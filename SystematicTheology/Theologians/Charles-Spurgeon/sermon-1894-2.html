          And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land
          of Canaan. These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen
          years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and he was a lad
          with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's
          wives: and Joseph brought the evil report of them unto their father.
          Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the
          son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours. And his
          brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren;
          and they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him. And Joseph
          dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren: and they hated him
          yet the more. And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream
          which I have dreamed: for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the
          field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold,
          your sheaves came round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. And his
          brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou
          indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his
          dreams, and for his words. And he dreamed yet another dream, and told
          it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed yet a dream; and,
          behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me.
          And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father
          rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast
          dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow
          down ourselves to thee to the earth? And his brethren envied him; but
          his father kept the saying in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. And
          Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in
          Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him,
          Here am I. And he said to him, Go now, see whether it be well with thy
          brethren, and well with the flock; and bring me word again. So he sent
          him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. And a certain
          man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in a field: and the man
          asked him, saying, What seekest thou? And he said, I seek my brethren:
          tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding the flock. And the man
          said, They are departed hence: for I heard them say, Let us go to
          Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.
          And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they
          conspired against him to slay him. And they said one to another,
          Behold, this dreamer cometh. Come now therefore, and let us slay him,
          and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, An evil beast hath
          devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams. And
          Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand; and said, Let us
          not take his life. And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood; cast him
          into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him:
          that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his
          father. And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,
          that they stript Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colours that was
          on him; and they took him, and cast him into the pit: and the pit was
          empty, there was no water in it. And they sat down to eat bread: and
          they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a travelling
          company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing
          spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt. And Judah
          said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother and
          conceal his blood? Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and
          let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And
          his brethren hearkened unto him. And there passed by Midianites,
          merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and
          sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they
          brought Joseph into Egypt. And Reuben returned unto the pit; and,
          behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes. And he
          returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither
          shall I go? And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a he-goat, and
          dipped the coat in the blood; and they sent the coat of many colours,
          and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found:
          know now whether it be thy son's coat or not. And he knew it, and
          said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is
          without doubt torn in pieces. And Jacob rent his garments, and put
          sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. And all
          his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused
          to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down to the grave to my
          son mourning. And his father wept for him. And the Midianites sold him
          into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the
          guard.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of
          Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the
          hand of the Ishmaelites, which had brought him down thither. And the
          LORD was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the
          house of his master the Egyptian. And his master saw that the LORD was
          with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his
          hand. And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he ministered unto him:
          and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put
          into his hand. And it came to pass from the time that he made him
          overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed
          the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD
          was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field. And he left
          all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not aught that was with
          him, save the bread which he did eat.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Joseph was comely and well favoured. And it came to pass after
          these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and
          she said, Lie with me. But he refused, and said unto his master's
          wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and
          he hath put all that he hath into my hand; there is none greater in
          this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but
          thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great
          wickedness, and sin against God? And it came to pass, as she spake to
          Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or
          to be with her. And it came to pass about this time, that he went into
          the house to do his work; and there was none of the men of the house
          there within. And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me:
          and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. And it
          came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand,
          and was fled forth, that she called unto the men of her house, and
          spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to
          mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud
          voice: and it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice
          and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled, and got him out.
          And she laid up his garment by her, until his master came home. And
          she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew
          servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:
          and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left
          his garment by me, and fled out. And it came to pass, when his master
          heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After
          this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled. And
          Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where
          the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison. But
          the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed kindness unto him, and gave him
          favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison. And the keeper of the
          prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the
          prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. The
          keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand,
          because the LORD was with him; and that which he did, the LORD made it
          to prosper.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of
          Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt. And Pharaoh
          was wroth against his two officers, against the chief of the butlers,
          and against the chief of the bakers. And he put them in ward in the
          house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where
          Joseph was bound. And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with
          them, and he ministered unto them: and they continued a season in
          ward. And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in
          one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the
          butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the
          prison. And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and saw them,
          and, behold, they were sad. And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were
          with him in ward in his master's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so
          sadly today? And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and
          there is none that can interpret it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not
          interpretations belong to God? tell it me, I pray you. And the chief
          butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold,
          a vine was before me; and in the vine were three branches: and it was
          as though it budded, and its blossoms shot forth; and the clusters
          thereof brought forth ripe grapes: and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand;
          and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave
          the cup into Pharaoh's hand. And Joseph said unto him, This is the
          interpretation of it: the three branches are three days; within yet
          three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto
          thine office: and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after
          the former manner when thou wast his butler. But have me in thy
          remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray
          thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out
          of this house: for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the
          Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me
          into the dungeon. When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was
          good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three
          baskets of white bread were on my head: and in the uppermost basket
          there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did
          eat them out of the basket upon my head. And Joseph answered and said,
          This is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days;
          within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee,
          and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from
          off thee. And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's
          birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up
          the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his
          servants. And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again;
          and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: but he hanged the chief
          baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. Yet did not the chief butler
          remember Joseph, but forgat him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh
          dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. And, behold, there came
          up out of the river seven kine, well favoured and fatfleshed; and they
          fed in the reed-grass. And, behold, seven other kine came up after
          them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the
          other kine upon the brink of the river. And the ill favoured and
          leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So
          Pharaoh awoke. And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold,
          seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. And, behold,
          seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
          And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And
          Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. And it came to pass in the
          morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all
          the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told
          them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto
          Pharaoh. Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do
          remember my faults this day: Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and
          put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the
          chief baker: and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed
          each man according to the interpretation of his dream. And there was
          with us there a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the
          guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each
          man according to his dream he did interpret. And it came to pass, as
          he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and
          him he hanged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out
          of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and
          came in unto Pharaoh. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a
          dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say
          of thee, that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it. And
          Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give
          Pharaoh an answer of peace. And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, In my
          dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river: and, behold, there
          came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and
          they fed in the reed-grass: and, behold, seven other kine came up
          after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I
          never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness: and the lean and ill
          favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: and when they had
          eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but
          they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke. And I
          saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full
          and good: and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with
          the east wind, sprung up after them: and the thin ears swallowed up
          the seven good ears: and I told it unto the magicians; but there was
          none that could declare it to me. And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The
          dream of Pharaoh is one: what God is about to do he hath declared unto
          Pharaoh. The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears
          are seven years: the dream is one. And the seven lean and ill favoured
          kine that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty
          ears blasted with the east wind; they shall be seven years of famine,
          That is the thing which I spake unto Pharaoh: what God is about to do
          he hath shewed unto Pharaoh. Behold, there come seven years of great
          plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: and there shall arise after
          them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in
          the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; and the
          plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which
          followeth; for it shall be very grievous. And for that the dream was
          doubled unto Pharaoh twice, it is because the thing is established by
          God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. Now therefore let Pharaoh
          look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
          Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and
          take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous
          years. And let them gather all the food of these good years that come,
          and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and
          let them keep it. And the food shall be for a store to the land
          against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of
          Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all
          his servants. And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a
          one as this, a man in whom the spirit of God is? And Pharaoh said unto
          Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so
          discreet and wise as thou: thou shalt be over my house, and according
          unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I
          be greater than thou. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set
          thee over all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh took off his signet ring
          from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in
          vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; and he
          made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried
          before him, Bow the knee: and he set him over all the land of Egypt.
          And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no
          man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh
          called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath
          the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On. And Joseph went out over the
          land of Egypt.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of
          Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went
          throughout all the land of Egypt. And in the seven plenteous years the
          earth brought forth by handfuls. And he gathered up all the food of
          the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food
          in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every
          city, laid he up in the same. And Joseph laid up corn as the sand of
          the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without
          number.
        </p>
        <p>
          And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came,
          which Asenath the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On bare unto him.
          And Joseph called the name of the first born 'Manasseh': For, said he,
          God hath 'made me forget' all my toil, and all my father's house. And
          the name of the second called he 'Ephraim': For God hath made me
          'fruitful' in the land of my affliction.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to
          an end. And the seven years of famine began to come, according as
          Joseph had said: and there was famine in all lands; but in all the
          land of Egypt there was bread. And when all the land of Egypt was
          famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto
          all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. And the
          famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the
          storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was sore in
          the land of Egypt. And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to
          buy corn; because the famine was sore in all the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, and Jacob said unto his
          sons, Why do ye look one upon another? And he said, Behold, I have
          heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for
          us from thence; that we may live, and not die. And Joseph's ten
          brethren went down to buy corn from Egypt. But Benjamin, Joseph's
          brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest
          peradventure mischief befall him. And the sons of Israel came to buy
          among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan. And
          Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the
          people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down
          themselves to him with their faces to the earth. And Joseph saw his
          brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and
          spake roughly with them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And
          they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. And Joseph knew his
          brethren, but they knew not him. And Joseph remembered the dreams
          which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the
          nakedness of the land ye are come. And they said unto him, Nay, my
          lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. We are all one man's
          sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies. And he said unto
          them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. And they
          said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the
          land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father,
          and one is not. And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake
          unto you, saying, Ye are spies: hereby ye shall be proved: by the life
          of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother
          come hither. Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye
          shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth
          in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. And he put
          them all together into ward three days.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear
          God: if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in your
          prison house; but go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses: and
          bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified,
          and ye shall not die. And they did so. And they said one to another,
          We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the
          distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear;
          therefore is this distress come upon us. And Reuben answered them,
          saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child;
          and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required.
          And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for there was an
          interpreter between them. And he turned himself about from them, and
          wept; and he returned to them, and spake to them, and took Simeon from
          among them, and bound him before their eyes. Then Joseph commanded to
          fill their vessels with corn, and to restore every man's money into
          his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus was it done
          unto them. And they laded their asses with their corn, and departed
          thence. And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender
          in the lodging place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the
          mouth of his sack. And he said unto his brethren, My money is
          restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them,
          and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that
          God hath done unto us?
        </p>
        <p>
          And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and
          told him all that had befallen them: saying, The man, the lord of the
          land, spake roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country. And
          we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: we be twelve
          brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day
          with our father in the land of Canaan. And the man, the lord of the
          land, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave
          one of your brethren with me, and take corn for the famine of your
          houses, and go your way: and bring your youngest brother unto me: then
          shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I
          deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land. And it
          came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's
          bundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw
          their bundles of money, they were afraid. And Jacob their father said
          unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and
          Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are
          against me. And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two
          sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will
          bring him to thee again. And he said, My son shall not go down with
          you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left: if mischief befall
          him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray
          hairs with sorrow to the grave.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the famine was sore in the land. And it came to pass, when they
          had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their
          father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food. And Judah spake
          unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye
          shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. If thou wilt
          send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food: but if
          thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us,
          Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. And Israel
          said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye
          had yet a brother? And they said, The man asked straitly concerning
          ourselves, and concerning our kindred, saying, Is your father yet
          alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor
          of these words: could we in any wise know that he would say, Bring
          your brother down? And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad
          with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both
          we, and thou, and also our little ones. I will be surety for him; of
          my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set
          him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever: for except we
          had lingered, surely we had now returned a second time. And their
          father Israel said unto them, If it be so now, do this; take of the
          choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a
          present, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and myrrh, nuts,
          and almonds: and take double money in your hand; and the money that
          was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry again in your hand;
          peradventure it was an oversight: take also your brother, and arise,
          go again unto the man: and God Almighty give you mercy before the man,
          that he may release unto you your other brother and Benjamin. And if I
          be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the men took that present, and they took double money in their
          hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood
          before Joseph. And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the
          steward of his house, Bring the men into the house, and slay, and make
          ready; for the men shall dine with me at noon. And the man did as
          Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. And the
          men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and
          they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the
          first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us,
          and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. And they
          came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spake unto him at
          the door of the house, and said, Oh my lord, we came indeed down at
          the first time to buy food: and it came to pass, when we came to the
          lodging place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's
          money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we
          have brought it again in our hand. And other money have we brought
          down in our hand to buy food: we know not who put our money in our
          sacks. And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God
          of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your
          money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. And the man brought the
          men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their
          feet; and he gave their asses provender.
        </p>
        <p>
          And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they
          heard that they should eat bread there. And when Joseph came home,
          they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house,
          and bowed down themselves to him to the earth. And he asked them of
          their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye
          spake? Is he yet alive? And they said, Thy servant our father is well,
          he is yet alive. And they bowed the head, and made obeisance. And he
          lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son,
          and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And
          he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. And Joseph made haste; for
          his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep;
          and he entered into his chamber, and wept there. And he washed his
          face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
          And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and
          for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the
          Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an
          abomination unto the Egyptians. And they sat before him, the firstborn
          according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth:
          and the men marvelled one with another. And he took and sent messes
          unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much
          as any of theirs. And they drank and were merry with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's
          sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money
          in his sack's mouth. And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's
          mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the
          word that Joseph had spoken. As soon as the morning was light, the men
          were sent away, they and their asses. And when they were gone out of
          the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up,
          follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them,
          Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? Is not this it in which my
          lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so
          doing. And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words. And
          they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these?
          God forbid that thy servants should do such a thing. Behold, the
          money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee
          out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's
          house silver or gold? With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let
          him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen. And he said, Now also
          let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be
          my bondman; and ye shall be blameless. Then they hasted, and took down
          every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. And
          he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and
          the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. Then they rent their clothes,
          and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; and he was yet
          there: and they fell before him on the ground. And Joseph said unto
          them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man
          as I can indeed divine? And Judah said, What shall we say unto my
          lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath
          found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's
          bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found. And he
          said, God forbid that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is
          found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace
          unto your father.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant,
          I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger
          burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh. My lord asked
          his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? And we said unto
          my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a
          little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his
          mother, and his father loveth him. And thou saidst unto thy servants,
          Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. And we said
          unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave
          his father, his father would die. And thou saidst unto thy servants,
          Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face
          no more. And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my
          father, we told him the words of my lord. And our father said, Go
          again, buy us a little food. And we said, We cannot go down: if our
          youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see
          the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us. And thy
          servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:
          and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces;
          and I have not seen him since: and if ye take this one also from me,
          and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow
          to the grave. Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and
          the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's
          life; it shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with
          us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs
          of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. For thy servant
          became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not
          unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever. Now
          therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a
          bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. For how
          shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest I see the
          evil that shall come on my father.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by
          him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood
          no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.
          And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh
          heard. And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father
          yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were
          troubled at his presence. And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near
          to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your
          brother whom ye sold into Egypt. And now be not grieved, nor angry
          with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before
          you to preserve life. For these two years hath the famine been in the
          land: and there are yet five years in the which there shall be neither
          plowing nor harvest. And God sent me before you to preserve you a
          remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance. So
          now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a
          father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the
          land of Egypt. Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him,
          Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come
          down unto me, tarry not: and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen,
          and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy
          children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou
          hast: and there will I nourish thee; for there are yet five years of
          famine; lest thou come to poverty, thou, and thy household, and all
          that thou hast. And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother
          Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. And ye shall
          tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen;
          and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. And he fell upon
          his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his
          neck. And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after
          that his brethren talked with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's
          brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. And
          Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your
          beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; and take your father
          and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of
          the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. Now thou art
          commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for
          your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
          Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is
          yours. And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,
          according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for
          the way. To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to
          Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of
          raiment. And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden
          with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses, laden with corn and
          bread and victual for his father by the way. So he sent his brethren
          away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not
          out by the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto
          Jacob their father. And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive,
          and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for
          he believed them not. And they told him all the words of Joseph, which
          he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had
          sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: and
          Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and
          see him before I die.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to
          Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.
          And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,
          Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I. And he said, I am God, the God
          of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make
          of thee a great nation: I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I
          will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand
          upon thine eyes. And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of
          Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their
          wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. And they
          took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land
          of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him: his
          sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons'
          daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to shew the way before him
          unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. And Joseph made
          ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen;
          and he presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck, and wept on
          his neck a good while. And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die,
          since I have seen thy face, that thou art yet alive. And Joseph said
          unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and tell
          Pharaoh, and will say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house,
          which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; and the men are
          shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought
          their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have. And it shall
          come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your
          occupation? that ye shall say, Thy servants have been keepers of
          cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers: that
          ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an
          abomination unto the Egyptians.

          Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my
          brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have,
          are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land
          of Goshen. And from among his brethren he took five men, and presented
          them unto Pharaoh. And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your
          occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds,
          both we, and our fathers. And they said unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in
          the land are we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants'
          flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now, therefore,
          we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen. And
          Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are
          come unto thee: the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the
          land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell: in the land of Goshen
          let them dwell: and if thou knowest any able men among them, then make
          them rulers over my cattle. And Joseph brought in Jacob his father,
          and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. And Pharaoh
          said unto Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life? And
          Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an
          hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years
          of my life, and they have not attained unto the days of the years of
          the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage. And Jacob
          blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh. And Joseph
          placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the
          land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as
          Pharaoh had commanded. And Joseph nourished his father, and his
          brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to
          their families.
