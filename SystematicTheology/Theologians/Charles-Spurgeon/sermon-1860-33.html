        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.339)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, October 7th, 1860, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>
          "The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the
          children of God; and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint
          heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be
          also glorified together." -- Romans 8:16, 17.

        <p>
          MY brethren, what a contrast there is between the present and future
          estate of the child of God! The believer is here the brother to the
          worm; in heaven he shall be next of kin to the angels. Here he is
          covered with the sweat and dust which he acquired by Adam's fall;
          there his brow shall be bright with the immortality which is conferred
          upon him by the resurrection of Christ. Here the heir of heaven is
          unknown; he is in disguise, full often clad in the habiliments of
          poverty, but there his princely character shall be discerned and
          acknowledged, he shall be waited upon by angels, and shall share in
          the admiration which the universe shall pour upon the glorified
          Redeemer. Well said our poet just now,
        </p>
        <p>"It doth not yet appear, how great we must be made."</p>
        <p>
          I think I need not remind you of your condition here below; you are
          too conversant with it, being hourly fretted with troubles, vexed with
          your own infirmities, with the temptations of Satan, and with all the
          allurements of this world. You are quite conscious that this is not
          your rest. There are too many thorns in your nest, to permit you to
          hope for an abiding city below the skies. I say, it is utterly
          needless for me to refresh your memories about your present condition;
          but I feel it will be a good and profitable work if I remind you that
          there are high privileges of which you are possessors even now; there
          are divine joys which even this day you may taste. The wilderness has
          its manna; the desert is gladdened with water from the rock. God hath
          not forsaken us; the tokens of his goodness are with us, and we may
          rejoice in full many a gracious boon which is ours this very day. I
          shall direct your joyous attention to one precious jewel in your
          treasury, namely, your adoption into the family of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are four things of which I shall speak this morning. First, a
          special privilege; second, a special proof of it, the Spirit bearing
          witness with our spirit; then thirdly, a special privilege, that of
          heirship; and fourthly, the practical part of the sermon and the
          conclusion shall be a special manner of life demanded of such persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, my brethren, a SPECIAL PRIVILEGE mentioned in the
          text. "We are the children of God." And here I am met upon the very
          threshhold by the opposition of certain modern theologians, who hold
          that sonship is not the special and peculiar privilege of believers.
          The newly discovered negative theology, which, I fear, has done some
          damage to the Baptist denomination, and a very large amount of injury
          to the Independent body -- the new heresy is to a large degree,
          founded upon the fiction of the Universal Fatherhood of God. The old
          divines, the Puritans, the Reformers, are now in these last days, to
          be superseded by men whose teaching flatly contradicts all that we
          have received of our forefathers. Our old ministers have all
          represented God as being to his people a father, to the rest of the
          world a judge. This is styled by our new philosophers as old
          cumbersome scheme of theology, and it is proposed that it be swept
          away -- a proposition which will never be carried out, while the earth
          remaineth, or while God endureth. But, at any rate, certain
          knight-errants have set themselves to do battle with windmills, and
          really believe that they shall actually destroy from the face of the
          earth that which is a fundamental and abiding distinction, without
          which the Scriptures are not to be understood. We are told by modern
          false prophets, that God in everything acts to all men as a father,
          even when he cast them into the lake of fire, and send upon them all
          the plagues that are written in his book. All these terrible things in
          righteousness, the awful proofs of holy vengeance in the judge of all
          the earth, and successfully neutralized in their arousing effect, by
          being quietly written among the loving acts and words of the Universal
          Father. It is dreamed that this is an age when men do not need to be
          thundered at; when everybody is become so tender-hearted that there is
          no need for the sword to be held "in terrorum" over mortals; but that
          everything is to be conducted now in a new and refined manner; God the
          Universal Father, and all men universal sons. Now I must confess there
          is something very pretty about this theory, something so fascinating
          that I do not wonder that some of the ablest minds have been wooed and
          won by it. I, for my part, take only one objection to it, which is
          that it is perfectly untrue and utterly unfounded, having not the
          lightest shadow of a pretence of being proved by the Word of God.
          Scripture everywhere represents the chosen people of the Lord, under
          their visible character of believers, penitents, and spiritual men, as
          being "the children of God," and to none but such is that holy title
          given. It speaks of the regenerate, of a special class me as having a
          claim to be God's children. Now, as there is nothing like Scripture,
          let me read you a few texts, Romans viii.14. -- "As many are led by
          the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God." Surely no one is so
          daring as to say, that all men are led by the Spirit of God; yet may
          it readily enough be inferred from our text, that those who are not
          led by the Spirit of God are not the sons of God, but that they and
          they alone who are led, guided and inspired by the Holy Spirit, are
          the sons of God. A passage from Galatians iii.26. -- "For ye are all
          the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus," declaring as it seems
          to me, and rightly enough, that all believers, all who have faith in
          Christ are the children of God, and that they become actually and
          manifestly so by faith in Christ Jesus, and implying that those who
          have no faith in Christ Jesus, are not God's sons, and that any
          pretence which they could make to that relationship would be but
          arrogance and presumption. And hear ye this, John i.12. -- "To as many
          as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God." How
          could they have been the sons of God before, for "to them gave he
          power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his
          name, who were born not of blood," -- then they were not make the sons
          of God by mere creation -- "nor of the will of the flesh," that is to
          say, not by any efforts of their own "but of God." If any text can be
          more conclusive than this against universal sonship, I must confess I
          know of none, and unless these words mean nothing at all, they do mean
          just this, that believers are the sons of God and none besides. But
          listen to another word of the Lord in the first epistle of John,
          iii.1-. -- "In this the children of God are manifest, and the children
          of the devil: whosoever doeth no righteousness is not of God, neither
          he that loveth not his brother." Here are two sorts of children,
          therefore all are not the children of God. Can it be supposed that
          those who are the children of the devil are nevertheless the children
          of God? I must confess my reason revolts against such a supposition,
          and though I think I might exercise a little imagination, yet I could
          not make my imagination sufficiently an acrobat to conceive of a man
          being at the same time a child of the devil, and yet a real child of
          God. Hear another, 2 Corinthians, vi.17. -- "Come out from among them,
          and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing;
          and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be
          my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty." Is not that "coming
          out" necessary to sonship, and were they his sons, were they his
          daughters, had they any claim or right to call him Father, until they
          came out from the midst of a wicked world, and were separate? If so,
          why doth God promise them what they have already. But again, Matthew
          v.9. -- "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the
          children of God." A fine title indeed if it belongs to every man!
          Where is the blessedness of the title, for they might be lovers of
          strife, and yet according to modern theologians they might still be
          the sons of God. Let us mark a yet more positive passage, Romans ix.8.
          -- "The children of the flesh, these are not the children of God."
          What then is to be said to this, "These are not the children of God."
          If any man will contradict that flatly -- well, be it so. I have no
          argument with which to convince the man who denies so strong and clear
          a witness. Listen to the divine apostle John, where in one of his
          epistles he is carried away in rhapsody of devout admiration, "Behold
          what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should
          be called the sons of God." And then he goes on giving a description
          of those who are the sons of God, who could not mean any but those who
          by a living faith in Christ Jesus, have cast their souls once for all
          on him. As far as I can guess, the main text on which these people
          build the doctrine of the universal Fatherhood, is that quotation
          which the apostle Paul took from a heathen poet -- "As certain also of
          your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring." The apostle
          endorses that sentiment by quoting it, and against that endorsement we
          can of course have no contention; but the word there used for
          "offspring," expresses no idea of Fatherhood in the majestic sense of
          the term, it is a word which might be used as appropriately for the
          young of animals, the young of any other creature, it has not about it
          the human sympathies which belong to a father and a son. I know,
          besides this, nothing which could support this new theory. Possibly
          they fancy that creation is a paternal act, that all created things
          are sons. This is too absurd to need an answer, for if so, horses and
          cows, rats and mice, snakes and flies are children of God, for they
          are surely creatures as well as we. Taking away this corner-stone,
          this fancy theory tumbles to the ground, and that theory which seemed
          to be as tall as Babel, and threatened to make as much confusion, may
          right soon be demolished, if you will batter it with the Word of God.
          The fact is, brethren, that the relationship of a son of God belongs
          only to those who are "predestinated unto the adoption of children by
          Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of the Father's will:"
          Ephesians i.5. The more you search the Bible, the more sure will you
          be that sonship is the special privilege of the chosen people of God
          and of none beside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having thus, as far as I can, established my point, that the privilege
          of our text is a special one, let me dwell upon it for a moment and
          remark that, as a special one, it is an act of pure unmistakeable
          grace. No man has any right to be a son of God. If we are born into
          his family it is a miracle of mercy. It is one of the ever-blessed
          exhibitions of the infinite love of God which without any cause in us,
          has set itself upon us. If thou art this day an heir of heaven,
          remember, man, thou wast once the slave of hell. Once thou didst
          wallow in the mire, and if thou shouldst adopt a swine to be thy
          child, thou couldst not then have performed an act of greater
          compassion than when God adopted thee. And if an angel could exalt a
          gnat to equal dignity with himself, yet would not the boon be
          such-an-one as that which God hath conferred on thee. He hath taken
          thee from the dunghill, and he hath set thee among princes. Thou hast
          lain among the pots, but he hat made thee as a dove whose wings are
          covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold. Remember that
          this is grace, and parentage, -- look back to the hole of the pit
          whence thou art digged, and the miry clay whence thou wast drawn.
          Boast not, if thou art in the true olive. Thou art not there, because
          of thine original, thou art a scion from an evil tree, and the Divine
          Spirit hath changed thy nature, for thou wast once nothing but a
          branch of the vine of Gomorrah. Ever let humility bow thee to the very
          earth while thine adoption lifts thee up to the third heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider again, I pray you, what a dignity God hath conferred upon you
          -- even upon you in making you his son. The tall archangel before the
          throne is not called God's Son, he is one of the most favoured of his
          servants, but not his child. I tell thee, thou poor brother in Christ,
          there is a dignity about thee that even angels may well envy. Thou in
          thy poverty art as a sparkling jewel in the darkness of the mine. Thou
          in the midst of thy sickness and infirmity art girt about with robes
          of glory, which make the spirits in heaven look down upon the earth
          with awe. Thou movest about this world as a prince among the crowd.
          The blood of heaven runs in thy veins; thou art one of the blood royal
          of eternity -- a son of God, descendant of the King of kings. Speak of
          pedigrees, the glories of heraldry -- thou hast more than heraldry
          could ever give thee, or all the pomp of ancestry could ever bestow.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now I press forward to notice that in order that we may know
          whether we are partakers of this high -- this royal relationship of
          children of God, the text furnishes us with a SPECIAL PROOF -- "The
          Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children
          of God. You will notice here, my beloved, that there are two witnesses
          in court -- two who are ready to prove our filiation to the eternal
          God. The first witness is our spirit; the second witness is The
          Spirit, the eternal Spirit of God, who beareth witness with our
          spirit. It is as if a poor man were called into court to prove his
          right to some piece of land which was disputed. He standeth up and
          beareth his own faithful testimony; but some great one of the land --
          some nobleman who lives near -- rises, stands in the witness box, and
          confirms his witness. So is it with our text. The plain, simple spirit
          of the humble-minded Christian cries, "I am God's child." The glorious
          Spirit, one with God, attests the truth of the testimony, and beareth
          witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us notice in the first place, how it is that our spirit is able to
          bear witness; and as this is a matter of experience, I can only appeal
          to those who are the true children of God; for no others are competent
          to give testimony. Our spirit bears witness that we are the children
          of God, when it feels a filial love to God. When bowing before his
          throne we can boldly say "Abba Father." -- "Thou art my father," then
          our spirit concludes that we are sons, for thus it argues, "I feel to
          thee as a child feeleth to its parent, and it could not be that I
          should have the feeling of a son if I had not the rights of a son --
          if I were not a child thou wouldst never have given to me that filial
          affection which no dares to call thee "Father."
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, too, the spirit feels that God is its Father not only by
          love but by trust. The rod has been upon our back and we have smarted
          very sore, but in the darkest hour we have been able to say, "The time
          is in my Father's hands; I cannot murmur; I would not repine; I feel
          it is but right that I should suffer, otherwise my Father would never
          have made me suffer." He surely doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve
          the children of man for nought; and when in these dark gloomy times we
          have looked up to a Father's face, and have said, "Though thou slay
          me, yet will I trust in thee; thy blows shall not drive thee from me;
          they shall but make me say, "Show me wherefore thou contendest with
          me, and purge me from my sin."" Then our spirit beareth witness that
          we are the children of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And are there not times with you, my dear friends, when your hearts
          feel that they would be emptied and void, unless God were in them. You
          have perhaps received an increase to your wealth, and after the first
          flush of pleasure which was but natural, you have said, "Vanity of
          vanities, all is vanity; this is not my joy." You have had many
          mercies in your family, but you have felt that in them all there was a
          lack of something which could satisfy your heart, and you have felt
          that that something was God. My God, thou art my all in all -- the
          circle where my passions move, the centre of my soul. Now these
          longings -- these pantings for something more than this world can give
          you -- were but the evidences of a child-like spirit, which was
          panting after its Father's presence. You feel you must have your
          Father, or else the gifts of his providence are nothing to you. That
          is, your spirit beareth witness that you are the child of God. But
          there are times when the heir of heaven is as sure that he is God's
          child as he is sure that he is his own father's son. No doubt can make
          him question. The evil one may whisper, "If thou be the son of God."
          But he says, "Get thee hence, Satan, I know I am the son of God." A
          man might as well try to dispute him out of the fact of his existence
          as out of that equally sure fact that he has been born again, and that
          by gracious adoption he has been taken into the family of God. This is
          our witnessing that we are born of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the text, you see, furnishes us with a higher witness than this.
          God that cannot lie, in the person of the Holy Ghost, graciously
          condescendeth to say "Amen" to the testimony of our conscience. And
          whereas our experience sometimes leads our spirit to conclude that we
          are born of God, there are happy times when the eternal Spirit from
          off the throne, descends and fills our heart, and then we have the two
          witnesses bearing witness with each other, that we are children of
          God. Perhaps you ask me, how is this. I was reading a passage by Dr.
          Chalmers the other day, in which he says, that his own experience did
          not lead him to believe that the Holy Spirit ever gave any witness of
          our being the children of God, apart from the written Word of God, and
          his ordinary workings in our hearts. Now, I am not sure that the
          doctor is perfectly right. As far as his own experience went I dare
          say he was right, but there may be some far inferior to the doctor in
          genius, who nevertheless were superior in nearness of fellowship with
          God, and who could therefore go a little farther than the eloquent
          divine. Now, I do believe with him this morning, that the chief
          witness of God the Holy Spirit lies in this -- the Holy Spirit has
          written this book which contains an account of what a Christian should
          be, and of the feelings which believers in Christ must have. I have
          certain experiences and feelings; turning to the Word, I find similar
          experiences and feelings recorded; and so I prove that I am right, and
          the Spirit bears witness with my spirit that I am born of God. Suppose
          you have been enabled to believe in Jesus Christ for your salvation;
          that faith has produced love to Christ; that love to Christ has led
          you to work for Christ; you come to the Bible, and you find that this
          was just the very thing which was felt by early believers; and then
          you say, "Good Lord, I am thy son, because what I feel is what thou
          has said by the lips of thy servant must be felt by those who are thy
          children." So the Spirit confirms the witness of my spirit that I am
          born of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But again, everything that is good in a Christian you know to be the
          work of God the Holy Ghost. When at any time then the Holy Spirit
          comforts you -- sheds a sweet calm over your disturbed spirit; when at
          any period he instructs you, opens to you a mystery you did not
          understand before; when at some special period he inspires you with an
          unwonted affection, an unusual faith in Christ; when you experience a
          hatred of sin, a faith in Jesus, a death to the world, and a life to
          God, these are the works of the Spirit. Now the Spirit never did work
          effectually in any but the children of God; and inasmuch as the Spirit
          works in you, he doth by that very working give his own infallible
          testimony to the fact that you are a child of God. If you had not been
          a child he would have left you where you were in your natural state;
          but inasmuch as he hath wrought in you to will and to do of his own
          good pleasure, he that put his stamp on you as being one of the family
          of the Most High. But I think must go a little further than this. I do
          believe that there is a supernatural way in which apart from means,
          the Spirit of God communicates with the spirit of man. My own little
          experience leads me to believe that apart from the Word of God, there
          are immediate dealings with the conscience and soul of man by the Holy
          Spirit, without any instrumentality, without even the agency of the
          truth. I believe that the Spirit of God sometimes comes into a
          mysterious and marvellous contact with the spirit of man, and that at
          times the Spirit speaketh in the heart of man by a voice not audible
          to the ear, but perfectly audible to the spirit which is the subject
          of it. he assures and consoles directly, by coming into immediate
          contact with the heart. It becomes our business then to take the
          Spirit's witness through his Word, and through his works, but I would
          seek to have immediate, actual, undivided fellowship with the Holy
          Ghost, who by his divine Spirit, should work in my spirit and convince
          me that I am a child of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let me ask my congregation, do any of you know that you are God's
          children? Say not, "In my baptism, wherein I was made a member of
          Christ, and a child of God." There are not many in England, I think,
          who believe those words. There may be a few who do, but it has never
          been my misfortune to meet with them. Every one knows that it is a
          disgrace to a matchless prayer-book, that such words should be
          permitted to stand there-words so infamously untrue that by their
          gross untruthfulness they cease to have the destructive effect which
          more cunning language might have produced, because the conscience of
          man revolts against the idea that the sprinkling of drops of water
          upon the infants's brow can ever make it a member of Christ, and a
          child of God. But I ask you, does your spirit say to-day "I am God's
          child." Do you feel the longings, the loves, the confidences of a
          child? If not, tremble, for there are but two vast families in this
          world. They are the family of God, and the family of Satan -- their
          character how different -- their end, how strangely divided! But let
          me say again to thee, hast thou ever felt that the Holy Ghost has
          borne witness with thy spirit in his word, and in his work, in thee;
          and in that secret whisper has he ever said to thee, "Thou art my son,
          this day have I begotten thee." I conjure thee, give no sleep to thine
          eyes, no slumber to thine eyelids, till by this divine mysterious
          agency, thou art new made, new born, and new begotten, and so admitted
          not only nominally but really into the living family of the living
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I shall now pass on to my third point. If it be settled in our
          mind by the true witness -- the spirit within us, and the Spirit of
          God, -- that we are God's children, what a NOBLE PRIVILEGE now appears
          to our view. "HEIRS OF GOD, and joint heirs with Christ." It does not
          always follow in human reasoning "if children, then heirs," because in
          our families but one is the heir. There is but one that can claim the
          heir's rights, and the heir's title. It is not so in the family of
          God. Man as a necessary piece of political policy, may give to the
          heir that which surely he can have not more real right to in the sight
          of God, than the rest of the family -- may give him all the
          inheritance, while his brethren, equally true born, may go without;
          but it is not so in the family of God. All God's children are heirs,
          however numerous the family, and he that shall be born of God last,
          shall be as much his heir as he who was born first. Abel, the
          protomartyr, entering alone into heaven, shall not have a more secure
          title to the inheritance than he who, last of woman born, shall trust
          in Christ, and then ascend into his glory. In heaven's logic it is
          true, "if children, then heirs."
        </p>
        <p>
          And see what it is that we are heirs of. The apostle opens with the
          grandest part of the inheritance first -- heirs of God -- heirs not of
          God's gifts, and God's works, but heirs of God himself. It was said of
          king Cyrus, that he was a prince of so amiable a disposition, that
          when at any time he sat down at meat, if there were aught that pleased
          his appetite, he would order it to be taken away and given to his
          friends with this message, "King Cyrus found that this food pleased
          his palate, and he thought his friend should feed upon that which he
          enjoyed himself." This was thought to be a singular instance of his
          affability, and his kindness to his courtiers. But our God doeth more
          than this, he doth not send merely bread from his table, as in the day
          when man did eat angel's food; he doth not give us merely to drink the
          wines on the lees well refined -- the rich wines of heaven -- but he
          gives himself himself to us. And the believer is to be the heir, I
          say, not merely of God's works, not simply of God's gifts, but of God
          himself. Talk we of his omnipotence? -- his Allmightiness is ours.
          Speak we of his omniscience? -- all his wisdom is engaged in our
          behalf. Do we say that he is love? -- that love belongs to us. Can we
          glory that he is full of immutability, and changes not? -- that
          eternal unchangeableness is engaged for the defence of the people of
          God. All the attributes of divinity are the property of God's children
          -- their inheritance entailed upon them. Nay, he himself is ours. Oh
          what riches! If we could say this morning, that all the stars belong
          to us; if we could turn the telescope to the most remote of the fixed
          stars, and then could say with the pride of possession, so natural to
          man, "That star, a thousand times bigger than the sun, is mine. I am
          the king of that inheritance, and without me doth not a dog move his
          tongue." If we could then sweep the telescope along the milky way, and
          see the millions upon millions of stars that lie clustered together
          there, and could cry, "All these are mine," yet these possessions were
          but a speck compared with that which is in the text. Heir of God! He
          to whom all these things are but as nothing, gives himself up to the
          inheritance of his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note yet a little further concerning the special privilege of
          heirship, -- we are joint heirs with Christ. That is, whatever Christ
          possesses, as heir of all things, belongs to us. Splendid must be the
          inheritance of Jesus Christ. Is he not very God of very God, Jehovah's
          only begotten Son, Most High and glorious, though he bowed himself to
          the grave and became the Servant of servants, yet God over all,
          blessed for ever. Amen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! what angelic tongue shall hymn his glory? What fiery lips shall
          ever speak of his possessions, of his riches, -- the unsearchable
          riches of God in Christ Jesus. But, beloved, all that belongs to
          Christ belongs to Christ's people. It is as when a man doth marry. His
          possessions shall be shared by his spouse; and when Christ took his
          Church unto himself he endowed her with all his goods, both temporal
          and eternal. He gives to us his raiments, and thus we stand arrayed.
          His righteousness becomes our beauty. He gave to us his person, it has
          become our meat and our drink; we eat his flesh and drink his blood.
          He gave to us hi inmost heart; he loved us even to the death. He gave
          to us his crown; he gave to us his throne; for "to him that overcometh
          will I give to sit upon my throne, even as I have overcome, and have
          sat down with my Father upon his throne." He gave to us his heaven,
          for "where I am, there shall my people be." He gave to us the fulness
          of his joy, for "my joy shall be in you, that your joy may be full." I
          repeat it, there is nothing in the highest heaven which Christ has
          reserved unto himself, "for all things are yours, and ye are Christ's
          and Christ is God's."
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot stay longer on that point, except just to notice, that we
          must never quarrel with this divine arrangement. "Oh," say you, "we
          never shall." Stay, stay, brother; I have known you do so already, for
          when all that is Christ's belongs to you, do ye forget that Christ
          once had a cross, and that belongs to you? Christ once wore a thorny
          crown, and if you are to have all that he has, you must bear the
          thorny crown too? Have you forgotten that he had shame and spitting,
          the reproach, the rebuke of men, and that he conceived all those to be
          greater riches than all the treasures of this world? Come, I know as
          you look down the inventory, you are apt to look a little askance on
          that cross, and you think, "Well, the crown is glorious, but I love
          not the spittle, I care not to be despised and rejected of men." Oh!
          you are quarreling with this divine arrangement, you are beginning to
          differ with this blessed policy of God. Why, one would have thought
          you would rejoice to take your Master for better or for worse, and to
          be partaker with him, not only in his glories but in his sufferings.
          So it must be, "If so be that we suffer with him that we also may be
          glorified together." Is there a place into which your Master went that
          you would be ashamed to enter? If so, methinks your heart is not in a
          right state. Would you refuse to go with him to the garden of his
          agony? Believer, would you be ashamed to stand and be accused as he
          was, and have false witness born against you? And would you blush to
          sit side- by-side with him, and be made nothing of as he was? Oh, when
          you start aside at a little jest, let your conscience prick you, and
          say, "Am I not a joint heir with Christ, and am I about to quarrel
          with the legacy? Did he not say, "In the world ye shall have
          tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world?" And oh,
          would you be ashamed to die for Christ; methinks, if you are what you
          should be, you will glory in tribulations also, and count it sweet to
          suffer for Christ. I know the world turns this into ridicule and says,
          "That the hypocrite loves persecution;" no, not the hypocrite, but the
          true believer; he feels that though the suffering must ever be
          painful, yet for Christ's sake, it becomes so glorious that the pain
          is all forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, believer, will you be partaker with Christ to-day in the battle,
          and then divide this spoil with him? Come, will you wade with him
          through the deep waters, and then at last climb up the topless hills
          with him? Are you prepared now to be despised and rejected of men that
          you may at last ascend up on high, leading captivity captive? The
          inheritance cannot be divided; if you will have the glory, you must
          have the shame. He that will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer
          persecution. Come, men, put your face against all weathers; be ready
          to come up hill, with the snow blowing in your face, be ready to march
          on when the tempest howls, and the lightnings flash over head, and the
          snow becomes knee-deep; nay, be ready to go into the crevasse with
          him, and perish, if need be. Who quarrels with this sacred regulation?
          Certainly no true child of God; he would not have it altered, even if
          he might.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And now I come to my last point, upon which briefly but I hope
          interestingly. The SPECIAL CONDUCT naturally expected from those who
          are partakers of the peculiar privileges of being the children of God.
          In the golden age of Rome, if a man were tempted to dishonesty, he
          would stand upright, look the tempter in the face, and say to him, "I
          am a Roman." He thought that a sufficient reason why he should neither
          lie nor cheat. It ought to be ten times more than sufficient answer to
          every temptation, for a man to be able to say, "I am a son of God;
          shall such a man as I yield to sin?" I have been astonished in looking
          though old Roman history at the wonderful prodigies of integrity and
          valour which were produced by idolatry, or rather, which were produced
          by patriotism, and that principle which ruled the Romans, namely, love
          of fame. And I say it this morning, it is a shameful thing that ever
          idolatry should be able to breed better men than some who profess
          Christianity. And I think I may stand firmly while I argue here, that
          if a Roman, a worshipper of Jupiter or Saturn, became great or
          glorious, a Son of God ought to be nobler far. Look ye, sirs, at
          Brutus; he has established a republic, he has put down tyranny, he
          sits upon the judgment seat; his two sons are brought before him, they
          have been traitors to the commonwealth. What will the father do? He is
          a man of a loving heart and loves his sons, but there they stand. Will
          he execute justice as a judge, or will he prefer his family to his
          country? He covers his face for a moment with his hands, and then
          looking down at his sons, and finding that the testimony is complete
          against them, he says, "Lictors, do your work." They bare their backs,
          the rod scourgeth them. "Complete the sentence, lictors;" and their
          heads are smitten off in the father's presence. Stern justice swayed
          his spirit, and no other feeling could for a single moment make him
          turn aside. Christian men, do you feel this with regard to your sins.
          When you have been sitting on the judgment bench; there has been some
          favourite sin brought up, and you have, oh, let me blush to say it,
          you have wished to spare it, it was so near your heart, you have
          wished to let it live, whereas should you not as the son of God have
          said, "If my eye offend me, I will pluck it out and cast it from me,
          if my right hand offend me, I will cut it off, rather than I should in
          anything offend my God." Brutus slays his sons; but some Christians
          would spare their sins. Look again at that noble youth, Mutius
          Scoevola. He goes into the tent of King Pyrrhus with the intention to
          put him to death, because he is the enemy of his country; he slays the
          wrong man; Pyrrhus orders him to be taken captive. A pan of hot coals
          is blazing in the tent; Scoevola puts out his right hand and holds it;
          it crackles in the flame; the young man flinches not, though his
          fingers drop away. "There are 400 youths," says he, "in Rome as brave
          as I am, and that will bear fire as well; and tyrant," he says "you
          will surely die."" Yet here are Christian men, who, if they are a
          little sneered at, or snubbed, or get the cold shoulder for Christ's
          sake, are half ashamed of their profession, and would go and hide it.
          And if they are not like Peter -- tempted to curse and swear to escape
          the blessed imputation -- they would turn the conversation, that they
          might not suffer for Christ. Oh for 400 Scoevolas, 400 men who for
          Christ's sake would burn, not their right hands, but their bodies, if
          indeed Christ's name night be glorified, and sin might be stabbed to
          the heart. Or, read you that old legend of Curtius, the Roman knight.
          A great gulf had opened in the Forum, perhaps caused by an earthquake,
          and the auspices had said that the chasm could never be filled up,
          except the most precious thing in Rome could be cast into it. Curtius
          puts on his helmet, and his armour, mounts his horse and leaps into
          the cleft, which is said to have filled at once, because courage,
          valour, and patriotism, were the best things in Rome. I wonder how
          many Christians there are who would leap like that into the cleft.
          Why, I see you, sirs, if there is a new and perilous work to be done
          for Christ, you like to be in the rear rank this time; if there were
          something honourable, so that you might ride on with your well
          caparisoned steeds in the midst of the dainty ranks ye would do it;
          but to leap into certain annihilation for Christ's sake -- Oh!
          heroism, where is it fled -- whither has it gone. Thou Church of God,
          surely it must survive in thee; for to whom should it more belong to
          die and sacrifice all, than to those who are the sons of God. Look ye
          again at Camillus. Camillus had been banished from Rome by false
          accusations. He was ill-treated, abused, and slandered, and went away
          to retirement. Suddenly the Goths, the old enemies of Rome, fell upon
          the city. They surrounded it; they were about to sack it, and Camillus
          was the only man who could deliver it. Some would have said within
          themselves "Let the caitiff nation be cut off. The city has turned me
          out; let it rue the day that it ever drove me away." But no, Camillus
          gathers together his body of followers, falls upon the Goths, routs
          them and enters in triumph into Rome though he was an exile. Oh
          Christian, this should ever be your spirit, only in a higher degree.
          When the Church rejects you, casts you out, annoys, despises you,
          still be ready to defend her, and when you have an ill name even in
          the lips of God's people, still stand up for the common cause of Zion,
          the city of our solemnities. Or look you at Cincinnatus. He is chosen
          Dictator, but as soon as ever his dictatorship is over he retires to
          his little farm of three acres, and goes to his plough, and when he is
          wanted to be absolute monarch of Rome he is found at his plough upon
          his three acres of land and his little cottage. He served his country,
          not for himself, but for his country's sake; and can it be that you
          will not be poor yet honest for Christ's sake! Will you descend to the
          tricks of trade to win money. Ah, then, the Roman eclipses the
          Christian. Will you not be satisfied to serve God though you lose by
          it; to stand up and be thought an arrant fool, because you will not
          learn the wisdom of this world; to be esteemed a mad fanatic, because
          you cannot swim with the current. Can you not do it? Can you not do
          it? Then again I say to you, "Tell it not in Gath and publish it not
          in Askelon, then has a heathen eclipsed a Christian." May the sons of
          God be greater than the sons of Romulus. One other instance let me
          give you. You have heard of Regulus the Roman general; he was taken
          prisoner by Carthagenians, who anxiously wished for peace. They told
          him to go home to Rome, and see if he could not make peace. But his
          reply was, "No, I trust they will always be at war with you, for
          Carthage must be destroyed if Rome is to prosper." They compelled him,
          however, to go, exacting from him this promise, that if the Romans did
          not make peace he would come back, and if he came back they would put
          him to death in the most horrid manner that ever cruelty could invent.
          Regulus returns to Rome; he stands up in the senate and conjures them
          never to make peace in Carthage, but ot his wife and children, and
          tells them that he is going back to Carthage, and of course the tell
          him that he need not keep faith with an enemy. I imagine that he said,
          "I promised to go back, and though it is to pangs indescribable, I
          will return." His wife clings to his shoulder, his children seek to
          persuade him; they attend him to the waters' edge; he sails for
          Carthage; his death was too horrible to be described. Never martyr
          suffered more for Christ than that man suffered for his word's sake.
          And shall a Christian man break his promise? shall a son of God be
          less true than a Roman or a heathen? Shall it be, I say, that
          integrity shall be found in heathen lands and not be found here? No.
          May you be holy, harmless, sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst
          of a crooked and perverse generation. I used this argument; I thought
          it might be a new one; I am sure it is a forcible one. You cannot
          imagine, surely, that God is to allow heathens to eclipse his
          children. Oh! never let it be so. So live, so act, ye sons of God,
          that the world may say of you, "Yes, these men bring forth the fruits
          of God; they are like their Father; they honour his name; they are
          indeed filled with his grace, for their every word is as true as his
          oath; their every act is sincere and upright; their heart is kind,
          their spirit is gentle; they are firm but yet they are generous; they
          are strict in their integrity, but they are loving in their souls;
          they are men who, like God, are full of love; but like him are
          severely just. They are sternly holy; they are, like him, ready to
          forgive, but they can by no means tolerate iniquity, nor hear that sin
          should live in their presence." God bless you, ye sons of God, and may
          those of you who are strangers to him, be convinced and converted by
          this sermon, and seek that grace by which alone you can have your
          prayer fulfilled: --
        </p>
        <p>"With them numbered may we be,</p>
        <p>Now and through eternity."<br /></p>
