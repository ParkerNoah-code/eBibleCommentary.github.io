        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.562)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, March 27th, 1864, by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most
          miserable." -- 1 Corinthians 15:19.
        </p>
        <p>
          YOU WILL UNDERSTAND that the apostle is arguing with professedly
          Christian people, who were dubious about the resurrection of the dead.
          He is not saying that all men are now miserable if there be no hope of
          the world to come, for such an assertion would be untrue. There are
          very many who never think of another life, who are quite happy in
          their way, enjoy themselves, and are very comfortable after a fashion.
          But he speaks of Christian people -- "If we, who have hope in Christ,
          are led to doubt the doctrine of a future state and of a resurrection,
          then we are of all men most miserable." The argument has nothing to do
          with some of you who are not Christians; it has nothing to do with you
          who have never been brought out of a state of nature into a state of
          grace; it only respects those who are real, living followers of the
          Savior, and who are known by this, that they have hope in Christ --
          hope in his blood for pardon, in his righteousness for justification,
          in his power for support, in his resurrection for eternal glory. "If
          we who have hope in Christ, have that hope for this life only, then we
          are of all men most miserable." You understand the argument; he is
          appealing to their consciousness; they, as Christians, had real
          enjoyments, "but," says he, "you could not have these enjoyments if it
          were not for the hope of another life; for once take that away, if you
          could still remain Christians and have the same feelings which you now
          have, and act as you now do, you would become of all men most
          miserable," therefore to justify your own happiness and make it all
          reasonable, you must admit a resurrection; there is no other method of
          accounting for the joyous peace which the Christian possesses. Our
          riches are beyond the sea; our city with firm foundations lies on the
          other side the river: gleams of glory from the spirit-world cheer our
          hearts, and urge us onward; but if it were not for these, our present
          joys would pine and die.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will try and handle our text this morning in this way. First, we
          are not of all men most miserable; but secondly, without the hope of
          another life we should be -- that we are prepared to confess --
          because thirdly, our chief joy lies in the hope of a life to come; and
          thus, fourthly, the future influences the present; and so, in the last
          place, we may to-day judge what our future is to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First then, WE ARE NOT OF ALL MEN MOST MISERABLE. Who ventures to
          say we are? He who will have the hardihood to say so knoweth nothing
          of us. He who shall affirm that Christianity makes men miserable, is
          himself an utter stranger to it, and has never partaken of its joyful
          influences. It were a very strange thing indeed, if it did make us
          wretched, for see to what a position it exalts us! It makes us sons of
          God. Suppose you that God will give all the happiness to his enemies,
          and reserve all the mourning for his sons? Shall his foes have mirth
          and joy, and shall his own home-born children inherit sorrow and
          wretchedness? Are the kisses for the wicked and the frowns for us? Are
          we condemned to hang our harps upon the willows, and sing nothing but
          doleful dirges, while the children of Satan are to laugh for joy of
          heart? We are heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ Jesus. Shall
          the sinner, who has no part nor lot in Christ, call himself happy, and
          shall we go mourning as if we were penniless beggars? No, we will
          rejoice in the Lord always, and glory in our inheritance, for we "have
          not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received
          the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father." The rod of
          chastisement must rest upon us in our measure, but it worketh for us
          the comfortable fruits of righteousness; and therefore by the aid of
          the divine Comforter, we will rejoice in the Lord at all times. We
          are, my brethren, married unto Christ; and shall our great Bridegroom
          permit his spouse to linger in constant grief? Our hearts are knit
          unto him: we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones,
          and though for awhile we may suffer as our Head once suffered, yet we
          are even now blessed with heavenly blessings in him. Shall our Head
          reign in heaven, and shall we have a hell upon earth? God forbid: the
          joyful triumph of our exalted Head is in a measure shared by us, even
          in this vale of tears. We have the earnest of our inheritance in the
          comforts of the Spirit, which are neither few nor small. Think of a
          Christian! He is a king, and shall the king be the most melancholy of
          men? He is a priest unto God, and shall he offer no sweet incense of
          hallowed joy and grateful thanksgiving? We are fit companions for
          angels: he hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the
          saints in light; and shall we have no days of heaven upon earth? Is
          Canaan ours from Dan to Beersheba, and shall we eat no fruit from
          Eshcol's vine on this side of Jordan? Shall we have no taste of the
          figs, and of the pomegranates, and of the flowing milk and honey? Is
          there no manna in the wilderness? Are there no streams in the desert?
          Are there no streaks of light to herald our eternal sunrising?
          Heritors of joy for ever, have we no foretastes of our portion? I say
          again, it were the oddest thing in the world if Christians were more
          miserable than other men, or not more happy. Think again of what God
          has done for them! The Christian knows that his sins are forgiven;
          there is not against the believer a single sin recorded in God's book.
          "I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a
          cloud, thy sins." More than that, the believer is accounted by God as
          if he had perfectly kept the law, for the righteousness of Christ is
          imputed to him, and he stands clothed in that fair white linen which
          is the righteousness of the saints, And shall the man whom God accepts
          be wretched? Shall the pardoned offender be less happy than the man
          upon whom the wrath of God abideth? Can you conceive such a thing?
          Moreover, my brethren, we are made temples of the Holy Ghost, and is
          the Holy Ghost's temple to be a dark, dolorous place, a place of
          shrieks, and moans, and cries, like the Druidic groves of old? Such is
          not like our God. Our God is a God of love, and it is his very nature
          to make his creatures happy; and we, who are his twice-made creatures,
          who are the partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the
          corruption which is in the world through lust, is it to be supposed
          that we are bound by a stern decree to go mourning all our days? Oh!
          if ye knew the Christian's privilege, if ye understood that the secret
          of the Lord is laid open to him, that the wounds of Christ are his
          shelter, that the flesh and blood of Christ are his food, that Christ
          himself is his sweet companion and his abiding friend, oh! if ye knew
          this, ye would never again foolishly dream that Christians are an
          unhappy race. "Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O
          people saved by the Lord?" Who can be compared with the man who is
          "satisfied with favor and full with the blessing of the Lord." Well
          might the evil prophet of Bethor exclaim, "Let me die the death of the
          righteous, and let my last end be like his."
        </p>
        <p>
          We will go a step farther. We will not only say that from the nature
          of his position and privileges, a Christian should be happy, but we
          declare that he is so, and that among all men there are none who enjoy
          such a constant peace of mind as believers in Christ. Our joy may not
          be like that of the sinner, noisy and boisterous. You know what
          Solomon says -- "The laughter of fools is as the crackling of thorns
          under a pot" -- a great deal of blaze and much noise, and then a
          handful of ashes, and it is all over. "Who hath woe, who hath redness
          of the eyes? They that tarry long at the wine-men of strength to
          mingle strong drink." The Christian, in truth, does not know much of
          the excitement of the bowl, the viol and the dance, nor does he desire
          to know; he is content that he possesses a calm deep-seated repose of
          soul. "He is not afraid of evil tidings, his heart is fixed, trusting
          in the Lord." He is not disturbed with any sudden fear: he knows that
          "all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who
          are the called according to his purpose." He is in the habit in
          whatever society he may be, of still lifting up his heart to God; and
          therefore he can say with the Psalmist, "My heart is fixed, O God, my
          heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise."
        </p>
        <p>"He waits in secret on his God;</p>
        <p>His God in secret sees;</p>
        <p>Let earth be all in arms abroad,</p>
        <p>He dwells in heavenly peace.</p>
        <p>His pleasures rise from things unseen,</p>
        <p>Beyond this world and time,</p>
        <p>Where neither eyes nor ears have been,</p>
        <p>Nor thoughts of sinners climb.</p>
        <p>He wants no pomp nor royal throne</p>
        <p>To raise his figure here:</p>
        <p>Content and pleased to live unknown,</p>
        <p>Till Christ his life appear.</p>
        <p>
          "There is a river the streams whereof make glad the city of God."
          Believers drink of that river and thirst not for carnal delights. They
          are made "to lie down in green pastures," and are led "beside the
          still waters." Now this solid, lasting joy and peace of mind sets the
          Christian so on high above all others, that I boldly testify that
          there are no people in the world to compare with him for happiness.
          But do not suppose that our joy never rises above this settled calm;
          for let me tell you, and I speak experimentally, we have our seasons
          of rapturous delight and overflowing bliss. There are times with us
          when no music could equal the melody of our heart's sweet hymn of joy.
          It would empty earth's coffers of every farthing of her joy to buy a
          single ounce of our delight. Do not fancy Paul was the only man who
          could say, "Whether in the body or out of the body, I cannot tell; God
          knoweth," for these ecstasies are usual with believers; and on their
          sunshiny days when their unbelief is shaken off and their faith is
          strong, they have all but walked the golden streets; and they can say,
          "If we have not entered within the pearly gate, we have been only just
          this side of it; and it we have not yet come to the general assembly
          and Church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven, if we
          have not joined the great congregation of the perfect in actual body,
          yet still --
        </p>
        <p>"E'en now by faith we join our hands</p>
        <p>With those that went before,</p>
        <p>And greet the blood-besprinkled bands</p>
        <p>On the eternal shore."</p>
        <p>
          I would not change one five minutes of the excessive joy my soul has
          sometimes felt for a thousand years of the best mirth that the
          children of this world could give me. O friends, there is a happiness
          which can make the eye sparkle and the heart beat high, and the whole
          man as full of bounding speed of life as the chariots of Amminadib.
          There are raptures and high ecstasies, which on festival days such as
          the Lord allotteth to his people, the saints are permitted to enjoy. I
          must not fail to remind you that the Christian is the happiest of men
          for this reason, that his joy does not depend upon circumstances. We
          have seen the happiest men in the most sorrowful conditions. Mr.
          Renwick, who was the last of the Scotch martyrs, said a little before
          his death, "Enemies think themselves satisfied that we are put to
          wander in mosses and upon mountains, but even amidst the storm of
          these last two nights I cannot express what sweet times I have had
          when I have had no coverings but the dark curtains of night: yea, in
          the silent watch my mind was led out to admire the deep and
          inexpressible ocean of joy wherein the whole family of heaven do swim.
          Each star led me to wonder what He must be who is the star of Jacob,
          and from whom all stars borrow their shining." Here is a martyr of God
          driven from house and home and from all comforts, and yet having such
          sweet seasons beneath the curtains of the black night as kings do not
          often know beneath their curtains of silk. A minister of Christ going
          to visit a very, very poor man, gives this description. He says, "I
          found him alone, his wife having gone out to ask help of some
          neighbor. I was startled by the sight of the pale emaciated man, the
          living image of death, fastened upright in his chair by a rude
          mechanism of cords and belts hanging from the ceiling, totally unable
          to move hand or foot, having been for more than four years entirely
          deprived of the use of his limbs, and suffering extreme pain from
          swellings in all his joints. I approached him full of pity, and I
          said, "Are you left alone, my friend, in this deplorable situation?"
          He answered with a gentle voice -- his lips were the only parts of his
          body which he appeared to have power to move -- "No, sir, I am not
          alone, because the Father is with me." I began to talk with him, and I
          soon observed what was the source of his consolation, for just in
          front of him lay the Bible upon a pillow, his wife having left it open
          at some choice Psalm of David so that he might read while she was
          gone, as he had no power to turn over the leaves. I asked him what he
          had to live upon, and found that it was a miserable pittance, scarcely
          enough to keep body and soul together, "But," said he, "I never want
          anything, for the Lord has said, Your bread shall be given you, and
          your water shall be sure,' and I trust in him, and I shall never want
          while God is faithful to his promise." "I asked him," says this
          minister "whether he did not often repine on account of suffering so
          acutely for so many years. "Sir," said he, "I did repine at first, but
          not for the last three years, blessed be God for it, for I know whom I
          have believed, and though I feel my own weakness and unworthiness more
          and more, yet I am persuaded that he will never leave me nor forsake
          me; and so graciously does he comfort me that when my lips are closed
          with lock-jaw and I cannot speak a word for hours together, he enables
          me to sing his praises most sweetly in my heart." Now here was a man
          to whom the sun of all earthly comfort was set, and yet the sun of
          heaven shone full in his face, and he was more peaceful and happy in
          deep poverty and racking pain than all you or I have been in the
          health and strength of youth. John Howard spent his time in visiting
          the gaols and going from one haunt of fever to another, he was asked
          how he could find any ground of happiness when he was living in
          miserable Russian villages, or dwelling in discomfort in an hospital
          or a gaol. Mr. Howard's answer was very beautiful. "I hope," said he,
          "I have sources of enjoyment which depend not upon the particular spot
          I inhabit. A rightly cultivated mind, under the power of divine grace
          and the exercise of a benevolent disposition affords a ground of
          satisfaction that is not to be affected by heres and theres." Every
          Christian will bear you his witness that he has found his sad times to
          be his glad times, his losses to be his gains, his sicknesses means to
          promote his soul's health. Our summer does not depend upon the sun,
          nor our flood-tide upon the moon. We can rejoice even in death. We
          look forward to that happy hour when we shall close our eyes in the
          peaceful slumbers of death, believing that our last day will be our
          best day. Even the crossing of the river Jordan is but an easy task,
          for we shall hear him say, "Fear not; I am with thee: be not dismayed,
          I am thy God; when thou passest through the rivers I will be with
          thee, and the floods shall not overflow thee." We dare to say it,
          then, very boldly, we are not of all men most miserable: we would not
          change with unconverted men for all their riches, and their pomp, and
          their honor thrown into the scale.
        </p>
        <p>"Go you that boast in all your stores,</p>
        <p>And tell how bright they shine,</p>
        <p>Your heaps of glittering dust are yours,</p>
        <p>And my Redeemer's mine.</p>
        <p>
          II. This brings us to the second point -- WITHOUT THE HOPE OF ANOTHER
          LIFE, WE WILL ADMIT, THAT WE SHOULD BE OF ALL MEN MOST MISERABLE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Especially was this true of the apostles. They were rejected by their
          countrymen; they lost all the comforts of home; their lives were spent
          in toil, and were daily exposed to violent death. They all of them
          suffered the martyr's doom, except John, who seems to have been
          preserved not from martyrdom, but in it. They were certainly the
          twelve most miserable of men apart from that hope of the world to
          come, which made them of all men the most happy. But this is true,
          dear friends, not merely of persecuted, and despised, and
          poverty-stricken Christians, but of all believers. We are prepared to
          grant it, that take away from us the hope of the world to come we
          should be more miserable than men without religion. The reason is very
          clear, if you think that the Christian has renounced those common and
          ordinary sources of joy from which other men drink. We must have some
          pleasure: it is impossible for men to live in this world without it,
          and I can say most truthfully I never urge any of you to do that which
          would make you unhappy. We must have some pleasure. Well then, there
          is a vessel filled with muddy filthy water which the camels' feet have
          stirred: shall I drink it? I see yonder a rippling stream of clear
          flowing water, pure as crystal and cooling as the snow of Lebanon, and
          I say, "No, I will not drink this foul, muddy stuff; leave that for
          beasts; I will drink of you clear stream." But if I be mistaken, if
          there be no stream yonder, if it be but the deceitful mirage, if I
          have been deluded, then I am worse off than those who were content
          with the muddy water, for they have at least some cooling draughts;
          but I have none at all. This is precisely the Christian's case. He
          passes by the pleasures of sin, and the amusements of carnal men,
          because he says, "I do not care for them, I find no pleasure in them:
          my happiness flows from the river which springs from the throne of God
          and flows to me through Jesus Christ -- I will drink of that," but if
          there were no hereafter, if that were proved to be a deception, then
          were we more wretched than the profligate and licentious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the Christian man has learned the vanity of all earthly joys.
          We know when we look upon pomp that it is an empty thing. We walk
          through the world, not with the scorn of Diogenes, the cynical
          philosopher, but with something of his wisdom, and we look upon the
          common things in which men rejoice, and say with Solomon, "Vanity of
          vanities, all is vanity." And why do we say this? Why, because we have
          chosen eternal things in which there is no vanity, and which are
          satisfying to the soul. But, my brethren, it is the most unhappy piece
          of knowledge which a man can acquire, to know that this world is vain,
          if there be not another world abundantly to compensate for all our
          ills. There is a poor lunatic in Bedlam, plaiting straw into a crown
          which he puts upon his head, and calls himself a king, and mounts his
          mimic throne and thinks that he is monarch over all nations, and is
          perfectly happy in his dream. Do you think that I would undeceive him?
          Nay, verily, if I could, I would not. If the delusion makes the man
          happy, by all means let him indulge in it; but, dear friends, you and
          I have been undeceived; our dream of perfect bliss beneath the skies
          is gone for ever; what then if there be no world to come? Why then it
          is a most sorrowful thing for us that we have been awakened out of our
          sleep unless this better thing which we have chosen, this good part
          which shall not be taken from us, should prove to be real and true, as
          we do believe it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the Christian man is a man who has had high, noble, and
          great expectations, and this is a very sad thing for us if our
          expectations be not fulfilled, for it makes us of all men most
          miserable. I have known poor men waiting and expecting a legacy. They
          had a right to expect it, and they have waited, and waited, and borne
          with poverty, and the relative has died and left them nothing; their
          poverty has ever afterwards seemed to be a heavier drag than before.
          It is an unhappy thing for a man to have large ideas and large
          desires, if he cannot gratify them. I believe that poverty is
          infinitely better endured by persons who were always poor, than by
          those who have been rich and have had to come down to penury, for they
          miss what the others never had, and what the originally poor would
          look upon as luxuries they consider to be necessary to their
          existence. The Christian has learned to think of eternity, of God, of
          Christ, of communion with Jesus, and if indeed it be all false, he
          certainly has dreamed the most magnificent of all mortal visions.
          Truly, if any man could prove it to be a vision, the best thing he
          could do would be to sit down and weep for ever to think it was not
          true, for the dream is so splendid, the picture of the world to come
          so gorgeous, that I can only say, if it be not true, it ought to be --
          if it be not true, then there is nothing here worth living for, my
          brethren, and we are disappointed wretches indeed -- of all men most
          miserable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Christian, too, has learned to look upon everything here on earth
          as fleeting. I must confess every day this feeling grows with me. I
          scarce look upon my friends as living. I walk as in a land of shadows,
          and find nothing enduring around me. The broad arrow of the great
          skeleton king is, to my eye, visibly stamped everywhere. I go so often
          to the grave, and with those I least expected to take there, that it
          seems to be rather a world of dying than of living men. Well, this is
          a very unhappy thing -- a very wretched state of mind for a man to be
          in, if there be no world to come. If there be no resurrection of the
          dead, then is the Christian indeed committed to a state of mind the
          most deplorable and pitiable. But, O my brethren, if there be a world
          to come, as faith assures us there is, how joyous it is to be weaned
          from the world, and to be ready to depart from it! To be with Christ
          is far better than to tarry in this vale of tears.
        </p>
        <p>"The cords that bound my heart to earth</p>
        <p>Are broken by his hand;</p>
        <p>Before his cross I find myself,</p>
        <p>A stranger in the land.</p>
        <p>My heart is with him on his throne,</p>
        <p>And ill can brook delay;</p>
        <p>Each moment listening for the voice,</p>
        <p>'Make haste, and come away."'</p>
        <p>
          May I not pant to be in my own sweet country with my own fair Lord, to
          see him face to face? Yet, if it be not so and there be no
          resurrection of the dead, "we are of all men most miserable."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. OUR CHIEF JOY IN THE HOPE OF THE WORLD TO COME. Think of the
          world to come, my brethren, and let your joys begin to kindle into
          flames of delight, for heaven offers you all that you can desire. You
          are, many of you, weary of toil; so weary, perhaps, that you can
          scarcely enjoy the morning service because of the late hours at which
          you have had to work at night. Ah! there is a land of rest -- of
          perfect rest, where the sweat of labor no more bedews the worker's
          brow, and fatigue is for ever banished. To those who are weary and
          spent, the word "rest" is full of heaven. Oh! happy truth, there
          remaineth a rest for the people of God. " They rest from their labors,
          and their works do follow them." Others of you are always in the field
          of battle; you are so tempted within, and so molested by foes without,
          that you have little or no peace. I know where your hope lies. It lies
          in the victory, when the banner shall be waved aloft, and the sword
          shall be sheathed, and you shall hear your Captain say, "Well done,
          good and faithful servant; thou hast fought a good fight; thou hast
          finished thy course: henceforth wear thou the crown of life which
          fadeth not away." Some of you are tossed about with many troubles; you
          go from care to care, from loss to loss: it seems to you as if all
          God's waves and billows had gone over you; but you shall soon arrive
          at the land of happiness, where you shall bathe your weary soul in
          seas of heavenly rest, You shall have no poverty soon; no mud-hovel,
          no rags, nor hunger. "In my Father's house are many mansions," and
          there shall you dwell, satisfied with favor, and full of every
          blessing. You have had bereavement after bereavement; the wife has
          been carried to the tomb, the children have followed, father and
          mother are gone, and you have few left to love you here; but you are
          going to the land where graves are unknown things, where they never
          see a shroud, and the sound of the mattock and the spade are never
          heard; you are going to your Father's house in the land of the
          immortal, in the country of the hereafter, in the home of the blessed,
          in the habitation of God Most High, in the Jerusalem which is above,
          the mother of us all. Is not this your best joy, that you are not to
          be here for ever, that you are not to dwell eternally in this
          wilderness, but shall soon inherit Canaan? With all God's people their
          worst grief is sin. I would not care for any sorrow, if I could live
          without sinning. Oh! if I were rid of the appetites of the flesh and
          the lusts thereof, and the desires which continually go astray, I
          would be satisfied to lie in a dungeon and rot there, so as to be
          delivered from the corruption of sin. Well but, brethren, we shall
          soon attain unto perfection. The body of this death will die with this
          body. There is no temptation in heaven, for the dog of hell can never
          cross the stream of death; there are no corruptions there, for they
          have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb;
          there shall by no means enter into that kingdom anything which
          defileth. Methinks as I hear the joyous song of the glorified this
          morning, as I catch floating down from heaven the sound of that music
          which is like many waters and like the great thunder, and as I hear
          the harmony of those notes which are sweet as harpers harping with
          their harps, my soul desireth to stretch her wings, and fly straight
          to yonder worlds of joy. I know it is so with you, my brethren in the
          tribulation of Christ -- as you wipe the sweat your brow, is not this
          the comfort: there is rest for the people of God? As you stand out
          against temptation and suffer for Christ's sake, is not this your
          comfort: " If we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him." When
          you are slandered and despised by men, is not this your hope: "He will
          remember me when he cometh into his kingdom. I shall sit upon his
          throne, even as he has overcome, and sitteth down upon his Father's
          throne?" Oh! yes, this is the music to which Christians dance; this is
          the wine which maketh glad their hearts; this is the banquet at which
          they feast. There is another and a better land, and we, though we
          sleep with the clods of the valley, shall in our flesh see God, when
          our Redeemer shall stand in the latter days upon the earth. I think
          you catch my drift -- we are not of all men most miserable; apart from
          the future hope we should be, for our hope in Christ for the future is
          the mainstay of our joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Now, dear friends, this brings me to a practical observation in
          the fourth place, which is, that THUS THE FUTURE OPERATES UPON THE
          PRESENT.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had some time ago a conversation with a very eminent man whose fame
          is familiar to you all, but whose name I do not feel justified in
          mentioning, who was once a professed believer but is now full of
          scepticism. He said to me in the course of our argument, "Why, how
          foolish you are, and all the company of preachers. You tell people to
          think about the next world, when the best thing they could do would be
          to behave themselves as well as they can in this!" I granted the truth
          of the observation; it would be very unwise to make people neglect the
          present, for it is of exceeding great importance, but I went on to
          show him that the very best method to make people attend to the
          present was by impressing them with high and noble motives with regard
          to the future. The potent force of the world to come supplies us
          through the Holy Spirit with force for the proper accomplishment of
          the duties of this life. Here is a man who has a machine for the
          manufacture of hardware. He wants steam power to work this machine. An
          engineer puts up a steam engine in a shed at some considerable
          distance. "Well," saith the other, "I asked you to bring steam power
          here, to operate upon my machine." "That is precisely," says he, "what
          I have done. I put the steam engine there, you have but to connect it
          by a band and your machine works as fast as you like; it is not
          necessary that I should put the boiler, and the fire, and the engine
          close to the work, just under your nose: only connect the two, and the
          one will operate upon the other." So God has been pleased to make our
          hopes of the future a great engine wherewith the Christian man may
          work the ordinary machine of every-day life, for the band of faith
          connects the two, and makes all the wheels of ordinary life revolve
          with rapidity and regularity. To speak against preaching the future as
          though it would make people neglect the present is absurd. It is as
          though somebody should say, "There, take away the moon, and blot out
          the sun. What is the use of them -- they are not in this world?"
          Precisely so, but take away the moon and you have removed the tides,
          and the sea becomes a stagnant, putrid pool. Then take away the sun --
          it is not in the world -- take it away, and light, and heat, and life;
          everything is gone. What the sun and moon are to this natural world,
          the hope of the future is to the Christian in this world. It is his
          light -- he looks upon all things in that light, and sees them truly.
          It is his heat; it gives him zeal and energy. It is his very life: his
          Christianity, his virtue would expire if it were not for the hope of
          the world to come. Do you believe, my brethren, that apostles and
          martyrs would ever have sacrificed their lives for truth's sake if
          they had not looked for a hereafter? In the heat of excitement, the
          soldier may die for honor, but to die in tortures and mockeries in
          cold blood needs a hope beyond the grave. Would you poor man go
          toiling on year after year, refusing to sacrifice his conscience for
          gain; would yon poor needle-girl refuse to become the slave of lust if
          she did not see something brighter than earth can picture to her as
          the reward of sin? O my brethren, the most practical thing in all the
          world is the hope of the world to come; and you see the text teaches
          this, for it is just this which keeps us from being miserable; and to
          keep a man from being miserable, let me say, is to do a great thing
          for him, for a miserable Christian -- what is the use of him? Keep him
          in a cupboard, where nobody can see him; nurse him in the hospital,
          for he is of no use in the field of labor. Build a monastery, and put
          all miserable Christians in it, and there let them meditate on mercy
          till they learn to smile; for really there is no other use for them in
          the world, But the man who has a hope of the next world goes about his
          work strong, for the joy of the Lord is our strength. He goes against,
          temptation mighty, for the hope of the next world repels the fiery
          darts of the adversary. He can labor without present reward, for he
          looks for a reward in the world to come. He can suffer rebuke, and can
          afford to die a slandered man, because he knows that God will avenge
          his own elect who cry day and night unto him. Through the Spirit of
          God the hope of another world is the most potent force for the product
          of virtue; it is a fountain of joy; it is the very channel of
          usefulness. It is to the Christian what food is to the vital force in
          the animal frame. Let it be said of any of us, that we are dreaming
          about the future and forgetting the present, but let the future
          sanctify the present to highest uses. I fear our prophetical brethren
          err here. They are reading continually about the last vials, the
          seventy weeks of Daniel, and a number of other mysteries; I wish they
          would set to work instead of speculating so much, or speculate even
          more if they will, but turn their prophecies to present practical
          account. Prophetical speculations too often lead men away from present
          urgent duty, and especially from contending earnestly for the faith
          once delivered to the saints; but a hope of the world to come is, I
          think, the best practical power which a Christian can have.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. And now, to conclude, this will let us see very clearly WHAT OUR
          FUTURE IS TO BE.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some persons here to whom my text has nothing whatever to
          say. Suppose there were no hereafter, would they be more miserable?
          Why, no; they would be more happy. If anybody could prove to them that
          death is an eternal sleep, it would be the greatest consolation that
          they could possibly receive, It it could be shown, to a demonstration,
          that as soon as people die they rot in the grave and there is an end
          of them -- why some of you could go to bed at night comfortable, your
          conscience would never disturb you, you would be molested by none of
          those terrible fears which now haunt you. Do you see, then, this
          proves that you are not a Christian; this proves as plainly as twice
          two make tour, that you are no believer in Christ; for if you were,
          the taking away of a hereafter would make you miserable. Since it
          would not tend to make you happy to believe in a future state, this
          proves that you are no believer in Christ. Well, then, what have Ito
          say to you? Why just this -- that in the world to come, you will be of
          all men most miserable. "What will become of you?" said an infidel
          once to a Christian man, "supposing there should be no heaven?"
          "Well," said he, "I like to have two strings to my bow. If there be no
          hereafter I am as well off as you are; if there be I am infinitely
          better off. But where are you? Where are you?" Why then we must read
          this text in the future -- "If in this life there be indeed a hope of
          a life to come, then you shall be in the next life of all men most
          miserable." Do you see where you will be? Your soul goes before the
          great Judge, and receives its condemnation and begins its hell. The
          trumpet rings; heaven and earth are astonished; the grave heaves;
          yonder slab of marble is lifted up, and up you rise in that very flesh
          and blood in which you sinned, and there you stand in the midst of a
          terrified multitude, all gathered to their doom. The Judge has come.
          The great assize has commenced. There on the great white throne sits
          the Savior who once said, "Come unto me, ye weary, and I will give you
          rest;" but now he sits there as a Judge and opens with stern hand the
          terrible volume. Page after page he reads, and as he reads he gives
          the signal, "Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire," and the angels
          bind up the fares in bundles to burn them. There stand you, and you
          know your doom; you already begin to feel it. You cry to the lofty
          Alps to fall upon you and conceal you. "O ye mountains, can ye not
          find in your rocky bowels some friendly cavern where I may be hidden
          from the face of him who sits upon the throne?" In terrible silence
          the mountains refuse your petition and the rocks reject your cry. You
          would plunge into the sea, but it is licked up with tongues of fire;
          you would fain make your bed even in hell if you could escape from
          those dreadful eyes, but you cannot; for now your turn is come, that
          page is turned over which records your history; the Savior reads with
          a voice of thunder and with eyes of lightning. He reads, and as he
          waves his hand you are cast away from hope. You shall then know what
          it is to be of all men most miserable. Ye had your pleasure; ye had
          your giddy hour; ye had your mirthful moments; you despised Christ,
          and you would not turn at his rebuke; you would not have him to reign
          over you; you lived his adversary; you died unreconciled, and now
          where are you? Now, what will ye do, ye who forget God, in that day
          when he shall tear you in pieces, and there shall be none to deliver
          you? In the name of my Lord and Master I do conjure you, fly away to
          Christ for refuge. "He that believeth in him shall be saved." To
          believe is to trust; and whosoever this morning is enabled by faith to
          cast himself upon Christ, need not fear to live, nor fear to die, You
          shall not be miserable here; you shall be thrice blessed hereafter if
          you trust my Lord.
        </p>
        <p>"Come, guilty souls, and flee away</p>
        <p>To Christ, and heal your wounds;</p>
        <p>This is the welcome gospel-day</p>
        <p>Wherein free grace abounds."</p>
        <p>
          O that ye would be wise and consider your latter end! O that ye would
          reflect that this life is but a span, and the life to come lasts on
          for ever! Do not, I pray you, fling away eternity; play not the fool
          with such solemn things as these, but in serious earnestness lay hold
          upon eternal life. Look to the bleeding Savior; see there his five
          wounds, and his face bedewed with bloody sweat! Trust him, trust him,
          and you are saved. The moment that you trust him your sins are gone.
          His righteousness is yours; you are saved on the spot, and you shall
          be saved when he cometh in his kingdom to raise the dead from their
          graves. O that the Lord might lead us all thus to rest on Jesus, now
          and ever. Amen.<br />
