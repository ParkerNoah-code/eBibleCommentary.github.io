        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.495)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, February 22nd, 1863, by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel
          together, against the Lord, and against his anointed." -- Psalm 2:2.
        </p>
        <p>
          AFTER OUR LORD HAD been betrayed by the false-hearted Judas, he was
          bound by the officers who had come to take him; no doubt the cords
          were drawn as tight, and twisted as mercilessly as possible. If we
          believe the traditions of the fathers, these cords cut through the
          flesh even to the very bones, so that all the way from the garden to
          the house of Annas, his blood left a crimson trail. Our Redeemer was
          hurried along the road which crosses the brook Kedron. A second time
          he was made like unto David, who passed over that brook, weeping as he
          went; and perhaps it was on this occasion that he drank of that foul
          brook by the way. The brook Redron, you know, was that into which all
          the filth of the sacrifices of the temple was cast, and Christ, as
          though he were a foul and filthy thing, must be led to the black
          stream. He was led into Jerusalem by the sheep-gate, the gate through
          which the lambs of the Passover and the sheep for sacrifice were
          always driven. Little did they understand, that in so doing they were
          again following out to the very letter the significant types which God
          had ordained in the law of Moses. They led, I say, this Lamb of God
          through the sheep-gate, and they hastened him on to the house of
          Annas, the ex-high priest, who, either from his relationship to
          Caiaphas, from his natural ability, or his prominence in opposing the
          Savior, stood high in the opinion of the rulers. Here they made a
          temporary call, to gratify the bloodthirsty Annas with the sight of
          his victim; and then, hastening on, they brought him to the house of
          Caiaphas, some little distance off; where, though it was but a little
          past the dead of night, many members of the Sanhedrim were assembled.
          In a very short time, no doubt informed by some speedy messenger, all
          the rest of the elders came together, and sat down with great delight
          to the malicious work. Let us follow our Lord Jesus Christ, not, like
          Peter, afar off, but, like John, let us go in with Jesus into the high
          priest's house, and when we have tarried awhile there, and have seen
          our Savior despitefully used, let us traverse the streets with him,
          till we come to the hall of Pilate, and then to the palace of Herod,
          and then afterwards to the place called "the pavement," where Christ
          is subjected to an ignominious competition with Barabbas, the
          murderer, and where we hear the howling of the people, "Crucify him!
          Crucify him!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, as the Lord gave commandment concerning even the ashes and
          offal of the sacrifices, we ought to think no matter trivial which
          stands in connection with our great burnt offering. My admonition is,
          "Gather up the fragments which remain, that nothing be lost." As
          goldsmiths sweep their shops, to save even the filings of the gold, so
          every word of Jesus should be treasured up as very precious. But,
          indeed, the narrative to which I invite you is not unimportant. Things
          which were purposed of old, prophesied by seers, witnessed by
          apostles, written by evangelists, and published by the ambassadors of
          God, are not matters of secondary interest, but deserve our solemn and
          devout attention. Let all our hearts be awed as we follow the King of
          kings in his pathway of shame and suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Come we, then, to the hall of Caiaphas. After the mob had dragged
          our Lord from the house of Annas, they reached the palace of Caiaphas,
          and there a brief interval occurred before the High Priest came forth
          to question the prisoner. How were those sad minutes spent? Was the
          poor victim allowed a little pause to collect his thoughts, that he
          might face his accusers calmly? Far from it; Luke shall tell the
          pitiful story: "And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.
          And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and
          asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? And many other
          things blasphemously spake they against him." The officers were
          pausing until the chairman of the court should please to have an
          interview with the prisoner, and instead of suffering the accused to
          take a little rest before a trial so important, upon which his life
          and character depended, they spend all the time in venting their
          bitter malice upon him. Observe how they insult his claim to the
          Messiahship! In effect, they mock him thus: "Thou claimest to be a
          prophet like unto Moses; thou knowest things to come; if thou be sent
          of God, prove it by discovering thy foes; we will put thee on thy
          trial, and test thee, O thou man of Nazareth." They bind his eyes, and
          then, smiting him one after another, they bid him exercise his
          prophetic gift, for their amusement, and prophesy who it was that
          smote him. Oh, shameful question! How gracious was the silence, for an
          answer might have withered them for ever. The day shall come when all
          that smite Christ, shall find that he has seen them, though they
          thought his eyes were blinded. The day shall come, blasphemer,
          worldling, careless man, when everything that you have done against
          Christ's cause and Christ's people, shall be published before the eyes
          of men and angels, and Christ shall answer your question, and shall
          tell you who it is that smote him. I speak to some this morning who
          have forgotten that Christ sees them; and they have ill-treated his
          people; they have spoken ill of his holy cause, saying, "How doth God
          know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?" I tell you, the Judge
          of men shall ere long, point you out, and make you, to your shame and
          confusion of face, confess that you smote the Savior when you smote
          his Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          This preliminary mockery being over, Caiaphas, the high priest came
          in; he began at once to interrogate the Lord before the public trial
          doubtless with the view of catching him in his speech. The high priest
          asked him first of his disciples. We do not know what questions he
          asked; perhaps they were something like these: "What meanest thou, to
          allow a rabble to follow thee wherever thou goest? Who art thou, that
          thou shouldst have twelve persons always attending thee and calling
          thee Master? Dost thou intend to make these the leaders of a band of
          men? Are these to be thy lieutenants, to raise a host on thy behalf?
          Or dost thou pretend to be a prophet, and are these the sons of the
          prophets who follow thee, as Elisha did Elias Moreover, where are
          they? Where are thy gallant followers? If thou art a good man, why are
          they not here to bear witness to thee? Where are they gone? Are they
          not ashamed of their folly, now that thy promises of honor all end in
          shame?" The high priest "asked him of his disciples." Our Lord Jesus
          on this point said not a syllable. Why this silence? Because it is not
          for our Advocate to accuse his disciples. He might have answered,
          "Well dost thou ask, Where are they?' the cowards forsook me; when one
          proved a traitor, the rest took to their heels. Thou sayest, Where are
          my disciples?' there is one yonder, sitting by the fire, warming his
          hands, the same who just now denied me with an oath." But no, he would
          not utter a word of accusation; he whose lips are mighty to intercede
          for his people, will never speak against them. Let Satan slander, but
          Christ pleads. The accuser of the brethren is the prince of this
          world: the Prince of peace is ever our Advocate before the eternal
          throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          The high priest next shifted his ground, and asked him concerning his
          doctrine -- what it was that he taught -- whether what he taught was
          not in contradiction to the original teachings of their great
          law-giver Moses -- and whether he had not railed at the Pharisees,
          reviled the Scribes, and exposed the rulers. The Master gave a noble
          answer. Truth is never shamefaced; he boldly points to his public life
          as his best answer. "I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the
          synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in
          secret have I said nothing. Why askest thou me? ask them which heard
          me, what I have said unto them: behold they know what I said." No
          sophistries -- no attempt at evasion -- the best armor for truth is
          her own naked breast. He had preached in the market-places, on the
          mountain's brow, and in the temple courts; nothing had been done in a
          corner. Happy is the man who can make so noble a defense. Where is the
          joint in such harness? Where can the arrow pierce the man arrayed in
          so complete a panoply? Little did that arch-knave Caiaphas gain by his
          crafty questioning. For the rest of the questioning, our Lord Jesus
          said not a word in self-defense; he knew that it availed not for a
          lamb to plead with wolves; he was well aware that whatever he said
          would be misconstrued and made a fresh source of accusation, and he
          willed, moreover, to fulfill the prophecy, "He is brought as a lamb to
          the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he
          openeth not his mouth." But what power he exerted in thus remaining
          silent! Perhaps nothing displays more fully the omnipotence of Christ,
          than this power of self-control. Control the Deity? What power less
          than divine can attempt the task? Behold, my brethren, the Son of God
          does more than rule the winds and commend the waves, he restrains
          himself. And when a word, a whisper, would have refuted his foes, and
          swept them to their eternal destruction, he "openeth not his mouth."
          He who opened his mouth for his enemies, will not utter a word for
          himself. If ever silence were more than golden, it is this deep
          silence under infinite provocation.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this preliminary examination, our Lord suffered an outrage
          which needs a passing notice. When he had said, "Ask them that hear
          me," some over-officious person in the crowd struck him in the face.
          The margin in John 18:22, very properly corrects our version, and
          renders the passage, "with a rod." Now, considering that our blessed
          Lord suffered so much, this one little particular might seem
          unimportant, only it happens to be the subject of prophecy in the book
          of Micah 5:1, "They shall smite the Judge of Israel with a rod upon
          the cheek." This smiting while under trial is peculiarly atrocious. To
          strike a man while he is pleading in his own defense, would surely be
          a violation of the laws even of barbarians. It brought Paul's blood
          into his face, and made him lose his balance when the high priest
          ordered them to smite him on the mouth. I think I hear his words of
          burning indignation: "God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for
          sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be
          smitten contrary to the law?" How soon the servant loses his temper:
          how far more glorious the meekness of the Master. What a contrast do
          these gentle words afford us -- "If I have spoken evil bear witness to
          the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me?" This was such a
          concentrated infamy, to strike a man while pleading for his life, that
          it well deserved the notice both of evangelist and prophet.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now the Court are all sitting; the members of the great Sanhedrim
          are all in their various places, and Christ is brought forth for the
          public trial before the highest ecclesiastical court; though it is,
          mark you, a foregone conclusion, that by hook or by crook they will
          find him guilty. They scour the neighborhood for witnesses. There were
          fellows to be found in Jerusalem, like those who in the olden times
          frequented the Old Bailey, "straw witnesses," who were ready to be
          bought on either side; and, provided they were well paid, would swear
          to anything. But for all this, though the witnesses were ready to
          perjure themselves, they could not agree one with another; being heard
          separately, their tales did not tally. At last two came, with some
          degree of similarity in their witness; they were both liars, but for
          once the two liars had struck the same note. They declared that he
          said "I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within
          three days I will build another made without hands," Mark 14:58. Now
          here was, first, misquotation. He never said, "I will destroy the
          temple," his words were, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I
          will raise it up." See how they add to his words and twist them to
          their own ends. Then again, they not only misquoted the words, but
          they misrepresented the sense, wilfully, because he spake concerning
          the temple of his body, and not the literal temple in which they
          worshipped; and this they must have known. He said, "Destroy this
          temple" -- and the accompanying action might have showed them that he
          meant his own body, which was raised by his glorious resurrection
          after destruction upon the cross. Let us add, that even when thus
          misrepresented, the witness was not sufficient as the foundation of a
          capital charge. Surely there could be nothing worthy of death in a
          man's saying, "Destroy this temple, and I will build it in three
          days." A person might make use of those words a thousand times over --
          he might be very foolish, but he would not be guilty of death for such
          an offense. But where men have made up their minds to hate Christ,
          they will hate him without a cause. Oh! ye that are adversaries of
          Christ -- and there are some such here to-day -- I know ye try to
          invent some excuse for your opposition to his holy religion; ye forge
          a hundred falsehoods; but ye know that your witness is not true, and
          your trial in conscience through which you pass the Savior, is but a
          mock one. Oh that ye were wise, and would understand him to be what he
          is, and submit yourselves to him now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finding that their witness, even when tortured to the highest degree,
          was not strong enough, the high priest, to get matter of accusation,
          adjured him by the Most High God to answer whether he was the Christ,
          "the Son of the Blessed." Being thus adjured, our Master would not set
          us an example of cowardice; he spake to purpose; he said, "I am," Mark
          14:62, and then, to show how fully he knew this to be true, he added,
          "ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and
          coming in the clouds of heaven." I cannot understand what Unitarians
          do with this incident. Christ was put to death on a charge of
          blasphemy, for having declared himself to be the Son of God. Was not
          that the time when any sensible person would have denied the
          accusation? If he had not really claimed to be the Son of God, would
          he not now have spoken? Would he not now, once for all, have delivered
          our minds from the mistake under which we are laboring, if, indeed, it
          be a mistake, that he is the Son of God? But no, he seals it with his
          blood; he bears open testimony before the herd of his accusers. "I
          am." I am the Son of God, and I am the sent-one of the Most High. Now,
          now the thing is done. They want no further evidence. The judge,
          forgetting the impartiality which becomes his station, pretends to be
          wonderfully struck with horror, rends his garments, turns round to ask
          his co-assessors whether they need any further witness, and they, all
          too ready, hold up their hands in token of unanimity, and he is at
          once condemned to die. Ah! brethren, and no sooner condemned, than the
          high priest, stepping down from his divan, spits in his face, and then
          the Sanhedrim follow, and smite him on his cheek; and then they turn
          him down to the rabble that had gathered in the court, and they buffet
          him from one to the other, and spit upon his blessed cheeks, and smite
          him, and then they play the old game again, which they had learned so
          well before the trial came on; they blindfold him for a second time,
          place him in the chair, and as they smite him with their fists they
          cry. "Prophet! Prophet! Prophet! who is it that smote thee? Prophecy
          unto us!" And thus the Savior passed a second time through that most
          brutal and ignominious treatment. If we had tears, if we had
          sympathies, if we had hearts, we should prepare to shed those tears,
          to awake those sympathies, and break those hearts, now. O thou Lord of
          life and glory! how shamefully wast thou illtreated by those who
          pretended to be the curators of holy truth, the conservators of
          integrity, and the teachers of the law!
        </p>
        <p>
          Having thus sketched the trial as briefly as I could, let me just say,
          that, throughout the whole of this trial before the ecclesiastical
          tribunal, it is manifest that they did all they could to pour contempt
          upon his two claims -- to Deity and to Messiahship. Now, friends, this
          morning -- this morning, as truly as on that eventful occasion -- you
          and I must range ourselves on one of two sides. Either this day we
          must cheerfully acknowledge his Godhead, and accept him also as the
          Messias, the Savior promised of old to us; or else we must take our
          post with those who are the adversaries of God and of his Christ. Will
          you ask yourself the question, on which side will you now stand? I
          pray you, do not think that Christ's Deity needs any further proof
          than that which this one court gives. My dear friends, there is no
          religion under heaven, no false religion, which would have dared to
          hazard such a statement, as that yonder man who was spit upon and
          buffeted was none other than incarnate God. No false religion would
          venture to draw upon the credulity of its followers to that extent.
          What! that man there who speaks not a word, who is mocked, despised,
          rejected, made nothing of -- what! he "very God of very God?" You do
          not find Mohammed, nor any false prophet, asking any person to believe
          a doctrine so extraordinary. They know too well that there is a limit
          even to human faith; and they have not ventured upon such a marvellous
          assertion as this, that yonder despised man is none other than the
          upholder of all things. No false religion would have taught a truth so
          humbling to him who is its founder and Lord. Besides, it is not in the
          power of any man-made religion to have conceived such a thought. That
          Deity should willingly submit to be spit upon to redeem those whose
          mouths vented the spittle! In what book do you read such a wonder as
          this? We have pictures drawn from imagination; we have been enchanted
          along romantic pages, and we have marvelled at the creative flights of
          human genius; but where did you ever read such a thought as this? "God
          was made flesh and dwelt among us" -- he was despised, scourged,
          mocked, treated as though he were the offscouring of all things,
          brutally treated, worse than a dog, and all out of pure love to his
          enemies. Why, the thought is such a great one, so God-like, the
          compassion in it is so divine, that it must be true. None but God
          could have thought of such a thing as this stoop from the highest
          throne in glory to the cross of deepest shame and woe. And do you
          think that if the doctrine of the cross were not true, such effects
          would follow from it? Would those South Sea Islands, once red with the
          blood of cannibalism, be now the abode of sacred song and peace? Would
          this island, once itself the place of naked savages, be what it is,
          through the influence of the benign gospel of God, if that gospel were
          a lie? Ah! hallowed mistake, indeed, to produce such peaceful, such
          blessed, such lasting, such divine results! Ah! he is God. The thing
          is not false. And that he is Messiah, who shall doubt? If God should
          send a prophet, what better prophet could you desire? What character
          would you seek to have exhibited more completely human and divine?
          What sort of a Savior would you wish for? What could better satisfy
          the cravings of conscience? Who could commend himself more fully to
          the affections of the heart? He must be, we feel at once, as we see
          him, one alone by himself, with no competitor; he must be the Messiah
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, now, sirs, on which side will you range yourselves? Will you
          smite him? I put the question -- "Who is it that will smite him this
          day? Who is it that will spit upon him this day?" "I will not," says
          one, "but I do not accept nor believe in him." In that you smite him.
          "I do not hate him," says another, "but I am not saved by him." In
          refusing his love you smite him. Whoever among you will not trust him
          with your soul -- in that you smite him, smite him in the tenderest
          part: since you impugn his love and power to save. Oh! "Kiss the Son,
          lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is
          kindled but a little." That suffering man stands in the room, and
          place, and stead of every one that will believe on him. Trust him!
          trust him! -- you have then accepted him as your God, as your Messiah.
          Refuse to trust him! -- you have smitten him; and you may think it
          little to do this to-day; but when he rides upon the clouds of heaven
          you will see your sin in its true light, and you will shudder to think
          that ever you could have refused him who now reigns "King of kings and
          Lord of lords." God help you to accept him, as your God and Christ,
          to-day!
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But our time flies too rapidly, and we must hasten with it, and
          accompany our Savior to another place.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Romans had taken away from the Jews the power to put a person to
          death, they sometimes did it still, but they did it, as in the case of
          Stephen, by popular tumult. Now, in our Savior's case they could not
          do this, because there was still a strong feeling in favor of Christ
          among the people, a feeling so strong, that had they not been bribed
          by the rulers, they would never have said, "Crucify him! crucify him!"
          You will remember that the priests and rulers did not arrest him on
          the feast day, "lest" said they "there be a tumult among the people."
          Besides, the Jewish way of putting a person to death, was by stoning:
          hence, unless there was a sufficient number of persons who hated him,
          a person would never get put to death at all. That is why the method
          of putting to death by stoning was chosen, because if a person was
          generally thought to be innocent, very few persons would stone him;
          and although he would be somewhat maimed, his life might possibly be
          spared. They thought, therefore, the Savior might escape as he did at
          other times, when they took up stones to stone him. Moreover they
          desired to put him to the death of the accursed; they would confound
          him with slaves and criminals, and hang him like the Canaanitish kings
          of old; therefore they hound him away to Pilate. The distance was
          about a mile. He was bound in the same cruel manner, and was doubtless
          cut by the cords. He had already suffered most dreadfully; please to
          remember the bloody sweat of last Sabbath week; then remember that he
          has already twice been beaten; and he is now hurried along, without
          any rest or refreshment, just as the morning is breaking, along the
          streets to the place where Pilate lived, perhaps the tower of Antonia,
          close to the temple itself; we are not quite sure. He is bound and
          they hurry him along the road; and here the Romish writers supply a
          great number of particulars of anguish out of their very fertile
          imaginations. After they had brought him there a difficulty occurred.
          These holy people, these very righteous elders, could not come into
          the company of Pilate, because Pilate, being a Gentile, would defile
          them; and there was a broad space outside the palace, like a raised
          platform, this was called "the pavement," where Pilate was wont to sit
          on those high days, that he might not touch these blessed Jews. So he
          came out on the pavement, and they themselves went not into the hall,
          but remained before "the pavement." Always notice, that sinners who
          can swallow camels will strain at gnats, crowds of men who will do
          great sins are very much afraid of committing some little things which
          they they think will affect their religion. Notice, that many a man
          who is a big thief during the week, will ease his conscience by rigid
          Sabbatarianism when the day comes round. In fact, most hypocrites run
          for shelter to some close observance of days, ceremonies, and
          observations, when they have slighted the weightier matters of the
          law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, Pilate receives him bound. The charge brought against him was
          not, of course, blasphemy; Pilate would have laughed at that, and
          declined all interference. They accused him of stirring up sedition,
          pretending to be a king, and teaching that it was not right to pay
          tribute to Caesar. This last charge was a clear and manifest lie. He
          refuse to pay tribute? Did not he send to the fish's mouth to get the
          money? He say that Caesar must not have his due? Did he not tell the
          Herodians -- "Render unto Caesar the things that are Cresar's?" He
          stir up a sedition? -- the man that had "not where to lay his head?"
          He pretend to snatch the diadem from Caesar? -- he, the man who hid
          himself, when the people would have taken him by force and made him a
          king? Nothing can be more atrociously false. Pilate examines him, and
          discovers at once, both from his silence and from his answer, that he
          is a most extraordinary person; he perceives that the kingdom which he
          claims is something supernatural; he cannot understand it. He asks him
          what he came into the world for, the reply puzzles and amazes him, "To
          bear witness to the truth," says he. Now, that was a thing no Roman
          understood; for a hundred years before Pilate came, Jugurtha said of
          the city of Rome, "a city for sale;" bribery, corruption, falsehood,
          treachery, villany, these were the gods of Rome, and truth had fled
          the seven hills, the very meaning of the word was scarcely known. So
          Pilate turned on his heel, and said, "What is truth?" As much as to
          say, "I am the procurator of this part of the country; all I care for
          is money." "What's truth?" I do not think he asked the question, "What
          is truth?" as some preach from it, as if he seriously desired to know
          what it really was, for surely he would have paused for the divine
          reply and not have gone away from Christ the moment afterwards. He
          said, "Pshaw; What's truth?" Yet there was something so awful about
          the prisoner, that his wife's dream, and her message -- "See that thou
          have nothing to do with this just person," all worked upon the
          superstitious fears of this very weak-minded ruler; so he went back
          and told the Jews a second time, "I find no fault in him;" and when
          they said, "He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry,
          beginning at Galilee to this place," he caught at that word "Galilee."
          "Now," he thought, "I will be rid of this man; the people shall have
          their way, and yet I will not be guilty." "Galilee?" said he; "why,
          Herod is ruler there; you had better take him to Herod at once." He
          thus gained two or three points; he made Herod his friend; he hoped to
          exonerate himself of his crime, and yet please the mob. Away they go
          to Herod. Oh! I think I see that blessed Lamb of God again hounded
          through the streets. Did you ever read such a tale? No martyr, even in
          bloody Mary's time, was ever harried thus as the Savior was. We must
          not think that his agonies were all confined to the cross; they were
          endured in those streets -- in those innumerable blows, and kicks, and
          strikings with the fist, that he had to bear. They took him before
          Herod, and Herod having heard of his miracles, thought to see some
          wonderful thing, some piece of jugglery, done in his presence; and
          when Christ refused to speak, and would not plead before "that fox" at
          all, then Herod treated him with a sneer. "They made nothing of him."
          Can you picture the scene? Herod, his captains, his lieutenants, all,
          down to the meanest soldiers, treat the Savior with a broad grin! "A
          pretty king," they seem to say; "a miserable beggar better! Look at
          his cheeks, all bruised where they have been smiting him: is that the
          color of royalty's complexion?" "Look," say they, "he is emaciated, he
          is covered with blood, as though he had been sweating drops of blood
          all night. Is that the imperial purple?" And so they "made nothing of
          him," and despised his kingship. And Herod said, "Bring out that
          costly white robe, you know, if he be a king, let us dress him so,"
          and so the white robe is put on him -- not a purple one -- that Pilate
          put on afterwards. He has two robes put on him -- the one put on by
          the Jews, the other by the Gentiles; seeming to be a fit comment on
          that passage in Solomon's song, where the spouse says, "My beloved is
          white and ruddy" -- white with the gorgeous robe which marked him King
          of the Jews, and then red with the purple robe which Pilate afterwards
          cast upon his shoulders, which proved him King of nations too. And so
          Herod and his men of war, after treating him as shamefully as they
          could, looking at him as some madman mare fit for Bedlam than
          elsewhere, sent him back again to Pilate. Oh! can you not follow him?
          You want no great imagination -- as you see them dragging him back
          again! It is another journey along those streets; another scene of
          shameful tumult, bitter scorn, and cruel smitings. Why, he dies a
          hundred deaths, my brethren, it is not one -- it is death on death the
          Savior bears, as he is dragged from tribunal to tribunal.
        </p>
        <p>
          See, they bring him to Pilate a second time. Pilate again is anxious
          to save him. He says, "I have found no fault in this man touching
          those things whereof ye accuse him: no, nor yet Herod; I will
          therefore release him!" "No, no," they say; and they clamor greatly.
          He proposes a cruel alternative, which yet he meant for tender mercy
          "I will therefore chastise him, and let him go." He gave him over to
          his lictors to be scourged. The Roman scourge was, as I have explained
          before, a most dreadful instrument. It was made of the sinews of oxen,
          and little sharp pieces of bone, which, you know, cause the most
          frightful lacerations, if by accident you even run them into your
          hand; little sharp pieces, splinters of bone, were intertwisted every
          here and there among the sinews; so that every time the lash came down
          some of these pieces of bone went right into the flesh, and tore off
          heavy thonglulls, and not only the blood but the very flesh would be
          rent away. The Savior was tied to the column, and thus beaten. He had
          been beaten before; but this of the Roman lictor was probably the most
          severe of his flagellations. After Pilate had beaten him, he gave him
          up to the soldiers for a short time, that they might complete the
          mockery, and so be able to witness that Pilate had no idea of the
          royalty of Jesus, and no complicity in any supposed treason. The
          soldiers put a crown of thorns on his head, and bowed before him, and
          spat on him, and put a reed in his hands; they smote the crown of
          thorns into his temple, they covered him with a purple robe; and then
          Pilate brought him out, saying, "Behold the man!" I believe he did it
          out of pity. He thought, "Now I have wounded him and cut him to pieces
          thus, I will not kill him; that sight will move their hearts." Oh!
          that Ecce Homo ought to have melted their hearts, if Satan had not
          made them harder than flints and sterner than steel. But no, they cry,
          "Crucify him! crucify him!" So Pilate listens to them again, and they
          change their note, "He hath spoken blasphemy." This was a wrong charge
          to bring; for Pilate, having his superstition again aroused, is the
          more afraid to put him to death; and he comes out again, and says, "I
          find no fault in him." What a strong contest between good and evil in
          that man's heart! But they cried out again, "If thou let this man go
          thou art not Caesar's friend." They hit the mark this time, and he
          yields to their clamor. He brings forth a basin of water, and he
          washes his hands before them all, and he says, "I am innocent of the
          blood of this just person: see ye to it." A poor way of escaping! That
          water could not wash the blood from his hands, though their cry did
          bring the blood on their heads -- "His blood be on us and on our
          children." When that is done, Pilate takes the last desperate step of
          sitting down on the pavement in royal state; he condemns Jesus, and
          bids them take him away. But ere he is taken to execution, the dogs of
          war shall snap at him again. The Jews no doubt having bribed the
          soldiers to excessive zeal of scorn, they a second time -- (oh! mark
          this; perhaps ye thought this happened only once. This is the fifth
          time he has thus been treated) -- the soldiers took him back again,
          and once more they mocked him, once more they spat upon him, and
          treated him shamefully. So, you see, there was once when he first went
          to the house of Caiaphas; then after he was condemned there; then
          Herod and his men of war; then Pilate after the scourging; and then
          the soldiers, after the ultimate condemnation. See ye not how
          manifestly "he was despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and
          acquainted with grief; we hid as it were our faces from him; he was
          despised, and we esteemed him not." I do not know when I ever more
          heartily wished to be eloquent than I do now. I am talking to my own
          lips, and saying, "Oh! that these lips had language worthy of the
          occasion!" I do but faintly sketch the scene. I cannot lay on the
          glowing colors. Oh, that I could set forth thy grief, thou Man of
          Sorrows! God the Holy Ghost impress it on your memories and on your
          souls, and help you pitifully to consider the griefs of your blessed
          Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will now leave this point, when I have made this practical
          application of it. Remember, dear friends, that this day, as truly as
          on that early morning, a division must be made among us. Either you
          must this day accept Christ as your King, or else his blood will be on
          you. I bring my Master out before your eyes, and say to you, "Behold
          your King." Are you willing to yield obedience to him? He claims first
          your implicit faith in his merit: will you yield to that? He claims,
          next, that you will take him to be Lord of your heart, and that, as he
          shall be Lord within, so he shall be Lord without. Which shall it be?
          Will you choose him now? Does the Holy Spirit in your soul -- for
          without that you never will -- does the Holy Spirit say, "Bow the
          knee, and take him as your king?" Thank God, then. But if not, his
          blood is on you, to condemn you. You crucified him. Pilate, Caiaphas,
          Herod, the Jews and Romans, all meet in you. You scourged him; you
          said, "Let him be crucified." Do not say it was not so. In effect you
          join their clamours when you refuse him; when you go your way to your
          farm and to your merchandise, and despise his love and his blood, you
          do spiritually what they did literally -- you despise the King of
          kings. Come to the fountain of his blood, and wash and be clean.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But we must close with a third remark. Christ really underwent
          yet a third trial. He was not only tried before the ecclesiastical and
          civil tribunals, but, he was really tried before the great
          democratical tribunal, that is, the assembly of the people in the
          street.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will say, "How?" Well, the trial was somewhat singular, but yet it
          was really a trial. Barabbas -- a thief, a felon, a murderer, a
          traitor, had been captured; he was probably one of a band of murderers
          who were accustomed to come up to Jerusalem at the time of the feast,
          carrying daggers under their cloaks to stab persons in the crowd, and
          rob them, and then he would be gone again; besides that, he had tried
          to stir up sedition, setting himself up possibly as a leader of
          banditti. Christ was put into competition with this villain; the two
          were presented before the popular eye, and to the shame of manhood, to
          the disgrace of Adam's race, let it be remembered that the perfect,
          loving, tender, sympathizing, disinterested Savior was met with the
          word, "Crucify him!" and Barabbas, the thief, was preferred. "Well,"
          says one, "that was atrocious." The same thing is put before you this
          morning -- the very same thing; and every unregenerate man will make
          the same choice that the Jews did, and only men renewed by grace will
          act upon the contrary principle. I say, friend, this day I put before
          you Christ Jesus, or your sins. The reason why many come not to Christ
          is because they cannot give up their lusts, their pleasures, their
          profits. Sin is Barabbas; sin is a thief; it will rob your soul of its
          life; it will rob God of his glory. Sin is a murderer; it stabbed our
          father Adam; it slew our purity. Sin is a traitor; it rebels against
          the king of heaven and earth. If you prefer sin to Christ, Christ has
          stood at your tribunal, and you have given in your verdict that sin is
          better than Christ. Where is that man? He comes here every Sunday; and
          yet he is a drunkard? Where is he? You prefer that reeling demon
          Bacchus to Christ. Where is that man? He comes here. Yes; and where
          are his midnight haunts? The harlot and the prostitute can tell! You
          have preferred your own foul, filthy lust to Christ. I know some here
          that have their consciences open pricked, and yet there is no change
          in them. You prefer Sunday trading to Christ; you prefer cheating to
          Christ; you prefer the theater to Christ; you prefer the harlot to
          Christ; you prefer the devil himself to Christ, for he it is that is
          the father and author of these things. "No," says one, "I don't, I
          don't." Then I do again put this question, and I put it very pointedly
          to you -- "If you do not prefer your sins to Christ, how is it that
          you are not a Christian?" I believe this is the main stumbling-stone,
          that "Men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are
          evil." We come not to Christ because of the viciousness of our nature,
          and depravity of our heart; and this is the depravity of your heart,
          that you prefer darkness to light, put bitter for sweet, and choose
          evil as your good. Well, I think I hear one saying, "Oh! I would be on
          Jesus Christ's side, but I did not look at it in that light; I thought
          the question was. "Would he be on my side? I am such a poor guilty
          sinner that I would fain stand anywhere, if Jesu's blood would wash
          me." Sinner! sinner! if thou talkest like that, then I will meet thee
          right joyously. Never was a man one with Christ till Christ was one
          with him. If you feel that you can now stand with Christ, and say,
          "Yes, despised and rejected, he is nevertheless my God, my Savior, my
          king. Will he accept me? Why, soul, he has accepted you; he has
          renewed you, or else you would not talk so. You speak like a saved
          man. You may not have the comfort of salvation, but surely there is a
          work of grace in your heart, God's divine election has fallen upon
          you, and Christ's precious redemption has been made for you, or else
          you would not talk so. You cannot be willing to come to Christ, and
          yet Christ reject you. God forbid we should suppose the possibility of
          any sinner crying after the Savior, and the Savior saying, "No, I will
          not have you." Blessed be his name, "Him that cometh to me," he says,
          "I will in no wise cast out." "Well," says one, "then I would have him
          to-day. How can I do it?" There is nothing asked of thee but this.
          Trust him! trust him! Believe that God put him in the stead of men;
          believe that what he suffered was accepted by God instead of their
          punishment; believe that this great equivalent for punishment can save
          you. Trust him; throw yourself on him; as a man commits himself to the
          waters, so do you; sink or swim! You will never sink, you will never
          sink; for "he that believeth on the Lord Jesus Christ hath everlasting
          life, and shall never come into condemnation."
        </p>
        <p>
          May these faint words upon so thrilling a subject bless your souls,
          and unto God be glory, for ever and ever. Amen and Amen.
