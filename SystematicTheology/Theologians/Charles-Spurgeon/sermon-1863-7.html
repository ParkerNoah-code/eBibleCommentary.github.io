        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.499)</p>
        <p>By the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which
          ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth. Whatsoever
          parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the
          beasts, that shall ye eat.| -- Leviticus 11:2, 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE MOSAIC LAW ATTACHED great importance to meats and drinks: the
          Christian religion attaches none. The apostle Peter was shown by the
          vision of a sheet let down from heaven, not only that all nations were
          now to receive the gospel message, but that all kinds of food were now
          clean, and that all the prohibitions which had formerly been laid upon
          them for legal purposes were now once for all withdrawn. A Christian
          may, if he pleases, put himself under restrictions as to these
          matters. You will remember that the apostle Paul says, |I know and am
          persuaded of the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself,
          but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean, to him it is
          unclean.| I wot our apostle was tender of weak consciences; but he
          could expostulate with the brethren somewhat thus, |If ye be dead with
          Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the
          world, do ye dogmatize -- touch not this, taste not that, handle not
          the other -- and all about things which perish with the using?| The
          doctrine of the New Testament is expressly laid down, |Every creature
          of God is good and nothing to be refused, if it be received with
          thanksgiving.| And as for the practice enjoined upon believers, |All
          things are lawful, but all things are not expedient.| In the example
          of Paul we have full liberty; he would put no embargo upon the
          conscience. But in his example we have also fervent charity; he would
          put no stumbling-block in his brother's way. |If meat make my brother
          to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth.| The
          levitical law enjoined many precepts as to meats and drinks; but those
          carnal ordinances were imposed until the time of reformation. Since
          then, this Mosaic institution was not designed to be perpetual, we
          feel certain that it must have had some use at the time when it was
          first established, and during the time in which it was sustained. As
          that was pecuharly a typical dispensation, we feel persuaded that we
          shall not exaggerate the uses of the text if we show that there was
          something instructive to us and something typical of the better
          covenant in the command that the people were to eat no creatures but
          those which divided the hoof and those which chewed the cud.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. It is our firm belief that these distinctions of meats were laid
          down on purpose TO KEEP THE JEWS AS A DISTINCT PEOPLE, and that herein
          they might be a type of the people of God, who are also, throughout
          all ages, to be a distinct and separate people -- not of the world,
          even as Christ was not of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          You that are conversant with the old Levitical rule, well know that it
          was quite impossible for the Hebrews to mix with any other nation,
          without violating the statutes they were commanded to keep. Their food
          was so restricted that they could not possibly enter into social
          intercourse with any of the neighboring peoples. The Canaanites, for
          instance, ate everything, even the flesh that had been torn by dogs,
          and the dogs themselves. Now, a Jew could never sit at a Canaanites
          table, because he could never be sure that there would not be the
          flesh of some unclean and accursed thing upon it. The Jews could not
          even eat with the Arabs, who were near akin to them, for they
          frequently partook of the flesh of the camels, the hare, and the
          coney, all which, as we shall see presently, were forbidden to the
          Jew. The Arabs on the south, and the Canaanitish nations all round
          Palestine, were the most likely people with whom the Jews would
          associate, and this command about what they should and should not eat
          prevented them for ever from mingling with these people, and made them
          a distinct and isolated republic so long as they were obedient to the
          law. We are told by Eastern travelers that the Mohammedan regulations,
          which are far less strict than those of the Jew, prevent their
          becoming socially intermingled either with the idolaters or with
          Christians. It is a well-known fact that no people that have
          prescriptions about meats and drinks have ever changed their religion
          to that of another people, because the famiharity which seems
          necessary in order to proselyte is quite prevented by the barrier that
          precludes from intercourse at the table. It is at the social table men
          enjoy the most genial intercourse; it is there they pour out their
          souls with the least reserve, and mix their thoughts one with another
          in the greatest freedom of conversation. Check them there; prevent
          their sitting at the same board, and there is no likehhood that they
          will ever blend or intermingle in any kind of affinity, the races must
          be distinct. I believe, dear fiiends, though I have been somewhat
          prosy in explaining myself, that it was God's real intention, to keep
          the children of Israel, until the coming of Christ, separate from all
          the nations that were upon the face of the earth. They could not join
          in the worship of other nations, for other nations sacrificed to their
          gods the very animals which to the Jew were unclean. They could not
          join in social intercourse, as we have already seen; and hence
          marriage with any other nation would be, not only, as it was,
          prohibited by the law, but would be actually prevented by the
          possibilities of the case. It must in each instance put the
          transgressor beyond the pale of his own tribe. They would remain as
          much a distinct people, as if a great wall of brass had been built all
          around them, or as if they had been transported to some island, and an
          impassable gulf had been put between them and any other kindred upon
          earth. They were separated for ever. Now friends, you will say, |What
          is the use of this to us?| I answer, it is the earthly type of a
          heavenly mystery. When the Jews were put away as the people of God for
          a time, then the Gentiles were grafted into their olive, and though we
          did not inherit the ceremonies, we did inherit all the privileges to
          which those ceremonies point. Thus all of you who name the name of
          Christ and are truly what you profess to be, are solemnly bound to be
          for ever separated from the world. Not that you are to leave off your
          daily intercourse with men. Our Savior did not do so. He was holy,
          harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners. Yet, you know, he was
          always in the company of sinners, sitting at their table, seeking
          their good, and hunting after their souls. He was with them, but he
          was never of them; he was among them, but always distinct and separate
          from them; not conforming himself to them, but transforming them to
          himself. He hath set us an example. It is not the seclusion of a
          hermit, nor the exclusion of yourselves in a monastery, where you
          would be of no service to your fellow-men, but it is a higher and more
          spiritual separation which I claim of Christians to-night. You are to
          be in the world, and among the world, you are to mingle with all sorts
          and conditions of men, but still to maintain the dignity of your
          newborn character, and to let men see that you are among them as a
          speckled bird, as a light in the midst of darkness, as salt scattered
          over putridity, as heavenly angels in the midst of fallen men. So are
          ye to be a distinct people, a chosen generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you will ask of me in what respects are you to be distinguished?
          In a pure consistency always, in a vain eccentricity never. This shall
          be my first reply. Not in your garments, my brethren. All those
          inventions of broad-brimmed hats, and coats without collars, perish in
          the using. Let your dress be, nevertheless, so distinguished from that
          of some other men, that there shall be none of the pride and foppery
          in which they delight. The Apostle Peter has well laid down the
          regulations by which our sisters in Christ are to adorn themselves,
          but I need not mention what you know so well and practice so little --
          that chaste and becoming neatness which is always right in the sight
          of God, and beautiful in the assembly of Christians. Not by my pecuhar
          Jargon in your speech are you to be known. For my part I abhor in any
          man that sanctimonious tone and sacred whine which many affect; even
          in the pulpit I despise it. I believe that the reason why the pulpit
          has lost so much of its former power is because men must needs mouth
          our blessed Saxon tongue, and talk as if everything natural were to be
          eschewed there, and men, metamorphosed into ministers, were to be as
          unnatural and grotesque in their modes of speech as possible. No, not
          these, not these; all such artificial separations we leave to the
          people whose vanity feeds on its own conceit. Nor need you make any
          straining effort to be distinguished by any stiff buckram of your own;
          do not try to make yourself look like a Christian. True Christians can
          do a great many things that sham Christians must not do. As for me, I
          am never afraid to laugh, for I shall never crack the paint on my
          face, laugh as I may. A sincere man may do a great many things that a
          hypocrite dare not do, for he will spht the garments of his hypocrisy
          if he ventures to run as a Christian may. Heavenly realities within do
          not always need to be plastered up and labelled outside, so that
          everybody may see and recognize you, and say, |There goes a saint.|
          There are other modes of being distinguished from the world than any
          of these.
        </p>
        <p>
          What are they then? Well, brethren, we ought ever to be distinguished
          from the world in the great object of our life. As for worldly men,
          some of them are seeking wealth, others of them fame; some seek after
          comfort, others after pleasure. Subordinately you may seek after any
          of these, but your main and principal motive as a Christian should
          always be to live for Christ. To live for glory? Yes, but for his
          glory. To live for comfort? Yes, but be all your consolation in him.
          To live for pleasure? Yes, but when you are merry, sing psalms, and
          make melody in your hearts to the Lord. To live for wealth? Yes, but
          to be rich in faith. You may lay up treasure; but lay it up in heaven,
          where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, where thieves break not
          through nor steal. It is thought, you know, that ministers do live for
          God; merchants should do the same. I would, my brethren, that you
          would trade, and do your merchandise for his service; or do ye plough,
          and sow, and reap, and mow, do it for Christ! Would God you could do
          this quite as much in his service, as we do ours, when we preach for
          Christ! You can make the commonest calling become really sacred. You
          may take the highest orders by dedicating your daily life wholly to
          the service of Jesus. There is such a thing -- and let those that deny
          the possibility stand self-convicted that they obey not the precept --
          |Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of
          God.|
        </p>
        <p>
          By your spirit as well as your aim you should likewise be
          distinguished. The spirit of this world is often selfish; it is always
          a spirit that forgets God, that ignores the existence of a Creator in
          his own world, the land which he makes fat by his own bounty. Men with
          God's breath in their nostrils forget him who makes them live. Now,
          your spirit should be one of unselfish devotion, a spirit always
          conscious of his presence, bowed down with the weight, or raised up
          with the cheer of Hagar's exclamation -- |Thou God seeest me;| a
          spirit which watcheth humbly before God, and seeketh to know his will
          and to do it through the grace of God given to you. Such a spirit as
          this, without the drab of one sect, or the phylacteries of another,
          will soon make you quite as distinct from your fellow men as ever
          meats and drinks could make the Jews a separate people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your maxims too, and the rules which regulate you, should be very
          different from those of others. The world says |Well, it is usual in
          the trade; there is no use in being over scrupulous; we must not be
          too Puritanic, or too severe; we shall never get on if we are picking
          at this and frowning at that.| A Christian never considers what is
          usual, but what is right; he does not estimate a wrong by its
          commonness; he counts that a fraud, and a falsehood will be as much
          fraud and falsehood, though all the world shall agree to practice it,
          as though but one man should do it in the dark. The believer reads
          things, not in man's light, in the obscurity of which so many blind
          bats are willing to fly, but he reads things in the sunlight of
          heaven. If a thing be right though he lose by it, it is done; if it be
          wrong, though he should become as rich as Croesus by allowing it, he
          scorns the sin for his Master's sake. We want our merchants on the
          Exchange, our traders in their shops, and our artisans in their
          factories; yea, and we want all masters, employers, and overseers too,
          to be distinguished, as the clean from the unclean, in the maxims that
          govern their daily life, and thus manifestly separate from the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will naturally lead to the next point -- the Christian should be
          separate in his actions. I would not give much for your religion
          unless it can be seen. I know some people's religion is heard of, but
          give me the man whose religion is seen. Lamps do not talk, but shine;
          a lighthouse sounds no drum, it beats no gong, and yet far over the
          waters its friendly spark is seen by the mariner. So let your actions
          shine out your religion. Let your conduct talk out your soul. Let the
          main sermon of your life be illustrated by all your conduct, and it
          shall not fail to be illustrious. Have I not told you before that the
          only bit of ecclesiastical history we have in the whole New Testament
          is -- what? The sermons of the Apostles? No, no, the |Acts of the
          Apostles.| So let your history be written, so that it may have this
          title -- |The acts of such-and-such a man.| This will furnish the best
          proof that you have been with Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Christian is distinguished by his conversation. He will often trim a
          sentence where others would have made it far more luxuriant by a jest
          which was not altogether clean. Following Herbert's advice -- |He
          pares his apple -- he would cleanly feed.| If he would have a jest, he
          picks the mirth but leaves the sin; his conversation is not used to
          levity; it is not mere froth, but it ministereth grace unto the
          hearers. He has learned where the salt-box is kept in God's great
          house, and so his speech is always seasoned with it, so that it may do
          no hurt but much good. Oh! commend me to the man who talks like Jesus,
          who will not for the world suffer corrupt communications to come out
          of his mouth. I know what people will say of you if you are like this:
          they will say you are straight-laced, and that you will not throw much
          life into company. Others will call you mean-spirited. Oh, my
          brethren! bold-hearted men are always called mean-spirited by cowards.
          They will admonish you not to be singular, but you can tell them that
          it is no folly to be singular, when to be singular is to be right. I
          know they will say you deny yourselves a great deal, but you will
          remind them that it is no denial to you. Sheep do not eat carrion, but
          I do not know that sheep think it a hardship to turn away from the
          foul feast. Eagles do not prefer to float on the sea, but I do not
          read that eagles think it a denial when they can soar in higher
          atmosphere. Do not talk of self-denial. You have other ends and other
          aims; you have welds of comfort that such men know not of. It would be
          a shame for you to be eating husks with swine, when your Father's
          table is loaded with dainties. I trust, my dear brethren, that you
          know the value of the gold of heaven too well to pawn it away for the
          counterfeits of earth. |Come ye out from among them; be ye separate,
          and touch not the unclean thing.| By a holiness which merely moral men
          cannot equal, stand as on a pedestal aloft above the world. Thus men
          may know you to be of the seed of Jesus, even as they knew the Jew to
          be the seed of Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          How shall I urge you to give more earnest heed to this holy
          separation? Let me add the voice of warning to that of entreaty. If we
          do not see to this matter we shall bring sorrow on our own souls; we
          shall lose all hope of honoring Christ, and we shall sooner or later
          bring a great disaster on the world. You know the world is always
          trying to nationalize the Church. What a mercy it is that there are
          some who will not have it! If you could once make the Church and the
          nation one, what would follow? It must be destroyed; it must fall. It
          was when the church and the world became one in Noah's day that the
          Lord sent the flood to destroy all people. No, the proper position of
          a Christian is not with the world, even in its best state and its most
          exalted condition. We are to be separated from this present evil world
          according to the will of God. Our position to-day is as much as in
          Christ's day, outside the camp, not in it; we are still to be
          protesters, still to be testifiers against the world. |Ye are of God,
          little children, and the whole world lieth in the wicked one.|
          Scripture never supposes that the world will get better till the
          coming of Christ. It does not propose to lift the world up and marry
          it with the Church. It always supposes the Church to be as an alien
          and a stranger here until Christ, her husband shall come. On which
          side will you rank? Truce there cannot be, links between the two there
          must not be. God and mammon cannot go together. For which will you be
          -- for God -- for truth -- for right? Or for Satan -- for the he --
          for the wrong? Which shall it be? May the Spirit of God whisper in
          your heart to-night, and say, |Believe thou in Christ Jesus; take up
          thy cross and follow him, and be enlisted on his side henceforth and
          for ever.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We have now a second and an important matter to bring forward. The
          distinction drawn between clean and unclean animals was, we think,
          intended by God TO KEEP HIS PEOPLE ALWAYS CONSCIOUS THAT THEY WERE IN
          THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF SIN.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just let me picture it. I have caught the idea from Mr. Bonar, though
          I fear I cannot paint it in words so well as he has done. An oriental
          Jew, sensible and intelligent, walks out in the fields. He walks along
          close by the side of the high-road, and what should he see but a
          string of camels going along? |Ah!| he says to himself |those are
          unclean animals.| Sin, you see, is brought at once before his mind's
          eye. He turns away from the road and walks down one of his own fields,
          and as he goes along a hare starts across his path. |Ah!| says he, |an
          unclean animal again; there is sin in my path.| He gets into a more
          retired place, he walks on the mountains; surely he shall be alone
          there. But he sees a coney burrowing among the rocks; |Ah!| says he,
          |unclean; there is sin there!| He lifts his eye up to heaven; he sees
          the osprey, the bald eagle, flying along through the air, and he says,
          |Ah! there is an emblem of sin there!| A dragon-fly has just flitted
          by him -- there is sin there. There are insects among the flowers; now
          every creeping thing, and every insect, except the locust, was unclean
          to the Jew. Everywhere he would come in contact with some creature
          that would render him ceremonially unclean, and it were impossible for
          him, unless he were brutish, to remain even for ten minutes abroad
          without being reminded that this world, however beautiful it is, still
          has sin in it. Even the fish, in sea, or river, or inland lake, had
          their divisions; those that had no scales or fins were unclean to the
          Jew, so the little Hebrew boys could not even fish for minnows in the
          brook but they would know that the minnow was unclean, and so their
          young hearts were made to dread little wrongs and little sins, for
          there were little sins in the little pools even as there were
          leviathan sins floating in the deep and nude sea. Ah! friends, we want
          to have this more before our minds. Look at the fairest landscape that
          your eye has ever beheld; see the towering Alp, the green valley, and
          the silver stream
        </p>
        <p>|These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,</p>
        <p>Almighty,|</p>
        <p>but the slime of the serpent is on them all,</p>
        <p>|Keep me, O, keep me King of kings,</p>
        <p>Beneath the shadow of thy wings.|</p>
        <p>
          When I walk abroad in this temple of nature, and seek to behold
          nature's God, I may not light upon a spot in the universe where the
          curse of sin has never inflicted a blight, or where the hope of
          redemption should not inspire a prayer. Sometimes, brethren you get
          all alone and quiet, but do not imagine that you are even there free
          from sin. As the most beautiful landscape, so the sweetest retirement
          cannot shut out uncleanness. As the fly or the insect would intrude
          into the arbour where the Jew would worship, so sin will haunt and
          molest us even in the closet of devotion. Get up Christians, and be
          upon your watch-towers. You may sleep, but your enemies never will;
          you may suppose yourselves safe, but then are you most in danger. See
          that you put on the whole panoply of God, and are armed from head to
          foot, and having done all, watch and pray lest ye enter into
          temptation. Every morning we ought to ask the Lord to keep us from
          unknown sins, to preserve us from temptations that we cannot foresee,
          to check us in every part of life if we are about to go wrong, and to
          hold us up every hour that we sin not. You will say it must have been
          an unpleasant thing for the Jew always to have sin before his eye, nor
          would you wish every aspect of life to be thus fouled before your eye;
          but it will not be so unpleasant for you, my brother, because you know
          there is a redemption, and your faith can realize the end of the curse
          by sin being put away. Shut not your eyes to sin, but keep Christ
          always before you, and you will walk aright. I wish that some of my
          hearers had sin before their eyes now. Oh! you that trifle with it,
          you do not know what it is! Fools make a mock of sin. You laugh at it
          now; you do not understand what a fire it is that you have kindled to
          consume your soul! Oh! you that think it is such a little thing, its
          deadly poison will soon envenom all your blood, and then you will
          discover that he that plays with sin plays with damnation. May the
          Lord set sin straight before your eyes, and then set the cross of
          Christ there too, and so you will be saved. Two prayers I ask all my
          hearers to pray -- they are very brief -- |Lord show me myself.| If
          there is any man here who says he would pray but he does not know what
          to pray, for; pray that every night and morning -- |Lord show me
          myself;| and if God hear you, you will soon be in such a wretched
          state that you will want another prayer, and then I give you this --
          |Lord show me thyself;| and then if he shall show you himself hanging
          on the tree, the expiation for guilt, the Great God become man that he
          might put away sin, your salvation will be accomplished. Tis all the
          prayer that is wanted -- |Lord show me myself; Lord show me thyself;
          reveal sin and reveal a Savior.| Lord, do this for all of us for thy
          name's sake.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, I come to show you a third teaching of my text. As this
          injunction was meant to separate the Jews from other nations, and to
          keep the pious Israelite in constant remembrance of his danger of
          falling into sin, so it was also intended to be A RULE OF
          DISCRIMINATION BY WHICH WE MAY JUDGE WHO ARE CLEAN AND WHO ARE
          UNCLEAN, THAT IS, WHO ARE SAINTS AND WHO ARE NOT.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two tests, but they must both be united. The beast that was
          clean was to chew the cud: here is the inner-life; every truehearted
          man must know how to read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest the sacred
          Word. The man who does not feed upon Gospel truth, and so feed upon
          it, too, that he knows the sweetness and relish of it, and seeks out
          its marrow and fatness, that man is no heir of heaven. You must know a
          Christian by his inwards, by that which supports his life and sustains
          his frame. But then the clean creatures were also known by their walk.
          The Jew at once discovered the unclean animal by its having an
          undivided hoof; but if the hoof was thoroughly divided, then it was
          clean, provided that it also chewed the cud. So there must be in the
          true Christian a pecuhar walk such as God requires. You cannot tell a
          man by either of these tests alone; you must have them both. But while
          you use them upon others apply them to yourselves. What do you feed
          on? What is your habit of life? Do you chew the cud by meditation?
          When your soul feeds on the flesh and blood of Christ have you learned
          that his flesh is meat indeed, and that his blood is drink indeed? If
          so tis well. What about your life? Are your conversation and your
          daily walk according to the description which is given in the Word of
          believers in Christ? If not, the first test will not stand alone. You
          may profess the faith within, but if you do not walk aright without,
          you belong to the unclean. On the other hand, you may walk aright
          without but unless there is the chewing of the cud within, unless
          there is a real feeding upon precious truth in the heart, all the
          right walking in the world will not prove you to be a Christian. That
          holiness which is only outward in moral not spiritual; it does not
          save the soul. That religion, on the other hand, which is only inward
          is but fancy; it cannot save the soul either. But the two together;
          the inward parts made capable of knowing the lusciousness, the
          sweetness, the fatness of Christ's truth; and the outward parts
          conformed to Christ's image and character: these conjoined point out
          the true and clean Christian with whom it is blessed to associate
          here, and for whom a better portion is prepared hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you read the chapter through you will find there were some two or
          three animals about which the Jew would have some little difficulty.
          There was the camel that did chew the cud, but did not exactly divide
          the hoof. Now this animal seems to me fitly to represent -- though it
          may not have been so intended -- those men who seem really to feed on
          the truth and yet their walk and conversation are not aright. Their
          feet have been formed rather for the sandy desert of sin than for the
          sacred soil of godliness. Oh! I know some of you -- come, let us be
          personal -- there are some of you if I would always preach the
          doctrine of predestination, or some other doctrine of that kind, how
          sweet it would be to you! But your lives are not what they should be.
          Thank God there are not many of that sort who come here. They get
          angry with me very soon, and go off to other places where they can get
          sweet and savoury morsels, which exactly suit their taste, and hear no
          admonitions about their lives whatever. May the Lord deliver my
          ministry from ever being comfortable and flattering to souls that live
          in sin. I hope you will sometimes have to say, |I must either give up
          that sin or else give up my seat there.| I know one who said, |Well!
          it has come to this: I cannot go there on Sunday evening and keep my
          shop open in the morning; it will not do for me to go and sit there,
          and hear the Word, and sing with those people on Sunday evening, and
          then hear songs and join in revelries on week-nights.| I hope the Word
          of God here will be such a searching Word to some of you that you will
          even gnash your teeth at the preacher. He would sooner for you to do
          that than for you to say; |Peace, peace, where there is no peace,|
          sucking in sweet doctrine, and yet living in sin. God deliver us from
          Antinomianism! We do preach against Arminianism, but that is a white
          devil compared with the black devil of Antinomianism. God save us from
          that! If there is any religion that will drug conscience, stimulate
          crime, crowd jails, and turn this world into an Aceldema, it is the
          religion of the man who preaches divine sovereignty but neglects human
          responsibility. I believe it is a vicious, immoral, and corrupt manner
          of setting forth doctrine, and cannot be of God. It would undermine
          morality, and put the very life of society in peril if it were largely
          believed, or if it were preached by men of any great weight who should
          have any great numbers to follow them. Oh, dear friends! be not as the
          animal which cheweth the cud but yet divideth not the hoof. Seek not
          merely to get precious doctrine, comforting to yourselves, but see
          that your walk is such as it should be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there was another animal. It did not chew the cud, still the Jews
          thought it did. This was the coney -- the nearest approach to it is
          the rabbit of our land -- |The coney, because he cheweth the cud but
          divideth not the hoof; he is unclean.| The coney was a very timid
          creature, which burrowed in the rocks. |The coneys be a feeble folk,
          but they make their dwellings in the rocks,| says Solomon. Now, there
          are some people who seem as if they like the gospel truth, and they
          may be put down in the class in which Moses puts the coney, which
          appeared to chew the cud, though it did not really do so. There are
          hundreds of this sort we know. They like the gospel, but it must be
          very cheap. They like to hear it preached, but as to doing anything to
          extend it, unless it were to lend their tongues an hour, they would
          not dream of it. The coney, you know, lived in the earth. These people
          are always scraping. John Bunyan's muck-rake is always in their hands.
          Neither to dig nor to beg are they ashamed. They are as true misers,
          and as coyetous, as if they had no religion at all. And many of these
          people get into our Churches, and are received when thee ought not to
          be. Coyetousness ought to exclude a man from Church fellowship as well
          as fornication, for Paul says, |Coyetousness, which is idolatry.| He
          puts the brand right on its forehead, and marks what it is. We would
          not admit an idolater to the Lord's table; nor ought we to admit a
          coyetous man; only we cannot always know him. St. Francis Sales, who
          had a great many people come to him to confession, makes this note,
          that he had many men and women come to him who confessed all sorts of
          most outrageous crimes, but he never had one who confessed
          coyetousness. It is a kind of sin that always comes in at the
          back-door, and it is always entertained at the back-part of the house.
          People do not suspect it as an inmate of their own hearts. Mr.
          Coyetousness has changed his name to Mr. Prudent-Thrifty; and it is
          quite an insult to call him other than by his adopted name. Old vices,
          like streets notorious for vice, get new names given them. Avaricious
          grasping, they call that only |the laws of social economy;| screwing
          down the poor is |the natural result of competition;| withholding corn
          until the people curse oh! that is |just the usual regulation of the
          market.| People name the thing prettily, and then they think they have
          rescued it from the taint. These people, who are all for earth, are
          like the coneys, who, though they chew the cud, burrow in the ground.
          They love precious truth, and yet they are all for this earth. If
          there are any such here, despite their fine experience, we pronounce
          them unclean -- they are not heirs of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next creature mentioned in the chapter is the hare -- |The hare,
          because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean.|
          See how he fhes with bounding step over the ground! A clapping of the
          hands, and how he starts and is away! The hare is such a timid
          creature; she leayeth her food, and fleeth before the passer-by. I
          would not say a hard thing, but there are some people who appear to
          chew the cud, they love to hear the gospel preached; their eyes will
          sparkle sometimes when we are talking of Christ, but they do not
          divide the hoof: Like the hare, they are too timid to be domesticated
          among the creatures whom the Lord has pronounced clean. They do not
          come out from the world, enter into the Church, and manifest
          themselves wholly on the Lord's side. Their conscience tells them they
          should baptized as believers -- but they dare not; they should be
          united with the people of God, and confess Christ before men -- but
          they are ashamed, ashamed, ashamed! One fears lest his wife should
          know it, and she might ridicule. Some start abashed lest their friends
          should know it, for the finger of scorn or the breath of raillery
          could frighten them out of their senses. Others of them are alarmed
          because the world might, perchance, give them an ill name. Do you know
          where the fearful go? Not the fearing, not the doubting -- for there
          are many poor, humble doubters and fearers that are saved -- but do
          you know where the fearful go? The fearful that are afraid of being
          persecuted, mocked, or even laughed at for Christ -- do you know where
          they go? You will find it in the Book of the Revelation -- |But the
          fearful and unbelieving shall have their part in the lake which
          burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.| Have you
          never read that sentence which says, |Whosoever shall be ashamed of me
          and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed when he shall
          come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels?|
          There you are, young men! you are ashamed of Christ. You have just
          come up from the country, and you did not pray to God the other night
          because there was another young man in the room, and you were ashamed
          of him! In the name of God I do entreat you, nay, I command you, be
          not ashamed of your Master, Christ, and of the religion which you
          learned at your father's knee. There are others of you who work in a
          large shop, and you do not want to be jeered at, as the other young
          fellow is who works with you, because he is a Christian. You keep your
          love as a secret do you, and will not let it out? What! if Christ had
          only loved you in secret, and had never dared to come here on earth to
          be despised and rejected of men, where would you have been? |No man
          lighteth a candle and putteth it under a bushel.| Do you think that
          Christ has lit a candle in your hearts that you may hide it? Oh! I
          pray you, be not like the hare. Let your hoof be so divided from the
          rest of mankind that they may say, |There is a man -- he is not as
          bold as a hon, mayhap, but he is not ashamed to be a follower of
          Jesus; he does bear the sneer and gibe for him, and counts it his
          honor to be thought evil of for Jesus' sake.| Oh! be not, I pray you,
          like the timid hare, lest you be found among the unclean!
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one other creature mentioned -- |The swine, though he divide
          the hoof, and be cloven-footed, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is
          unclean to you.| Now, the swine is the emblem of those who do act
          rightly. They make a profession; before men they are the most upright
          and the most devout; but then the inner part is not right; they do not
          chew the cud. The foot is right, but not the inward part. There is no
          chewing, no masticating, no digesting the Word of Life. |But,| says
          one, |why pick out a swine, because that does not seem to be a fair
          comparison.| Yes it is, for there are no people in the world more like
          swine than those Pharisees who make clean the outside of the cup and
          the platter; whose hoof is divided enough, but whose inward part is
          very wickedness. I do not know an animal that might more filly picture
          out those vile, unclean Pharisees. You may say you think it is too
          hard a picture for you. You are put down thus in the catalogue, and I
          have no other place in which to put you. You are like swine, unless
          the grace of God be in you. What good does the swine do? Of what
          concern is life to him but to feed grossly and slumber heavily? And so
          your life, since the inward part is wrong, you bring no glory to God,
          you bring no good to your fellow-men. Oh! that the Lord would show you
          that dead morality, unattended by the love of God in the soul, will
          most certainly be of no avail! |You must be born again.| |Except ye be
          converted, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter
          into the kingdom of heaven.|
        </p>
        <p>
          My text seems to be a dividing one; it divides the house in two.
          Remember, dear friends, the day is coming when a greater division than
          that which description can give will occur to all of us. But the same
          rule will be enforced. We shall be assembled in one crowd, a mightier
          crowd than language can picture, or imagination grasp. The books shall
          be opened -- books more terrible than this Book of Mercy. The Book of
          Life shall be unfolded and read, in which those washed in Jesu's
          blood, and so made clean, shall find their names recorded. They are
          borne to heaven. Listen to the music of the angels as they bear them
          up to God's right hand! Where will you be? Will you be with those who
          mount to heaven, or with yonder trembling, shrieking, screaming souls,
          who, as hell opens her mouth, descend alive into the pit? God help you
          if you are not on the righthand side! It is not too late. Jesus Christ
          is still preached to you. The way of salvation is very plain. It is
          this -- Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.
          Believe thou in Jesus. Then make a profession of thy faith in God's
          own ordained way and method, and you have his promise for it that you
          will be saved. God help you to believe, and you shall be saved through
          Jesus, and unto him shall be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
