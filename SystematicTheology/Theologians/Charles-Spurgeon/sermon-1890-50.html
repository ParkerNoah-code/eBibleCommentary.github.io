          Give heed to this ministry which ye hold, and with fear and trembling
          continue ye in it, and minister every day. Minister ye not in it with
          neglectful habits, but with the discreetness of faith. And let not the
          praises of Christ cease out of your mouth, and let not any sense of
          weariness come over you at the season of prayers. Give heed to the
          verity which ye hold, and to the teaching of the truth which ye have
          received, and to the teaching of salvation which I commit to you.
          Because before the tribunal of Christ will it be required of you, when
          He maketh reckoning with the pastors and overseers, and when He shall
          take His money from the traders with the usury of what they have
          taught. For He is the Son of a King, and goeth to receive a kingdom,
          and He will return and come and make a resuscitation to life of all
          men.<br />
