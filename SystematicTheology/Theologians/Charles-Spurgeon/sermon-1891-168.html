          1. In the previous books I have set forth the causes for which God
          permitted these things to be made, and have pointed out that all such
          have been created for the benefit of that human nature which is saved,
          ripening for immortality that which is [possessed] of its own free
          will and its own power, and preparing and rendering it more adapted
          for eternal subjection to God. And therefore the creation is suited to
          [the wants of] man; for man was not made for its sake, but creation
          for the sake of man. Those nations however, who did not of themselves
          raise up their eyes unto heaven, nor returned thanks to their Maker,
          nor wished to behold the light of truth, but who were like blind mice
          concealed in the depths of ignorance, the word justly reckons |as
          waste water from a sink, and as the turning-weight of a balance -- in
          fact, as nothing;| so far useful and serviceable to the just, as
          stubble conduces towards the growth of the wheat, and its straw, by
          means of combustion, serves for working gold. And therefore, when in
          the end the Church shall be suddenly caught up from this, it is said,
          |There shall be tribulation such as has not been since the beginning,
          neither shall be.| For this is the last contest of the righteous, in
          which, when they overcome they are crowned with incorruption.

          2. And there is therefore in this beast, when he comes, a
          recapitulation made of all sorts of iniquity and of every deceit, in
          order that all apostate power, flowing into and being shut up in him,
          may be sent into the furnace of fire. Fittingly, therefore, shall his
          name possess the number six hundred and sixty-six, since he sums up in
          his own person all the commixture of wickedness which took place
          previous to the deluge, due to the apostasy of the angels. For Noah
          was six hundred years old when the deluge came upon the earth,
          sweeping away the rebellious world, for the sake of that most infamous
          generation which lived in the times of Noah. And [Antichrist] also
          sums up every error of devised idols since the flood, together with
          the slaying of the prophets and the cutting off of the just. For that
          image which was set up by Nebuchadnezzar had indeed a height of sixty
          cubits, while the breadth was six cubits; on account of which Ananias,
          Azarias, and MisaÃ«l, when they did not worship it, were cast into a
          furnace of fire, pointing out prophetically, by what happened to them,
          the wrath against the righteous which shall arise towards the [time of
          the] end. For that image, taken as a whole, was a prefiguring of this
          man's coming, decreeing that he should undoubtedly himself alone be
          worshipped by all men. Thus, then, the six hundred years of Noah, in
          whose time the deluge occurred because of the apostasy, and the number
          of the cubits of the image for which these just men were sent into the
          fiery furnace, do indicate the number of the name of that man in whom
          is concentrated the whole apostasy of six thousand years, and
          unrighteousness, and wickedness, and false prophecy, and deception;
          for which things' sake a cataclysm of fire shall also come [upon the
          earth].<br />
