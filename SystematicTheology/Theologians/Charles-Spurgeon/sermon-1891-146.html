          1. In the same manner, therefore, as Christ did rise in the substance
          of flesh, and pointed out to His disciples the mark of the nails and
          the opening in His side (now these are the tokens of that flesh which
          rose from the dead), so "shall He also," it is said, "raise us up by
          His own power." And again to the Romans he says, "But if the Spirit of
          Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up
          Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies." What,
          then, are mortal bodies? Can they be souls? Nay, for souls are
          incorporeal when put in comparison with mortal bodies; for God
          "breathed into the face of man the breath of life, and man became a
          living soul." Now the breath of life is an incorporeal thing. And
          certainly they cannot maintain that the very breath of life is mortal.
          Therefore David says, "My soul also shall live to Him," just as if its
          substance were immortal. Neither, on the other hand, can they say that
          the spirit is the mortal body. What therefore is there left to which
          we may apply the term "mortal body," unless it be the thing that was
          moulded, that is, the flesh, of which it is also said that God will
          vivify it? For this it is which dies and is decomposed, but not the
          soul or the spirit. For to die is to lose vital power, and to become
          henceforth breathless, inanimate, and devoid of motion, and to melt
          away into those [component parts] from which also it derived the
          commencement of [its] substance. But this event happens neither to the
          soul, for it is the breath of life; nor to the spirit, for the spirit
          is simple and not composite, so that it cannot be decomposed, and is
          itself the life of those who receive it. We must therefore conclude
          that it is in reference to the flesh that death is mentioned; which
          [flesh], after the soul's departure, becomes breathless and inanimate,
          and is decomposed gradually into the earth from which it was taken.
          This, then, is what is mortal. And it is this of which he also says,
          "He shall also quicken your mortal bodies." And therefore in reference
          to it he says, in the first [Epistle] to the Corinthians: "So also is
          the resurrection of the dead: it is sown in corruption, it rises in
          incorruption." For he declares, "That which thou sowest cannot be
          quickened, unless first it die."

          2. But what is that which, like a grain of wheat, is sown in the earth
          and decays, unless it be the bodies which are laid in the earth, into
          which seeds are also cast? And for this reason he said, "It is sown in
          dishonour, it rises in glory." For what is more ignoble than dead
          flesh? Or, on the other hand, what is more glorious than the same when
          it arises and partakes of incorruption? "It is sown in weakness, it is
          raised in power:" in its own weakness certainly, because since it is
          earth it goes to earth; but [it is quickened] by the power of God, who
          raises it from the dead. "It is sown an animal body, it rises a
          spiritual body." He has taught, beyond all doubt, that such language
          was not used by him, either with reference to the soul or to the
          spirit, but to bodies that have become corpses. For these are animal
          bodies, that is, [bodies] which partake of life, which when they have
          lost, they succumb to death; then, rising through the Spirit's
          instrumentality, they become spiritual bodies, so that by the Spirit
          they possess a perpetual life. "For now," he says, "we know in part,
          and we prophesy in part, but then face to face." And this it is which
          has been said also by Peter: "Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom
          now also, not seeing, ye believe; and believing, ye shall rejoice with
          joy unspeakable." For our face shall see the face of the Lord and
          shall rejoice with joy unspeakable, -- that is to say, when it shall
          behold its own Delight.<br />
