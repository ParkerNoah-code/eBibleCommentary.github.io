        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.149)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, August 31, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of
          Hosts." -- Zechariah 4:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          GOD'S first and greatest object is his own glory. There was a time,
          before all time, when there was no day but the Ancient of days, when
          God dwelt alone in the magnificence of his sublime solitude. Whether
          he should create, or not create was a question depending upon the
          answer to another question -- Would it be to his honor or not? He
          determined that he would glorify himself by creating; but, in
          creating, beyond all doubt, his motive was his glory. And since that
          time, he hath ever ruled the earth, and even blessed it with the same
          object in his infinite mind -- his own glory and honor. Lesser motive
          for God to have, were less than divine; it is the highest position to
          which you or I could attain, to live for God; and the very highest
          virtue of God is for him to magnify himself in all his greatness as
          the Infinite and the Eternal. Whatever, then, God permits or does, he
          doeth with this one motive, his own glory. And even salvation, costly
          though it was, and infinitely a benefaction to us, had for its first
          object, and for its grand result, the exaltation of the Being and of
          the attributes of the Supreme Ruler.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as this is true in the general of the great acts of God, this is
          equally true in the minutiae of them. It is true that God has a
          church, that that church has been redeemed and will be preserved for
          his glory, and it is equally true that everything that is done to the
          church, in the church, or for the church either with the permission or
          by the power of God, is for God's glory, as well as for the church's
          weal. You will notice, in reading Scripture, that whenever God has
          blessed the church, he has secured himself the glory of the blessing,
          though they have had the profit of it. Sometimes he has been pleased
          to redeem his people by might but then he has so used the might and
          power that all the glory hath come to him, and his head alone hath
          worn the crown. Did he smite Egypt, and lead forth his people, with a
          strong hand and outstretched arm? The glory was not to the rod of
          Moses, but to the Almighty power which made the rod so potent. Did he
          lead his people through the wilderness, and defend them from their
          enemies? Still, did he, by teaching the people their dependence upon
          him, preserve to himself all the glory? So that not Moses or Aaron
          amongst the priests or prophets could share the honor with him. And
          tell me, if ye will, of slaughtered Anak, and the destruction of the
          tribes of Canaan; tell me of Israel's possessing the promised land;
          tell me of Philistines routed, and laid heaps on heaps; of Midianites
          made to fall on each other; tell me of kings and princes who fled
          apace and fell, until the ground was white, like the snow in Salmon. I
          will say of everyone of these triumphs, "Sing ye to the Lord, for he
          hath triumphed gloriously;" and I will say at the end of every
          victory, "Crown him, crown him, for he hath done it; and let his name
          be exalted and extolled, world without end." Sometimes, however, God
          chooseth not to employ the agency of power. If he chooses to save, by
          might and by power, it is that glory may be unto him; and when he
          says, "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord,"
          it is still with the same object, and the same desire, that we may be
          led --
        </p>
        <p>"To give to the King of kings renown,</p>
        <p>The Lord of Lords with glory crown,"</p>
        <p>
          God is jealous of his own honor; he will not suffer even his church to
          be delivered in such a way as to honor men more than God; he will take
          to himself the throne without a rival he will wear a crown that never
          head did wear, and sway a scepter that never head hath grasped, for as
          truly as he is God, the earth shall know that he, and he alone, hath
          done it, and unto him shall be the glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my objects this morning will be to glorify God, by showing to
          you, who love the Saviour, that the preservation and the triumph of
          the church are both of them to be accomplished, not by might, nor by
          power, but by the Spirit of God, in order that all the honor might be
          to God, and none of it to man. I shall divide my text very simply; it
          divides itself. First, not by might; secondly, nor by power; thirdly,
          but by my Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will ask me whether there is any distinction to be drawn between
          these two words, "NOT BY MIGHT, NOR BY POWER." I answer, yes. The best
          Hebrew scholars tell us that the "might," in the first place, may be
          translated, "army." The Septuagint does so translate it. It signifies
          power collectedly -- the power of a number of men combined together.
          The second word, "power," signifies the prowess of a single
          individual, so that I might paraphrase my text thus -- "Not by the
          combined might of men laboring to assist each other, nor by the
          separate might of any single hero, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord."
          And now you will see the distinction, which is not without a
          difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin then, the preservation and the triumph of the church cannot
          be accomplished BY MIGHT -- that is, not by might collectedly.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, let us consider that collected might to represent human armies.
          The church, we affirm, can neither be preserved nor can its interests
          be promoted by human armies. We have all thought otherwise in our
          time, and have foolishly said when a fresh territory was annexed to
          our empire, "Ah! what a providence that England has annexed Oude," --
          or taken to itself some other territory -- "Now a door is opened for
          the Gospel. A Christian power will necessarily encourage Christianity,
          and seeing that a Christian power is at the head of the Government, it
          will be likely that the natives will be induced to search into the
          authenticity of our revelation, and so great results will follow. Who
          can tell but that, at the point of the British bayonet, the Gospel
          will be carried, and that, by the edge of the true sword of valiant
          men, Christ's Gospel will be proclaimed?" I have said so myself; and
          now I know I am a fool for my pains, and that Christ's church hath
          been also miserably befooled; for this I will assert, and prove too,
          that the progress of the arms of a Christian nation is not the
          progress of Christianity, and that the spread of our empire, so far
          from being advantageous to the Gospel, I will hold, and this day
          proclaim, hath been hostile to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will just confine our attention for a moment or two to India. I
          believe that British rule there, has been useful in many ways. I shall
          not deny the civilizing influence of European society; or that great
          things have been done for humanity; but I do assert, and can prove it,
          that there would have been greater probability of the Gospel spreading
          in India if it had been let alone, than there has been ever since the
          domination of Great Britain. Ye thought that when Christians, as ye
          called them, had the land, they would favor religion. Now I will state
          a fact which ought to go through the length and breadth of the land;
          it does not rest on hearsay, I was informed of it a little while ago
          by a clergyman, upon whose memory the fact is vividly impressed. A
          Sepoy in a certain regiment was converted to God by a missionary. He
          proposed to be baptized, and become a Christian. Mark, not a Christian
          after our way and fashion, as a Baptist, or an Independent or a
          Methodist; but a Christian according to the fashion of the
          Episcopalian church established in this realm. He was seen by the
          chaplain, and was received as a Christian. What think you became of
          that Sepoy? Let the East India Company blush for ever, he was stripped
          of his regimentals, dismissed the service and sent home, because he
          had become a Christian! Ah! we dreamed that if the; had the power they
          would help us. Alas! the policy of greed cannot easily be made to
          assist the Kingdom of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I have another string to my bow, I believe that the help of
          Government would have been far worse than its opposition, I do regret
          that the Company sometimes discourages missionary enterprise; but I
          believe that, had they encouraged it, it would have been far worse
          still, for their encouragement would have been the greatest hindrance
          we could receive. If I had to-morrow to go to India to preach the
          Gospel, I should pray to God, if such a thing could be, that he would
          give me a black face and make me like a Hindoo; for otherwise I should
          feel that when I preached I should be regarded as one of the lords --
          one of the oppressors it may sometime be added -- and I should not
          expect my congregation to listen to me as a man speaking to men, a
          brother to brother, a Christian full of love, but they would hear me,
          and only cavil at me, because even my white face would give me some
          appearance of superiority. Why in England, our missionaries and our
          clergymen have assumed a kind of superiority and dignity over the
          people; they have called themselves clergy, and the people laity; and
          the result has been that they have weakened their influence. I have
          thought it right to come amongst my fellow men, and be a man amongst
          men, just one of themselves, their equal and their friend; and they
          have rallied around me, and not refused to love me. And I should not
          expect to be successful in preaching the gospel, unless I might stand
          and feel that I am a brother, bone of their bone, and flesh of their
          flesh. If I cannot stand before them thus, I cannot get at their
          hearts. Send me, then, to India as one of the dominant ruling race,
          and you give me a work I cannot accomplish when you tell me to
          evangelise its inhabitants. In that day when John Williams fell in
          Erromanga, ye wept, but it was a more hopeful day for Erromanga than
          the day when our missionaries in India first landed there. I had
          rather go to preach to the greatest savages that live, than I would go
          to preach in the place that is under British rule. Not for the fault
          of Britain, but simply because I, as a Briton, would be looked upon as
          one of the superiors, one of the lords, and that would take away much
          of my power to do good. Now, will you just cast your eye upon the wide
          world? Did you ever hear of a nation under British rule being
          converted to God? Mr. Moffat and our great friend Dr. Livingstone have
          been laboring in Africa with great success, and many have been
          converted. Did you ever hear of Kaffir tribes protected by England,
          ever being converted? It is only a people that have been left to
          themselves, and preached to by men as men, that have been brought to
          God. For my part, I conceive, that when an enterprise begins in
          martyrdom, it is none the less likely to succeed, but when conquerors
          begin to preach the gospel to those they have conquered, it will not
          succeed, God will teach us that it is not by might All swords that
          have ever flashed from scabbards have not aided Christ a single grain.
          Mahommedans' religion might be sustained by scimitars, but Christians'
          religion must be sustained by love. The great crime of war can never
          promote the religion of peace. The battle, and the garment rolled in
          blood, are not a fitting prelude to "peace on earth, goodwill to men."
          And I do firmly hold, that the slaughter of men, that bayonets, and
          swords, and guns, have never yet been, and never can be, promoters of
          the gospel. The gospel will proceed without them, but never through
          them. "Not by might." Now don't be be fooled again, if you hear of the
          English conquering in China, don't go down on your knees and thank God
          for it, and say it's such a heavenly thing for the spread of the
          gospel -- it just is not. Experience teaches you that, and if you look
          upon the map you will find I have stated only the truth, that where
          our arms have been victorious, the gospel has been hindered rather
          than not; so that where South Sea Islanders have bowed their knees and
          cast their idols to the bats, British Hindoos have kept their idols,
          and where Bechuanas and Bushmen have turned unto the Lord, British
          Affairs have not been converted, not perhaps because they were
          British, but because the very fact of the missionary being a Briton,
          put him above them, and weakened their influence. Hush thy trump, O
          war; put away thy gaudy trappings and thy bloodstained drapery, if
          thou thinkest that the cannon with the cross upon it is really
          sanctified, and if thou imaginest that thy banner hath become holy,
          thou dreamest of a lie. God wanteth not thee to help his cause. "It is
          not by armies, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, understanding this word "might," in another sense, to signify
          great corporations, or, as we say, denominations of men. Now-a-days,
          people get a queer notion in their head, and they form what they call
          a denomination. It is all wrong; there never ought to have been any
          denominations at all, for according to Scripture, every church is
          independent of every other. There ought to have been as many separate
          churches as there were separate opinions; but denominations, which are
          the gathering up of those churches, I take it, ought not to have
          existed at all. They may do some good, but they do a world of
          mischief. Now, when first denomination starts it is very much opposed.
          Take, for instance, Methodism; how earnest were its first preachers,
          how indefatigably did they toil, and how incessantly were they
          persecuted; yet what a harvest of souls God gave to them! What a great
          blessing was showered from the cloud that first started at Oxford,
          with those few young men preaching the everlasting gospel! Methodism
          goes on till it grows to be a most respectable kind of society, its
          ramifications extend all over England and it has societies in every
          country -- and now -- God forbid I should say anything against
          Methodism; let those who like it believe it; I do not like it -- but I
          do say now, when they have come to the greatest is the time when they
          are doing the least. They will confess that the ancient power of
          Methodism has to a great degree failed. That power which once seemed
          to turn the world upside down, and set the whole of the churches on
          fire with a divine light and life, is to a great degree quenched. Wars
          and rumors of wars are in their camp; till, what with new connections
          and old connections, reformed and conferential, and an infinite
          quantity of names, one does not know into how many fraternities they
          intend to divide themselves. The fact is, that just when the
          corporation began to be the greatest, God said, "Now then, you have
          done your work, to a great degree, it shall not be by you any longer;
          not by might, not by your allied forces. You have said our efforts
          will cover the earth with the gospel." "Now," says God, "I will
          diminish you by thousands, I will take off your roll year by year, as
          many as would make another denomination strong; and though you shall
          still exist, you shall have to weep and repent with bitterness,
          because of your departed zeal." It is just the same with every other
          denomination. When we Baptists were reckoned to be the poorest lot in
          the world, and everybody sneered at us, we did far more good than we
          do now. There was far more pure doctrine, and far better preaching
          than there is at the present time. But we began to be respectable --
          and just as we began to be respectable we began to lose our power.
          Every fresh Gothic Baptist chapel was a diminution of simplicity; and
          every fresh place where the minister become intellectual, as it was
          called, was just a loss of evangelical might, till now, as a
          denomination, we are just as low as any other: and we need some of our
          old leaders again, just to preach the word with demonstration and with
          power, and to overthrow all those grand conventionalisms which have
          tried to make the Baptist denomination respectable. I pray to God I
          may never be called to preach to a much applauded congregation; it
          would be a sad and evil day. To be despised, to be spit upon, to be
          caricatured, and to be jeered, is the highest honor that a Christian
          minister can have; and to be pampered, flattered, and applauded by
          men, is a poor, base thing, that is not worth having. If any come here
          and say "They are not a respectable sort;" we reply, "we labor to
          preach to the poor." But mark this, whenever a great denomination
          begins to get too great, God will cut away its horns, and take away
          its glory, till the world shall say, "It is not by might nor by
          power."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, I shall give one more application of the word "might." It is
          so with one particular church, just as I have been observing. I
          tremble for the church of which I am the pastor. I never trembled for
          it when we were few, when we were earnest in prayer, and devout in
          supplication, when it was a thing of contempt to go into "that
          miserable Baptist Chapel in Park Street," when we were despised and
          maligned and slandered. I never trembled for them then; God was
          blessing the ministry, souls were saved, and we walked together in the
          fear of the Lord and in love. But I tremble for it now, now that God
          hath enlarged our borders, and given us to count our members not by
          tens but by hundreds, now that we can say we are the largest Baptist
          church in England. I do tremble now, because now is just the time when
          we shall begin to say, "We are a great people," "We shall do very
          much," "We are a great agency," "The world will look upon us, and we
          will do a great deal." If we ever say that, God will say, "Cursed is
          he that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm," and he will hide
          the light of his countenance from us, so that our mountain that
          standeth firm shall begin to shake. O churches! -- all of ye here that
          are representatives of churches, carry ye the tidings. O churches!
          take heed lest ye trust in yourselves; take heed lest ye say, "We are
          a respectable body," "We are a mighty number," "We are a potent
          people;" take heed lest ye begin to glory in your own strength; for
          when that is done, "Ichabod" shall be written on your walls and your
          glory shall depart from you. Remember, that he who was with us when we
          were but few, must be with us now we are many, or else we must fail;
          and he who strengthened us when we were but as "little in Israel,"
          must be with us, now that we are like "the thousands of Manasseh," or
          else it is all over with us and our day is past. "Not by might, nor by
          power, but by my Spirit saith the Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. NOR BY POWER, that is, individual strength. You know, beloved,
          that after all, the greatest works that have been done have been done
          by the ones. The hundreds do not often do much, the companies never
          do, it is the units, just the single individuals, that after all are
          the power and the might. Take any parish in England where there is a
          well-regulated society for doing good -- it is some young woman or
          some young man who is the very life of it. Take any church, there are
          multitudes in it, but it is some two or three that do the work. Look
          on the Reformation, there might be many reformers, but there was but
          one Luther, there might be many teachers, but there was but one
          Calvin. Look ye upon the preachers of the last age, the mighty
          preachers who stirred up the churches; there were many coadjutors with
          them, but after all, it was not Whitfield's friends, nor Wesley's
          friends, but the men themselves that did it. Individual effort is,
          after all, the grand thing. A man alone can do more than a man with
          fifty men at his heels to fetter him. Committees are very seldom of
          much use, and bodies and societies sometimes are loss of strength
          instead of a gain. It is said, that if Noah's Ark had had to be built
          by a company, they would not have laid the keel yet; and it is perhaps
          true. There is scarcely anything done by a body, it almost always
          fails; because what is many men's business is just nobody's business
          at all. Just the same with religion, the grand things must be done by
          the ones, the great works of God must be accomplished by single men.
          Look back through old history. Who delivered Israel from the
          Philistines? It was a solitary Samson. Who was it gathered the people
          together to rout the Midianites? It was one Gideon, who cried, "The
          sword of the Lord and of Gideon." Who was he that smote the enemy? It
          was one Shamgar, with his ox goad, or it was an Elon, who with his
          dagger, put an end to his country's tyrant. Separate men -- Davids
          with their slings and stones, have done more than armies could
          accomplish. "But," says God, "it is not even by individual might, the
          gospel is to be spread." Take individual might in different senses;
          sometimes we may say, of this kind, it represents learning. We
          discover here and there certain great and mighty men in learning, that
          can take an infidel, strap him on to the dissecting board, and just
          anatomise him in a minute, they are great doctors of divinity, they
          have achieved the highest titles that can be given them at the
          universities; they have read the Scriptures thoroughly, they are
          mighty theologians, they could dispute with John Owen, and could
          entirely take the wind out of the sails of Calvin, they know a great
          deal, a very great deal; they can write most excellent reviews, and
          are much gifted in philosophical disquisitions. But did you ever hear,
          in the course of all your life, of any one of these being blessed by
          God to lead any great religious movement? Such a thing may have been,
          but I have forgotten all about it; there may have been such an
          occurrence, but I do not remember it. This I am sure of; that the
          apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ had taken no degree, except it was a
          good degree of being excellent fishermen, this I am certain, that all
          through the ages God has not often used men of any very great
          intellectual compass, they have not seemed to be men of profound
          learning; they have generally been men of determined will and strong
          principle, but not often of any very high intellectual attainments. Do
          I, therefore, rail at learning? O! no; God forbid, the more of that
          the better. Let men be as wise as they can be, and as learned as they
          can be, but still the fact remaineth, and there is no one that can
          dispute it -- that God hath often taken the foolish things of this
          world to confound the wise, in order that men may see "It is not by
          power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          I have the pleasure and happiness of being acquainted with a large
          number of the most eminent ministers in England; I have walked and
          talked with them, and spoken to them about the things of the kingdom,
          and with great pleasure, and if they were present they would not think
          me severe in what I am about to say. Many of those at whose feet we
          have been prepared to sit as little children to hear their wisdom,
          confessed as ministers, that when they reviewed up their life, they
          felt that it has been unprofitable. They have been learned, but they
          would say with Owen, "I would give up all my talents to preach like
          Bunyan the tinker." They have wished that they could have believed
          something else besides having attained a name for profound learning
          and research. My brethren, it is not their fault, they have labored
          well and earnestly, I find no fault whatever with them: it is God's
          supremacy that stamps this upon them and makes them feel the force of
          it -- that it must not be by power, and their very intellectual
          prowess, puts them out of the way -- so that they are incapable of
          being used by God as a mass at least, though individuals may be, for
          any very great result in the church, because then it would seem to be
          by power.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, no," says one. "If a man is not learned that does not signify
          much, a man must be eloquent." That is another mistake, it is not by
          power of eloquence that souls are saved. I believe every man that
          preaches the gospel in his heart is eloquent; so I have used a wrong
          word. I mean, however, that great oratorical powers are very seldom
          made use of by God for any very great result; not even here, is God
          pleased to let it be seen to be by power. Ye have heard of the
          preaching of Whitfield did ye ever read his sermons? If ye did ye will
          say they were rather contemptible productions. There is nothing in
          them that I should think could have approached to oratory; it was only
          the man's earnestness that made him eloquent. Have ye heard any
          preacher that has been blessed by God to move the multitude? He has
          been eloquent, for he has spoken earnestly, but as to oratory, there
          has been none of it. I, for my own part, must eschew every pretension
          thereunto. I am certain I never think, when I come into this pulpit,
          "How shall I talk to this people in a grand fashion?" I think when I
          come up here, "I have got something to say, I will tell them it." How
          I will tell them, it does not signify much to me, I shall find the
          words somehow or other I daresay, God helping me, but about any of the
          graces of eloquence, or the words of oratory, I am utterly and quite
          in the dark, nor do I wish to imitate any who have been masters in
          that. I believe that the men whom we call eloquent now they are dead,
          were laughed at in their day as poor bungling speakers. Now they are
          buried they are canonized, but in their lives they were abused.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my brethren, God, I do think will generally cast a slur upon fine
          speaking and grand compositions and so on, in order that he may show
          that it is not by individual power, but by his Spirit. I could stand
          here, and point my finger in a certain circle around this place, and I
          could pause at such a chapel and say, There is a man preaching there
          whose compositions are worthy to be read by the most intellectual of
          persons, but whose chapel contains this morning, a hundred. I will
          point you to another of whose preaching we can say that it was the
          most faultless oratory to which we ever listened, but his congregation
          were nearly all of them asleep. We might point you to another, of whom
          we could say that there was the most chaste simplicity, the most
          extraordinary beauty in the compositions he delivered, but there has
          not been a soul known to be saved in the chapel for years. Now, why is
          that? I think it is because God says, it is not by power, it shall not
          he by individual power. And I will say this that whenever God is
          pleased to raise up a man by individual power to move the world, or to
          work any reform, he invariably selects a man whose faults and whose
          errors are so glaring and apparent to everyone, that we are obliged to
          say, "I wonder that man should do it, surely it must be of God, it
          could not be of that man." No, there are some men who are too great
          for God's designs, their style is too excellent. If God blessed them
          the world would cry -- especially the literary world -- it is their
          talent that God blesses; but God, on the other hand takes up some
          rough fellow, truly an earthen vessel, puts his treasure in him, and
          just shakes the whole world. People cry, "We do not see how it is, it
          is not in the man certainly;" the critic takes up his pen, dips it in
          gall, writes a most fearful character about the man, the man reads it,
          and says, "It is just true, and I am glad of it for if it had not been
          true God would not have used me. I glory in my infirmities, because
          Christ's own power rests on me. If I had not those infirmities so much
          could not have been done, but the very infirmities have insured
          against men's saying, It was the man.'" I have often been delighted at
          some of my opponents, they have sneered at everything in me -- from
          the crown of my head to the sole of my foot, I have been all over
          bruises and putrifying sores, every word has been vulgarity, every
          action has been grotesque, the whole of it has been abominable and
          blasphemous; and I said, Well that is delightful, now that is good.'
          And while some persons have said, Now we must defend our minister,' I
          have thought, "You had better let it alone, it is much the best that
          it should be so; for suppose it is true -- and it is, the most of it
          -- there is all the more glory to God; for who can deny that the work
          is done?'" And he is a great workman that can use bad tools and yet
          produce a fine piece of workmanship; and if the conversion of hundreds
          of souls now present, if the sobriety of drunkards, if the chastity of
          harlots, if the salvation of men who have been swearers, blasphemers,
          thieves and vagabonds from their youth up, is not a grand result, I do
          not know what is. And if I have been the unwieldy, uncouth, unworthy
          tool employed in doing it, I bless God, for then you cannot honor me,
          but must give all the glory to him, and to him all the glory belongs.
          He will have it proved that "It is not by might, nor by power, but by
          my Spirit, saith the Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now to conclude lest I weary you. Whilst the progress and
          advance of the church are neither to be accomplished by the collected
          might of armies, corporations, nor churches, nor by the separate
          exertions of individuals, by the might neither of learning nor of
          eloquence, yet both the objects are to be accomplished BY THE SPIRIT
          OF GOD.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was thinking, yesterday, my friends, what a magnificent change would
          come over the face of Christendom if God were on a sudden to pour out
          his Spirit as he did on the day of Pentecost. I was then sitting down
          meditating upon this sermon, and I thought! oh, if God should pour his
          Spirit upon me, should I not leap from this place where I am now
          sitting, and on my knees begin to pray as I never did before; and
          should I not go next Sabbath-day to a congregation who would feel a
          solemn awe about them! Every word I spoke would strike like arrows
          from the bow of God; and they themselves would feel that it was "none
          other than the house of God and the very gate of heaven!" Thousands
          would cry out, "What must I do to be saved?" and go away carrying the
          divine fire till the whole of this city would be kindled. And then I
          had pictured to myself what would come over all the churches if they
          were in the same condition, and all the people received that same
          Spirit. I had seen the minister from Monday morning till Saturday
          night doing little or nothing; delivering his weekly lecture,
          attending one prayer-meeting, and thinking himself hard worked I saw
          him, on a sudden, start from his couch, and go round to all the sick
          of his chapel, and I marked how he delivered a short address of
          comfort to the sick, with such holy gravity and such divine
          simplicity, that they lifted their heads from their pillows, and began
          to sing, even in the agonies of death. I thought I saw others of them
          girding up their loins, and crying, "What am I doing? -- men are
          perishing, and I am preaching to them but three times a week and am
          called to the work of the ministry." I thought I read of all those
          ministers going into the open-air to preach next Monday night; I
          thought I saw the whole of them flying, like angels fly, to-and-fro
          this land. And then I thought I saw the deacons all full of the Spirit
          too, and found them with all their powers, doing everything in the
          fear of God. I found those who had been lords and rulers no longer
          seeking to be like Diotrephes; I saw the heavenly influence spread
          over every mind, I saw the vestries too small for the prayer-meetings,
          and I saw the chapel crowded, and I heard the brethren who year after
          year had prayed the same monotonous prayer, break forth in earnest
          burning words; I saw the whole assembly melted in tears when the
          pastor addressed them, and urged them to prayer, and I heard the
          brethren one by one as they rose up speak like men who had been with
          Jesus, and had learned how to pray. They prayed as if they had heard
          Christ pray in Gethsemane, that prayer which was such as never man
          prayed; and then I thought I saw all those members, and those deacons,
          and those pastors going out into the world. And, oh, I pictured what
          preaching there would be, what tract distributing, what alms giving,
          what holy living! And then I already thought I heard every house at
          vesper uttering its song, and every cottage as its matin, sending up
          its prayer to heaven. I thought I saw upon every ploughshare
          "consecrated to God," and every bell upon the horses, "holiness unto
          the Lord." And then I thought I saw the different denominations
          rushing into each others arms; I saw the bishop doff his mitre, and
          clasp his dissenting brother and call him friend, and bid him preach
          in his cathedral. And I thought I saw the stiff puritanical dissenter
          casting away his hatred of conformity, and receiving the Church of
          England brother to his heart. I thought I saw baptized and unbaptized
          sitting at one table. I saw Presbyterian, Wesleyan, Independent, and
          Quaker agreeing in one thing -- that Christ crucified was all: and
          clasping one another's hands. Ay, and then I thought I have the angels
          coming down from heaven. And I was not long before I finished my
          reverie by hearing the shout -- "Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah,
          the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!" It was a reverie, but it will be
          true some day. By the Spirit of God all this will be accomplished. How
          and by what means I know not, but I know the great agency must be the
          Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, dear friends, let me counsel you. The grand thing the church
          wants in this time, is God's Holy Spirit. You all get up plans and
          say, "Now, if the church were altered a little bit, it would go on
          better." You think if there were different ministers, or different
          church order, or something different, then all would be well. No, dear
          friends, it is not there the mistake lies, it is that we want more of
          the Spirit. It is as if you saw a locomotive engine upon a railway,
          and it would not go, and they put up a driver, and they said, "Now,
          that driver will just do." They try another and another. One proposes
          that such-and-such a wheel should be altered, but still it will not
          go. Some one then bursts in amongst those who are conversing and says,
          "No, friends; but the reason why it will not move, is because there is
          no steam. You have no fire, you have no water in the boiler: that's
          why it will not go. There may be some faults about it; it may want a
          bit of paint here and there, but it will go well enough with all those
          faults if you do but get the steam up." But now people are saying,
          "This must be altered, and that must be altered; but it would go no
          better unless God the Spirit should come to bless us. You may have the
          same ministers, and they shall be a thousand times more useful for
          God, if God is pleased to bless them. You shall have the same deacons,
          they shall be a thousand times more influential than they are now,
          when the Spirit is poured down upon them from on high. That is the
          church's great want, and until that want be supplied, we may reform,
          and reform, and still be just the same. We want the Holy Spirit, and
          then whatever faults there may be in our organization, they can never
          materially impede the progress of Christianity, when once the Spirit
          of the Lord God is in our midst.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I beseech you be earnest in praying for this. Do you know that
          there is no reason to day, why I should not have preached to day, so
          that every soul in the place was converted, if God the Holy Spirit had
          been pleased to manifest himself. There is not any solitary shadow of
          a reason why every soul that has been within the sound of my lips
          should not have been converted by something said to-day if God the
          Holy Spirit had been pleased to bless the word. Now I will repeat,
          there, is not a humble Primitive Methodist, nor a poor insignificant
          preacher of any sort on earth, but who, if he preaches the truth, God
          the Spirit may not make as useful in conversion, as any of the great
          departed, who are now before God's throne. All we want is the Spirit
          of God. Dear Christian friends, go home and pray for it; give no rest
          until God reveals himself, do not tarry, here you are, do not be
          content to go on in your everlasting jog-trot as you have done; do not
          be content with the mere round of formalities. Awake, O Zion; awake,
          awake, awake! Put on thy strength, O Jerusalem, start ye from your
          slumbers, arouse ye from your lethargy, and cry unto God and say unto
          him, "Awake, awake! put on thy strength, O arm of the Lord, as in the
          ancient days," then when he shall do it, you will find that while it
          is not by might, nor by power, it is by God's Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I conclude with a brief address that shall not occupy a
          moment. Sinner, unconverted sinner, thou hast often tried to save
          thyself, but thou hast often failed. Thou hast, by thine own power and
          might, sought to curb thy evil passions and licentious desires with
          thee, I lament that all thine efforts have been unsuccessful. And I
          warn thee, it will be unsuccessful, for thou never canst by thine own
          might save thyself; with all the strength thou hast, thou never canst
          regenerate thine own soul; thou canst never cause thyself to be born
          again, And though the new birth is absolutely necessary, it is
          absolutely impossible to thee, unless God the Spirit shall do it. I
          pray for thee that God the Spirit may convince thee of sin, and if
          thou art already convinced, I bid thee believe in the Lord Jesus
          Christ, for he has died for thee, hath washed away thy sins; thou art
          forgiven. Believe that; be happy, and go thy way rejoicing; an, God
          Almighty be with thee until thou diest.
