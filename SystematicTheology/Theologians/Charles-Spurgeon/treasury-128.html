<p align="center">PSALM 123 <br/>
 </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">TITLE. A Song of degrees. We are climbing. The first step 
    (Psalm 120) saw us lamenting our troublesome surroundings, and the next saw 
    us lifting or eyes to the hills and resting in assured security; from this 
    we rose to delight in the house of the Lord; but here we look to the Lord 
    himself, and this is the highest ascent of all by many degrees. The eyes are 
    now looking above the hills, and above Jehovah's footstool on earth, to his 
    throne in the heavens. Let us know it as "the Psalm of the eyes". Old 
    authors call it Oculus Sperans, or the eye of hope. It is a short Psalm, 
    written with singular art, containing one thought, and expressing if in a 
    most engaging manner. Doubtless it would be a favorite song among the people 
    of God. </p>
<p align="justify">It has been conjectured that this brief song, or rather 
    sigh, may have first been heard in the days of Nehemiah, or under the 
    persecutions of Antiochus. It may be so, but there is no evidence of it; it 
    seems to us quite as probable that afflicted ones in all periods after 
    David's time found this psalm ready to their hand. If it appears to describe 
    days remote from David, it is all the more evident that the Psalmist was 
    also a prophet, and sang what he saw in vision.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. Unto you lift I up my eyes.</p></b> It is good to 
    have someone to look up to. The Psalmist looked so high that he could look 
    no higher. Not to the hills, but to the God of the hills he looked. He 
    believed in a personal God, and knew nothing of that modern pantheism which 
    is nothing more than atheism wearing a fig leaf. The uplifted eyes naturally 
    and instinctively represent the state of heart which fixes desire, hope, 
    confidence, and expectation upon the Lord. God is everywhere, and yet it is 
    most natural to think of him as being above us, in that glory land which 
    lies beyond the skies. 
<b>
<p align="justify">O you who dwell in the heavens</p></b>, just sets forth, the 
    unsophisticated idea of a child of God in distress: God is, God is in 
    Heaven, God resides in one place, and God is evermore the same, therefore 
    will I look to him. When we cannot look to any helper on a level with us, it 
    is greatly wise to look above us. In fact, if we have a thousand helpers, 
    our eyes should still be toward the Lord. The higher the Lord is the better 
    for our faith, since that height represents power, glory, and excellence, 
    and these will be all engaged on our behalf. 
<p align="justify">We ought to be very thankful for spiritual eyes; the 
    blind men of this world, however much of human learning they may possess, 
    cannot behold our God, for in heavenly matters they are devoid of sight. Yet 
    we must use our eyes with resolution, for they will not go upward to the 
    Lord of themselves, but they incline to look downward, or inward, or 
    anywhere but to the Lord: let it be our firm resolve that the heavenward 
    glance shall not be lacking. If we cannot see God, at least we will look 
    towards him. </p>
<p align="justify">God is in Heaven as a king in his palace; he is here 
    revealed, adored, and glorified: thence he looks down on the world and sends 
    supports to his saints as their needs demand; hence we look up, even when 
    our sorrow is so great that we can do no more. It is a blessed condescension 
    on God's part that he permits us to lift up our eyes to his glorious high 
    throne; yes, more, that he invites and even commands us so to do. When we 
    are looking to the Lord in hope, it is well to tell him so in prayer: the 
    Psalmist uses his voice as well as his eye. We need not speak in prayer; a 
    glance of the eye will do it all.</p>
<p align="justify">"Prayer is the burden of a sigh,<br/>
    The falling of a tear,<br/>
    The upward glancing of an eye<br/>
    When none but God is near."</p>
<p align="justify">Still, it is helpful to the heart to use the tongue, and 
    we do well to address ourselves in words and sentences to the God who hears 
    his people. It is no small joy that our God is always at home: he is not on 
    a journey, like Baal, but he dwells in the heavens. Let us think no hour of 
    the day inopportune for waiting upon the Lord; no watch of the night too 
    dark for us to look to him.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. Behold</p></b>—for it is worthy of regard among men, 
    and O that the Majesty of Heaven would also note it, and speedily send the 
    mercy which our waiting spirits seek. See, O Lord, how we look to you, and 
    in your mercy look on us. 
<p align="justify">This Behold has, however, a call to us to observe and 
    consider. Whenever saints of God have waited upon the Lord their example has 
    been worthy of earnest consideration. Sanctification is a miracle of grace; 
    therefore let us behold it. For God to have wrought in men the spirit of 
    service is a great marvel, and as such let all men turn aside and see this 
    great sight. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"As the eyes of servants (or slaves) look unto the hand 
    of their masters."</p></b> They stand at the end of the room with their hands 
    folded watching their lord's movements. Orientals speak less than we do, and 
    prefer to direct their slaves by movements of their hands: hence, the 
    servant must fix his eyes on his master, or he might miss a sign, and so 
    fail to obey it: even so, the sanctified man lifts his eyes unto God, and 
    endeavors to learn the divine will from every one of the signs which the 
    Lord is pleased to use. Creation, providence, grace—these are all motions of 
    Jehovah's hand, and from each of them a portion of our duty is to be 
    learned; therefore should we carefully study them, to discover the divine 
    will. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"And as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her 
    mistress,"</p></b> this second comparison may be used because Eastern women are 
    even more thorough than the men in the training of their servants. It is 
    usually thought that women issue more commands, and are more sensitive of 
    disobedience, than the sterner gender. Among the Roman matrons female slaves 
    had a sorry time of it, and no doubt it was the same among the generality of 
    Eastern ladies. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"Even so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God."</p></b> 
    Believers desire to be attentive to each and all of the directions of the 
    Lord; even those which concern apparently little things are not little to 
    us, for we know that even for idle words we shall be called to account, and 
    we are anxious to give in that account with joy, and not with grief. 
<p align="justify">True saints, like obedient servants, look to the Lord 
    their God reverentially: they have a holy awe and inward fear of the great 
    and glorious One. They watch, obediently, doing his commandments, guided by 
    his eye. Their constant gaze is fixed attentively on all that comes from the 
    Most High. They give earnest heed, and fear lest they should let anything 
    slip through inadvertence or drowsiness. They look continuously, for there 
    never is a time when they are off duty; at all times they delight to serve 
    in all things. <i>Upon the Lord they fix their eyes expectantly, looking for 
    supply, support, and safety from his hands, waiting that he may have mercy 
    upon them. </i>To him they look singly, they have no other confidence, and 
    they learn to look submissively, waiting patiently for the Lord, seeking 
    both in activity and suffering to glorify his name. When they are smitten 
    with the rod they turn their eyes imploringly to the hand which chastens, 
    hoping that mercy will soon abate the rigor of the affliction. </p>
<p align="justify">There is much more in the figure than we can display in 
    this brief comment; perhaps it will be most profitable to suggest the 
    question: Are we thus trained to service? Though we are sons, have we 
    learned the full obedience of servants? Have we surrendered <i>self</i>, and 
    bowed our will before the heavenly Majesty? Do we desire in all things to be 
    at the Lord's disposal? If so, happy are we. Though we are made joint heirs 
    with Christ—yet for the present we differ little from servants, and may be 
    well content to take them for our model.</p>
<p align="justify">Observe the covenant name, "Jehovah our God": it is sweet 
    to wait upon a covenant God. Because of that covenant he will show mercy to 
    us; but we may have to wait for it. "Until that he have mercy upon us:" God 
    has his time and season, and we must wait until it comes. For the trial of 
    our faith our blessed Lord may for awhile delay, but in the end the vision 
    will be fulfilled. Mercy is that which we need, that which we look for, that 
    which our Lord will manifest to us. Even those who look to the Lord, with 
    that holy look which is here described, still need mercy, and as they cannot 
    claim it by right they wait for it until sovereign grace chooses to grant 
    it. Blessed are those servants whom their Master shall find so doing. </p>
<p align="justify">Waiting upon the Lord is a posture suitable both for 
    earth and Heaven: it is, indeed, in every place the right and fitting 
    condition for a servant of the Lord. Nor may we leave the posture so long as 
    we are by grace dwellers in the realm of mercy. It is a great mercy to be 
    enabled to wait for mercy, so much the more spirit, when anyone causelessly 
    did them violence. Nor can it be doubted that God, when he sees us placing 
    an exclusive dependence upon his protection, and renouncing all confidence 
    in our own resources, will, as our defender, encounter and shield us from 
    all the molestation that shall be offered to us. John Calvin.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us.
    </p></b>He hangs upon the word "mercy," and embodies it in a vehement prayer: 
    the very word seems to hold him, and he harps upon it.<i> It is well for us 
    to pray about everything, and turn everything into prayer</i>; and 
    especially when we are reminded of a great necessity we should catch at it 
    as a keynote, and pitch our tune to it. 
<p align="justify">The reduplication of the prayer before us is meant to 
    express the eagerness of the Psalmist's spirit and his urgent need: what he 
    needed speedily, he begs for importunately.</p>
<p align="justify">Note that he has left the first person singular for the 
    plural. All the saints need mercy; they all seek it; they shall all have it, 
    therefore we pray, "have mercy upon <i>us</i>". A servant when corrected 
    looks to his master's hand that the punishment may cease, and even so we 
    look to the Lord for mercy, and entreat for it with all our hearts. Our 
    contemptuous opponents will have no mercy upon us; let us not ask it at 
    their hands, but turn to the God of mercy, and seek his aid alone. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"For we are exceedingly filled with contempt,"</p></b> and 
    this is an acid which eats into the soul. Observe the emphatic words. 
    Contempt is bitterness, wormwood mingled with gall; he who feels it may well 
    cry for mercy to his God. <i>Filled </i>with contempt, as if the bitter wine 
    had been poured in until it was up to the brim. This had become the chief 
    thought of their minds, the peculiar sorrow of their hearts. Excluding all 
    other feelings, a sense of scorn monopolized the soul and made it 
    unutterably wretched. 
<p align="justify">Another word is added adverbially—<i>exceedingly </i>
    filled. Filled even to running over, as if pressed down and then heaped up. 
    A little contempt they could bear, but now they were satiated with it, and 
    weary of it. Do we wonder at the threefold mention of mercy when this master 
    evil was in the ascendant? Nothing is more wounding, embittering, 
    festering—than disdain. When our companions make little of us we are far too 
    apt to make little of ourselves and of the consolations prepared for us. Oh 
    to be filled with communion with Jesus, and then contempt will run off from 
    us, and never be able to fill us with its biting vinegar.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning 
    of those that are at ease. </p></b>Knowing no troubles of their own, the easy 
    ones grow cruel and deride the people of the Lord. <i>Having the godly 
    already in secret contempt, they show it by openly scorning them</i>. 
<p align="justify">Note those who do this: they are not the poor, the 
    humble, the troubled, but those who have a merry life of it, and are 
    self-content. They are in easy circumstances; they are easy in heart through 
    a deadened conscience, and so they easily come to mock at holiness. They are 
    easy from needing nothing, and from having no severe toil exacted from them. 
    They are easy as to any anxiety to improve, for their conceit of themselves 
    is boundless. Such men take things easily, and therefore they scorn the holy 
    carefulness of those who watch the hand of the Lord. They say: Who is the 
    Lord that we should obey his voice? and then they turn round with a 
    contemptuous look and sneer at those who fear the Lord. Woe unto those who 
    are at case in Zion; their contempt of the godly shall hasten and increase 
    their misery.</p>
<p align="justify">The injurious effect of freedom from affliction is 
    singularly evident here. Place a man perfectly at ease and he derides the 
    suffering godly, and becomes himself proud in heart and conduct. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"And with the contempt of the proud". </p></b>The proud think 
    so much of themselves that they must needs think all the less of those who 
    are better than themselves. Pride is both contemptible and contemptuous. The 
    contempt of the great ones of the earth is often peculiarly acrid. Some of 
    them, like a well known statesman, are "masters of gibes and flouts and 
    sneers", and never do they seem so much at home in their acrimony as when a 
    servant of the Lord is the victim of their venom.
<p align="justify">It is easy enough to write upon this subject, but to be 
    selected as the target of contempt is quite another matter. Great hearts 
    have been broken and brave spirits have been withered beneath the accursed 
    power of falsehood, and the horrible blight of contempt. </p>
<p align="justify">For our comfort we may remember that our divine Lord was 
    despised and rejected of men—yet he ceased not from his perfect service 
    until he was exalted to dwell in the heavens. Let us bear our share of this 
    evil which still rages under the sun, and let us firmly believe that the 
    contempt of the ungodly shall turn to our honor in the world to come. Even 
    now it serves as a certificate that we are not of the world, for if we were 
    of the world the world would love us as its own.</p>
