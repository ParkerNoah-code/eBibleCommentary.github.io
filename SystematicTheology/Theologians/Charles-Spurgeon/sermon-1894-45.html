        <p>The Land Desolate and Mourning</p>
        <p>OLD MEN</p>
        <p>
          Hear this, ye old men,<br />And give ear, all ye inhabitants of the
          land!<br />Hath this been in your days,<br />Or in the days of your
          fathers?<br />Tell ye your children of it,<br />And let your children
          tell their children,<br />And their children another generation.<br />That
          which the palmerworm hath left<br />Hath the locust eaten;<br />And
          that which the locust hath left<br />Hath the cankerworm eaten;<br />And
          that which the cankerworm hath left<br />Hath the caterpillar eaten.
        </p>
        <p>REVELLERS</p>
        <p>
          Awake, ye drunkards, and weep,<br />And howl, all ye drinkers of
          wine,<br />Because of the sweet wine;<br />For it is cut off from your
          mouth!<br />For a nation is come up upon my land,<br />Strong, and
          without number;<br />His teeth are the teeth of a lion,<br />And he
          hath the jaw teeth of a great lion.<br />He hath laid my vine
          waste,<br />And barked my fig tree:<br />He hath made it clean bare,
          and cast it away;<br />The branches thereof are made white.
        </p>
        <p>PRIESTS</p>
        <p>
          Lament like a virgin<br />Girded with sackcloth for the husband of her
          youth! The meal offering and the drink offering<br />Is cut off from
          the house of the LORD:<br />The priests, the LORD'S ministers,
          mourn.<br />The field is wasted,<br />The land mourneth;<br />For the
          corn is wasted,<br />The new wine is dried up,<br />The oil
          languisheth.
        </p>
        <p>HUSBANDMEN</p>
        <p>
          Be ashamed, O ye husbandmen,<br />Howl, O ye vinedressers,<br />For
          the wheat, and for the barley;<br />For the harvest of the field is
          perished!<br />The vine is withered,<br />And the fig tree
          languisheth;<br />The pomegranate tree,<br />The palm tree also, and
          the apple tree,<br />Even all the trees of the field are withered:<br />For
          joy is withered away from the sons of men.
        </p>
        <p>PRIESTS</p>
        <p>
          Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests;<br />Howl, ye ministers of
          the altar;<br />Come, lie all night in sackcloth,<br />Ye ministers of
          my God:<br />For the meal offering and the drink offering<br />Is
          withholden from the house of your God!
        </p>
        <p>THE WHOLE PEOPLE</p>
        <p>
          Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the old men and all
          the inhabitants of the land unto the house of the LORD your God, and
          cry unto the LORD:
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand! And as
          destruction from the Almighty shall it come. Is not the meat cut off
          before our eyes,<br />Yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God?
        </p>
        <p>
          The seeds rot under their clods:<br />The garners are laid
          desolate,<br />The barns are broken down;<br />For the corn is
          withered.
        </p>
        <p>
          How do the beasts groan!<br />The herds of cattle are perplexed,<br />Because
          they have no pasture;<br />Yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.
        </p>
        <p>
          O LORD, to thee do I cry:<br />For the fire hath devoured the pastures
          of the wilderness, And the flame hath burned all the trees of the
          field. Yea, the beasts of the field pant unto thee:<br />For the water
          brooks are dried up,<br />And the fire hath devoured the pastures of
          the wilderness.
        </p>
        <p>ii</p>
        <p>The Judgment Advancing</p>
        <p>
          Blow ye the trumpet in Zion,<br />And sound an alarm in my holy
          mountain;<br />Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble!
        </p>
        <p>
          For the Day of the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand; a day of
          darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the
          dawn spread upon the mountains; a great people and a strong, there
          hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after them,
          even to the years of many generations!
        </p>
        <p>
          A fire devoureth before them;<br />And behind them a flame burneth:<br />The
          land is as the garden of Eden before them,<br />And behind them a
          desolate wilderness!
        </p>
        <p>
          Yea, and none hath escaped them. The appearance of them is as the
          appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so do they run. Like the noise
          of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the noise
          of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set
          in battle array.
        </p>
        <p>
          At their presence the peoples are in anguish:<br />All faces are waxed
          pale:<br />They run like mighty men;<br />They climb the wall like men
          of war;<br />And they march every one on his ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          And they break not their ranks: neither doth one thrust another; they
          march every one in his path: and they burst through the weapons, and
          break not off their course.
        </p>
        <p>
          They leap upon the city;<br />They run upon the wall;<br />They climb
          up into the houses;<br />They enter in at the windows like a thief.<br />The
          earth quaketh before them;<br />The heavens tremble:<br />The sun and
          the moon are darkened,<br />And the stars withdraw their shining.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the LORD uttereth his voice before his army; for his camp is very
          great; for he is strong that executeth his word: for the Day of the
          LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?
        </p>
        <p>iii</p>
        <p>Repentance at the Last Moment</p>
        <p>THE LORD</p>
        <p>
          Yet even now, saith the LORD, turn ye unto me with all your heart, and
          with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: and rend your
          heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he
          is gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger, and plenteous in
          mercy, and repenteth him of the evil.
        </p>
        <p>THE PEOPLE</p>
        <p>
          Who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing
          behind him, even a meal offering and a drink offering unto the LORD
          your God?
        </p>
        <p>
          Blow the trumpet in Zion,<br />Sanctify a fast,<br />Call a solemn
          assembly:<br />Gather the people,<br />Sanctify the congregation,<br />Assemble
          the old men,<br />Gather the children, and those that suck the
          breasts: Let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber,<br />And the
          bride out of her closet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and
          the altar, and let them say:
        </p>
        <p>PRIESTS</p>
        <p>
          Spare thy people, O LORD,<br />And give not thine heritage to
          reproach,<br />That the nations should use a byword against them,<br />Wherefore
          should they say among the peoples,<br />Where is their God?
        </p>
        <p>iv</p>
        <p>Relief and Restoration</p>
        <p>
          Then was the LORD jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.
        </p>
        <p>THE LORD</p>
        <p>
          Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be
          satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the
          nations: but I will remove far off from you the northern army, and
          will drive him into a land barren and desolate, his forepart into the
          eastern sea, and his hinder part into the western sea; and his stink
          shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done
          great things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for the LORD hath done great
          things. Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the
          wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and
          the vine do yield their strength. Be glad then, ye children of Zion,
          and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he giveth you the former rain in
          just measure, and he causeth to come down for you the rain, the former
          rain and the latter rain, in the first month. And the floors shall be
          full of wheat, and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil. And I
          will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the
          cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmerworm, my great army
          which I sent among you. And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied,
          and shall praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt
          wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed. And ye
          shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD
          your God, and there is none else: and my people shall never be
          ashamed.
        </p>
        <p>v</p>
        <p>Afterward</p>
        <p>THE LORD</p>
        <p>
          And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit
          upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your
          old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: and also
          upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out
          my spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and
          fire, and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and
          the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD
          come. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name
          of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem
          there shall be those that escape, as the LORD hath said, and in the
          remnant whom the LORD doth call. For, behold, in those days, and in
          that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and
          Jerusalem, I will gather all nations, and will bring them down into
          the Valley of Jehoshaphat; and I will plead with them there for my
          people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the
          nations, and parted my land. And they have cast lots for my people:
          and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that
          they might drink. Yea, and what are ye to me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and
          all the regions of Philistia? will ye render me a recompence? and if
          ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence
          upon your own head. Forasmuch as ye have taken my silver and my gold,
          and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things; the
          children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto
          the sons of the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their
          border: behold, I will stir them up out of the place whither ye have
          sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head; and I
          will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children
          of Judah, and they shall sell them to the men of Sheba, to a nation
          far off: for the LORD hath spoken it.
        </p>
        <p>[Footnote 6: The LORD'S Decision.]</p>
        <p>vi</p>
        <p>Advance to the Valley of Decision</p>
        <p>THE LORD</p>
        <p>
          Proclaim ye this among the nations; prepare war: stir up the mighty
          men; let all the men of war draw near, let them come up. Beat your
          plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the
          weak say, I am strong.
        </p>
        <p>VOICES</p>
        <p>
          Haste ye, and come, all ye nations round about, and gather yourselves
          together. Thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD.
        </p>
        <p>THE LORD</p>
        <p>
          Let the nations bestir themselves, and come up to the Valley of
          'Jehoshaphat': for there will I 'sit to judge' all the nations round
          about.
        </p>
        <p>THE LORD (to his Hosts)</p>
        <p>
          Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, tread ye; for the
          winepress is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great.
        </p>
        <p>THE PROPHETIC SPECTATOR</p>
        <p>
          Multitudes, multitudes in the Valley of Decision! for the Day of the
          LORD is near in the Valley of Decision. The sun and the moon are
          darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining. And the LORD shall
          roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens
          and the earth shall shake: but the LORD will be a refuge unto his
          people, and a strong hold to the children of Israel.
        </p>
        <p>vii</p>
        <p>The Holy Mountain and Eternal Peace</p>
        <p>THE LORD</p>
        <p>
          So shall ye know that I am the LORD your God, dwelling in Zion my holy
          mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers
          pass through her any more. And it shall come to pass in that day, that
          the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, and the hills shall flow
          with milk, and all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters; and a
          fountain shall come forth of the house of the LORD, and shall water
          the Valley of Acacias. Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be
          a desolate wilderness, for the violence done to the children of Judah,
          because they have shed innocent blood in their land. But Judah shall
          be inhabited for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
          And I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the LORD
          dwelleth in Zion.
