        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.561)</p>
        <p>By the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>"Thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin." -- Isaiah 53:10.</p>
        <p>
          BOTH Jews and Gentiles knew pretty well what an offering for sin
          meant. The Gentiles had been in the habit of offering sacrifices. The
          Jews, however, had by far the clearer idea of it. And what was meant
          by a sin-offering? Undoubtedly, it was taken for granted by the
          offerer, that without shedding blood there was no remission of sin.
          Conscious of guilt, and anxious for pardon, therefore he brought a
          sacrifice, the blood of which should be poured out at the foot of the
          altar -- feeling persuaded that without sacrifice there was no
          satisfaction, and without satisfaction there was no pardon. Then the
          victim to be offered was, on all occasions, a spotless one. The most
          scrupulous care was taken that it should be altogether without
          blemish; for this idea was always connected with a sin-offering, that
          it must be sinless in itself; and being without spot or wrinkle, or
          any such thing, it was held to be a competent victim to take the
          offender's place. That done, the victim being selected, the offerer
          put his hand upon the sin-offering -- and this indeed was the essence
          of the whole transaction -- putting his hand on the victim, he
          confessed his sin, and a transferrence took place, in type at least,
          from the offender to the victim. He did, as it were, put the sin from
          off his own shoulders on to those of the lamb, or the bullock, or the
          he-goat which was now about to be slaughtered. And, to complete the
          sin-offering, the priest draws his knife and kills the victim which
          must be utterly consumed with fire. I say this was always the idea of
          a sin-offering, -- that of a perfect victim; without offense on its
          own account, taking the place of the offender; the transferrence of
          the offender's sin to that victim, and that expiation in the person of
          the victim for the sin done by another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, Jesus Christ has been made by God an offering for sin; and oh
          that to-night we may be able to do in reality what the Jew did in
          metaphor! May we put our hand upon the head of Christ Jesus; as we see
          him offered up upon the cross for guilty men, may we know that our
          sins are transferred to him, and may we be able to cry, in the ecstasy
          of faith, "Great God, I am clean; through Jesus' blood I am clean."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In trying now to expound the doctrine of Christ's being an offering
          for sin, we will begin by laying down one great axiom; which is, that
          SIN DESERVES AND DEMANDS PUNISHMENT.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certain divines have demurred to this. You are aware, I suppose, that
          there have been many theories of atonement; and every new or different
          theory of atonement involves a new or different theory of sin. There
          are some who say that there is no reason in sin itself why it should
          be punished, but that God punishes offenses for the sake of society at
          large. This is what is called the governmental theory, -- that it is
          necessary for the maintenance of good order that an offender should be
          punished, but that there is nothing in sin itself which absolutely
          requires a penalty. Now, we begin by opposing all this, and asserting,
          and we believe we have God's warrant of it, that sin intrinsically and
          in itself demands and deserves the just anger of God, and that that
          anger should be displayed in the form of a punishment. To establish
          this, let me appeal to the conscience -- I will not say to the
          conscience of a man who has, by years of sin, dwindled it down to the
          very lowest degree, but let me appeal to the conscience of an awakened
          sinner, -- a sinner under the influence of the Holy Spirit. And are we
          ever in our right senses, brethren, till the Holy Spirit really brings
          us into them? May it not be said of each of us as it was of the
          prodigal, "He came to himself?" Are we not beside ourselves till the
          Holy Spirit begins to enlighten us? Well, ask this man, who is now
          really in the possession of his true senses, whether he believes that
          sin deserves punishment; and his answer will be quick, sharp, and
          decisive. "Deserve it," saith he, "ay, indeed; and the wonder is that
          I have not suffered it. Why, sir, it seems a marvel to me that I am
          out of hell, and Wesley's hymn is often on my lips, --
        </p>
        <p>'Tell it unto sinners, tell,</p>
        <p>I am, I am out of hell.'"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, sir," says such a sinner, "I feel that if God should smite me
          now, without hope or offer of mercy, to the lowest hell, I should only
          have what I justly deserve; and I feel that if I be not punished for
          my sins, or if there be not some plan found by which my sin can be
          punished in another, I cannot understand how God can be just at all:
          how shall he be Judge of all the earth, if he suffer offenses to go
          unpunished?" There has been a dispute whether men have any innate
          ideas, but surely this idea is in us as early as anything, that virtue
          deserves reward, and sin deserves punishment. I think I might venture
          to assert that if you go to the most degraded race of men, you would
          still find, at least, some traces of this -- shall I call it
          tradition? or is it not a part of the natural light which never was
          altogether eclipsed in man? Man may put bitter for sweet, and sweet
          for bitter; darkness for light, and light for darkness; but this
          follows him as a dog at the heels of its master, -- a sense that
          virtue should be rewarded, and that sin must be punished. You may
          stifle this voice, if you will, but sometimes you will hear it; and
          terribly and decisively will it speak in your ears to say to you,
          "Yes, man, God must punish you; the Judge of all the earth cannot
          suffer you to go scot free." Add to this another matter; namely, that
          God has absolutely declared his displeasure against sin itself. There
          is a passage in Jeremiah, the forty-fourth chapter and the fourth
          verse, where he calls it "That abominable thing which I hate." And
          then, in Deuteronomy, the twenty-fifth chapter, at the sixteenth
          verse, he speaks of it as the thing which is an abomination to him. It
          must be the character of God, that he has a desire to do towards his
          creatures that which is equitable. "Shall not the Judge of all the
          earth do right?" If there is anything in them which deserves reward,
          rest assured he will not rob them of it; and, on the other hand, he
          will do the right thing with those who have offended, and if they
          deserve punishment, it is according to the nature and character of a
          just and holy God that punishment should be inflicted. And we think
          there is nothing more clear in Scripture than the truth that sin is in
          itself so detestable to God that he must and will put forth all the
          vigor of his tremendous strength to crush it, and to make the offender
          feel that it is an evil and a bitter thing to offend against the Most
          High. Beware, ye who forget God in this matter, lest he tear you in
          pieces, and there be none to deliver you. Sin must be punished.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other idea, that sin is only to be punished for the sake of the
          community, involves injustice. If I am to be damned for the sake of
          other people, I demur to it. No, sir: if I am to be punished, Justice
          says; at any rate, that it shall be for my own sins, but if I am to be
          eternally a castaway from God's presence merely as a sort of trick of
          government to maintain the dignity of his law, I cannot understand the
          justice of this. If I am to be cast into hell merely that I am to
          teach to others the tremendousness of the divine holiness, I shall say
          there is no justice in this; but if my sin intrinsically and of itself
          deserves the wrath of God, and I am sent to perdition as the result of
          this fact, I close my lips, and have nothing to say. I am speechless;
          conscience binds my tongue. But if I am told that I am only sent there
          as a part of a scheme of moral government, and that I am sent into
          torment to impress others with a sense of right, I ask that some one
          else should have the place of preacher to the people, and that I may
          be one of those whose felicity it shall be to be preached to; for I
          see no reason in justice why I should be selected as the victim.
          Really, when men run away from the simplicities of the gospel in order
          to make Jehovah more kind, it is strange how unjust and unkind they
          make him. Sinner, God will never destroy you merely to maintain his
          government, or for the good of others. If you be destroyed, it shall
          be because you would not come to him that you might have life; because
          you would rebel against him; because sin from stern necessity did, as
          it were, compel the attribute of divine justice to kindle into
          vengeance, and to drive you from his presence for ever. Sin must be
          punished.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reverse of this doctrine, that sin demands punishment, may be used
          to prove it; for it is highly immoral, dangerous, and opens the
          floodgates of licentiousness to teach that sin can go unpunished. O
          sirs, it is contrary to fact. Look ye! Oh! if your eyes could see
          to-night the terrible justice of God which a being executed now, -- if
          these ears could but hear it, -- if ye could be appalled for a moment
          with
        </p>
        <p>" The sullen groans and hollow moans</p>
        <p>And shrieks of tortured ghosts,"</p>
        <p>
          you would soon perceive that God is punishing sin! And if sin deserve
          not to be punished, what is Tophet but injustice on a monstrous scale?
          What is it but an infinite outrage against everything which is honest
          and right, if these creatures are punished for anything short of their
          own deserts. Go and preach this in hell, and you will have quenched
          the fire which is forever to burn, and the worm of conscience will
          die. Tell them in hell that they are not punished for sin, and you
          have taken away the very sting of their punishment. And then come to
          earth, and go, like Jonah went, though with another message than Jonah
          carried, through the highways and the broadways, the streets and
          thoroughfares of the exceeding great city, and proclaim that sin is
          not to be punished for its own intrinsic desert and baseness. But if
          you expect your prophecy to be believed, enlarge the number of your
          jails, and seek for fresh fields for transportation in the interests
          of society; for if any doctrine can breed villains, this will. Say
          that sin is not to be punished, and you have unhinged government; you
          have plucked up the very gate of our commonweal; you have been another
          Samson to another Gaza; and we shall soon have to rue the day. But,
          sirs, I need not stop to prove it; it is written clearly upon the
          consciousness of each man, and upon the conscience of every one of us,
          that sin must be punished. Here are you and I to-night brought into
          this dilemma. We have sinned; we all like sheep have gone astray; and
          we must be punished for it. It is impossible, absolutely, that sin can
          be forgiven without a sacrifice. God must be just, if heaven falls. If
          earth should pass away and every creature should be lost, the justice
          of God must stand, it cannot by any possibility be suffered to be
          impugned. Let this, then, be fully established in our minds.
        </p>
        <p>
          You need not to be told, as for the first time, that God in his
          infinite mercy has devised a way by which justice can be satisfied,
          and yet mercy can be triumphant. Jesus Christ, the only begotten of
          the Father, took upon himself the form of man, and offered unto Divine
          Justice that which was accepted as an equivalent for the punishment
          due to all his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, the second matter that I wish to bring under your notice is
          this, -- THAT THE PROVISION AND ACCEPTANCE OF A SUBSTITUTE FOR SINNERS
          IS AN ACT OF GRACE.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is no act of grace for a person to accept a pecuniary debt on my
          behalf of another person. If I owe a man twenty pounds, it is no
          matter to him whatever who shall pay the twenty pounds so long as it
          is duly paid. You know that you could legally and at once demand a
          receipt and an acquittance from any one who is your creditor, so long
          as his debt is discharged, though it is discharged by another, and not
          by you. It is so in pecuniary matters, but it is not so in penal
          matters. If a man be condemned to be imprisoned, there is no law,
          there is no justice which can compel the lawgiver to accept a
          substitute for him. If the sovereign should permit another to suffer
          in his stead, it must be the sovereign's own act and deed. He must use
          his own discretion as to whether he will accept the substitute or not;
          and if he do so, it is an act of grace. In Gods case, if he had said
          in the infinite sovereignty of his absolute will, "I will have no
          substitute, but each man shall suffer for himself, he who sinneth
          shall die," none could have murmured. It was grace, and only grace
          which led the divine mind to say, "I will accept of a substitute.
          There shall be a vicarious suffering; and my vengeance shall be
          content, and my mercy shall be gratified."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, dear friends, this grace of God is yet further magnified not only
          in the allowance of the principle of substitution, but in the
          providing of such a substitute as Christ -- on Christ's part that he
          should give up himself, the Prince of Life to die; the King of glory
          to be despised and rejected of men; the Lord of angels to be a servant
          of servants; and the Ancient of days to become an infant of a span
          long. Think of the distance
        </p>
        <p>"From the highest throne in glory</p>
        <p>To the cross of deepest woe,"</p>
        <p>
          and consider the unexampled love which shines in Christ's gift of
          himself. But the Father gives the Son. "God so loved the world that he
          gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not
          perish, but have everlasting life." To give your wealth is something,
          if you make yourself poor; but to give your child is something more.
          When the patriot mother tears her son from her bosom, and cries, "Go,
          my first-born, to your country's wars; there, go and fight until your
          country's flag is safe, and the hearths and homes of your native land
          are secure," there is something in it; for she can look forward to the
          bloody spectacle of her son's mangled body, and yet love her country
          more than her own child. Here is heroism indeed; but God spared not
          his own Son, his only-begotten Son, but freely delivered him up for us
          all. "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet
          sinners, Christ died for us." I do implore you, do not look upon the
          sacrifice of Christ as an act of mere vengeance on the Father's part.
          Never imagine, oh! never indulge the idea, that Jesus died to make the
          Father complacent towards us. Oh, no, dear friends: Jesus' death is
          the effect of overwhelming and infinite love on the Father's part; and
          every blow which wounds, every infliction which occasions sorrow, and
          every pang which rends his heart, speaks of the Father's love as much
          as the joy, the everlasting triumph, which now surrounds his head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us add, however, to this, that, although Jesus Christ's dying as a
          substitute does give to him lawful right to all promised privileges,
          and does make him, as the covenant head of his people a claimant of
          the divine mercy, yet it does not render any of the gifts which we
          receive from God the less gifts from God. Christ has died; but still
          everything that we receive comes to us entirely as a gratuitous
          outflow of God's great heart of love. Never think you have any claim
          to anything because Christ purchased it. If you use the word claim at
          all, let it always be in so humble and modified a sense that you
          understand that you are still receiving, not of debt, but of grace.
          Look upon the whole transaction of a substitute, and of Christ
          becoming the second Adam, as being a matter of pure, rich, free,
          sovereign grace, and never indulge the atrocious thought, I pray you,
          that there was justice, and justice only here; but do magnify the love
          and pity of God in that he did devise and accomplish the great plan of
          salvation by an atoning sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But now to go a step further, and with as much brevity as
          possible. The Lord having established the principle of substitution,
          having provided a substitute, and having through him bestowed upon us
          gratuitously innumerable mercies, let us observe THAT JESUS IS THE
          MOST FITTING PERSON TO BE A SUBSTITUTE, AND THAT HIS WORK IS THE MOST
          FITTING WORK TO BE A SATISFACTION.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let every sinner here who desires something stable to fix his faith
          upon, listen to these simple truths, which I am trying to put as
          plainly as possible. You do understand me, I trust, that God must
          punish sin; that he must punish you for sin unless some one else will
          suffer in your stead; that Jesus Christ is the person who did suffer
          in the room and place of all those who ever have believed on him who
          do believe in him, or ever shall believe in him, -- making for those
          who believe on him a complete atonement by his substitution in their
          place. Now we say that Christ was the best person to be a substitute;
          for just consider what sort of a mediator was needed. Most absolutely
          he must be one who had no debt of his own. If Christ had been at all
          under the law naturally, if it had been his duty to do what it is our
          duty to do, it is plain he could only have lived for himself; and if
          he had any sin of his own, he could only have died for himself, seeing
          his obligations to do and to suffer would have been his just due to
          the righteousness and the vengeance of God. But on Christ's part there
          was no natural necessity for obedience, much less for obedience unto
          death. Who shall venture to say that the Divine Lord, amidst the
          glories of heaven, owed to his father anything? "Who shall say it was
          due to the Divine Father that Christ should be nailed to the accursed
          tree, to suffer, bleed, and die, and then be cast into the grave? None
          can dare to say such a thing. He is himself perfectly free, and
          therefore can he undertake for others. One man who is drawn for the
          militia cannot be a substitute for another person so drawn, because he
          owes for himself his own personal service. I must, if I would escape,
          and would procure a substitute, find a man who is not drawn, and who
          is therefore exempt. Such is Jesus Christ. He is perfectly exempt from
          service, and therefore can volunteer to undertake it for our sake. He
          is the right person.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was needed, also, one of the same nature with us. Such is Jesus
          Christ. For this purpose he became man, of the substance of his
          mother, very man, such a man as any of us. Handle him, and see if he
          be not flesh and bones. Look at him, and mark if he be not man in soul
          as well as in body. He hungers; he thirsts, he fears, he weeps, he
          rejoices, he loves, he dies. Made in all points and like unto us,
          being a man, and standing exactly in a man's place, becoming a real
          Adam, -- as true an Adam as was the first Adam, standing quite in the
          first Adam's place, -- he is a fit person to become a substitute for
          us.
        </p>
        <p>
          But please to observe (see if you cannot throw your grappling-hooks
          upon this), the dignity of his sacred person made him the most proper
          person for a substitute. A mere man could at most only substitute for
          one other man. Crush him as you will, and make him feel in his life
          every pang which flesh is heir to, but he can only suffer what one man
          would have suffered. He could not, I will venture to say, even then
          have suffered an equivalent for that eternal misery which the ungodly
          deserve; and if he were a mere man, he must suffer precisely the same.
          A difference may be made in the penalty, when there is a difference in
          the person; but if the person be the same, the penalty must be
          precisely and exactly the same in degree and in quality. But the
          dignity of the Son of God, the dignity of his nature, changes the
          whole matter. A God bowing his head, and suffering and dying, in the
          person of manhood, puts such a singular efficacy into every groan and
          every pang that it needs not that his pangs should be eternal, or that
          he should die a second death. Remember that in pecuniary matters you
          must give a quid pro quo, but that in matters of penal justice no such
          thing is demanded. The dignity of the person adds a special force to
          the substitution; and thus one bleeding Saviour can make atonement for
          millions of sinful men, and the Captain of our salvation can bring
          multitudes unto glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          It needs one other condition to be fulfilled. The person so free from
          personal service, and so truly in our nature, and yet so exalted in
          person, should also be accepted and ordained of God. Our text gives
          this a full solution, in that it says, "He shall make his soul an
          offering for sin." Christ did not make himself a sin-offering without
          a warrant from the Most High: God made him so. "The Lord hath laid on
          him the iniquity of us all." It was the sovereign degree of heaven
          which constituted Christ the great substitute for his people. No man
          taketh this office upon himself. Even the Son of God stoopeth not to
          this burden uncalled. He was chosen as the covenant-head in election;
          he was ordained in the divine decree to stand for his people. God the
          Father cannot refuse the sacrifice which he has himself appointed. "My
          son," said good old Abraham, "God shall provide himself a lamb for a
          burnt-offering." He has done so in the Saviour; and what God provides,
          God must and will accept.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish to-night that I had power to deal with this doctrine as I
          would. Poor trembling sinner, look up a moment. Dost thou see him
          there -- him whom God hath set forth? Dost thou see him in proper
          flesh and blood fastened to that tree? See how the cruel iron drags
          through his tender hands! Mark how the rough nails are making the
          blood flow profusely from his feet! See how fever parches his tongue,
          and dries his whole body like a potsherd! Hearest thou the cry of his
          spirit, which is suffering more than his body suffers -- "My God, my
          God, why hast thou forsaken me?" This is none other than God's
          only-begotten Son; this is he who made the worlds; this is the express
          image of his Father's person, the brightness of Jehovah's glory! What
          thinkest thou, man? Is there not enough there to satisfy God? Truly it
          has satisfied God: is there not enough there to satisfy thee? Cannot
          thy conscience rest on that? If God's appointed Christ could suffer in
          thy stead, is it not enough? What can Justice ask more? Wilt thou now
          trust Christ with thy soul? Come, now, sir, wilt thou now fall flat at
          the foot of the cross, and rest thy soul's eternal destiny in the
          pierced hands of Jesus of Nazareth? If thou wilt, then God has made
          him to be a sin-offering for thee; but if thou wilt not, beware, lest
          he whom thou wouldst not have to be thy Saviour should become thy
          Judge, and say, "Depart, thou cursed one, into everlasting fire in
          hell!"
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. We come now to our fourth remark, -- THAT CHRIST'S WORK, AND THE
          EFFECTS OF THAT WORK, ARE NOW COMPLETE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ becomes a substitute for us. We have seen how fit and proper a
          person he was to be such. We hinted that from the dignity of his
          person the pains he suffered were a good and sufficient equivalent for
          our own suffering on account of sin. But now the joyous truths come up
          that Christ's work is finished. Christ has made an atonement so
          complete that he never need suffer again. No more drops of blood; no
          more pangs of heart; no more bitterness and darkness, with exceeding
          heaviness, even unto death, are needed.
        </p>
        <p>"Tis done -- the great transaction's done."</p>
        <p>
          The death-knell of the penalty rings in the dying words of the
          Saviour, -- "It is finished." Do you ask for a proof of this? Remember
          that Jesus Christ rose again from the dead. If he had not completed
          his work of penalty-suffering, he would have been left in the tomb
          till now; our preaching would have been in vain, and your faith would
          have been in vain; ye would have been yet in your sins. But Jesus
          rose. God's sheriff's officer let him out of "durance vile" because
          the account had been discharged, and God's great Court of King's Bench
          sent down the mittimus to let the captive go free. More than that:
          Christ has ascended upon high. Think you he would have returned
          thither with unexpiated sin red upon his garments? Do you suppose he
          would have ascended to the rest and to the reward of an accomplished
          work? What! sit at his Fathers right hand to be crowned for doing
          nothing, and rest until his adversaries are made his footstool, when
          he has not performed his Father's will! Absurd! Impossible! His
          ascension in stately pomp, amidst the acclamations of angels, to the
          enjoyment of his Father's continued smile, is the sure proof that the
          work is complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Complete it is, dear brethren, not only in itself, but, as I said, in
          its effects; that is to say, that there is now complete pardon for
          every soul which believeth in Christ. You need not do anything to make
          the atonement of Christ sufficient to pardon you. It wants no eking
          out. It is not as if Christ had put so much into the scale and it was
          quivering in the balance; but your sins, for all their gravity,
          utterly ceased their pressure through the tremendous weight of his
          atonement. He has outweighed the penalty, and given double for all
          your sins. Pardon, full and free, is now presented in the name of
          Jesus, proclaimed to every creature under heaven, for sins past, for
          sins present, and for sins to come; for blasphemies and murders; for
          drunkenness and whoredom; for all manner of sin under heaven. Jesus
          Christ hath ascended up on high, and exalted he is that he may give
          repentance and remission of sin. Ye have no need of shillings to pay
          the priests; nor is baptismal water wanted to erect the pardon: there
          is no willing, doing, being, or suffering of yours required to
          complete the task. The blood has filled the fountain full: thou hast
          but to wash and be clean, and thy sins shall be gone forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Justification, too, is finished. You know the difference. Pardon takes
          away our filth, but then it leaves us naked; justification puts a
          royal robe upon us. How no rags of yours are wanted; not a stitch of
          yours is needed to perfect what Christ has done. He whom God the
          Father hath accepted as a sin offering hath perfected forever thou who
          are set apart. Ye are complete in Christ. No tears of yours, no
          penance, no personal mortifications, nay, no good works of yours, are
          wanted to make yourself complete and perfect. Take it as it is. O
          sirs! may you have grace to take it as it is freely presented to you
          in the gospel. "He that believeth on him is not condemned;" "There is
          therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus." Trust
          Christ -- implicitly trust Christ; and all that he did shall cover
          you, while all that he suffered shall cleanse you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, too, that acceptance is finished. There are the Father's
          arms, and here are you, a black sinner to-night. I do not know you,
          but it may be you have trodden the pavements, or you have gone further
          than that, and added drunkenness to shame; you have gone to the lowest
          vice, perhaps to robbery, -- who knoweth what manner of person may
          step into this place? -- but the great arms of the Eternal Father are
          ready to save you as you are, because the great work of Christ has
          effected all that is wanted before God for the acceptance of the
          vilest sinner. How is it that the Father can embrace the prodigal?
          Why! he is fresh from the swine-trough! Look at him: look at his rags;
          how foul they are! We would not touch them with a pair of tongs! Take
          him to the fire and burn the filth! Take him to the bath and wash him!
          That lip is not fit to kiss; those filthy lips cannot be permitted to
          touch that holy cheek of the glorious Father! Ah! but it is not so.
          While he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, -- rags and
          poverty and sin and filth and all, -- and he did not wait till he was
          clean, but ran and fell upon his neck and kissed him, just as he was.
          How could he do that? Why, the parable does not tell us; for it did
          not run on with the subject to introduce the atonement. But this
          explains it, -- when God accepts a sinner, he is, in fact, only
          accepting Christ. He looks into the sinner's eyes, and he sees his own
          dear Son's image there, and he takes him in. As we have heard of a
          good woman, who, whenever a poor sailor came to her door, whoever he
          might be, would always make him welcome, because, she said, "I think I
          see my own dear son who has been these many years away, and I have
          never heard of him; but whenever I see a sailor, I think of him, and
          treat the stranger kindly for my son's sake." So my God, when he sees
          a sinner long for pardon and desirous of being accepted, thinks he
          sees his Son in him, and accepts him for his Son's sake. Do not
          imagine that we preach a gospel in this place for respectable, godly
          people. No: we preach a gospel here for sinners. I heard, the other
          day, from one who told me that he believed we were saved by being
          perfect, that when we committed sin we at once fell out of God's
          mercy. Well now, supposing that were true, it would not be worth
          making a large splutter about. It would not be worth angels singing
          "Glory to God in the highest" about it, I should think. Any fool might
          know that God would accept a perfect man. But this is the thing of
          marvel, for which heaven and earth shall ring with the praises of the
          Mediator, that Jesus Christ died for the ungodly, -- that Jesus Christ
          gave himself for their sin; not for their righteousness, not for their
          good deeds. If he had looked to all eternity, he could not have seen
          anything in us worthy of so great a suffering as that which he
          endured; but he did it for charity's sake, -- for love's sake.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, in his name, -- oh that I could do it with his voice and with
          his love and with his fervor! -- I do beseech you to lay hold upon
          him. No matter who you may be, I will not exclude you from the
          invitation. Hast thou piled thy sins together till they seem to
          provoke heaven? Do thy sins touch the clouds? Yet come, and welcome;
          for God has provided a sin-offering. Has man cast thee out? Say, poor
          woman, does the dreary river seem to invite thee to the fatal plunge?
          God has not cast thee out. O thou who feelest in thine own body the
          effect of thy sin, till thou art loathing thyself, and wishing thou
          hadst never been born -- perhaps thou sayest, like John Bunyan, "Oh
          that I had been a frog, or a toad, or a snake, sooner than have been a
          man, to have fallen into such sin, and to have become so foul!" Have
          courage, sinner; have courage. "Let the wicked forsake his way, and
          the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord,
          and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will
          abundantly pardon." Do not doubt this message: God has sent it to you.
          Do not reject it: you will reject your own life if you do. Turn you at
          his rebuke! It is a loving voice which speaks to you, and that would
          speak, perhaps, better and more forcibly if it were not choked with
          love. I do implore thee, sinner, come to Jesus! If thou art damned it
          is not for want of invitation. If thou wilt perish, it is not for want
          of earnest pleading with thee. I tell thee, man, there is nothing of
          thine own wanted. All this is found in the sin-offering; for thou
          needest not find it. There is no merit of thine needed; there is merit
          enough in Christ. Is it not the old proverb that you are not to take
          coals to Newcastle? Do not take anything to Christ. Come as you are --
          just as you are. Nay, tarry not till you go out of this house. The
          Lord enable you to believe in Jesus now, to take him now as a complete
          and finished salvation for you, though you may be the most sunken and
          abandoned and hopeless of all characters. Why did God provide a
          sin-offering but for sinners? He could not have wanted to provide it
          if there was no necessity. You have a great necessity. You have, shall
          I say? compelled him to it. Your sins have nailed Christ's hands to
          the cross, -- your sins have pierced his heart; and his heart is not
          pierced in vain, nor are those hands nailed there for naught. Christ
          will have you, sinner, Christ will have you. There are some of God's
          elect here, and he will have you. You shall not stand out against him.
          Almighty love will have you. He has determined that you shall not do
          what you have vowed. Your league with hell is broken to-night, and
          your covenant with death is disannulled. The prey shall not be taken
          from the mighty; the lawful captive shall be delivered. The Lord will
          yet fetch you up from the depths of the sea. Oh! what a debtor to
          grace you will be! Be a debtor to that grace to-night. Over head and
          ears in debt, plunge yourself by a simple act of trusting in Jesus,
          and you are saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pray, ye who know how to pray, that this message may be made effective
          in the hand of God. And you who have never prayed before, God help you
          to pray now. May he now be found of them who sought not for him, and
          he shall have the glory, world without end. Amen.<br />
