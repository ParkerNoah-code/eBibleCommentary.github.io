<p align="center">PSALM 140<br/>
 </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">This Psalm is in its proper place, and so fitly follows 
    Psalm 139 that you might almost read right on, and make no break between the 
    two. Serious injury would follow to the whole Book of Psalms if the order 
    should be interfered with as certain wiseacres propose. </p>
<p align="justify">It is <i>The Cry Of A Hunted Soul</i>, the supplication 
    of a believer incessantly persecuted and beset by cunning enemies, who 
    hungered for his destruction. David was hunted like a partridge upon the 
    mountains, and seldom obtained a moment's rest. This is his pathetic appeal 
    to Jehovah for protection, an appeal which gradually intensifies into a 
    denunciation of his bitter foes. With this sacrifice of prayer, he offers 
    the salt of faith; for in a very marked and emphatic manner he expresses his 
    personal confidence in the Lord as the Protector of the oppressed, and as 
    his own God and Defender. Few short Psalms are so rich in the <i>jewelry of 
    precious faith</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">TO THE CHIEF MUSICIAN. The writer wished this 
    experimental hymn to be under the care of the chief master of song, that it 
    might neither be left unsung, nor chanted in a slovenly manner. Such <i>
    trials </i>and such <i>rescues </i>deserved to be had in remembrance, and to 
    be set up among the choicest memorials of the Lord's goodness. </p>
<p align="justify">We, too, have our songs which are of no ordinary kind, 
    and these must be sung with our best powers of heart and tongue. We will 
    offer them to the Lord by no other hand than that of "the Chief Musician."</p>
<p align="justify">A PSALM OF DAVID. The life of David wherein he comes in 
    contact with Saul and Doeg, is the best explanation of this Psalm; and 
    surely there can be no reasonable doubt that David wrote it, and wrote it in 
    the time of his exile and peril. The tremendous outburst at the end has in 
    it the warmth which was so natural to David, who was never lukewarm in 
    anything. Yet it is to be noticed that concerning his enemies he was often 
    hot in language through indignation, and yet he was cool in action, for he 
    was not revengeful. His was no petty malice, but a righteous anger. He 
    foresaw, foretold, and even desired the just vengeance of God upon the proud 
    and wicked, and yet he would not avail himself of opportunities to revenge 
    himself upon those who had done him wrong. </p>
<p align="justify">It may be that his appeals to the great King cooled his 
    anger, and enabled him to leave his wrongs unredressed by any personal act 
    of violence. "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says the Lord"; and David 
    when most wounded by undeserved persecution and wicked falsehood was glad to 
    leave his matters at the foot of the throne, where they would be safe with 
    the King of kings.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man.</p></b> It 
    reads like a clause of the Lord's prayer, "Deliver us from evil." David does 
    not so much plead against an individual as against the species represented 
    by him, namely, the being whose best description is, "the evil man." 
<p align="justify">There are many such abroad; indeed we shall not find an 
    unregenerate man who is not in some sense an evil man, and yet all are not 
    alike evil. It is well for us that our enemies are evil: it would be a 
    horrible thing to have the good against us. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">When "the evil man" bestirs himself against the godly he 
    is as terrible a being as a wolf, or a serpent, or even a devil.</p></i> Fierce, 
    implacable, unpitying, unrelenting, unscrupulous, he cares for nothing but 
    the indulgence of his malice. The persecuted man turns to God in prayer; he 
    could not do a wiser thing. Who can meet the evil man and defeat him save 
    Jehovah himself, whose infinite goodness is more than a match for all the 
    evil in the universe? 
<p align="justify">We cannot of ourselves baffle the craft of the enemy, but 
    the Lord knows how to deliver his saints. He can keep us out of the enemy's 
    reach. He can sustain us when under his power. He can rescue us when our 
    doom seems fixed. He can give us the victory when defeat seems certain. In 
    any and every case, if he does not save us from the man, he can keep us from 
    the evil. </p>
<p align="justify">Should we be at this moment oppressed in any measure by 
    ungodly men, it will be better to leave our defense with God than to attempt 
    it ourselves. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Preserve me from the violent man.</p></b> Evil in the heart 
    simmers in malice, and at last boils over in violence. Evil is a ragtag 
    thing when it gets liberty to manifest itself; and so "the evil man" soon 
    develops into "the violent man." 
<p align="justify">What watchfulness, strength, or valor can preserve the 
    child of God from deceit and violence? There is but one sure Preserver, and 
    it is our wisdom to hide under the shadow of his wings. </p>
<p align="justify">It is a common thing for godly men to be assailed by 
    enemies: David was attacked by Saul, Doeg, Ahithophel, Shimei, and others; 
    even Mordecai sitting humbly in the gate had his Haman; and our Lord, the 
    Perfect One, was surrounded by those who thirsted for his blood. We may not, 
    therefore, hope to pass through the world without enemies, but we may hope 
    to be delivered out of their hands, and preserved from their rage, so that 
    no real harm shall come of their malignity. This blessing is to be sought by 
    prayer, and expected by faith.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. Who imagine mischiefs in their heart.</p></b> They 
    cannot be happy unless they are plotting and planning, conspiring and 
    contriving. They seem to have but one heart, for they are completely agreed 
    in their malice; and with all their heart and soul they pursue their victim.
    
<p align="justify">One piece of mischief is not enough for them; they work 
    in the plural, and prepare many arrows for their bow. What they cannot 
    actually do they nevertheless like to think over, and to rehearse on the 
    stage of their cruel imagination. It is an awful thing to have such a heart 
    disease as this. When the imagination gloats over doing harm to others, it 
    is a sure sign that the entire nature is far gone in wickedness.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Continually are they gathered together for war.</p></b> They 
    are a committee of opposition in permanent session: they never adjourn, but 
    perpetually consider the all-absorbing question of how to do the most harm 
    to the man of God. They are a standing army always ready for the fray: they 
    not only go to the wars, but dwell in them. Though they are the worst of 
    company—yet they put up with one another, and are continually in each 
    other's society, confederate for fight. 
<p align="justify">David's enemies were as <i>violent </i>as they were <i>
    evil</i>, as <i>crafty </i>as they were violent, and as <i>persistent </i>as 
    they were crafty. It is hard dealing with people who are only in their 
    element when they are at daggers drawn with you. Such a case calls for 
    prayer, and prayer calls on God.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. They have sharpened their tongues like a 
    serpent.</p></b> The rapid motion of a viper's tongue gives you the idea of its 
    sharpening it; even thus do the malicious move their tongues at such a rate 
    that one might suppose them to be in the very act of wearing them to a 
    point, or rubbing them to a keen edge. It was a common notion that serpents 
    inserted their poison by their tongues, and the poets used the idea as a 
    poetic expression, although it is certain that the serpent wounds by his 
    fangs and not by his tongue. We are not to suppose that all authors who used 
    such language were mistaken in their natural history any more than a writer 
    can be charged with ignorance of astronomy because he speaks of the sun's 
    traveling from east to west. How else can poets speak but according to the 
    appearance of things to an imaginative eye. The world's great poet puts it 
    in "King Lear":
<p align="justify">"She struck me with her tongue,<br/>
 Most serpent like, upon the very heart."</p>
<p align="justify">In the case of slanderers, they so literally sting with 
    their tongues, which are so nimble in malice, and withal so piercing and 
    cutting, that it is by no means unjust to speak of them as sharpened. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Adders' poison is under their lips. </p></b><i>The deadliest 
    of all venom is the slander of the unscrupulous. </i>Some men care not what 
    they say so long as they can vex and injure. Our text, however, must not be 
    confined in its reference to some few individuals, for in the inspired 
    epistle to the Romans it is quoted by the apostle as being true of us all.
    <i>So depraved are we by nature that the most venomous creatures are our fit 
    types</i>. 
<p align="justify">The old serpent has not only inoculated us with his 
    venom, but he has caused us to be ourselves producers of the like poison—it 
    lies under our lips, ready for use, and, alas, it is all too freely used 
    when we grow angry, and desire to take vengeance upon any who have caused us 
    vexation. </p>
<p align="justify">It is sadly astonishing what hard things even godly men 
    will say when provoked; yes, even such as call themselves "perfect" in cool 
    blood are not quite as gentle as doves when their <i>claims to sinlessness
    </i>are bluntly questioned. </p>
<p align="justify">This <i>poison of evil speaking </i>would never fall from 
    our lips, however much we might be provoked, if it were not there at other 
    times; but <i>by nature we have as great a store of venomous words as a 
    cobra has of poison</i>. O Lord, take the poison bags away, and cause our 
    lips to drop nothing but honey. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Selah. </p></b>This is heavy work. Go up, go up, my heart! 
    Sink not too low. Fall not into the lowest key. Lift up yourself to God.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked.</p></b> 
    To fall into their hands would be a calamity indeed. David in his most 
    pitiable plight chose to fall into the hand of a chastising God rather than 
    to be left in the power of men. No creature among the wild beasts of the 
    forest is so terrible an enemy to man, as man himself when guided by evil, 
    and impelled by violence. 
<p align="justify">The Lord by providence and grace can keep us out of the 
    power of the wicked. He alone can do this, for neither our own watchfulness 
    nor the faithfulness of friends can secure us against the serpentine 
    assaults of the foe. We have need to be preserved from the <i>smooth </i>as 
    well as the rough hands of the ungodly, for their <i>flatteries </i>may harm 
    us as much as their calumnies. The hands of their example may pollute us, 
    and so do us more harm than the hands of their oppression. Jehovah must be 
    our keeper, or evil hands will do what evil hearts have imagined and evil 
    lips have threatened.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Preserve me from the violent man.</p></b> His intense passion 
    makes him terribly dangerous. He will strike anyhow, use any weapon, smite 
    from any quarter: he is so furious that he is reckless of his own life if he 
    may only accomplish his detestable design. Lord, preserve us by your 
    omnipotence when men attack us with their violence. This prayer is a wise 
    and suitable one. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Who have purposed to overthrow my goings. </p></b>They 
    resolve to turn the godly man from his resolve, they would defeat his 
    designs, injure his integrity, and blast his character. Their own goings are 
    wicked, and therefore they hate those of the righteous, seeing they are a 
    standing rebuke to them. 
<p align="justify">This is a forcible argument to use in prayer with God: he 
    is the patron of holiness, and when the pure lives of his people are in 
    danger of overthrow, he may be expected to interpose. Never let the pious 
    forget to pray, for this is a weapon against which the most determined enemy 
    cannot stand.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. The proud have hid a snare for me.</p></b> Proud as 
    they are, they stoop to this mean action: they use a snare, and they hide it 
    away, that their victim may be taken like a poor rabbit who is killed 
    without warning—killed in its usual run, by a snare which it could not see. 
    David's enemies wished to snare him in his path of service, the usual way of 
    his life. Saul laid many snares for David, but the Lord preserved him. 
<p align="justify">All around us there are snares of one sort or another, 
    and he will be well kept, yes, divinely kept, who never falls into one of 
    them. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And cords.</p></b> With these they pull the net together and 
    with these they bind their captive. Thus fowlers do, and trappers of certain 
    large animals. The cords of love are pleasant, but the cords of hate are 
    cruel as death itself. 
<b>
<p align="justify">They have spread a net by the wayside.</p></b> Where it will 
    be near their prey; where the slightest divergence from the path will bring 
    the victim into it. Surely the common wayside ought to be safe: men who go 
    out of the way may well be taken in a net, but the path of duty is 
    proverbially the path of safety. Yet it is safe nowhere when malicious 
    people are abroad. Birds are taken in nets, and men are taken by deceit. 
    Satan instructs his children in the art of fowling, and they right speedily 
    learn how to spread nets: perhaps they have been doing that for us already; 
    let us make our appeal to God concerning it. 
<b>
<p align="justify">They have set traps for me.</p></b> One instrument of 
    destruction is not enough; they are so afraid of missing their prey that 
    they multiply their traps, using differing devices, so that one way or 
    another they may catch their victim. Those who avoid the <i>snare </i>and 
    the <i>net </i>may yet be caught in a trap, and accordingly traps are placed 
    in all likely places. If a godly man can be cajoled, or bribed, or cowed, or 
    made angry—the wicked will make the attempt. Ready are they to twist his 
    words, misread his intentions, and misdirect his efforts. They are ready to 
    fawn, and lie, and make themselves mean to the last degree—so that they may 
    accomplish their abominable purpose. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Selah.</p></b> The harp needs tuning after such a strain, and 
    the heart needs lifting up towards God.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. I said unto the LORD, You are my God. </p></b>Here 
    was David's stay and hope. He was assured that Jehovah was his God, he 
    expressed that assurance, and he expressed it before Jehovah himself. That 
    had need be a good and full assurance, which a man dares to lay before the 
    face of the heart-searching Lord. The Psalmist when hunted by man, addressed 
    himself to God. Often the less we say to our foes, and the more we say to 
    our best Friend the better it will fare with us: if we say anything, let it 
    be said unto the Lord. 
<p align="justify">David rejoiced in the fact that he had already said that 
    Jehovah was his God. He was content to have committed himself, he had no 
    wish to draw back. The Lord was David's own by deliberate choice, to which 
    he again sets his seal with delight. </p>
<p align="justify">The wicked reject God, but the righteous receive him as 
    their own, their treasure, their pleasure, their light and delight. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.</p></b> Since you 
    are mine, I pray that you hear my cries. We cannot ask this favor of another 
    man's God, but we may seek it from our own God. The prayers of saints have a 
    voice in them; they are expressive pleadings even when they sound like 
    inarticulate moanings. The Lord can discern a voice in our waitings, and he 
    can and will hearken thereto. Because he is <i>God</i>, he <i>can </i>hear 
    us; because he is <i>our </i>God he <i>will </i>hear us. So long as the Lord 
    does but hear us we are content: the answer may be according to his own 
    will, but we do entreat to be heard. A soul in distress is grateful to any 
    one who will be kind and patient enough to hearken to its tale, but 
    specially is it thankful for an audience with Jehovah. <i>The more we 
    consider his greatness and our insignificance, his wisdom and our folly—the 
    more shall we be filled with praise when the Lord attends unto our cry.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, 
    you have covered my head in the day of battle.</p></b> When he looked back upon 
    past dangers and deliverances, the godly man felt that he would have 
    perished had not the Lord held a shield over his head. In the day of the 
    clash of arms, or of the putting on of armor (as some read it), the glorious 
    Lord had been his constant Protector. Goliath had his armor-bearer, and so 
    had Saul, and these each one guarded his master. Yet the giant and the king 
    both perished, while David, without armor or shield, slew the giant and 
    baffled the tyrant. The shield of the Eternal is a better protection than a 
    helmet of brass, When arrows fly thick and the battle axe crashes right and 
    left, there is no covering for the head like the power of the Almighty. 
<p align="justify">See how the child of providence glorifies his Preserver! 
    He calls him not only his salvation, but the strength of it, by whose 
    unrivaled force he had been enabled to outlive the cunning and cruelty of 
    his adversaries. He had obtained a deliverance in which the strength of the 
    Omnipotent was clearly to be seen. This is a grand utterance of praise, a 
    gracious ground of comfort, a prevalent argument in prayer. He who has 
    covered our head aforetime will not now desert us. Let us fight a good 
    fight, and fear no deadly wound: the Lord God is our shield, and our 
    exceeding great reward.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked.</p></b> 
    Even they are dependent upon you they can do no more than you do permit. You 
    do restrain them; not a dog of them can move his tongue without your leave 
    and license. Therefore I entreat you not to let them have their way. Even 
    though they dare to pray to you, do not hear their prayers against innocent 
    men. Assuredly the Lord Jehovah will be no accomplice with the malevolent; 
    their desires shall never be his desires; if they thirst for blood, he will 
    not gratify their cruelty. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Further not his wicked devices.</p></b> They are so united as 
    to be like one man in their wishes; but do rot hear their prayers. Though 
    hand join in hand, and they desire and design as one man—yet do not lend 
    them the aid of your providence. Do not permit their malicious schemes to 
    succeed. 
<p align="justify">The Lord may allow success to attend the policy of the 
    wicked for a time for wise reasons unknown to us, but we are permitted to 
    pray that it be not so. The petition "Deliver us from evil" includes and 
    allows such supplication.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Lest they exalt themselves.</p></b> If successful, the wicked 
    are sure to grow proud, and insult the righteous over whom they have 
    triumphed, and this is so great an evil, and so dishonoring to God, that the 
    Psalmist uses it in his pleading as an argument against their being allowed 
    to prosper. 
<p align="justify">The glory of the wicked is opposed to the glory of God. 
    If God seems to favor them they grow too high for this world, and their 
    heads strike against the heavens. Let us hope that the Lord will not allow 
    this to be. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Selah.</p></b> Here let us exalt our thoughts and praises 
    high over the heads of self-exalting sinners. The more they rise in conceit 
    the higher let us rise in confidence.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. As for the head of those that compass me about, 
    let the mischief of their own lips cover them.</p></b> To the Lord who had 
    covered his head amid the din of arms the Psalmist appeals against his foes, 
    that their heads may be covered in quite another sense—covered with the 
    wages of their own malice. David's foes were so many that they hemmed him 
    in, encircling him as hunters do their prey. It is little wonder that he 
    turns to the Lord in his dire need.
<p align="justify">The poet represents his adversaries as so united as to 
    have but one head; for there is often a unanimity among evil spirits which 
    makes them the more strong and terrible for their vile purposes. The <i>law 
    of retaliation</i>, often brings down upon violent men the evil which they 
    planned and spoke of for others: their arrows fall upon themselves. When a 
    man's lips vent curses they will probably, like chickens, come home to 
    roost. A stone hurled upward into the air, is apt to fall upon the thrower's 
    head. </p>
<p align="justify">David's words may be read in the future as a prophecy; 
    but in this verse, at any rate, there is no need to do so in order to soften 
    their tone. It is so <i>just </i>that the mischief which men plot and the 
    slander which they speak should recoil upon themselves that every righteous 
    man must desire it: he who does not desire it may wish to be considered 
    humane and Christlike, but the chances are that he has a sneaking agreement 
    with the wicked, or is deficient in a manly sense of right and wrong. </p>
<p align="justify">When evil men fall into pits which they have dug for the 
    innocent, we believe that even the angels are glad. Certainly the most 
    gentle and tender of philanthropists, however much they pity the sufferers, 
    must also approve the justice which makes them suffer. We suspect that some 
    of our excessively soft-spoken critics only need to be put into David's 
    place, and they would become a vast deal more bitter than he ever was.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. Let burning coals fall upon them. </p></b>Then will 
    they know that the scattering of the firebrands is not the sport they 
    thought it to be. When hailstones and coals of fire descend upon them, how 
    will they escape? Even the skies above the wicked are able to deal out 
    vengeance upon them. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Let them be cast into the fire.</p></b> They have kindled the 
    flames of strife, and it is fair that they should be cast therein. They have 
    heated the furnace of slander seven times hotter than it was accustomed to 
    be heated—and they shall be devoured therein. Who would have pitied 
    Nebuchadnezzar if he had been thrown into his own burning fiery furnace?
<b>
<p align="justify">Into deep pits, that they rise not up again.</p></b> They 
    made those ditches for the godly, and it is meet that they should themselves 
    fall into them and never escape. When a righteous man falls he rises again; 
    but when the wicked man goes down "he falls like Lucifer, never to hope 
    again."
<p align="justify">The Psalmist in this passage graphically depicts the 
    Sodom of the wicked persecutor: fire falls upon him from Heaven; the city 
    blazes, and he is cast into the conflagration; the valley of Siddim is full 
    of slime pits, and into these he is hurried. <i>Extraordinary judgment 
    overtakes the extraordinary offender</i>—above, around, beneath, all is 
    destruction. He would have consumed the righteous, and now he is consumed 
    himself. So shall it be—so let it be.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. Let not an evil speaker be established in the 
    earth.</p></b> For that would be an established plague, a perpetual curse. <i>
    Men of false and cruel tongues are of most use when they go to fatten the 
    soil in which they rot as carcases. </i>While they are alive they are the 
    terror of the godly, and the torment of the poor. God will not allow the 
    specious orators of falsehood, to retain the power they temporarily obtain 
    by their deceitful speaking. They may become prominent, but they cannot 
    become permanent. They shall be disendowed and disestablished in spite of 
    all that they can say to the contrary. All evil bears the element of decay 
    within itself; for what is it but corruption? 
<p align="justify">Hence the utmost powers of oratory are insufficient to 
    settle upon a sure foundation the cause which bears a lie within it.<i> Evil 
    shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him. He hunted the good, and now his 
    own evil shall hunt him. </i>He tried to overthrow the goings of the 
    righteous, and now his own unrighteousness shall prove his overthrow. As he 
    was violent, so shall he be violently assaulted and hunted down. </p>
<p align="justify">Sin is its own punishment; a violent man will need no 
    direr doom than to reap what he has sown. <i>It is horrible for a huntsman 
    to be devoured by his own hounds</i>; yet this is the sure fate of the 
    persecutor.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of 
    the afflicted, and the right of the poor.</p></b> All through the Psalm the 
    writer is bravely confident, and speaks of things about which he had no 
    doubt: in fact, no Psalm can be more grandly positive than this protest 
    against slander. The slandered saint knew Jehovah's care for the afflicted, 
    for he had received actual proofs of it himself. 
<p align="justify">"I will maintain it" is the motto of the great Defender 
    of the rights of the needy. What confidence this should create within the 
    bosoms of the persecuted and poverty stricken! The prosperous and wealthy 
    can maintain their own cause, but those who are otherwise shall find that <i>
    God helps those who cannot help themselves</i>. Many talk as if the poor had 
    no rights worth noticing, but they will sooner or later find out their 
    mistake when the Judge of all the earth begins to plead with them.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto 
    your name. </p></b>The former Psalm had its "surely", but this is a more 
    pleasing one.<i> As surely as God will slay the wicked—he will save the 
    oppressed</i>, and fill their hearts and mouths with praises. Whoever else 
    may be silent, the righteous will give thanks; and whatever they may suffer, 
    the matter will end ill their living through the trial, and magnifying the 
    Lord for his delivering grace. 
<p align="justify">On earth before long, and in Heaven forever, the pure in 
    heart shall sing unto the Lord. How loud and sweet will be the songs of the 
    redeemed in the millennial age, when the meek shall inherit the earth, and 
    delight themselves in the abundance of peace! </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The upright shall dwell in your presence.</p></b> Thus shall 
    they give thanks in the truest and fullest manner. This abiding before the 
    Lord shall render to him "songs without words", and therefore all the more 
    spiritual and true. Their living and walking with their God shall be their 
    practical form of <i>gratitude</i>. Sitting down in holy peace, like 
    children at their father's table, their joyful looks and language shall 
    speak their high esteem and fervent love to him who has become their 
    dwelling place. 
<p align="justify">How high have we climbed in this Psalm—from being hunted 
    by the evil man, to dwelling in the divine presence; so does faith upraise 
    the saint from the lowest depths to heights of peaceful repose. Well might 
    the song be studded with <i>Selahs</i>, or uplifters.</p>
