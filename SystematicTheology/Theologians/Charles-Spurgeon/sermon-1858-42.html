        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.206)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, July 25, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens</p>
        <p>
          |I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes.| -- Hosea 12:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHEN THE LORD would win his people Israel from their iniquities, he
          did not leave a stone unturned, but gave them precept upon precept,
          line upon line, here a little and there a little. He taught them
          sometimes with a rod in his hand, when he smote them with sore famine
          and pestilence, and invasion; at other times he sought to win them
          with bounties, for he multiplied their corn and their wine and their
          oil, and he laid no famine upon them. But all the teachings of his
          providence were unavailing, and whilst his hand was stretched out,
          still they continued to rebel against the Most High. He hewed them by
          the prophets. He sent them first one, and then another: the golden
          mouthed Isaiah was followed by the plaintive Jeremy; while at his
          heels in quick succession, there followed many far-seeing,
          thunder-speaking seers. But though prophet followed prophet in quick
          succession, each of them uttering the burning words of the Most High,
          yet they would have none of his rebukes, but they hardened their
          hearts, and went on still in their iniquities. Among the rest of God's
          agencies for striking their attention and their conscience, was the
          use of similitudes. The prophets were accustomed not only to preach,
          but to be themselves as signs and wonders to the people. For instance,
          Isaiah named his child, Maher-shalal-hash-baz, that they might know
          that the judgment of the Lord was hastening upon them; and this child
          was ordained to be a sign, |for before the child shall have knowledge
          to cry, my father and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil
          of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.| On another
          occasion, the lord said unto Isaiah, |Go and loose the sackcloth from
          off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so,
          walking naked and barefoot. And the Lord said, |Like as my servant
          Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and
          wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia; so shall the king of Assyria lead
          away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives young and
          old, naked and barefoot, to the shame of Egypt.| Hosea, the prophet,
          himself had to teach the people by a similitude. You will notice in
          the first chapter a most extraordinary similitude. The Lord said to
          him, |Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms; for the land hath
          committed great whoredom, departing from the Lord,| and he did so; and
          the children begotten by this: marriage, were made as signs and
          wonders to the people. As for his first son he was to be called
          Jezreel, |for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of
          Jezreel upon the house of Jehu.| As for his daughter, she was to be
          called Lo-ruhamah |for I will no more have mercy upon the house of
          Israel; but I will utterly take them away.| Thus by divers significant
          signs, God made the people think. He made his prophets do strange
          things, in order that the people might talk about what he had done,
          and then the meaning which God would have them learn, should come home
          more powerfully to their consciences, and be the better remembered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it struck me that God is every day preaching to us by similitudes.
          When Christ was on earth he preached in parables, and, though he is in
          heaven now, he is preaching in parables to-day. Providence is God's
          sermon. The things which we see about us are God's thoughts and God's
          words to us; and if we were but wise there is not a step that we take,
          which me should not find to be full of mighty instruction. O ye sons
          of men! God warns you every day by his own word; he speaks to you by
          the lips of his servants, his ministers; but, besides this, by
          similitudes he addresses you at every time. He leaves no stone
          unturned to bring his wandering children to himself, to make the lost
          sheep of the house of Israel return to the fold. In addressing myself
          to you this morning, I shall endeavor to show how every day, and every
          season of the year, in every place, and in every calling which you are
          made to exercise, God is speaking to you by similitudes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. EVERY DAY God speaks to you by similitudes. Let us begin with the
          early morning. This morning you awakened and you found yourselves
          unclothed, and you began to array yourselves in your garments. Did not
          God, if you would but have heard him, speak to you by a similitude?
          Did he not as much as say to thee, |Sinner, what will it be when thy
          vain dreams shall have ended, if thou shouldst wake up in eternity to
          find thyself naked? Wherewithal shalt thou array thyself? If in this
          life thou dost cast away the wedding garment, the spotless
          righteousness of Jesus Christ, what wilt thou do when the trump of the
          archangel shall awaken thee from thy clay cold couch in the grave,
          when the heavens shall be blazing with lightnings, and the solid
          pillars of the earth shall quake with the terror of God's thunder? How
          wilt thou be able to dress thyself then? Canst thou confront thy Maker
          without a covering for thy nakedness? Adam dared not, and canst thou
          attempt it? Will he not affright thee with his terrors? Will he not
          cast thee to the tormentors that thou mayest be burned up with
          unquenchable fire, because thou didst forget the clothing of thy soul
          while thou wast in this place of probation?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, you have put on your dress, and you come down to your families,
          and your Children gather round your table for the morning meal. If you
          have been wise God has been preaching to you by a similitude then: he
          seemed to say to thee -- |Sinner, to whom should a child go but to his
          father? And where should be his resort when he is hungry but to his
          father's table?| And as you feed your children, if you had an ear to
          hear, the Lord was speaking to you and saying, |How willingly would I
          feed you! How would I give you of the bread of heaven and cause you to
          eat angels, food! But thou hast spent thy money for that which is not
          bread, and thy labor for that which not. Hearken diligently unto me,
          and eat ye that which is good, let thy soul delight itself in
          fatness.| Did he not stand there as a Father, and say, |Come my child,
          come to my table. The precious blood of my Son has been shed to be thy
          drink, and he has given his body to be thy bread. Why wilt thou wander
          hungry and thirsty? Come to my table O, my child, for I love my
          children to be there and to feast upon the mercies I have provided.|
        </p>
        <p>
          You left your home and you went to your business. I knew not in what
          calling your time was occupied -- of that we will say more before we
          shall have gathered up the ends of your similitudes this morning --
          but you spend your time in your work; and surely, beloved, All the
          time that your fingers were occupied, God was speaking to your heart,
          if the ears of your soul had not been closed, so that you were heavy
          and ready to slumber, and could not hear his voice And when the sun
          was shining in high heaven, and the hour of noon was reached, mightest
          thou not bare lifted up thine eye and remembered that if thou hadst
          committed thy soul to God, thy path should have been as the shining
          light which shineth more and more unto the perfect day? Did he not
          speak to thee and say, |I brought the sun from the darkness of the
          east; I have guided him and helped him to ascend the slippery steeps
          of heaven and now he standeth in his zenith, like a giant that hath
          run his race, and hath attained his goal. And even so will I do with
          thee. Commit thy ways unto me and I will make thee full of light, and
          thy path shall be as brightness, and thy life shall be as the
          noon-day: thy sun shall not go down by day, but the days of thy
          mourning shall be ended, for the Lord God shall be thy light, and thy
          salvation.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And the sun began to set, and the shadows of evening were drawing on,
          and did not the Lord then remind thee of thy death? Suns have their
          setting, and men have their graves. When the shadows of the evening
          were stretched out, and when the darkness began to gather, did he not
          say unto thee, |O man, take heed of thine eventide, for the light of
          the sun shall not endure for ever? There are twelve hours wherein a
          man shall work, but when they are past there is no work nor device in
          the night of that grave whither we are all hastening. Work while ye
          have the light, for the night cometh wherein no man can work.
          Therefore, whatsoever thine hand findeth to do, do it with all thy
          might.| Look I say to the sun at his setting and observe the rainbow
          hues of glory with which he paints the sky, and mark how he appears to
          increase his orb as he nears the horizon. O man kneel down and learn
          this prayer, -- |Lord, let my dying be like the setting of the sun;
          help me, if clouds and darkness are round about me, to light them up
          with splendor; surround me, O my God, with a greater brightness at my
          death than I have shown in all my former life. If my death-bed shall
          be the miserable pallet, and if I expire in some lone cot yet
          nevertheless, grant, O Lord, that my poverty may be gilded with the
          light that thou shalt give me, that I may exhibit the grandeur of a
          Christian's departure at my dying hour.| God speaketh to thee, O man,
          by similitude, from the rising to the setting of the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, thou hast lit thy candle and thou sittest down; thy children
          are about thee. and the Lord sends thee a little preacher to preach
          thee a sermon, if thou wilt hear. It is a little gnat, and it flieth
          round and round about thy candle, and delighteth itself in the light
          thereof, till, dazzled and intoxicated, it begins to singe its wings
          and burn itself. Thou seekest to put it away, but it dashes into the
          flame, and having burned itself it can scarcely fan itself through the
          air again. But as soon as it has recruited its strength again,
          mad-like it dashes to its death and destruction. Did not the Lord say
          to thee, |Sinner, thou art doing this also, thou lovest the light of
          sin; oh! that thou wert wise enough to tremble at the fire of sin, for
          he who delights in the sparks thereof, must be consumed in the
          burning!| Did not the hand seem to be like the hand of thy Almighty,
          who would put thee away from thine own destruction, and who rebukes
          and smites thee by his providence, as much as to say to thee, |Poor
          silly man be not thine own destruction.| And whilst thou seest perhaps
          with a little sorrow the death of the foolish insect, might not that
          forewarn thee of thine awful doom. when, after having been dazzled
          with the giddy round of this world's joys, thou shalt at last plunge
          into the eternal burning and lose thy soul, so madly, for nothing but
          the enjoyments of an hour? Doth not God preach to thee thus?
        </p>
        <p>
          And now it is time for thee to retire to thy rest. Thy door is bolted,
          and thou hast fast closed it. Did not that remind thee of that saying,
          |When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut-to the
          door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door saying,
          Lord, Lord, open unto us;' and he shall answer and say unto you, I
          know not whence you are?| in vain shall be your knocking then, when
          the bars of immutable justice shall have fast closed the gates of
          mercy on mankind; when the hand of the Almighty Master shall have shut
          his children within the gates of Paradise, and shall have left the
          thief and the robber in the cold chilly darkness, the outer darkness,
          where there shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth. Did he
          not preach to thee by similitude? Even then, when thy finger was on
          the bolt, might not his finger have been on thy heart?
        </p>
        <p>
          And at night time thou wast startled. The watchman in the street awoke
          thee with the cry of the hour of the night, or his tramp along the
          street. O man, if thou hadst ears to hear, thou mightest have heard in
          the steady tramp of the policeman the cry, |Behold, the bridegroom
          cometh; go ye out to meet him.| And every sound at midnight that did
          awaken thee from thy slumber and startle thee upon thy bed, might seem
          to forewarn thee of that dread trump of the archangel which shall
          herald the coming of the Son of Man, in the day he shall judge both
          the quick and the dead, according to my gospel. O that ye were wise,
          that ye understood this, for all the day long, from dewy morning till
          the darkness of the eventide, and the thick darkness of midnight, God
          evermore doth preach to man -- he preacheth to him by similitudes.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now we turn the current of our thoughts, and observe that ALL
          THE YEAR round God doth preach to man by similitudes. It was but a
          little while ago that we were sowing our seeds in our garden, and
          scattering the corn over the broad furrows. God had sent the seed
          time, to remind us that we too are like the ground, and that he is
          scattering seed in our hearts each day. And did he not say to us,
          |Take heed, O man, lest thou shouldest be like the highway whereon the
          seed was scattered, the fowls of the air devoured it. Take heed that
          thou be not like the ground that had its basement on a hard and arid
          rock, lest this seed should spring up and by-and-bye should wither
          away when the sun arose, because it had not much depth of earth. And
          be thou careful, O son of man, that thou art not like the ground where
          the seed did spring up, but the thorns sprang up and choked it; but be
          thou like the good ground whereon the seed did fall, and it brought
          forth fruit, some twenty, some fifty, and some a hundred fold.|
        </p>
        <p>
          We thought, when are were sowing the seed, that we expected one day to
          see it spring up again. Was there not a lesson for us there? Are not
          our actions all of them as seeds? Are not our little words like grains
          of mustard seed? Is not our daily conversation like a handful of the
          corn that we scatter over the soil? And ought we not to remember that
          our words shall live again, that our acts are as immortal as
          ourselves, that after having laid a little while in the dust to be
          matured, they shall certainly arise? The black deeds of sin shall bear
          a dismal harvest of damnation; and the right deeds which God's grace
          has permitted us to do, shall, through his mercy and not through our
          merit, bring forth a bounteous harvest in the day when they who sow in
          tears slowly reap in joy. Doth not seed-time preach to thee, O man,
          and say, |Take heed that thou sowest good seed in thy field.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And when the seed sprang up, and the season had changed, did God cease
          then to preach? Ah! no. First the blade, then the ear, and then the
          full corn in the ear, had each its homily. And when at last the
          harvest came, how loud the sermon which it preached to us! It said to
          us, |O Israel, I have set a harvest for thee. Whatsoever a man soweth
          that shall he also reap. He that soweth to the flesh shall of the
          flesh reap corruption, and he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the
          Spirit reap life everlasting.| If you have an opportunity to journey
          into the country during the next three weeks, you will, if your heart
          is rightly attuned, find a marvellous mass of wisdom couched in a
          cornfield. Why I could not attempt for a moment to open the mighty
          mines of gabled treasure which are hidden there. Think, beloved, of
          the joy of thy harvest. How does it tell us of the joy of the redeemed
          if we, being saved, shall at last be carried like shocks of corn fully
          ripe into the garner. Look at the ear of corn when it is fully ripe,
          and see how it bendeth toward the earth! It held its head erect
          before, but in getting ripe how humble does it become! And how does
          God speak to the sinner and tell him, that if he would be fit for the
          great harvest he must drop his head and cry |Lord hare mercy upon me a
          sinner.| And when we see the weeds spring up amongst wheat, have we
          not our Master's parable over again of the tares among the wheat; and
          are we not reminded of the great day of division, when he shall say to
          the reaper, |Gather first the tares and bind them in bundles, to burn
          them; but gather the wheat into my barn.| O yellow field of corn, thou
          preaches well to me, for thou safest to me, the minister, |Behold, the
          fields are ripe already to the harvest. Work thou thyself; and pray
          thou the Lord of the harvest to send forth more laborers into the
          harvest.| And it preaches well to thee, thou man of years, it tells
          thee that the sickle of death is sharp, and that thou must soon fall,
          but it cheers and comforts thee, for it tells thee that the wheat
          shall be safely housed, and it bids thee hope that thou shalt be
          carried to thy Master's garner to be his joy and his delight for ever.
          Hark, then, to the rustling eloquence of the yellow harvest.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a very little time, my beloved, you will see the birds congregated
          upon the housetops in great multitudes, and after they have whirled
          round and round and round as if they were taking their last sight of
          Old England, or rehearsing their supplications before they launched
          away, you will see them, with their leader in advance, speed across
          the purple sea to live in sunnier climes, while winter's cold hand
          shall strip their native woods. And doth not God seem to preach to
          you, sinners, when these birds are taking their flight? Do you not
          remember how he himself puts it? |Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth
          her appointed times; and the turtle, and the crane, and the swallow,
          observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment
          of the Lord.| Doth he not tell us that there is a time of dark winter
          coming upon this world; a time of trouble, such as there has been none
          like it, neither shall be any more; a time, when all the joys of sin
          shall be nipped and frost-bitten, and when the summer of man's estate
          shall be turned into the dark winter of his disappointment? And does
          he not say to you, |Sinner fly away -- away -- away to the goodly
          land, where Jesus dwells! Away from self and sin! Away from the city
          of destruction! Away from the whirl of pleasures, and from the tossing
          to and fro of trouble! Haste thee, like a bird to its rest! Fly thou
          across the sea of repentance and faith and build thy nest in the land
          of mercy, that when the great day of vengeance shall pass o'er this
          world, thou mayest be safe in the clefts of the rock.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember well, how once God preached to me by a similitude in the
          depth of winter The earth had been black, and there was scarcely a
          green thing or a flower to be seen. As you looked across the field,
          there was nothing but blackness -- bare hedges and leafless trees, and
          black, black earth, wherever you looked. On a sudden God spake and
          unlocked the treasures of the snow, and white flakes descended until
          there was no blackness to be seen, and all was one sheet of dazzling
          whiteness. It was at that time that I was seeking the Saviour, and it
          was then I found him; and I remember well that sermon which I say,
          before me: |Come now, and let us reason together; though your sins be
          as scarlet they shall be as snow, though they be red like crimson they
          shall be whiter than wool.| Sinner! thy heart is like that black
          ground; thy soul is like that black tree and hedgerow, without leaf or
          blossom. God's grace is like the white snow -- it shall fall upon thee
          till thy doubting heart shall glitter in whiteness of pardon, and thy
          poor black soul shall be covered with the spotless purity of the Son
          of God. He seems to say to you, |Sinner, you are black, but I am ready
          to forgive you; I will wrap thy heart in the ermine of my Son's
          righteousness, and with my Son's own garments on, thou shalt be holy
          as the Holy One.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And the wind of to-day, as it comes howling through the trees, -- many
          of which have been swept down, -- reminds us of the Spirit of the
          Lord, which, |bloweth where it listeth,| and when it pleaseth; and it
          tells us to seek earnestly after that divine and mysterious influence,
          which alone can speed us on our voyage to heaven; which shall cast
          down the trees of our pride, and tear up by the roots the goodly
          cedars of our self confidence; which shall shake our refuges of lies
          about our ears, and make us look to Him who is the only covert from
          the storm, the only shelter when |the blast of the terrible ones is as
          a storm against the wall.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Ay, and when the heat is coming down, and we hide ourselves beneath
          the shadow of the tree, an angel standeth there, and whispereth, |Look
          upwards, sinner, as thou hidest thyself from the burning rays of Sol
          beneath the tree; so there is One who is like the apple tree among the
          trees of the wood, and he bids thee come and take shadow beneath his
          branches, for he will screen thee from the eternal vengeance of God,
          and give thee shelter when the fierce heat of God's anger shall beat
          upon the heads of wicked men.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now again, EVERY PLACE to which you journey, every animal
          that you see, every spot you visit, has a sermon for you. Go into your
          farm-yard, and your ox and your ass shall preach to you. |The ox
          knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib; but Israel doth not
          know, my people doth not consider.| The very dog at your heels may
          rebuke you. He follows his master; a stranger will he not follow, for
          he knows not the voice of a stranger, but ye forsake your God and turn
          aside unto your crooked ways. Look at the chicken by the side of
          yonder pond, and let it rebuke your ingratitude. It drinks, and every
          sip it takes it lifts its head to heaven and thanks the giver of the
          rain for the drink afforded to it; while thou eatest and drinkest, and
          there is no blessing pronounced at thy meals and no thanksgiving
          bestowed upon thy Father for his bounty. The very horse is checked by
          the bridle, and the whip is for the ass; but thy God hath bridled thee
          by his commandments, and he hath chastened by his providence, yet art
          thou more obstinate than the ass or the mule; still thou wilt not run
          in his commandments, but thou turnest aside, wilfully and wickedly
          following out the perversity of thine own heart. Is it not so? Are not
          these things true of you? If you are still without God and without
          Christ, must not these things strike your conscience? Would not any
          one of them lead you to tremble before the Most High, and beg of him
          that he would give you a new heart and a right spirit, and that no
          longer you might be as the beasts of the field, but might be a man
          full of the Divine Spirit, living in obedience to your Creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          And in journeying, you have noticed how often the road is rough with
          stones, and you have murmured because of the way over which you have
          to tread; and have you not thought that those stones were helping to
          make the road better, and that the worst piece of road when mended
          with hard stones would in time become smooth and fit to travel on? And
          did you think how often God has mended you; how many stones of
          affliction he has cast upon you; how many waggon-loads of warnings you
          have had spread out upon you, and you have been none the better, but
          have only grown worse, and when he comes to look on you to see whether
          your life has become smooth, whether the highway of your moral conduct
          has become more like the king's highway of righteousness, how might he
          say, |Alas! I have repaired this road, but it is none the better; let
          it alone until it becomes a very bog and quagmire, until he who keeps
          it thus ill shall have perished in it himself.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And thou hast gone by the sea-side, and has not the sea talked to
          thee? Inconstant as the sea art thou, but thou art not one-half so
          obedient. God keeps the sea, the mountain-waved sea, in check with a
          belt of sand; he spreads the sand along the sea-shore and even the sea
          observes the landmark. |Fear ye not me? saith the Lord: will ye not
          tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of
          the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the
          waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they
          roar, yet can they not pass over it?| It is so. Let thy conscience
          prick thee. The sea obeys Him from shore to shore, and yet thou wilt
          not have him to be thy God, but thou sayest, |Who is the Lord that I
          should fear him? Who is Jehovah that I should acknowledge his sway?|
        </p>
        <p>
          Hear the mountains and the hills, for they have a lesson. Such is God.
          He abideth for ever, think not that he shall change.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, sinner, I entreat thee to open thine eyes as thou goest home
          today and if nothing that I have said shall smite thee, perhaps God
          shall put into thy way something that shall give thee a text, from
          which thou mayest preach to thyself a sermon that never shall be
          forgotten. Oh! if I had but time, and thought, and words, I would
          bring the things that are in heaven above, and in the earth beneath
          and in the waters under the earth, and I would set them all before
          thee, and they should every one give their warning before they had
          passed from thine inspection, and I know that their voice would be,
          |Consider the Lord thy Creator and fear and serve him, for he hath
          made thee, and thou hast not made thyself;| we obey him, and we find
          it is our beauty to be obedient, and our glory ever to move according
          to his will; and thou shalt find it to be the same.| Obey him while
          thou mayest, lest haply when this life is over all these things shall
          rise up against thee, and the stone in the street shall clamor for the
          condemnation, and the beam out of the wall shall bear witness against
          thee, and the beasts of the field shall be thine accusers, and the
          valley and hill shall begin to curse thee. O man, the earth is made
          for thy warning. God would have thee he saved. He hath set hand-posts
          everywhere in nature and in providence, pointing thee the way to the
          City of Refuge, and if thou art but wise thou needest not miss thy
          way; it is but thy wilful ignorance and thy neglect that shall cause
          thee to run on in the way of error, for God hath made the way straight
          before thee and given thee every encouragement to run therein.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And now, lest I should weary you, I will just notice that every
          man in his CALLING has a sermon preached to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The farmer has a thousand sermons; I have brought them out already;
          let him open wide his eye, and he shall see more. He need not go an
          inch without hearing the songs of angels, and the voice of spirits
          wooing him to righteousness, for all nature round about him has a
          tongue given to it, when man hath an ear to hear.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are others, however, engaged in a business which allows them to
          see but very little of nature, and yet even there God has provided
          them with a lesson. There is the baker who provides us with our bread.
          He thrusts his fuel into the oven, and he causeth it to glow with
          heat, and puts bread therein. Well may he if he be an ungodly man,
          tremble as he stands at the oven's mouth, for there is a text which he
          may well comprehend as he stands there: |For the day cometh that shall
          burn as an oven, and all the proud and they that do wickedly shall be
          as stubble; they shall be consumed.| Men ingather them in bundles and
          cast them into the fire, and they are burned. Out of the oven's mouth
          comes a hot and burning warning, and the man's heart might melt like
          wax within him if he would but regard it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then see the butcher. How doth the beast speak to him? He sees the
          lamb almost lick his knife, and the bullock goes unconsciously to the
          slaughter. How might he think every time that he smites the
          unconscious animal, (who knows nothing of death), of his own. doom.
          Are we not, all of us who are without Christ, fattening for the
          slaughter? Are we not more foolish than the bullock, for doth not the
          wicked man follow his executioner, and walk after his own destroyer
          into the very chambers of hell? When we see a drunkard pursuing his
          drunkenness, or an unchaste man running in the way of licentiousness,
          is he not as an ox going to the slaughter, until a dart smite him
          through the liver? Hath not God sharpened his knife and made ready his
          axe that the fatlings of this earth may he killed, when he shall say
          to the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field, |Behold, I have
          made a feast of vengeance for you, and ye shall feast upon the blood
          of the slain, and make yourselves drunken with the streams thereof?|
          Ay butcher, there is a lecture for you in your trade; and your
          business may reproach you.
        </p>
        <p>
          And ye whose craft is to sit still all day, making shoes far our feet,
          the lapstone in your lap may reproach you, for your heart, perhaps, is
          as hard as that. Have you not been smitten as often as your lapstone,
          and yet your heart has never been broken or melted? And what shall the
          Lord say to you at last, when your stony heart being still within you,
          he shall condemn you and cast you away because you would have none of
          his rebukes and would not turn at the voice of his exhortation?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let the brewer remember that as he brews he must drink. Let the potter
          tremble lest he be like a vessel marred upon the wheel. Let the
          printer take heed, that his life be set in heavenly type, and not in
          the black letter of sin. Painter, beware! for paint will not suffice,
          we must have unvarnished realities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others of you are engaged in business where you are continually using
          scales and measures. Might you not often put yourselves into those
          scales? Might you not fancy you saw the great Judge standing by with
          his Gospel in one scale and you in the other, and solemnly looking
          down upon you, saying, |Mene, mene, tekel, -- thou art weighed in the
          balances and found wanting.| Some of you use the measure, and when you
          have measured out, you cut off the portion that your customer
          requires. Think of your life too, it is to be of a certain length, and
          every year brings the measure a little farther, and at last there come
          the scissors that shall clip off your life, and it is done. How
          knowest thou when thou art come to the last inch? What is that disease
          thou hast about thee, but the first snip of the scissors? What is that
          trembling in thy bones, that failing in thy eyesight, that fleeing of
          thy memory, that departure off thy youthful vigor, but the first rent?
          How soon shalt thou be rent in twain, the remnant of thy days past
          away, and thy years all numbered and gone, misspent and wasted for
          ever!
        </p>
        <p>
          But you say you are engaged as a servant and your occupations are
          diverse. Then diverse are the lectures God preaches to you. |A servant
          waits for his wages and the hireling fulfilleth his day.| There is a
          similitude for thee, when thou hast fulfilled thy day on earth, and
          shalt take thy wages at last. Who then is thy master? Art thou serving
          Satan and the lusts of the flesh, and wilt thou take out thy wages at
          hast in the hot metal of destruction? or art thou serving the fair
          prince Emmanuel, and shalt thy wages be the golden crowns of heaven?
          Oh! happy art thou if thou servest a good master, for according to thy
          master shall be thy reward; as is thy labor such shall the end be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or thou art one that guideth the pen, and from hour to hour wearily
          thou writest. Ah! man, know that thy life is a writing. When thy hand
          is not on the pen, thou art a writer still; thou art always writing
          upon the pages of eternity; thy sins thou art writing or else thy holy
          confidence in him that loved thee. Happy shall it be for thee, O
          writer, if thy name is written in the Lamb's book of life, and if that
          black writing of thine, in the history of thy pilgrimage below, shall
          have been blotted out with the red blood of Christ, and thou shalt
          hare written upon thee the fair name of Jehovah, to stand legible for
          ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or perhaps thou art a physician or a chemist; thou prescribest or
          preparest medicines for man's body. God stands there by the side of
          thy pestle and thy mortar, and by the table where thou writest thy
          prescriptions, and he says to thee, |Man, thou art sick; I can
          prescribe for thee. The blood and righteousness of Christ, laid hold
          of by faith, and applied by the Spirit, can cure thy soul I can
          compound a medicine for thee that shall rid thee of thy sins and bring
          thee to the place where the inhabitants shall no more say, I am sick.'
          Wilt thou take my medicine or wilt thou reject it? Is it bitter to
          thee, and dost thou turn away from it? Come, drink my child, drink,
          for thy life lieth here; and how shalt thou escape if thou neglect so
          great salvation?| Do you cast iron, or melt lead, or fuse the hard
          metals of the mines? then pray that the Lord may melt thine heart and
          cast thee in the mould of the gospel? Do you make garments for men?
          oh, be careful that you find a garment for yourself for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Are you busy in building all day long, laying the stone upon its
          fellow and the mortar in its crevice? Then remember thou art building
          for eternity too. Oh that thou mayest thyself be built upon a good
          foundation! Oh that thou mayest build thereon, not wood, hay, or
          stubble, but gold, and silver, and precious stones, and things that
          will abide the fire! Take care man lest thou shouldest be God's
          scaffold, lest thou shouldest be used on earth to be a scaffolding for
          building his church, and when his church is built thou shouldest be
          cast down and burned up with fire unquenchable. Take heed that thou
          art built upon a rock, and not upon the sand, and that the vermillion
          cement of the Saviour's precious blood unites thee to the foundation
          of the building, and to every stone thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
          Art thou a jeweller, and dost thou cut thy gem and polish the diamond
          from day to day? Would to God thou wouldest take warning from the
          contrast which thou presentest to the stone on which thou dost
          exercise thy craft. Thou cuttest it, and it glitters the more thou
          dost cut it; but though thou hast been cut and ground, though thou
          hast had cholera and fever, and hast been at death's door many a day,
          thou art none the brighter, but the duller, for alas! thou art no
          diamond. Thou art but the pebble-stone of the brook, and in the day
          when God makes up his jewels he shall not enclose thee in the casket
          of his treasures; for thou art not one of the precious sons of Zion,
          comparable unto fine gold. But be thy situation what it may, be thy
          calling what it may, there is a continual sermon preached to thy
          conscience. I could that thou wouldest now from this time forth open
          both eye and ear, and see and hear the things that God would teach
          thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, dropping the similitude while the clock shall tick but a few
          times more, let us put the matter thus -- Sinner, thou art as yet
          without God and without Christ; thou art liable to death every hour.
          Thou canst not tell but that thou mayest be in the flames of hell
          before the clock shall strike ONE to-day. Thou art to-day |condemned
          already,| because thou believest not in the Son of God. And Jesus
          Christ saith to thee this day, |Oh, that thou wouldest consider thy
          latter end!| He cries to thee this morning, |How often would I have
          gathered thee as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye
          would not.| I entreat you, consider your ways. If it be worth while to
          make your bed in hell do it. If the pleasures of this world are worth
          being damned to all eternity for enjoying them, if heaven be a cheat
          and hell a delusion, go on in your sins. But, if there be hell for
          sinners and heaven for repenting ones, and if thou must dwell a whole
          eternity in one place or the other, without similitude, I put a plain
          question to thee -- Art thou wise in living as thou dost, without
          thought, -- careless, and godless? Wouldest thou ask now the way of
          salvation? It is simply this -- |Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
          thou shalt be saved.| He died; he rose again; thou art to believe him
          to be thine. Thou art to believe that he is able to save unto the
          uttermost them that come unto God by him. But, more than that,
          believing that to be a fact, thou art to cast thy soul upon that fact
          and trust to him, sink or swim. Spirit of God! help us each to do this
          and by similitude, or by providence, or by thy prophets, bring us each
          to thyself and save us eternally, and unto thee shall be the glory.<br />
