        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.88)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Evening, June 22, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>|Do as thou hast said.' -- 2 Samuel 7:25.</p>
        <p>
          NATHAN had been giving to David, on God's behalf, sundry exceeding
          great and precious promises. David expresses his gratitude to God for
          having so promised, and he says, |Now, O Lord God, the word that thou
          hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house,
          establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.'
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a prayer to God. Those words naturally flowed from his lips:
          after hearing such precious promises, he was anxious for their
          fulfilment. Such words will be equally in place, if they shall be
          adopted by us in these modern times, and if, after reading a promise,
          on turning to God's Word, we should finish by saying, |Remember the
          word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope,| it
          will be a practical application of the text, |Do as thou hast said.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall not commence my sermon to-night by endeavoring to prove that
          this Bible is what God has said; I do not come here to give you
          arguments to prove the inspiration of Scripture; I assume that I speak
          to a Christian congregation, and I assume, therefore, at starting,
          that this is God's word and none other. Leaving that matter, then,
          altogether, permit me to proceed at once to the text, understanding by
          what God has said, the Scriptures of his truth; and I trust there are
          some here who will be led, to-night, to cry to God in behalf of some
          promise made to their souls, |O Lord, do as thou hast said.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Our first remark shall be HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO KNOW WHAT GOD HAS
          SAID, for unless we know what God has said, it will be folly to say,
          |do as thou hast said.| Perhaps there is no book more neglected in
          these days than the Bible. I do verily believe there are more mouldy
          Bibles in this world than there are of any sort of neglected books. We
          have stillborn books in abundance; we have innumerable books which
          never see any circulation except the circulation of the butter shop,
          but we have no book that is so much bought, and then so speedily laid
          aside, and so little used, as the Bible. If we buy a newspaper, it is
          generally handed from one person to another, or we take care to peruse
          it pretty well; indeed some go so far as to read advertisements and
          all. If a person purchases a novel, it is well known how he will sit
          and read it all the way through, till the midnight candle is burnt
          out; the book must be finished in one day, because it is so admirable
          and interesting; but the Bible, of course, in the estimation of many,
          is not an interesting book; and the subjects it treats of are not of
          any very great importance. So most men think; they think it is a very
          good book to carry out on a Sunday, but never meant to be used as a
          book of pleasure, or a book to which one could turn with delight. Such
          is the opinion of many; but no opinion can be more apart from the
          truth; for what book can treat of truths one-half so important as
          those that concern the soul. What book can so well deserve my
          attention as that which is written by the greatest of all authors, God
          himself? If I must read a valuable book with attention, how much more
          ought I to give my mind to the study of that book which is invaluable,
          and which contains truth without the slightest admixture of error? And
          if books upon my health, or books which only concern the doings of my
          fellow creatures occupy some of my time, and deservedly so, how much
          more time should I spend in reading that which concerns my everlasting
          destiny; which reveals to me worlds hitherto unknown; which tells me
          how I may escape from hell and fly to heaven? But I must remark, that
          even among Christian people, the Bible is one of the least read books
          that they have in their house. What with our innumerable magazines,
          our religious newspapers, and our perpetual controversies about the
          Bible, it is too seldom that people read the Bible. There certainly is
          not that reading of it that there used to be. Our predecessors, the
          ancient Puritans, would scarcely read any book but that; and if a book
          was not concerning the Bible, they did not care about reading it at
          all. Perhaps therein they may have been too strait and narrow, and may
          somewhat have cramped their minds; but I would rather have a little
          truth, and have a mind filled with that, though that mind should only
          be as large as a nutshell, than have the most gigantic intellect, and
          have that crammed with error. It is not the greatness of our
          intellect, it is the rightness of it, that makes us men in this world,
          and right men before God. I beseech you, therefore, you who are
          members of Christian churches, if you have but little time, do not
          expend it in reading ephemeral books, but take your Bible and read it
          constantly; and I promise you one thing, that if you are already
          Christians, the more you read the Bible the more you will love it. You
          may find it hard, perhaps, at present, to read a short passage and
          meditate upon it all day; but as you proceed you will see such depths
          unfathomable, such heights beyond your ken; and you will discover such
          unutterable sweetness in this precious honey-comb dropping with drops
          of honey, that you will say, |I must have more of it,| and your spirit
          will always cry, |Give, give;| nor will it be content until you can
          have God's statutes upon your mind daily, to be your songs in the
          house of your pilgrimage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The errors of this present age have sprung from a non-reading of the
          Bible. Do you think, my brethren, that if we all read the Scriptures
          with judgment, and desired to know them rightly, there would be so
          many sects as there are? Heresies and schisms have sprung from this;
          one man has gone a little astray upon a point; another man, without
          referring to Scripture, has endorsed all he has said; another one has
          added something else to it; and then another one, being cunning, full
          of subtlety of the devil, has twisted passages of Scripture, and has
          woven them into a system, which has been fashioned in the first place
          by mistake, has accumulated and become more colossal by sundry other
          mistakes which naturally accrued to it, and at last has been perfected
          by the craft of designing heretics.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, again: bigotry, ill feeling, and uncharitableness, must all be
          traced, in a large degree, to our want of reading the Bible. What is
          the reason why yon man hates me, because I preach what I believe to be
          right? If I do speak the truth am I responsible for his hating me? Not
          in the least degree. I am sometimes told by my people that I attack
          certain parties very hard. Well, I cannot help it; if they are not
          right, it is not my fault -- if they come in my way, that I am
          compelled to run over them. Suppose two of you should be driving in
          the road to-morrow, and one of you should be on the right side of the
          road, and some accident should occur, you would say, |Sir, the other
          man ought to have pulled up, he must pay the damages, for he had no
          business there at all on his wrong side.| And it will be the same with
          us if we preach God's truth; we must go straight on; if the greatest
          ill-feeling in the world rise up we have nothing to do with it. God's
          truth will sometimes bring about warfare; Jesus Christ, you know, said
          himself that he came to put warfare between man and man; to set the
          mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law
          against mother-in-law; and that a man's foes should be those of his
          own household. But if there be ill-feeling, if there be clamouring of
          sects, to whom is it due? Who is responsible for it? Why, the man who
          makes the new sects, not the man who abides fast and firm by the old
          one. If I am safely moored by a good strong anchor of fundamental
          truth, and some other shall strike my vessel and sink himself, I will
          not pay the damages. I stand firm: if others chose to go away from the
          truth, to cut their cables and slip their moorings; then let them. God
          grant that we may not do the same. Hold the truth, my friends, and
          hold it as the easiest method of sweeping away heresies and false
          doctrines. But now-a-days, you know, you are told, |Oh, it does not
          matter what you believe; doctrines are nothing;| ad they have tried
          lately to make a very happy family of us, like the happy family near
          Waterloo Bridge, where all kinds of creatures are shut up together;
          but they are only kept in order by a lath which the man, when we turn
          our heads, applies between the bars of the cage. Just so with
          denominations; they want to amalgamate us all. We differ in various
          doctrines, and therefore some of us must be wrong, if we hold
          doctrines which are directly hostile to each other. But we are told,
          |It does not signify; doubtless, you are all right.| Now, I cannot see
          that. If I say one thing, and another man says another, how, by all
          that is holy, can both speak the truth? Shall black and white be the
          same colour? Shall falsehood and truth be the same? When they shall
          be, and fire shall sleep in the same cradle with the waves of the
          ocean, then shall we agree to amalgamate ourselves with those who deny
          our doctrines, or speak evil of what we believe to be the gospel. My
          brethren, no man has any right to absolve your judgment from
          allegiance to God; there is liberty of conscience between man and man,
          but there is none between God and man. No man has a right to believe
          what he likes; he is to believe what God tells him; and if he does not
          believe that though he is not responsible to man, or to any set of
          men, or to any government, yet mark you, he is responsible to God. I
          beseech you, therefore, if you would avoid heresies, and bring the
          church to a glorious union, read the Scriptures. Read not so much
          man's comments, or man's books, but read the Scriptures, and keep your
          faith on this, -- |God has said it.| If you cannot make all God's
          truths agree, yet remember God has not made two sets of truth opposite
          to each other; that were an impossibility which even God himself could
          not accomplish mighty though he be. My brethren, always stand by what
          God has said, and do not be turned aside from it by all the arguments
          that can be brought to bear against you. |Search the Scriptures, for
          they testify of Christ.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now for our second point, ALL THAT FAITH WANTS TO BUILD UPON
          IS WHAT GOD HAS SAID. |Do as thou hast said.| The only solid foothold
          that faith has is, |It is written, God hath said it.| When a sinner
          comes to God he must have nothing else to rely upon except this, |Do
          as thou hast said.| There is a tendency in most men's minds to bring
          before God something which he did not say. Many of you, I dare say,
          will go and ask God in prayer for something for which you cannot prove
          a positive promise that he will ever give it to you. You go to God and
          say, |Lord, do as John Bunyan said, do as Whitfield said, let me have
          an experience like theirs.| Now, that is all wrong. We must, when we
          come to God, say only, |Lord, do as thou hast said.| And then, again,
          I do believe that many of those who are members of our churches have
          not put their faith simply in what God has said. If I were to go round
          to some of you and ask you why you believe yourselves to be
          Christians, it is marvellous what strange reasons many of you would
          bring. It is very singular what strange views persons often have as to
          the way of salvation. It is hard to bring a sinner to God simply with
          this, -- |Lord, do as thou hast said.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I know some who think themselves to be God's children, because they
          dreamed they were. They had a very remarkable dream one night, and if
          you were to laugh at them they would be unutterably indignant; they
          would cut you at once out of the family of God, and call you an
          |accuser of the brethren.| They do not rely upon what God has said in
          the Bible; but they had some singular vision, when deep sleep had
          fallen upon them, and because of that vision, they reckon they are
          children of God. In the course of my seeing persons who come to me, I
          hear every now and then a story like this, |Sir, I was in
          such-and-such a room, and suddenly I thought I saw Jesus Christ, and
          heard a voice saying such-and-such a thing to me, and that is the
          reason why I hope I am saved.| Now, that is not God's way of
          salvation; the sinner is not to say, |Lord, do as I dreamed, do as I
          fancy;| but |Do as thou hast said.| And if I have any one here who has
          never had a dream, or vision, he does not want to have, if he goes to
          God with this, |Lord, thou hast said Christ died to save sinners, I am
          a sinner, save me,| that is faith, |Do as thou hast said.| But there
          are other persons far more rational, who if they were asked the reason
          for their supposing that they are saved, would speak of some
          remarkable rhapsody which, on a particular occasion they had when
          hearing a certain minister; or of a particular text which struck them
          suddenly, and transported them to the seventh heaven, and they had
          such thoughts as they never had before. |Oh! sir,| they say, |it is
          marvellous, I thought my heart would break, it was so full of joy and
          gladness; I never felt so before in all my life; and when I went out
          of the house, I felt so light and so ready to run home, I thought I
          should sing al the way; so I know I must be a child of God.| Well, you
          may know it, but I don't, because there are many persons who have been
          deluded by the devil in that fashion, who never had faith in Christ.
          Faith in Christ never rests in rhapsody; it rests on a |thou hast said
          it.| Ask faith whether it will ever take its standing on anything but
          a |thou hast said,| and faith will answer, |No; I cannot climb to
          heaven on a ladder made of dreams, they are too flimsy to bear my
          feet.| Faith, why dost thou not march on? Why dost thou not cross that
          bridge? |No,| says faith, |I cannot; it is made up of rhapsodies, and
          rhapsodies are intoxicating things, and I cannot place my feet upon
          them.| Faith will stand on a promise, though it be no bigger than
          grain of mustard seed; but it could not stand on a rhapsody if it was
          as large as the everlasting mountains. Faith can build on a |thou hast
          said it;| but it cannot build on frames and feelings, on dreams and
          experiences -- it only relies on this -- |Thou hast said it.| Let me
          caution my hearers against suppositions, which some of them have as to
          salvation. Some persons think that the Holy Spirit is a kind of
          electric shock working in the heart; that there is some mysterious and
          terrible thing they cannot understand, which they must feel, not only
          very different from what they ever felt before, but even superior to
          anything described in God's Word. Now, I beg to tell you, that so far
          from the effectual operation of the Holy Spirit being a dark thing in
          its manifestation, it is, because it is the Holy Spirit, a thing of
          simplicity and light. The way of salvation is no great mystery, it is
          very plain; it is |believe and live.| And faith needs no mysteries to
          hang itself upon; it catches hold of the bare naked promise, and it
          says, |Lord, do as thou hast said.|
        </p>
        <p>
          My faith can on this promise live; I know that on this promise it
          never can die. But faith wants neither testimonies of man, nor
          learning of philosophers, nor eloquence of orators, nor rhapsodies,
          nor visions, nor revelations. It wants nothing else but what God has
          said applied to the heart; and it goes to God, and says, |Lord, do as
          thou hast said.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now for the third remark. We see that faith is a very bold
          thing; when God says a thing it goes to God, and says, |Lord, do as
          thou hast said.|
        </p>
        <p>
          My third remark is, that FAITH IS QUITE RIGHT IN SO DOING. The Lord
          always meant, when he said a thing, that we should remind him of it.
          God's promises were never meant to be waste paper; he meant that they
          should be used. Whenever God gives a promise, if a man does not use
          that promise, the promise fails in effect to that man, and God's great
          intention therein is in some measure frustrated. God sent the promise
          on purpose to be used. If I see a Bank of England note, it is a
          promise for a certain amount of money, and I take it and use it. But
          oh! my friend, do try and use God's promises; nothing pleases God
          better than to see his promises put in circulation; he loves to see
          his children bring them up to him, and say, |Lord, do as thou hast
          said.| And let me tell you that it glorifies God to use his promises.
          Do you think that God will be any the poorer for giving you the riches
          he has promised? Do you think he will be any the less holy for giving
          holiness to you? Do you think he will be any the less pure for washing
          you from your sins? And he has said, |Come now, let us reason
          together, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as wool;
          though they be red, they shall be whiter than snow.| Faith gets hold
          of that promise, and it does not stand saying, |this is a precious
          promise, I will look at it;| it goes right up to the throne, and says,
          |Lord, here is the promise, do as thou hast said.| And God says, |Oh!
          faith, I am as glad to see the promise brought to me, as thou art to
          bring it; I meant my promise to be used, and the using of it glorifies
          me.| Why, if any one gave us a cheque, and we did not go to have it
          cashed, though we might want the money badly enough, suppose we said,
          |I don't like to go,| there would be some slur cast upon the character
          of the man whose signature had made it valid. And so when a Christian
          gets a promise, if he does not take it to God, he dishonors him. But
          when faith in all its raggedness and poverty, and sickness about it,
          goes to God and says, |Lord, I have nothing to recommend me but this,
          thou hast said it:' there is the promise, Lord, give me the
          fulfilment.| God smiles, and says, |Ay, my child, I love to see thee
          trust me; there, take back the fulfilment, and go on thy way
          rejoicing.| Never think that God will be troubled by your asking him
          about his promises so much. God likes to be troubled, if I may use
          such an expression; he likes you to go to his door, and say, |Great
          Banker, cash this note; great Promiser, fulfil this promise; great
          covenant God, fulfil thy covenant, and send me not empty away.| |Do as
          thou hast said,| is a legitimate request; we ought to say it; it
          honors God, and God meant that we should so use his promises, |Do as
          thou hast said.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Another remark. Faith has very good reasons for appealing to God to do
          as he has said. If you should say to faith, |Faith, why do you expect
          God to do as he has said it, why do you expect it?| Faith would
          answer, |I have a whole bundle of reasons that justify the act. And in
          the first place, I have a right to expect him to do as he has said,
          because he is a true God; I know he cannot lie. He has said he will
          give me such-and-such a thing; if he was not a truthful God, I would
          not say, do as thou hast said!' but since he is a true God, and never
          was known to break his promise, and since, moreover, by two immutable
          things, wherein it is impossible for God to lie -- his oath and his
          promise -- he has made the thing secure; and since I know that in
          Christ all the promises are yea and amen, I think I have good reason
          enough for going to him and saying, do as thou hast said.' If he were
          some fallible being who promised and would not perform, I might
          hesitate somewhat; but since he is always true and constantly
          precious, I will go and say to him, Lord, do as thou hast said.'| Poor
          sinner! God has said, |He that confesseth his sin shall find mercy.|
          Now, if you go to God, you want no other plea than this, -- |Lord, do
          as thou hast said;' I have confessed my sins;' do as thou hast said.'|
          |But, sinner, why should I do as I have said? you do not deserve it.|
          |Lord, thou art a true God.|
        </p>
        <p>|Thou hast promised to forgive,</p>
        <p>All who on thy Son believe;</p>
        <p>Lord I know thou canst not lie,</p>
        <p>Give me Christ or else I die.|</p>
        <p>
          Go, poor sinner, tell the Lord that, and as truly as he is God, he
          will never send you empty away. Faith has good reasons to feel that
          God is true, and therefore he will do as he has said. And not only so,
          but he is able to do it; his ability is infinite. His intentions also
          are the same, his promises never get worn out by being circulated, and
          they become all the more sure for being tried. Poor sinner, here again
          is a joyful thought: thou canst go to God, and say, |Lord thou hast
          promised to wash away all our iniquities, and cast them into the
          depths of the sea. Lord, if thou hadst been a changeable God, I might
          have thought thou wouldst not wash away mine, but thou didst wash
          Manasseh, and thou didst wash Paul; now, Lord, because thou art
          unchangeable, do as thou hast said.' For thou art just the same now,
          just as merciful, just as powerful, and just as kind as ever thou
          wert. What, wilt thou break thy promise, Lord? Do as thou hast said.'|
        </p>
        <p>
          But faith puts it on stronger ground than this: it says, |Lord, if
          thou dost not do as thou hast said, thou wilt be dishonored, thou wilt
          be disgraced.| If a man does not carry out his promise, he is
          cashiered; men care not to associate with on who breaks his promise;
          and what would become of God's great name if he were to break his
          promise? Poor black sinner! thou art coming to the fountain; God has
          given the promise that he will wash every sinner that comes to the
          fountain. Now, with reverence, let me speak it poor sinner; if Christ
          did not wash you, it would be a dishonor to his truth. If you were to
          go to Christ, and he were to cast you out, surely the devils in hell
          would despise the name of him who breaks his promise. Beloved, to
          suppose that God could violate his promise, is to suppose him divested
          of his Godhead. Take away God's honour from him, and he becomes less
          than man. Take away the honour which even man holds dear, and what do
          you make of God? |Oh! sir,| you say, |but I do not deserve it; I am
          such a poor worthless creature, he will not keep his promise to me.| I
          tell you that does not make a whit difference in God's promise; if he
          has promised, he is divinely bound to perform his promise, in whatever
          state you may be. Though you have slandered God, though you may have
          hated him and despised him, and run away from him, and in every way
          ill-treated him -- if he has made a promise to you here, I will be
          bound for my God. He would keep a promise to the devil if he had made
          one; and if he has made a promise to you who are ever so vile, he will
          keep that promise to you. Hear the promise, then, once more, Are you a
          sinner? |This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that
          Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinner, even the chief.| And,
          again: |He is able to save unto the uttermost them that come unto God
          by him.| And, again: |Come unto me, all ye that are heavy laden, and I
          will give you rest.| And let me say again, with the profoundest
          reverence, that if Christ did not give rest to every weary heavy laden
          sinner that came to him, he would be un-Christed, he would lose his
          truthfulness, he would be undeified, he would lose his veracity, and
          the loss of one poor believing sinner would be the loss of God's own
          godhead; it would be the dethroning of the immortal; it would be the
          pulling down of heaven, the breaking asunder of the universe, and the
          dissolution of creation's own earth, and of creation's self. Faith may
          well go to God, and say, |Lord, do as thou hast said; for if thou dost
          not, it will be a dishonor to thyself.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And now let us conclude by asking, what has God said? I cannot tell
          you all that he has said to you, because I cannot mark out all the
          different characters here. But, my dear friends, whatever may be your
          character, from the earliest stage of religion up to the last, there
          is always some special promise to you; and you have only to turn your
          Bible over and find it out, and then go to God with |Do as thou hast
          said.| Let me just select a few characters. There is one here,
          exceeding faint in the ways of the Lord. |Oh!| he says, |I am faint,
          though I hope I am pursuing.| Now, here is the promise, -- |He giveth
          power unto the faint;| When you get such a promise, stick hard and
          fast to it; do not let the devil cheat you out of it, but keep on
          saying, |Lord, thou hast said, He giveth power unto the faint.| |Do as
          thou hast said.| Let it ring and ring again in the ears of the
          promiser, and he will be a performer yet. |Ah!| says another, |I am
          not faint; I am afraid I scarcely have life at all; I am a hungry and
          thirsty soul; I want Christ, but I cannot get at him.| Hear this:
          |Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they
          shall be filled.| Take that promise to God, and keep to it: do not
          plead anything else, but go to God over and over again with this, --
          |Lord, thou hast said it; do as thou hast said.| Are you covered all
          over with sin, and under a deep sense of your iniquities? Go and tell
          him this: |Thou hast said, I will cast their iniquities into the
          depths of the sea.' Lord, I know I have these sins; I do not deny it;
          but thou hast said, I will pardon them.' I have no reason why thou
          shouldst pardon them; I cannot promise that I shall be better; but,
          Lord, thou hast said it, and that is enough; Do as thou hast said.'|
          Another one here is afraid lest he should not be able to hold on to
          the end, and lest after having been a child of God he should be a
          cast-away. Then, if that be thy state, go and take this to God: |The
          mountains may depart, and the hills may be removed, but the covenant
          of my love shall not depart from you;| and when you are thinking that
          Saviour is going away, catch hold of his skirts, and say, |Jesus, do
          as thou hast said. Thou hast said, I will never leave thee;' do as
          thou hast said.'| Or, if thou hast lost his presence, remember the
          promise, |I will come again to you.| Go and say, |Lord, I have lost
          the sweet comfort of thy presence in my heart, but thou hast said, I
          will come again to you.'| And if Satan says, |He is gone away, and
          will never come back again,| tell Satan he has nothing to do with it;
          God has said it, and keep to this, |Do as thou hast said.| If you do
          that, you will want no other argument and no other reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us suppose a case, and having tried to illustrate the truth by it,
          we will have done. There is a desperate ruffian; he has been concerned
          in twenty burglaries; it is said he has committed several murders; the
          police are on his track, they are hunting after him; he cannot be
          discovered. The principal point is to discover him, for it is hoped
          that by his discovery and his pardon more good might be done than even
          by his execution. Persons come to this desperately bad fellow, and
          they tell him, |If you give yourself up, I dare say you will get a
          free pardon.| |I do not give myself up on daresays,| he says. Another
          comes, and says, |If you were to give yourself up, I would intercede
          for you; I know my lord so-and-so, and such a man, member of
          parliament, would intercede for you.| |No,| he would say, |let well
          alone. I am pretty safe now; I am not going to give myself up on the
          mere speculation that some one will intercede for me.| But by-and-bye
          there comes out a huge placard, |V.R. Free pardon to such a man if he
          surrenders himself.| He walks straight up to the place. Some one says
          to him, |Stop, my dear fellow; they will hang you, perhaps.| |No,|
          says he, |they won't.| Some one says, |They have been many years
          looking after you; you do not think that if you get into the fangs of
          the law now the Queen will pardon you?| |Yes,| he says, |I can trust
          her? she has never given a free pardon, and then executed anyone.| He
          goes to the office, and they say, |We are astonished to see this
          fellow; he might have kept away; he had no necessity to give himself
          up.| |See,| says one, |there is a policeman, are you not afraid? There
          are the handcuffs; are you not afraid that they will be put on your
          wrists and that you will be put into jail?| |No,| he says, |I will
          walk all through the prison, but there is not a cell in which I may be
          locked up. The Queen has said she will pardon me, and I do not want
          any thing else.| |But look at your conduct; you know you deserve to be
          hanged.| |I know I do, but I have received a free pardon, and I will
          surrender myself.| |But who can tell how many buglaries you will
          commit if you are allowed to go free.| |Never mind,| she has promised
          to pardon me, and I know well that her word will not be violated. Sure
          the majesty of England will not lie against such an offender as I am.|
          Now, you would not wonder at that, would you? It would be no very
          marvellous thing, because we can trust her Majesty pretty fairly. But
          it is the hardest thing to get sinners to come to God. |No,| says one,
          |I have been a drunkard, God will not forgive me.| My dear fellow, it
          is said, |All manner of sin and iniquity shall be forgiven to man.|
          |Oh,| says another, |I have been a swearer, I have been an infidel, I
          have blasphemed God, and broken all his statutes.| My dear
          fellow-creature, it is said, |All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be
          forgiven unto men,| Cannot you believe it? God means what he says; and
          can you not come to God, trembling, though you be, and cast yourself
          before his feet, and say, |Lord, if thou dost damn me, I deserve it;
          if thou shouldst cast me down to hell, I know thou wouldst be just:
          but then Lord thou hast said, Him that cometh to me I will in no wise
          cast out.'| I tell you God will do as he has said. If you have but
          faith to believe that promise, you never need fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worthless, vilest of the vile, sweepings of the universe, the very
          offal of creation, if you come to God he will take you in, for his
          promise is not to be broken by reason of your vileness; he will
          receive you, if you can but plead a promise of your own case, and say
          to him, |Do as thou hast said.| Now, then, I will say in conclusion,
          it will be easy enough for every poor sinner, for every penitent
          sinner, for every weak saint, to go home, and turn his Bible over; and
          by a little diligence he will be able to find out a promise that will
          exactly suit his case; and if he does not find such a promise, it will
          be because he did not look long enough, for there is one that just
          fits, and when he has got hold of it let him go to God, and say,
          |Lord, do as thou hast said,| and let him keep to that; and the
          heavens would sooner fall than one of God's promises should be broken.
          Oh! trust my Master! oh! trust my Master; trust your souls to him!
          trust your bodies to him, I beseech you; do it, for his own name's
          sake! Amen and Amen.
