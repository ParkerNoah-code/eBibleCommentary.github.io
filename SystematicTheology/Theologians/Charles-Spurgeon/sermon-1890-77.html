          Shamuna and Guria, martyrs who made themselves illustrious in their
          afflictions,
        </p>
        <p>Have in love required of me to tell of their illustrious deeds.</p>
        <p>To champions of the faith the doctrine calleth me,</p>
        <p>That I should go and behold their contests and their crowns.</p>
        <p>
          Children of the right hand, who have done battle against the left,
        </p>
        <p>
          Have called me this day to recite the marvellous tale of their
          conflicts: --
        </p>
        <p>Simple old men, who entered into the fight like heroes,</p>
        <p>And nobly distinguished themselves in the strife of blood:</p>
        <p>
          Those who were the salt of our land, and it was sweetened thereby,
        </p>
        <p>
          And its savour was restored, which had become insipid through
          unbelief:
        </p>
        <p>
          Candlesticks of gold, which were full of the oil of the crucifixion,
        </p>
        <p>
          By which was lighted up all our region, which had turned to darkness:
        </p>
        <p>Two lamps, of which, when all the winds were blowing</p>
        <p>Of every kind of error, the lights were not put out;</p>
        <p>Good labourers, who from the spring of day laboured</p>
        <p>In the blessed vineyard of the house of God right duteously:</p>
        <p>Bulwarks of our land, who became to us as it were a defence</p>
        <p>Against all spoilers in all the wars that surrounded us:</p>
        <p>
          Havens of peace, a place also of retreat for all that were distressed,
        </p>
        <p>
          And a resting-place for the head of every one that was in need of
          succour:
        </p>
        <p>Two precious pearls, which were</p>
        <p>An ornament for the bride of my lord Abgar, the Aram√¶an's son.</p>
        <p>Teachers they were who practised their teaching in blood,</p>
        <p>And whose faith was known by their sufferings.</p>
        <p>On their bodies they wrote the story of the Son of God</p>
        <p>With the marks of combs and scourges which thickly covered them.</p>
        <p>They showed their love, not by words of the mouth alone,</p>
        <p>But by tortures and by the rending of their limbs asunder.</p>
        <p>For the love of the Son of God they gave up their bodies:</p>
        <p>
          Since it beseemeth the lover that for his love he should give up
          himself.
        </p>
        <p>Fire and sword proved their love, how true it was;</p>
        <p>
          And more beautiful than silver tried in a furnace of earth were their
          necks.
        </p>
        <p>They looked on God, and, because they saw His exalted beauties,</p>
        <p>
          Therefore did they look with contempt upon their sufferings for His
          sake.
        </p>
        <p>The Sun of righteousness had arisen in their hearts;</p>
        <p>
          And they were enlightened by it, and with His light chased they away
          the darkness.
        </p>
        <p>At the idols of vanity, which error had brought in, they laughed,</p>
        <p>Instinct with the faith of the Son of God which is full of light.</p>
        <p>The love of the Lord was as a fire in their hearts;</p>
        <p>Nor could all the brambles of idolatry stand before it.</p>
        <p>Fixed was their love on God unchangeably:</p>
        <p>
          And therefore did they look with scorn upon the sword, all athirst as
          it was for blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          With guilelessness and yet with wisdom stood they in the
          judgment-hall,
        </p>
        <p>As they had been commanded by the Teacher of that which is true.</p>
        <p>Despising as they did kindred and family, guileless were they;</p>
        <p>
          Forasmuch, also, as possessions and wealth were held in no account by
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor guileless only: for in the judgment-hall with the wisdom of
          serpents too
        </p>
        <p>They were heedful of the faith of the house of God.</p>
        <p>When a serpent is seized and struck, he guards his head,</p>
        <p>But gives up and leaves exposed all his body to his captors:</p>
        <p>
          And, so long as his head is kept from harm, his life abideth in him;
        </p>
        <p>
          But, if the head be struck, his life is left a prey to destruction.
        </p>
        <p>The head of the soul is men's faith;</p>
        <p>
          And, if this be preserved unharmed, by it is also preserved their
          life:
        </p>
        <p>Even though the whole body be lacerated with blows,</p>
        <p>Yet, so long as faith is preserved, the soul is alive;</p>
        <p>But, if faith is struck down by unbelief,</p>
        <p>Lost is the soul, and life has perished from the man.</p>
        <p>Shamuna and Guria of the faith as men</p>
        <p>Were heedful, that it should not be struck down by persecutors:</p>
        <p>For they knew that, if faith is preserved,</p>
        <p>Both soul and body are preserved from destruction.</p>
        <p>And, because of this, touching their faith were they solicitous,</p>
        <p>
          That that should not be struck down in which their very life was
          hidden.
        </p>
        <p>They gave up their bodies both to blows and to dislocation,</p>
        <p>
          Yea to every kind of torture, that their faith should not be stricken
          down;
        </p>
        <p>And, even as the serpent also hides his head from blows,</p>
        <p>So hid they their faith within their hearts;</p>
        <p>
          And the body was smitten, and endured stripes, and bore sufferings:
        </p>
        <p>But overthrown was not their faith which was within their hearts.</p>
        <p>The mouth betrayeth the soul to death when it speaks,</p>
        <p>And with the tongue, as with a sword, worketh slaughter.</p>
        <p>And from it spring up both life and death to men:</p>
        <p>
          Denying a man dies, confessing he lives, and the mouth hath power over
          it.
        </p>
        <p>Denial is death, and in confession is the soul's life;</p>
        <p>And power hath the mouth over them both, like a judge.</p>
        <p>The word of the mouth openeth the door for death to enter in;</p>
        <p>This, too, calleth for life, and it beameth forth upon the man.</p>
        <p>Even the robber by one word of faith</p>
        <p>
          Won him the kingdom, and became heir of paradise, all fraught with
          blessings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wicked judges too, from the martyrs, the sons of the right hand,
        </p>
        <p>Demanded that by word of mouth only they should blaspheme;</p>
        <p>But, like true men holding fast the faith,</p>
        <p>They uttered not a word by which unbelief might be served.</p>
        <p>Shamuna, beauty of our faith, who is adequate to tell of thee?</p>
        <p>
          All too narrow is my mouth for thy praise, too mean for thee to be
          spoken of by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thy truth is thy beauty, thy crown thy suffering, thy wealth thy
          stripes,
        </p>
        <p>
          And by reason of thy blows magnificent is the beauty of thy
          championship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proud of thee is our country, as of a treasury which is full of gold:
        </p>
        <p>
          Since wealth art thou to us, and a coveted store which cannot be
          stolen from us.
        </p>
        <p>Guria, martyr, staunch hero of our faith,</p>
        <p>Who shall suffice thee, to recount thy beauties divine?</p>
        <p>Lo! tortures on thy body are set like gems of beryl,</p>
        <p>And the sword on thy neck like a chain of choice gold.</p>
        <p>Thy blood upon thy form is a robe of glory full of beauty,</p>
        <p>
          And the scourging of thy back a vesture with which the sun may not
          compare.
        </p>
        <p>
          Radiant thou art and comely by virtue of these thy sufferings, so
          abounding;
        </p>
        <p>
          And resplendent are thy beauties, because of the pains which are so
          severe upon thee.
        </p>
        <p>Shamuna, our riches, richer art thou than the rich:</p>
        <p>
          For lo! the rich stand at thy door, that thou mayest relieve them.
        </p>
        <p>Small thy village, poor thy country: who, then, gave thee</p>
        <p>That lords of villages and cities should court thy favour?</p>
        <p>Lo! judges in their robes and vestments</p>
        <p>
          Take dust from thy threshold, as though it were the medicine of life.
        </p>
        <p>The cross is rich, and to its worshippers increaseth riches;</p>
        <p>And its poverty despiseth all the riches of the world.</p>
        <p>Shamuna and Guria, sons of the poor, lo! at your doors</p>
        <p>
          Bow down the rich, that they may receive from you supplies for their
          wants.
        </p>
        <p>The Son of God in poverty and want</p>
        <p>Showed to the world that all its riches are as nothing,</p>
        <p>His disciples, all fishermen, all poor, all weak,</p>
        <p>All men of little note, became illustrious through His faith.</p>
        <p>One fisherman, whose "village" too was a home of fishermen,</p>
        <p>He made chief over the twelve, yea head of the house.</p>
        <p>One a tentmaker, who aforetime was a persecutor,</p>
        <p>He seized upon, and made him a chosen vessel for the faith.</p>
        <p>Shamuna and Guria came from villages that were not wealthy,</p>
        <p>And lo! in a great city became they lords;</p>
        <p>And its chief men, its judges also, stand before their doors,</p>
        <p>And they solicit their charity to satisfy their wants.</p>
        <p>From their confession of the faith of the Son of God</p>
        <p>These blessed men acquired riches beyond compute.</p>
        <p>Poor did He Himself become, and the poor made He rich;</p>
        <p>And lo! enriched is the whole creation through His poverty.</p>
        <p>The chosen martyrs did battle against error,</p>
        <p>
          And in the confession of the Son of God stood they firm like valiant
          men.
        </p>
        <p>
          They went in and confessed Him before the judge with look undaunted,
        </p>
        <p>
          That He too might confess them, even as they confessed Him, before His
          Father.
        </p>
        <p>There arose against them the war of pagans like a tempest;</p>
        <p>But the cross was their helmsman, and steered them on.</p>
        <p>They were required to sacrifice to lifeless images,</p>
        <p>But they departed not from their confession of the Son of God.</p>
        <p>The wind of idolatry blew in their faces,</p>
        <p>But they themselves were as rocks piled up against the hurricane.</p>
        <p>Like a swift whirlwind, error snatched at them;</p>
        <p>
          But, forasmuch as they were sheltered by the crucifixion, it hurt them
          not.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Evil One set on all his dogs to bark, that they might bite them;
        </p>
        <p>
          But, forasmuch as they had the cross for a staff, they put them all to
          flight.
        </p>
        <p>But who is sufficient to tell of their contests,</p>
        <p>Or their sufferings, or the rending asunder of their limbs?</p>
        <p>Or who can paint the picture of their coronation,</p>
        <p>How they went up from the contest covered with glory?</p>
        <p>To judgment they went in, but of the judge they took no account;</p>
        <p>Nor were they anxious what they should say when questioned.</p>
        <p>The judge menaced them, and multiplied his words of threatening;</p>
        <p>
          And recounted tortures and all kinds of inflictions, that he might
          terrify them.
        </p>
        <p>He spake great words, that by fright and intimidation,</p>
        <p>By menaces too, he might incline them to sacrifice.</p>
        <p>Yet the combatants despised the menaces, and the intimidations,</p>
        <p>And the sentence of judgment, and all bodily deaths;</p>
        <p>
          And they prepared themselves for insult and stripes, and for blows,
        </p>
        <p>And for provocation, and to be dragged along, and to be burnt;</p>
        <p>For imprisonment also, and for bonds, and for all evil things,</p>
        <p>
          And for all tortures, and for all sufferings, rejoicing all the while.
        </p>
        <p>They were not alarmed nor affrighted, nor dismayed,</p>
        <p>Nor did the sharpness of the tortures bend them to sacrifice.</p>
        <p>
          Their body they despised, and as dung upon the ground accounted they
          it:
        </p>
        <p>
          For they knew that, the more it was beaten, the more would its beauty
          increase;
        </p>
        <p>And, the more the judge increased his menaces to alarm them,</p>
        <p>
          The more did they show their contempt of him, having no fear of his
          threats.
        </p>
        <p>He kept telling them what tortures he had prepared for them;</p>
        <p>
          And they continued telling him about Gehenna which was reserved for
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          By those things which he told them he tried to frighten them to
          sacrifice;
        </p>
        <p>And they spoke to him about the fearful judgment yonder.</p>
        <p>Truth is wiser than wise words,</p>
        <p>And very hateful, however much it may be adorned, is falsehood.</p>
        <p>Shamuna and Guria went on speaking truth,</p>
        <p>While the judge continued to utter falsehood.</p>
        <p>And therefore were they not afraid of his threatening,</p>
        <p>
          Because all his menaces against the truth were accounted by them as
          empty sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          The intercourse of the world they despised, they contemned and
          scorned, yea they abandoned;
        </p>
        <p>And to return to it they had no wish, or to enter it again.</p>
        <p>From the place of judgment they set their faces to depart</p>
        <p>To that meeting-place for them all, the life of the new world.</p>
        <p>They cared neither for possessions nor for houses,</p>
        <p>Nor for the advantages of this world, so full of evil.</p>
        <p>In the world of light was their heart bound captive with God,</p>
        <p>And to "that" country did they set their face to depart;</p>
        <p>And they looked to the sword, to come and be a bridge</p>
        <p>To let them pass over to God, for whom they were longing.</p>
        <p>This world they accounted as a little tent,</p>
        <p>But that yonder as a city full of beauties;</p>
        <p>And they were in haste by the sword to depart hence</p>
        <p>
          To the land of light, which is full of blessing for those who are
          worthy of it.
        </p>
        <p>The judge commanded to hang them up by their arms,</p>
        <p>And without mercy did they stretch them out in bitter agony.</p>
        <p>A demon's fury breathed rage into the heart of the judge,</p>
        <p>
          And embittered him against the stedfast ones, inciting him to crush
          them;
        </p>
        <p>
          And between the height and the depth he stretched them out to afflict
          them:
        </p>
        <p>
          And they were a marvel to both sides, when they saw how much they
          endured.
        </p>
        <p>At the old men's frame heaven and earth marvelled,</p>
        <p>
          To see how much suffering it bore nor cried out for help under their
          affliction.
        </p>
        <p>Hung up and dragged along are their feeble bodies by their arms,</p>
        <p>
          Yet is there deep silence, nor is there one that cries out for help or
          that murmurs.
        </p>
        <p>Amazed were all who beheld their contests,</p>
        <p>
          To see how calmly the outstretched forms bore the inflictions laid
          upon them.
        </p>
        <p>Amazed too was Satan at their spotless frames,</p>
        <p>To see what weight of affliction they sustained without a groan.</p>
        <p>
          Yea, and gladdened too were the angels by that fortitude of theirs,
        </p>
        <p>To see how patiently it bore that contest so terrible that was.</p>
        <p>But, as combatants who were awaiting their crowns,</p>
        <p>There entered no sense of weariness into their minds.</p>
        <p>Nay, it was the judge that grew weary; yea, he was astonished:</p>
        <p>
          But the noble men before him felt no weariness in their afflictions.
        </p>
        <p>He asked them whether they would consent to sacrifice;</p>
        <p>But the mouth was unable to speak from pain.</p>
        <p>Thus did the persecutors increase their inflictions,</p>
        <p>Until they gave no place for the word to be spoken.</p>
        <p>Silent was the mouth from the inflictions laid on their limbs;</p>
        <p>
          But the will, like that of a hero, was nerved with fortitude from
          itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas for the persecutors! how destitute were they of righteousness!
        </p>
        <p>But the children of light -- how were they clad in faith!</p>
        <p>They demand speech, when there is no place for speaking,</p>
        <p>Since the word of the mouth was forbidden them by pain.</p>
        <p>Fast bound was the body, and silent the mouth, and it was unable</p>
        <p>To utter the word when unrighteously questioned.</p>
        <p>And what should the martyr do, who had no power to say,</p>
        <p>When he was questioned, that he would not sacrifice?</p>
        <p>All silent were the old men full of faith,</p>
        <p>And from pain they were incapable of speaking.</p>
        <p>Yet questioned they were: and in what way, if a man is silent</p>
        <p>When he is questioned, shall he assent to that which is said?</p>
        <p>But the old men, that they might not be thought to assent,</p>
        <p>
          Expressed clearly by signs the word which it behoved them to speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their heads they shook, and, instead of speech, by a dumb sign they
          showed
        </p>
        <p>The resolve of the new man that was within.</p>
        <p>Their heads hung down, signifying amidst their pains</p>
        <p>
          That they were not going to sacrifice, and every one understood their
          meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          As long as there was in them place for speech, with speech did they
          confess;
        </p>
        <p>
          But, when it was forbidden them by pain, they spake with a dumb sign.
        </p>
        <p>Of faith they spoke both with the voice and without the voice:</p>
        <p>
          So that, when speaking and also when silent, they were alike stedfast.
        </p>
        <p>Who but must be amazed at the path of life, how narrow it is,</p>
        <p>And how straight to him that desires to walk in it?</p>
        <p>
          Who but must marvel to see that, when the will is watchful and ready,
        </p>
        <p>It is very broad and full of light to him that goeth therein?</p>
        <p>About the path are ditches; full also is it of pitfalls;</p>
        <p>
          And, if one turn but a little aside from it, a ditch receives him.
        </p>
        <p>That dumb sign only is there between the right and the left,</p>
        <p>And on "Yea" and "Nay" stand sin and righteousness.</p>
        <p>
          By a dumb sign only did the blessed men plainly signify that they
          would not sacrifice,
        </p>
        <p>
          And in virtue of a single dumb sign did the path lead them to Eden;
        </p>
        <p>
          And, if this same dumb sign had inclined and turned down but a little
        </p>
        <p>
          Toward the depth, the path of the old men would have been to Gehenna.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upwards they made a sign, to signify that upwards were they prepared
          to ascend;
        </p>
        <p>
          And in consequence of that sign they ascended and mingled with the
          heavenly ones.
        </p>
        <p>Between sign and sign were Paradise and Gehenna:</p>
        <p>
          They made a sign that they would not sacrifice, and they inherited the
          place of the kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even while they were silent they were advocates for the Son of God:
        </p>
        <p>For not in multitude of words doth faith consist.</p>
        <p>That fortitude of theirs was a full-voiced confession,</p>
        <p>And as though with open mouth declared they their faith by signs;</p>
        <p>And every one knew what they were saying, though silent,</p>
        <p>And enriched and increased was the faith of the house of God;</p>
        <p>
          And error was put to shame by reason of two old men, who, though they
          spake not,
        </p>
        <p>Vanquished it; and they kept silence, and their faith stood fast.</p>
        <p>And, though tempestuous accents were heard from the judge,</p>
        <p>And the commands of the emperor were dreadful, yea violent,</p>
        <p>And paganism had a bold face and an open mouth,</p>
        <p>And its voice was raised, and silent were the old men with pain,</p>
        <p>
          Yet null and void became the command and drowned was the voice of the
          judge,
        </p>
        <p>
          And without speech the mute sign of the martyrs bore off the palm.
        </p>
        <p>Talking and clamour, and the sound of stripes, on the left;</p>
        <p>And deep silence and suffering standing on the right;</p>
        <p>
          And, by one mute sign with which the old men pointed above their
          heads,
        </p>
        <p>The head of faith was lifted up, and error was put to shame.</p>
        <p>
          Worsted in the encounter were they who spoke, and the victory was to
          the silent:
        </p>
        <p>For, voiceless they uttered by signs the discourse of faith.</p>
        <p>They took them down, because they had vanquished while silent;</p>
        <p>And they put them in bonds, threatening yet to vanquish them.</p>
        <p>Bonds and a dungeon void of light were by the martyrs</p>
        <p>Held of no account -- yea rather as the light which has no end.</p>
        <p>To be without bread, and without water, and without light,</p>
        <p>Pleased them well, because of the love of the Son of God.</p>
        <p>The judge commanded by their feet to hang them up</p>
        <p>With their heads downwards, by a sentence all unrighteous:</p>
        <p>Hanged up was Shamuna with his head downwards; and he prayed</p>
        <p>In prayer pure and strained clear by pain.</p>
        <p>Sweet fruit was hanging on the tree in that judgment-hall,</p>
        <p>
          And its taste and smell made the very denizens of heaven to marvel.
        </p>
        <p>Afflicted was his body, but sound was his faith;</p>
        <p>
          Bound fast was his person, but unfettered was his prayer over his
          deed.
        </p>
        <p>For, prayer nothing whatsoever turneth aside,</p>
        <p>And nothing hindereth it -- not even sword, not even fire.</p>
        <p>His form was turned upside down, but his prayer was unrestrained,</p>
        <p>And straight was its path on high to the abode of the angels.</p>
        <p>The more the affliction of the chosen martyr was increased,</p>
        <p>The more from his lips was all confession heard.</p>
        <p>The martyrs longed for the whetted sword affectionately,</p>
        <p>And sought it as a treasure full of riches.</p>
        <p>A new work has the Son of God wrought in the world --</p>
        <p>That dreadful death should be yearned for by many.</p>
        <p>That men should run to meet the sword is a thing unheard of,</p>
        <p>
          Except they were those whom Jesus has enlisted in His service by His
          crucifixion.
        </p>
        <p>That death is bitter, every one knoweth lo! from earliest time:</p>
        <p>To martyrs alone is it not bitter to be slain.</p>
        <p>They laughed at the whetted sword when they saw it,</p>
        <p>
          And greeted it with smiles: for it was that which was the occasion of
          their crowns.
        </p>
        <p>
          As though it had been something hated, they left the body to be
          beaten:
        </p>
        <p>Even though loving it, they held it not back from pains.</p>
        <p>
          For the sword they waited, and the sword went forth and crowned them:
        </p>
        <p>
          Because for it they looked; and it came to meet them, even as they
          desired.
        </p>
        <p>The Son of God slew death by His crucifixion;</p>
        <p>
          And, inasmuch as death is slain, it caused no suffering to the
          martyrs.
        </p>
        <p>With a wounded serpent one playeth without fear;</p>
        <p>A slain lion even a coward will drag along:</p>
        <p>The great serpent our Lord crushed by His crucifixion;</p>
        <p>The dread lion did the Son of God slay by His sufferings.</p>
        <p>
          Death bound He fast, and laid him prostrate and trampled on him at the
          gate of Hades;
        </p>
        <p>
          And now whosoever will draweth near and mocketh at him, because he is
          slain.
        </p>
        <p>These old men, Shamuna and Guria, mocked at death,</p>
        <p>As at that lion which by the Son of God was slain.</p>
        <p>The great serpent, which slew Adam among the trees,</p>
        <p>
          Who could seize, so long as he drank not of the blood of the cross?
        </p>
        <p>The Son of God crushed the dragon by His crucifixion,</p>
        <p>And lo! boys and old men mock at the wounded serpent.</p>
        <p>
          Pierced is the lion with the spear which pierced the side of the Son
          of God;
        </p>
        <p>And whosoever will trampleth on him, yea mocketh at him.</p>
        <p>The Son of God -- He is the cause of all good things,</p>
        <p>And Him doth it behove every mouth to celebrate.</p>
        <p>
          He did Himself espouse the bride with the blood which flowed from His
          wounds,
        </p>
        <p>
          And of His wedding-friends He demanded as a nuptial gift the blood of
          their necks.
        </p>
        <p>The Lord of the wedding-feast hung on the cross in nakedness,</p>
        <p>And whosoever came to be a guest, He let fall His blood upon him.</p>
        <p>Shamuna and Guria gave up their bodies for His sake</p>
        <p>To sufferings and tomes and to all the various forms of woe.</p>
        <p>At Him they looked as He was mocked by wicked men,</p>
        <p>And thus did they themselves endure mockery without a groan.</p>
        <p>Edessa was enriched by your slaughter, O blessed ones:</p>
        <p>For ye adorned her with your crowns and with your sufferings.</p>
        <p>Her beauty are ye, her bulwark ye, her salt ye,</p>
        <p>Her riches and her store, yea her boast and all her treasure.</p>
        <p>Faithful stewards are ye:</p>
        <p>Since by your sufferings ye did array the bride in beauty.</p>
        <p>The daughter of the Parthians, who was espoused to the cross,</p>
        <p>
          Of you maketh her boast: since by your teaching lo! she was
          enlightened.
        </p>
        <p>Her advocates are ye; scribes who, though silent, vanquished</p>
        <p>All error, whilst its voice was uplifted high in unbelief.</p>
        <p>Those old men of the daughter of the Hebrews were sons of Belial,</p>
        <p>
          False witnesses, who killed Naboth, feigning themselves to be true.
        </p>
        <p>Her did Edessa outdo by her two old men full of beauty,</p>
        <p>Who were witnesses to the Son of God, and died like Naboth.</p>
        <p>Two were there, and two here, old men;</p>
        <p>And these were called witnesses, and witnesses those.</p>
        <p>Let us now see which of them were witnesses chosen of God,</p>
        <p>
          And which city is beloved by reason of her old men and of her
          honourable ones.
        </p>
        <p>Lo! the sons of Belial who slew Naboth are witnesses;</p>
        <p>And here Shamuna and Guria, again, are witnesses.</p>
        <p>Let us now see which witnesses, and which old men,</p>
        <p>And which city can stand with confidence before God.</p>
        <p>Sons of Belial were those witnesses of that adulterous woman,</p>
        <p>And lo! their shame is all portrayed in their names.</p>
        <p>Edessa's just and righteous old men, her witnesses,</p>
        <p>
          Were like Naboth, who himself also was slain for righteousness' sake.
        </p>
        <p>They were not like the two lying sons of Belial,</p>
        <p>Nor is Edessa like Zion, which also crucified the Lord.</p>
        <p>Like herself her old men were false, yea dared</p>
        <p>To shed on the ground innocent blood wickedly.</p>
        <p>But by these witnesses here lo! the truth is spoken. --</p>
        <p>Blessed be He who gave us the treasure-store of their crowns!</p>
        <p>Here endeth the Homily on Guria and Shamuna.<br /></p>
