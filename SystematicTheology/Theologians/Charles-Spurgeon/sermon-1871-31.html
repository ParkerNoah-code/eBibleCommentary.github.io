        <p>A Sermon</p>

          |But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.|
          -- Psalm 71:14.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHEN sin conquered the realm of manhood, it slew all the minstrels
          except those of the race of Hope. For humanity, amid all its sorrows
          and sins, hope sings on. To believers in Jesus there remains a royal
          race of bards, for we have a hope of glory, a lively hope, a hope
          eternal and divine. Because our hope abides, our praise continues --
          |I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee.| Because our hopes
          grow brighter, and are every day nearer and nearer to their
          fulfillment, therefore the volume of our praise increases. |I will
          hope continually, and yet praise thee more and more.| A dying hope
          would bring forth declining songs; as the expectations grew more dim,
          so would the music become more faint; but a hope immortal and eternal,
          flaming forth each day with intenser brightness, brings forth a song
          of praise which, as it shall always continue to arise, so shall it
          always gather new force. See well, my brethren, to your faith, and
          your faith and hope, for otherwise God will be robbed of his praise.
          It will be in proportion as you hope for the good things which he has
          promised to your faith, that you will render to him the praise which
          is his royal revenue, acceptable to him by Jesus Christ, and
          abundantly due from you.

          David had not been slack in praise: indeed, he was a sweet singer in
          Israel, a very choir-master unto the Lord yet he vowed to praise him
          more and more. Those who do much already, are usually the people who
          can do more. He was old. Would he praise God more when he was infirm
          than he had done when he was young and vigorous? If he could not excel
          with loudness of voice, yet would he with eagerness of heart; and what
          his praise might lack in sound, it should gain in solemn earnestness.
          He was in trouble too, yet he would not allow the heyday of his
          prosperity to surpass in its notes of loving adoration the dark hour
          of his adversity. For him on no account could there be any going back.
          He had adored the Lord when he was but a youth and kept his father's
          flock. Harp in hand, beneath the spreading tree, he had worshipped the
          Lord his Shepherd, whose rod and staff were his comfort and delight.
          When an exile he had made the rocky fastnesses of Adullam and Engedi
          resound with the name of Jehovah. In after time, when he had become
          king in Israel, his psalms had been multiplied, and his harpstrings
          were daily accustomed to the praises of the God of his salvation. How
          could that zealous songster make an advance in praise? See him yonder
          dancing before the ark of the Lord with all his might: what more of
          joy and zeal can be manifest? Yet he says: |I will yet praise thee
          more and more.| His troubles had been multiplied of late, and his
          infirmities too, yet for all that, no murmuring escapes him, but he
          resolved that his praise should rise higher and higher till he
          continued it in better lands for ever and ever.

          Beloved, it is an intense joy to me to address you this morning after
          so long and sad an absence, and I pray that the Holy Spirit may make
          my word stimulating to you all. Our subject is that of our praising
          God more and more. I do not intend to exhort you to praise God; but
          shall take it for granted that you are doing so, though I fear it will
          be a great mistake in the case of many. We must, however, take that
          fact for granted in those to whom we address ourselves upon our
          particular topic; for those who do not praise God at all cannot be
          exhorted to praise him more and more. To those I direct my speech who
          now love to praise God; these would I charge to resolve with the
          psalmist: |I will yet praise thee more and more.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Our first business shall be, to URGE OURSELVES TO THIS RESOLUTION.
          Why should we praise God more and more? Here I am embarrassed with the
          multitude of arguments which beset me. So many crowd around me that I
          cannot number them in order, but must seize them somewhat at random.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is humbling to remember that we may very well praise God more than
          we have done, for we have praised him very little as yet. What we have
          done, as believers, in glorifying God Mls far, far short of his due.
          Personally, upon consideration, we shall each own this. Bethink thee,
          my dear brother, or sister, what the Lord has done for thee. Some
          years ago thou wast in thy sin, and death, and ruin; he called thee by
          his grace. Thou wast under the burden and curse of sin; he delivered
          thee. Didst thou not expect in the first joy of pardon to have done
          more for him, to have loved him more, to have served him better? What
          are the returns which thou hast made for the boons which thou hast
          received? Are they at all fitting or adequate? I look at a field
          loaded with precious grain and ripening for the harvest: I hear that
          the husbandman has expended so much in rent, so much upon the
          ploughing, so much upon enriching the soil, so much for seed, so much
          more for needful weeding. There is the harvest, and it yields a
          profit: he is contented. But I see another field: it is my own heart;
          and, my brother, thine is the same. What has the Husbandman done for
          it? He has reclaimed it from the wild waste, by a power no less then
          omnipotent. He has hedged it, ploughed it, and cut down the thorns. He
          has watered it as no other field was ever watered, for the bloody
          sweat of Christ has bedewed it, to remove the primeval curse. God's
          own Son has given his whole self that this barren waste may become a
          garden. What has been done it were hard to sum: what more could have
          been done none can say. Yet what is the harvest? Is it adequate to the
          labor expended? Is the tillage remunerative? I am afraid if we cover
          our faces, or if a blush shall serve us instead of a veil, it will be
          the most fit reply to the question. Here and there a withered ear is a
          poor recompense for the tillage of infinite love. Let us, therefore,
          be shamed into a firm resolve, and say with resolute spirit: |By the
          good help of infinite grace, I, at any rate, having been so great a
          laggard, will quicken my pace; I will yet praise thee more and more.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Another argument which presses upon my mind is this: that wherein we
          have praised God up till now, we have not found the service to be a
          weariness to ourselves, but it has ever been to us both a profit and a
          delight. I would not speak falsely even for God, but I bear my
          testimony that the happiest moments I have ever spent have been
          occupied with the worship of God. I have never been so near heaven as
          when adoring before the eternal throne. I think every Christian will
          bear like witness. Among all the joys of earth, and I shall not
          depreciate them, there is no joy comparable to that of praise. The
          innocent mirth of the fireside, the chaste happinesses of household
          love, even these are not to be mentioned side by side with the joy of
          worship, the rapture of drawing near to the Most High. Earth, at her
          best, yields but water, but this divine occupation is as the wine of
          Cana's marriage feast. The purest and most exhilarating joy is the
          delight of glorifying God, and so anticipating the time when we shall
          enjoy him for ever. Now, brethren, if God's praise has been no
          wilderness to you, return to it with zest and ardor, and say: |I will
          yet praise thee more and more.| If any suppose that you grow weary
          with the service of the Lord, tell them that his praise is such
          freedom, such recreation, such felicity, that you desire never to
          cease from it. As for me, if men call God's service slavery, I desire
          to be such a bondslave for ever, and would fain be branded with my
          Master's name indelibly. I would have my ear bored to the door-post of
          my Lord's house, and go no more out. My soul joyfully sings --
        </p>
        <p>|Let thy grace, Lord, like a fetter,</p>
        <p>Bind my wandering heart to thee.|</p>
        <p>
          This to me shall be ambition -- to be more and more subservient to the
          divine honor. This shall be gain -- to be nothing for Christ's sake.
          This my all in all -- to praise thee, my Lord, as long as I have any
          being.
        </p>
        <p>
          A third reason readily suggests itself. We ought surely to praise God
          more to-day than at any other previous day, because we have received
          more mercies. Even of temporal favors we have been large partakers.
          Begin with these, and then rise higher. Some of you, dear brethren and
          sisters, may well be reminded of the great temporal mercies which have
          been lavished upon you. You are to-day in a similar state with Jacob
          when he said: |with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am
          become two bands.| When you first left your father's house to follow a
          toilsome occupation, you had a scant enough purse, and but poor
          prospects; but where are you now as to temporal circumstances and
          position? How highly God has favored some of you! Joseph has risen
          from the dungeon to the throne, David has gone up from the sheepfolds
          to a palace. Look back to what you were, and give the Lord his due. He
          lifts up the poor from the dust, and sets them among princes. You were
          unknown and insignificant, and now his mercy has placed you in
          prominence and esteem. Is this nothing? Do you despise the bounty of
          heaven? Will you not praise the Lord more and more for this? Surely,
          you should do so, and must do so, or else feel the withering curse
          which blasts ingratitude wherever it dwells. Perhaps divine providence
          has not dealt with you exactly in that way but with equal goodness and
          wisdom has revealed itself to you in another form. You have continued
          in the same sphere in which you commenced life, but you have been
          enabled to pursue your work, have been preserved in health and
          strength, have been supplied with food and raiment and what is best,
          have been blessed with a contented heart and a gleaming eye. My dear
          friend, are you not thankful? Will you not praise your heavenly Father
          more and more? We ought not to over estimate temporal mercies so as to
          become worldly; but I am afraid there is a greater likelihood of our
          under estimating them, and becoming ungrateful. We must beware of so
          under estimating them as to lessen our sense of the debt in which they
          involve us before God. We speak sometimes of great mercies. Come now,
          I will ask you a question: Can you count your great mercies? I cannot
          count mine. Perhaps you think the numeration easy! I find it endless.
          I was thinking the other day, and I will venture to confess it
          publicly, what a great mercy it was to be able to turn over in bed.
          Some of you smile, perhaps. Yet I do not exaggerate when I say, I
          could almost clap my hands for joy when I found myself able to turn in
          bed without pain. This day, it is to me a very great mercy to be able
          to stand upright before you. We carelessly imagine that there are but
          a score or two of great mercies, such as having our children about us,
          or enjoying health and so on; but in trying times we see that
          innumerable minor matters are also great gifts of divine love, and
          entail great misery when withdrawn. Sing ye, then, as ye draw water at
          the nether springs, and as the brimming vessels overflow, praise ye
          the Lord yet more and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          But ought we not to praise God more and more when we think of our
          spiritual mercies! What favors have we received of this higher sort!
          Ten years ago you were bound to praise God for the covenant mercies
          you had even then enjoyed; but now, how many more have been bestowed
          upon you; how many cheerings amid darkness; how many answers to
          prayer; how many directions in dilemma; how many delights of
          fellowship; how many helps in service; how many successes in conflict;
          how many revelations of infinite love! To adoption there has been
          added all the blessings of heirship; to justification, all the
          security of acceptance; to conversion, all the energies of indwelling.
          And, remember, as there was no silver cup in Benjamin's sack the
          Joseph put it there, so there was no spiritual good in you till the
          Lord of mercy gave it. Therefore, praise ye the Lord. Louder and
          louder yet be the song. Praise him on the high-sounding cymbals. Since
          we cannot hope to measure his mercies, let us immeasurably praise our
          God. |I will yet praise thee more and more.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now go on a little farther. We have been proving through a
          series of years the faithfulness, immutability, and veracity of our
          God -- proving these attributes by our sinning against God, and their
          bearing the strain of our misbehaviour -- proving them by the
          innumerable benefits which the Lord has bestowed upon us. Shall all
          this experience end in no result? Shall there be no advance in
          gratitude where there is such an increase of obligation? God is so
          good that every moment of his love demands a life of praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should never be forgotten that every Christian as he grows in grace
          should have a loftier idea of God. Our highest conception of God falls
          infinitely short of his glory, but an advanced Christian enjoys a far
          clearer view of what God is than he had at the first. Now, the
          greatness of God is ever a claim for praise. |Great is the Lord, and|
          -- what follows? -- |greatly to be praised.| If, then, God is greater
          to me than he was, let my praise be greater. If I think of him now
          more tenderly as my Father -- if I have a clearer view of him in the
          terror of his justice -- if I have a clearer view of the splendors of
          his wisdom by which he devised the atonement -- if I have larger
          thoughts of his eternal, immutable love -- let every advance in
          knowledge constrain me to say: |I will yet praise thee more and more.|
          I heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth
          thee: therefore while I abhor myself in dust and ashes, my praise
          shall rise yet more loftily; up to thy throne shall my song ascend. I
          did but see as it were the skirts of thy garment, but thou hast hidden
          me in the cleft of the rock Christ Jesus, and made thy glory pass
          before me, and now will I praise thee even as the seraphs do, and vie
          with those before the throne in magnifying thy name. We learn but
          little in Christ's school, if the practical result of it all be not to
          make us cry: |I will yet praise thee more and more.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Still culling here and there a thought out of thousands, I would
          remind you that it is a good reason for praising God more that we are
          getting nearer to the place where we hope to praise him, world without
          end, after a perfect sort. Never have we made these walls ring more
          joyously than when we have united in singing of our Father's house on
          high, and the tents pitched --
        </p>
        <p>|A day's march nearer home.|</p>
        <p>
          Heaven is indeed the only home of our souls, and we shall never feel
          that we have come to our rest till we have reached its mansions. One
          reason why we shall be able to rest in heaven, is because we shall
          there be able perpetually to achieve the object of our creation. Am I
          nearer heaven? then I will be doing more of the work which I shall do
          in heaven. I shall soon use the harp: let me be carefully tuning it:
          let me rehearse the hymns which I shall sing before the throne; for if
          the words in heaven shall be sweeter and more rich than any that poets
          can put together here, yet the essential song of heaven shall be the
          same as that which we present to Jehovah here below.
        </p>
        <p>|they praise the Lamb in hymns above,</p>
        <p>And we in hymns below.|</p>
        <p>
          The essence of their praise is gratitude that he should bleed: it is
          the essence of our praise too. They bless Immanuel's name for
          undeserved favors bestowed upon unworthy ones, and we do the same. My
          aged brethren, I congratulate you, for you are almost home; be yet
          more full of praise than ever. Quicken your footsteps as the glory
          land shines more brightly. You are close to the gate of pearl; sing
          on, dear brother, though infirmities increase, and let the song grow
          sweeter and louder until it melts into the infinite harmonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shall I need to give another reason why we should praise God more and
          more? If I must, I would throw this one into the scale, that surely at
          this present juncture we ought to be more earnest in the praise of
          God, because God's enemies are very earnest in laboring to dishonor
          him. These are times when scoffers are boundlessly impudent. Did it
          not make your blood chill when you heard revolutionists in unhappy
          Paris talk of having |demolished God|? It struck me as almost a sadder
          thing when I read the proposition of one of their philosophers who
          would have them become religious again, that they should bring God
          back again for ten years at least -- an audacious recommendation as
          blasphemously impertinent as the insolence which had proclaimed the
          triumph of atheism. But we need not look across the Channel; perhaps
          they speak more honestly on that side than we do here; for among
          ourselves we have abounding infidelity, which pretends to reverence
          Scripture while it denies its plainest teachings; and we have what is
          quite as bad, a superstition which thrusts Christ aside for the human
          priest, and makes the sacraments everything, and simple trust in the
          great atonement to be as nothing. Now, my brethren, those who hold
          these views are not sleepers, nor do they relax their efforts. We may
          be very quiet and lukewarm about religion (alas! that we should be);
          but these persons are earnest propagators of their faith, or no faith
          -- they compass sea and land to make one proselyte. As we think of
          these busy servants of Satan, we ought to chide ourselves and say:
          |Shall Baal be diligently served, and Jehovah have such a sleepy
          advocate? Be stirred, my soul! Awake, my spirit! Arouse thee at once,
          and praise thy God more and more!|
        </p>
        <p>
          But, indeed, while I give you these few arguments out of many that
          come to my mind, the thought cheers my spirit that with those of you
          who know and love God, there is little need for me to mention reasons,
          for your own souls are hungering and thirsting to praise him. If you
          are debarred for a little time from the public service of God, you
          pant for the assemblies of God's house, and envy the swallows that
          build their nests beneath the eaves. If you are unable to accomplish
          service which you were accustomed to perform for Christ's church, the
          hours drag very wearily along. As the Master found it his meat and his
          drink to do the will of him that sent him, so when you are unable to
          do that will, you are like a person deprived of his meat and drink,
          and an insatiable hunger grows upon you. O Christian brother, do you
          not pant to praise God? I am sure you feel now: |O that I could praise
          him better!| You are perhaps in a position in which you have work to
          do for him, and your heart is saying, |How I wish I could do this work
          more thoroughly to his praise!| Or possibly you are in such a
          condition of life that it is little you can do, and you often wish if
          God would make a change for you, not that it should be one more full
          of comfort, but one in which you could be more serviceable. Above all,
          I know you wish you were rid of sin, and everything which hinders your
          praising God more and more. Well, then, I need not argue, for your own
          heart pleads the holy cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suffer me to conclude this head with a fact that illustrates the
          point. I know one, who has been long privileged to lift his voice in
          the choir of the great King. In that delightful labor none more happy
          than he. The longer he was engaged in the work the more he loved it.
          Now, it came to pass that on a certain day, this songster found
          himself shut out of the choir; he would have entered to take his part,
          but he was not permitted. Perhaps the King was angry; perhaps the
          songster had sung carelessly; perhaps he had acted unworthily in some
          other matter; or possibly his master knew that his song would grow
          more sweet if he were silenced for awhile. How it was I know not, but
          this I know, that it caused great searching of heart. Often this
          chorister begged to be restored, but he was as often repulsed, and
          somewhat roughly too. I think it was more than three months that this
          unhappy songster was kept in enforced silence, with fire in his bones
          and no vent for it. The royal music went on without him; there was no
          lack of song, and in this he rejoiced, but he longed to take his place
          again. I cannot tell you how eagerly he longed. At last the happy hour
          arrived, the king gave his permit, he might sing again. The songster
          was full of gratitude, and I heard him say -- you shall hear him say
          it: |My Lord, since I am again restored, I will hope continually, and
          will yet praise thee more and more.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now let us turn to another point. Let us in the Spirit's strength
          DRIVE AWAY THAT WHICH HINDERS US FROM PRAISING GOD MORE AND MORE.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the deadliest things is dreaminess, sleepiness. A Christian
          readily falls into this state. I notice it even in the public
          congregation. Very often the whole service is gone through
          mechanically. That same dreaminess falls upon many professors and
          abides with them, and instead of praising God more and more, it is as
          much as ever they can do to keep up the old strain -- and barely that.
          Let us shake ourselves from all such sleep. Surely if there were any
          service in which a man should be altogether and wholly awake, it is in
          praising and magnifying God. A sleepy seraph before the throne of
          Jehovah, or a cherub nodding during sacred song, it were ridiculous to
          imagine. And shall such an insult to the majesty of heaven be seen on
          earth? No! Let us say to all that is within us, |Awake! awake!|
        </p>
        <p>
          The next hindrance would be divided objects. We cannot, however we may
          resolve, praise God more and more, if, as we grow older, we allow this
          world to take up our thoughts. If I say, |I will praise God more and
          more,| and yet I am striking out right and left with projects of
          amassing wealth, or I am plunging myself into greater business cares
          unnecessarily, my actions belie my resolutions. Not that we would
          check enterprise. There are periods in life when a man may be enabled
          to praise God more and more by extending the bounds of his business;
          but there are persons whom I have known who have praised God right
          well in a certain condition, but they have not been content to let
          well alone, and they have been for aggrandising themselves, and they
          have had to give up their Sabbath-school class, or the village
          station, or attendance at the visiting committee, or some other form
          of Christian service, because their money-getting demanded all their
          strength. Beloved, you shall find it small gain if you gain in this
          world, but lose in praising God. As we grow older, it is wise to
          concentrate more and more our energies upon the one thing, the only
          thing worth living for -- the praise of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another great obstacle to praising God more is, self-content; and
          this, again, is a condition into which we may very easily fall. Our
          belief is, only we must not avow it when we may be overheard, we are
          all very fine fellows indeed. We may confess when we are praying, and
          at other times, that we are miserable sinners -- and I daresay we have
          some belief that it is so -- but for all that, there is within our
          minds the conviction that we are very respectable people, and are
          doing exceedingly well upon the whole; and comparing ourselves with
          other Christians, it is much to our credit that we are praising God as
          well as we are. Now, I have put this very roughly, but is it not what
          the heart has said to us at times? Oh, loathsome thought! that a
          sinner should grow content with himself. Self-satisfaction is the end
          of progress. Dear friend, why compare yourself with the dwarfs around
          you? If you must compare yourself with your fellow men, look at the
          giants of other days; but, better still, relinquish the evil habit
          altogether; for Paul tells us it is not wise to compare ourselves
          among ourselves. Look to our Lord and Master, who towers so high above
          us in peerless excellence. No, no, we dare not flatter ourselves, but
          with humble self-condemnation we resolve to praise the Lord more and
          more.
        </p>
        <p>
          To rest on the past is another danger as to this matter. We did so
          much for God when we were young. I occasionally meet with drones in
          the Christian hive, whose boast is that they made a great deal of
          honey years ago. I see men lying upon their oars to-day, but they
          startle me with a description of the impetus they gave to the boat
          years ago. You should have seen them when they were master-rowers, in
          those former times. What a pity that these brethren cannot be aroused
          to do their first works; it would be a gain to the church, but it
          would be an equal benefit to themselves. Suppose God should say, |Rest
          on the past. I gave you great mercies twenty years ago; live on them.|
          Suppose the eternal and ever beloved Spirit should say, |I wrought a
          work in you thirty years ago; I withdraw myself, and I will do no
          more.| Where were you then? Yet, my dear brother, if you still have to
          draw afresh upon the eternal fountains, do, I beseech you, praise the
          ever-blessed source of all.
        </p>
        <p>
          May God help us then to shake off all those things which would prevent
          our praising him! Possibly there is some afflicted one here, in so low
          a state, so far pressed by poverty or bodily pain, that he is saying:
          |I cannot praise God more and more: I am ready to despair.| Dear
          brother, may God give you full resignation to his will, and the
          greater your troubles the sweeter will be your song. I met in an old
          divine a short but sweet story, which touched my heart. A poor widow
          and her little child were sitting together in great want, both feeling
          the pinch of hunger, and the child looked up into the mother's face,
          and said: |Mother, God won't starve us, will he?| |No, my child,| said
          the mother; |I do not think he will.| |But, mother,| said the child,
          |if he does, we will still praise him as long as we live, won't we,
          mother?| |May those who are grey headed be able to say what the child
          said, and to carry it out. |Though he slay me, yet will I trust in
          him.| We have received good at the hands of the Lord; shall we not
          also receive evil? |The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away;
          blessed be the name of the Lord.| |I will yet praise thee more and
          more.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Very briefly LET US APPLY OURSELVES TO THE PRACTICAL CARRYING OUT
          OF THIS RESOLUTION. I have given you arguments for it, and tried to
          move away impediments. Now for a little help in the performance of it.
          How shall I begin to praise God more and more?
        </p>
        <p>
          Earnestness says: |I shall undertake some fresh duty this afternoon.|
          Stop, dear brother, just a minute. If you want to praise God, would
          not it be as well first to begin with yourself? The musician said: |I
          will praise God better;| but the pipes of his instrument were foul; he
          had better look to them first. If the strings have slipped from their
          proper tension, it will be well to correct them before beginning the
          tune. If we would praise God more, it is not to be done as boys rush
          into a bath -- head first. No; prepare yourself; make your heart
          ready. Thou needest the Spirit's aid to make thy soul fit for praising
          God. It is not every fool's work. Go then to thy chamber, confess the
          sins of the past, and ask the Lord to give thee much more grace that
          thou mayst begin to praise him.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we would praise God more and more, let us improve our private
          devotions. God is much praised by really devout prayer and adoration.
          Preachings are not fruits: they are sowings. True song is fruit. I
          mean this, that the green blade of the wheat may be the sermon, but
          the wheat-ear is the hymn you sing, the prayer in which you unite. The
          true result of life is praise to God. |The chief end of man,| says the
          catechism, and I cannot put it better, |is to glorify God, and enjoy
          him for ever;| and wherein we glorify God in our private devotion, we
          are answering the true end of our being. If we desire to praise God
          more, we must ask grace that our private devotions may rise to a
          higher standard. I am more and more persuaded from my own experience,
          that in proportion to the strength of our private life with God will
          be the force of our character, and the power of our work for God
          amongst men. Let us look well to this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, however, I hear the zealous young man or woman saying: |Well, I
          will attend to what you have said. I will see to private prayer and to
          heart work, but I mean to begin some work of usefulness.| Quite right;
          but stay a little. I want to ask you this question: Are you sure that
          your own personal conduct in what you call your everyday life has as
          much of the praise of God in it as it might have? It is all a mistake
          to think that we must come here to praise God. You can praise God in
          your shops, and in your kitchens, and in your bedrooms. It is all a
          mistake to suppose that Sunday is the only day to praise God in.
          Praise him on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, every day, everywhere.
          All places are holy to holy people, and all engagements holy to holy
          men, if they do them with holy motives, lifting up their hearts to
          God; and whether a man swings the blacksmith's hammer, or lays his
          hand upon the ploughtail, that is true worship which is done as unto
          the Lord and not unto men. I like the story of the servant-maid, who,
          when she was asked on joining the church, |Are you converted?| |I hope
          so, sir.| |What makes you think you are really a child of God?| |Well,
          sir, there is a great change in me from what there used to be.| |What
          is that change?| |I don't know, sir, but there is a change in all
          things; but there is one thing, I always sweep under the mats now.|
          Many a time she had hidden the dust under the mat. It was not so now;
          it is a very excellent reason for believing that there is a change of
          heart when work is conscientiously done. There is a set of mats in all
          our houses where we are accustomed to put the dirt away; and when a
          man gets in his business to sweep from under the mats -- you merchants
          have your mats, you know, when you avoid the evils which custom
          tolerates but which God condemns, then you have marks of grace within.
          Oh, to have a conduct moulded by the example of Christ! If any man
          lived after a holy sort, though he never preached a sermon or even
          sung a hymn, he would have praised God; and the more conscientiously
          he acted, the more thoroughly would he have done so.
        </p>
        <p>
          These inner matters being considered, let us go on to increase our
          actual and direct service of God. Let us do what we have been doing of
          Christian teaching, visiting, and so on; but in all let us do more,
          give more, and labor more. Who among us is working at his utmost, or
          giving at his utmost? Let us quicken our speed. Or suppose we are
          already doing so much that all the time we can possibly spare is fully
          occupied, let us do what we do better. In some Christian churches they
          do not want more societies, but they want more force put into them.
          You may trip over the sand of the sea-shore and scarcely leave an
          impression, but if you take heavy steps there is a deep foot-mark each
          time. May we in our service of God tread heavily, and leave deep
          foot-prints on the sands of time. Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily;
          throw yourselves into it; do it with thy might. |Thou shalt love the
          Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all
          thy might.| Oh, to be enabled to serve God after this fashion -- this
          would be to praise him more and more! Though I do not say that you can
          always tell how far a man praises God by the quantity of work that he
          does for God, yet it is not a bad gauge. It was an old aphorism of
          Hippocrates, the old physician, that you could judge of a man's heart
          by his arm; by which he meant that by his pulse he judged of his
          heart: and as a rule, though there may be exceptions, you shall tell
          whether a man's heart beats truly to God, by the work that he does for
          God. You who are doing much, do more; and you who are doing little,
          multiply that little, I pray you, in God's strength, and so praise him
          more and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          We should praise God much more if we threw more of his praise into our
          common conversation -- if we spoke more of him when we are by the way
          or when we sit in the house. We should praise him more and more if we
          fulfilled our consecration, and obeyed the precept, |Whether therefore
          ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.| We
          should do well if we added to our godly service more singing. The
          world sings: the million have their songs; and I must say the taste of
          the populace is a very remarkable taste just now as to its favourite
          songs. They are, many of them, so absurd and meaningless as to be
          unworthy of an idiot. I should insult an idiot if I could suppose that
          such songs as people sing nowadays would really be agreeable to him.
          Yet these things will be heard from men, and places will be thronged
          to listen to hear the stuff. Now, why should we, with the grand psalms
          we have of David, with the noble hymns of Cowper, of Milton, of Watts
          -- why should not we sing as well as they? Let us sing the songs of
          Zion they are as cheerful as the songs of Sodom any day. Let us drown
          the howling nonsense of Gomorrha with the melodies of the New
          Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to conclude, I would that every Christian here would labor to be
          impressed with the importance of the subject which I have tried to
          bring before you. And when I say every Christian, I may correct myself
          and say, every person here present. |I will yet praise thee more and
          more.| Why some of you present have never praised God at all! Suppose
          you were to die to-day, and soon you must: where should you go? To
          heaven? Where would heaven be to you? There can be no heaven for you.
          They praise God in the only heaven I have ever heard of. The element
          of heaven is gratitude, praise, adoration you do not know anything of
          this, and therefore it would not be possible for God to make a heaven
          for you. God can do all things except make a sinful spirit happy, or
          violate truth and justice. Thou must either praise God or be wretched.
          O my hearer, there is a choice for thee: thou must either worship the
          God that made thee, or else thou must be wretched. It is not that he
          kindles a fire for thee, nor that he casts upon it the brimstone of
          his wrath, though that be true; but thy wretchedness will begin within
          thyself, for to be unable to praise is to be full of hell. To praise
          God is heaven. When completely immersed in adoration, we are
          completely filled with felicity; but to be totally devoid of gratitude
          is to be totally devoid of happiness. O that a change might come over
          you who have never blessed the Lord, and may it happen this morning!
          May the work of regeneration take place now! There is power in the
          Holy Spirit to change thy heart of stone in a moment into a heart of
          flesh, so that instead of being cold and lifeless, it shall palpitate
          with gratitude. Seest thou not Christ on the cross dying for sinners?
          Canst thou look on that disinterested love, and not feel some
          gratitude for such love as is there exhibited? Oh, if thou canst look
          to Jesus and trust him, thou shalt feel a flash of life come into thy
          soul, and with it shall come praise, and then shalt thou find it
          possible to begin the happy life, and it shall be certain to thee that
          as thou shalt praise God more and more, so shall that happy life be
          expanded, be perfected in bliss.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Christians, the last word shall be to you. Are you praising God
          more and more? If you are not, I am afraid of one thing, and that is,
          that you are probably praising him less and less. It is a certain
          truth that if we do not go forward in the Christian life, we go
          backward. You cannot stand still; there is a drift one way or the
          other. Now he that praises God less than he did, and goes on to praise
          him less to-morrow, and less the next day, and so on -- what will he
          get to? and what is he? Evidently he is one of those that draw back
          unto perdition, and there are no persons upon whom a more dreadful
          sentence is pronounced, often spoken of by Paul, and most terribly by
          Peter and Jude. Those |Trees twice dead, plucked up by the roots;| the
          |Wandering stars for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for
          ever.| It would have been infinitely better for them not to have known
          the way of righteousness, than having known it, after a fashion, to
          have turned aside! Better never to have put their hand to the plough,
          than having done so, after a sort, to turn back from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, beloved, I am persuaded better things of you, and things that
          accompany salvation, though I thus speak. I pray that God will lead
          you on from strength to strength, for that is the path of the just.
          May you grow in grace, for life is proven by growth. May you march
          like pilgrims towards heaven, singing, all the way. The lark may serve
          us as a final picture, and an example of what we all should be. We
          should be mounting: our prayer should be, |Nearer, my God, to thee.|
          We should be mounting: our motto might well be, |Higher! higher!
          higher!| As we mount, we should sing, and our song should grow louder,
          clearer, more full of heaven. Upward, brother I sing as thou soarest.
          Upward, sing till thou art dissolved in glory. Amen.
