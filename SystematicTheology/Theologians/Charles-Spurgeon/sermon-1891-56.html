          1. I have shown that the number thirty fails them in every respect;
          too few Æons, as they represent them, being at one time found within
          the Pleroma, and then again too many [to correspond with that number].
          There are not, therefore, thirty Æons, nor did the Saviour come to be
          baptized when He was thirty years old, for this reason, that He might
          show forth the thirty silent Æons of their system, otherwise they must
          first of all separate and eject [the Saviour] Himself from the Pleroma
          of all. Moreover, they affirm that He suffered in the twelfth month,
          so that He continued to preach for one year after His baptism; and
          they endeavour to establish this point out of the prophet (for it is
          written, |To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of
          retribution| ), being truly blind, inasmuch as they affirm they have
          found out the mysteries of Bythus, yet not understanding that which is
          called by Isaiah the acceptable year of the Lord, nor the day of
          retribution. For the prophet neither speaks concerning a day which
          includes the space of twelve hours, nor of a year the length of which
          is twelve months. For even they themselves acknowledge that the
          prophets have very often expressed themselves in parables and
          allegories, and [are] not [to be understood] according to the mere
          sound of the words.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That, then, was called the day of retribution on which the Lord
          will render to every one according to his works -- that is, the
          judgment. The acceptable year of the Lord, again, is this present
          time, in which those who believe Him are called by Him, and become
          acceptable to God -- that is, the whole time from His advent onwards
          to the consummation [of all things], during which He acquires to
          Himself as fruits [of the scheme of mercy] those who are saved. For,
          according to the phraseology of the prophet, the day of retribution
          follows the [acceptable] year; and the prophet will be proved guilty
          of falsehood if the Lord preached only for a year, and if he speaks of
          it. For where is the day of retribution? For the year has passed, and
          the day of retribution has not yet come; but He still |makes His sun
          to rise upon the good and upon the evil, and sends rain upon the just
          and unjust.| And the righteous suffer persecution, are afflicted, and
          are slain, while sinners are possessed of abundance, and |drink with
          the sound of the harp and psaltery, but do not regard the works of the
          Lord.| But, according to the language [used by the prophet], they
          ought to be combined, and the day of retribution to follow the
          [acceptable] year. For the words are, |to proclaim the acceptable year
          of the Lord, and the day of retribution.| This present time,
          therefore, in which men are called and saved by the Lord, is properly
          understood to be denoted by |the acceptable year of the Lord;| and
          there follows on this |the day of retribution,| that is, the judgment.
          And the time thus referred to is not called |a year| only, but is also
          named |a day| both by the prophet and by Paul, of whom the apostle,
          calling to mind the Scripture, says in the Epistle addressed to the
          Romans, |As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day
          long, we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.| But here the
          expression |all the day long| is put for all this time during which we
          suffer persecution, and are killed as sheep. As then this day does not
          signify one which consists of twelve hours, but the whole time during
          which believers in Christ suffer and are put to death for His sake, so
          also the year there mentioned does not denote one which consists of
          twelve months, but the whole time of faith during which men hear and
          believe the preaching of the Gospel, and those become acceptable to
          God who unite themselves to Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But it is greatly to be wondered at, how it has come to pass that,
          while affirming that they have found out the mysteries of God, they
          have not examined the Gospels to ascertain how often after His baptism
          the Lord went up, at the time of the passover, to Jerusalem, in
          accordance with what was the practice of the Jews from every land, and
          every year, that they should assemble at this period in Jerusalem, and
          there celebrate the feast of the passover. First of all, after He had
          made the water wine at Cana of Galilee, He went up to the festival day
          of the passover, on which occasion it is written, |For many believed
          in Him, when they saw the signs which He did,| as John the disciple of
          the Lord records. Then, again, withdrawing Himself [from Judæa], He is
          found in Samaria; on which occasion, too, He conversed with the
          Samaritan woman, and while at a distance, cured the son of the
          centurion by a word, saying, |Go thy way, thy son liveth.| Afterwards
          He went up, the second time, to observe the festival day of the
          passover in Jerusalem; on which occasion He cured the paralytic man,
          who had lain beside the pool thirty-eight years, bidding him rise,
          take up his couch, and depart. Again, withdrawing from thence to the
          other side of the sea of Tiberias, He there seeing a great crowd had
          followed Him, fed all that multitude with five loaves of bread, and
          twelve baskets of fragments remained over and above. Then, when He had
          raised Lazarus from the dead, and plots were formed against Him by the
          Pharisees, He withdrew to a city called Ephraim; and from that place,
          as it is written |He came to Bethany six days before the passover,|
          and going up from Bethany to Jerusalem, He there ate the passover, and
          suffered on the day following. Now, that these three occasions of the
          passover are not included within one year, every person whatever must
          acknowledge. And that the special month in which the passover was
          celebrated, and in which also the Lord suffered, was not the twelfth,
          but the first, those men who boast that they know all things, if they
          know not this, may learn it from Moses. Their explanation, therefore,
          both of the year and of the twelfth month has been proved false, and
          they ought to reject either their explanation or the Gospel; otherwise
          [this unanswerable question forces itself upon them], How is it
          possible that the Lord preached for one year only?
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Being thirty years old when He came to be baptized, and then
          possessing the full age of a Master, He came to Jerusalem, so that He
          might be properly acknowledged by all as a Master. For He did not seem
          one thing while He was another, as those affirm who describe Him as
          being man only in appearance; but what He was, that He also appeared
          to be. Being a Master, therefore, He also possessed the age of a
          Master, not despising or evading any condition of humanity, nor
          setting aside in Himself that law which He had appointed for the human
          race, but sanctifying every age, by that period corresponding to it
          which belonged to Himself. For He came to save all through means of
          Himself -- all, I say, who through Him are born again to God --
          infants, and children, and boys, and youths, and old men. He therefore
          passed through every age, becoming an infant for infants, thus
          sanctifying infants; a child for children, thus sanctifying those who
          are of this age, being at the same time made to them an example of
          piety, righteousness, and submission; a youth for youths, becoming an
          example to youths, and thus sanctifying them for the Lord. So likewise
          He was an old man for old men, that He might be a perfect Master for
          all, not merely as respects the setting forth of the truth, but also
          as regards age, sanctifying at the same time the aged also, and
          becoming an example to them likewise. Then, at last, He came on to
          death itself, that He might be |the first-born from the dead, that in
          all things He might have the pre-eminence,| the Prince of life,
          existing before all, and going before all.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. They, however, that they may establish their false opinion
          regarding that which is written, |to proclaim the acceptable year of
          the Lord,| maintain that He preached for one year only, and then
          suffered in the twelfth month. [In speaking thus,] they are forgetful
          to their own disadvantage, destroying His whole work, and robbing Him
          of that age which is both more necessary and more honourable than any
          other; that more advanced age, I mean, during which also as a teacher
          He excelled all others. For how could He have had disciples, if He did
          not teach? And how could He have taught, unless He had reached the age
          of a Master? For when He came to be baptized, He had not yet completed
          His thirtieth year, but was beginning to be about thirty years of age
          (for thus Luke, who has mentioned His years, has expressed it: |Now
          Jesus was, as it were, beginning to be thirty years old,| when He came
          to receive baptism); and, [according to these men,] He preached only
          one year reckoning from His baptism. On completing His thirtieth year
          He suffered, being in fact still a young man, and who had by no means
          attained to advanced age. Now, that the first stage of early life
          embraces thirty years, and that this extends onwards to the fortieth
          year, every one will admit; but from the fortieth and fiftieth year a
          man begins to decline towards old age, which our Lord possessed while
          He still fulfilled the office of a Teacher, even as the Gospel and all
          the elders testify; those who were conversant in Asia with John, the
          disciple of the Lord, [affirming] that John conveyed to them that
          information. And he remained among them up to the times of Trajan.
          Some of them, moreover, saw not only John, but the other apostles
          also, and heard the very same account from them, and bear testimony as
          to the [validity of] the statement. Whom then should we rather
          believe? Whether such men as these, or Ptolemæus, who never saw the
          apostles, and who never even in his dreams attained to the slightest
          trace of an apostle?
        </p>
        <p>
          6. But, besides this, those very Jews who then disputed with the Lord
          Jesus Christ have most clearly indicated the same thing. For when the
          Lord said to them, |Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day; and he
          saw it, and was glad,| they answered Him, |Thou art not yet fifty
          years old, and hast Thou seen Abraham?| Now, such language is
          fittingly applied to one who has already passed the age of forty,
          without having as yet reached his fiftieth year, yet is not far from
          this latter period. But to one who is only thirty years old it would
          unquestionably be said, |Thou art not yet forty years old.| For those
          who wished to convict Him of falsehood would certainly not extend the
          number of His years far beyond the age which they saw He had attained;
          but they mentioned a period near His real age, whether they had truly
          ascertained this out of the entry in the public register, or simply
          made a conjecture from what they observed that He was above forty
          years old, and that He certainly was not one of only thirty years of
          age. For it is altogether unreasonable to suppose that they were
          mistaken by twenty years, when they wished to prove Him younger than
          the times of Abraham. For what they saw, that they also expressed; and
          He whom they beheld was not a mere phantasm, but an actual being of
          flesh and blood. He did not then want much of being fifty years old;
          and, in accordance with that fact, they said to Him, |Thou art not yet
          fifty years old, and hast Thou seen Abraham?| He did not therefore
          preach only for one year, nor did He suffer in the twelfth month of
          the year. For the period included between the thirtieth and the
          fiftieth year can never be regarded as one year, unless indeed, among
          their Æons, there be so long years assigned to those who sit in their
          ranks with Bythus in the Pleroma; of which beings Homer the poet, too,
          has spoken, doubtless being inspired by the Mother of their [system
          of] error: --
