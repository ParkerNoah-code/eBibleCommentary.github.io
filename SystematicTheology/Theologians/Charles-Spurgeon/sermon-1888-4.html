        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.2023)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, May 13th, 1888, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the
          Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye
          may believe on the name of the Son of God." -- 1 John 5:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          JOHN wrote to believers -- "These things have I written unto you that
          believe on the name of the Son of God." It is worthy of note that all
          the epistles are so written. They are not letters to everybody, they
          are letters to those who are called to be saints. It ought to strike
          some of you with awe when you open the Bible and think how large a
          part of it is not directed at you. You may read it, and God's Holy
          Spirit may graciously bless it to you, but it is not directed to you.
          You are reading another man's letter: thank God that you are permitted
          to read it, but long to be numbered with those to whom it is directed.
          Thank God much more if any part of it should be used of the Holy Ghost
          for your salvation. The fact that the Holy Spirit speaks to the
          churches and to believers in Christ should make you bow the knee and
          cry to God to put you among the children, that this Book may become
          your Book from beginning to end, that you may read its precious
          promises as made to you. This solemn thought may not have struck some
          of you: let it impress you now.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not wonder that certain men do not receive the epistles, for
          they were not written to them. Why should they cavil at words which
          are addressed to men of another sort from themselves? Yet we do not
          marvel, for we knew it would be so. Here is a will, and you begin to
          read it; but you do not find it interesting: it is full of words and
          terms which you do not take the trouble to understand, because they
          have no relation to yourself; but should you, in reading that will,
          come upon a clause in which an estate is left to you, I warrant you
          that the nature of the whole document will seem changed to you. You
          will be anxious now to understand the terms, and to make sure of the
          clauses, and you will even wish to remember every word of the clause
          which refers to yourself. O dear friends, may you read the Testament
          of our Lord Jesus Christ as a testament of love to yourselves, and
          then you will prize it beyond all the writings of the sages.
        </p>
        <p>
          This leads me to make the second remark, that as these things are
          written to believers, believers ought especially to make themselves
          acquainted with them, and to search into their meaning and intent.
          John says, "These things have I written to you that believe on the
          name of the Son of God." Do not, I beseech you, neglect to read what
          the Holy Ghost has taken care to write to you. It is not merely John
          that writes. John is inspired of the Lord, and these things are
          written to you by the Spirit of God. Give earnest heed to every single
          word of what God has sent as his own epistle to your hearts. Value the
          Scriptures. Luther said that "he would not be in paradise, if he might
          , without the Word of the Lord; but with the Word he could live in
          hell itself." He said at another time that "he would not take all the
          world for one leaf of the Bible." The Scriptures are everything to the
          Christian -- his meat and his drink. The saint can say, "O how I love
          thy law!" If we cannot say so, something is wrong with us. If we have
          lost our relish for Holy Scripture, we are out of condition, and need
          to pray for spiritual health.
        </p>
        <p>
          This much is the porch of my sermon, let us now enter more fully into
          our subject, noticing, first, that John wrote with a special purpose;
          and then going on to assert, secondly, that this purpose we ought to
          follow up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, JOHN WROTE WITH A SPECIAL PURPOSE. Men do not write well
          unless they have some end in writing. To sit down with paper and ink
          before you, and so much space to fill up, will ensure very poor
          writing. John knew what he was at. His intent and aim were clear to
          his own mind, and he tells us what they were.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the text the beloved apostle had one clear purpose which
          branched out into three.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin with, John wrote that we might enjoy the full assurance of
          our salvation. "These things have I written unto you that believe on
          the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal
          life."
        </p>
        <p>
          Many who believe on the name of Jesus are not sure that they have
          eternal life; they only hope so. Occasionally they have assurance, but
          the joy is not abiding. They are like a minister I have heard of, who
          said he felt assured of his salvation, "except when the wind was in
          the east." It is a wretched thing to be so subject to circumstances as
          many are. What is true when the wind is in the soft south or the
          reviving west is equally true when the wind is neither good for man
          nor beast. John would not have our assurance vary with the
          weather-glass, nor turn with the vane. He says, "These things have I
          written unto you, that ye may know that ye have eternal life." He
          would have us certain that we are partakers of the new life, and so
          know it as to reap the golden fruit of such knowledge, and be filled
          with joy and peace through believing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I speak affectionately to the weaker ones, who cannot yet say that
          they know they have believed. I speak not to your condemnation, but to
          your consolation. Full assurance is not essential to salvation, but it
          is essential to satisfaction. May you get -- may you get it at once;
          at any rate may you never be satisfied to live without it. You may
          have full assurance. You may have it without personal revelations: it
          is wrought in us by the Word of God. These things are written that you
          may have it; and we may be sure that the means used by the Spirit are
          equal to the effect which he desires. Under the guidance of the Spirit
          of God, John so wrote as to attain his end in writing. What, then, has
          he written with the design of making us know that we have eternal
          life? Go through the whole Epistle, and you will see that it all
          presses in that direction; but we shall not at this present have time
          to do more than glance through this chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
          He begins thus: "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born
          of God." Do you believe that Jesus is the anointed of God? Is he so to
          you? Is he anointed as your prophet, priest, and king? Have you
          realized his anointing so as to put your trust in him? Do you receive
          Jesus as appointed of God to be the Mediator, the Propitiation for
          sin, the Saviour of men? If so, you are born of God. "How may I know
          this?" Brethern, our evidence is the witness of God himself as here
          recorded. We need no other witness. Suppose an angel were to tell you
          that you are born of God, would that be a more sure testimony than the
          infallible Scripture? If you believe that Jesus is the Christ, you are
          born of God. John has thus positively declared the truth, that you may
          know that you have eternal life. Can anything be more clear than this?
        </p>
        <p>
          The loving spirit of John leads him to say, "Every one that loveth him
          that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him." Do you love God?
          Do you love his Only-begotten Son? You can answer those two questions
          surely. I knew a dear Christian woman who would sometimes say, "I know
          that I love Jesus; but my fear is that he does not love me." Her doubt
          used to make me smile, for it never could have occurred to me. If I
          love him, I know it is because he first loved me. Love to God in us is
          always the work of God's love towards us. Jesus loved us, and gave
          himself for us, and therefore we love him in return. Love to Jesus is
          an effect which proves the existence of its cause. Do you love Jesus?
          Do you feel a delight in him? Is his name as music to your ear, and
          honey to your mouth? Do you love to hear him extolled? Ah, dear
          friends! I know that to many of you a sermon full of his dear name is
          as a royal banquent; and if there is no Christ in a discourse, it is
          empty, and vain, and void to you. Is it not so? If you do indeed love
          him that begat and him that is begotten of him, then this is one of
          the things that is written "that ye may know that ye have eternal
          life."
        </p>
        <p>
          John goes on to give another evidence: "By this we know that we love
          the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments." Do
          you love God? and do you love his children? Listen to another word
          from the same apostle: "We know that we have passed from death unto
          life, because we love the brethren." That may appear to be a very
          small evidence; but I can assure you it has often been a great comfort
          to my soul. I know I love the brethern: I can say unto my Lord,
        </p>
        <p>"Is there a lamb among thy flock</p>
        <p>I would disdain to feed?"</p>
        <p>
          I would gladly cheer and comfort the least of his people. Well, then,
          if I love the brethern, I love the Elder Brother. If I love the babes,
          I love the Father; and I know that I have passed from death unto life.
          Brethren, take this evidence home in all its force. It is conclusive:
          John has said, "We know that we have passed from death unto life,
          because we love the brethren"; and he would not have spoken so
          positively if it had not been even so. Brethren, never be content with
          sentimental comforts; set your feet firmly upon the rock of fact and
          truth. True Christian assurance is not a matter of guesswork, but of
          mathematical precision. It is capable of logical proof, and is no
          rhapsody or poetical fiction. We are told by the Holy Ghost that, if
          we love the brethren, we have passed from death to life. You can tell
          whether you love the brethren, as such, for their Master's sake, and
          for the truth's sake that is in them; and if you can truly say that
          you thus love them, then you may know that you have eternal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our apostle gives us this further evidence: "This is the love of God,
          that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous."
          Obedience is the grand test of love. If you are living after your own
          will, and pay no homage to God, you are none of his. If you never
          think of the Lord Jesus as your Master, and never recognize the claims
          of God, and never wish to be obedient to his will, you are not in
          possession of eternal life. If you desire to be obedient, and prove
          that desire by your actions, then you have the divine life within you.
          Judge yourselves. Is the tenor of your life obedience or disobedience?
          By the fruit you can test the root and the sap.
        </p>
        <p>
          But note, that this obedience must be cheerful and willing. No doubt
          some for a while obey the commands of God unwillingly. They do not
          like them, though they bow to them. They fret and grizzle because of
          the restraints of piety; and this proves that they are hypocrites.
          What you wish to do you practically are doing in the sight of God. If
          there could be such a thing as holiness forced upon a man, it would be
          unholiness. O my hearer, it may be that you cannot fall into a certain
          line of sin; but if you could, you would: your desires show what you
          really are. I have heard of Christian people, so called, going to
          sinful amusements, just, as they say, to enjoy a little pleasure. Ah
          well, we see where you are! Where your pleasure is, your heart is. If
          you enjoy the pleasures of the world, you are of the world, and with
          the world you will be condemned. If God's commands are grievous to
          you, then you are a rebel at heart. Loyal subjects delight in the
          royal law. "His commandments are not grievous." I said to one who came
          to join the church the other day, "I suppose you are not perfect"? and
          the reply was, "No, sir, I wish I might be." I said, "And suppose you
          were"? "Oh, then," she said, "that would be heaven to me." So it would
          be to me. We delight in the law of God after the inward man. Oh, that
          we could perfectly obey in thought, and word, and deed! This is our
          view of heaven. Thus we sing of it:
        </p>
        <p>"There shall we see his face,</p>
        <p>And never, never sin;</p>
        <p>There from the rivers of his grace</p>
        <p>Drink endless pleasures in."</p>
        <p>
          We would scarce ask to be rid of sorrow, if we might be rid of sin. We
          would bear any burden cheerfully if we could live without spot we
          shall also be without grief. His commandments are not grievous, but
          they are ways of pleasantness and peace to us. Do you feel that you
          love the ways of God, that you desire holiness, and follow after it
          joyfully? Then, dear friends, you have eternal life, and these are the
          sure evidences of it. Obedience, holiness, delight in God never came
          into a human heart except from a heavenly hand. Wherever they are
          found they prove that the Lord has implanted eternal life, for they
          are much too precious to be buried away in a dead soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          John then proceeds to mention three witnesses. Now, dear hearers, do
          you know anything about these three witnesses? "There are three that
          bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and
          these three agree in one." Do you know "the Spirit" ? Has the Spirit
          of God quickened you, changed you, illuminated you, sanctified you?
          Does the Spirit of God dwell in you? Do you feel his sacred impulses?
          Is he the essence of the new life within you? Do you know him as
          clothing you with his light and power? If so, you are alive unto God.
          Next, do you know "the water," the purifying power of the death of
          Christ? Does the crucified Lord crucify your sins? Is the water
          applied to you to remove the power of sin? Do you now long to perfect
          holiness in the fear of God? This proves that you have eternal life.
          Do you also know "the blood"? This is a wretched age, in which men
          think little of the precious blood. My heart has well-nigh been
          broken, and my very flesh has been enfeebled, as I have thought upon
          the horrible things which have been spoken of late about the precious
          blood by men called Christian ministers. "O my soul, come not thou
          into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou
          united." Beloved friends, do you know the power of the blood to take
          away sin, the power of the blood to speak peace to the conscience, the
          power of the blood to give access to the throne of grace? Do you know
          the quickening, restoring, cheering power of the precious blood of
          Christ which is set forth in the Lord's Supper by the fruit of the
          vine? Then in the mouth of these three witnesses shall the fact of
          your having eternal life be fully established. If the Spirit of God be
          in you, he is the earnest of your eternal inheritance. If the water
          has washed you, then you are the Lord's. Jesus said to Peter, "If I
          wash thee not, thou hast no part in me." But ye are washed, and
          therefore the Lord's. If the precious blood has cleansed you from the
          guilt of sin, you know that it has also purchased you from death, and
          it is to you the guarantee of eternal life. I pray that you may from
          this moment enjoy the combined light of these three lamps of God --
          "the spirit, and the water, and the blood," and so have full assurance
          of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing more I would notice. Read the ninth verse: the apostle puts
          our faith and assurance on the ground that we receive "the witness of
          God." If I believe that I am saved because of this, that, and the
          other, I may be mistaken: the only sure ground is "the witness of
          God." The inmost heart of Christian faith is that we take God as his
          word; and we must accept that word, not because of the probabilities
          of its statements, nor because of the confirmatory evidence of science
          and philosophy, but simply and alone because the Lord has spoken it.
          Many professing Christians fall sadly short of this point. They dare
          to judge the Word instead of bowing before it. They do not sit at the
          Master's feet, but become doctors themselves. I thank God that I
          believe everything that God has spoken, whether I am able to see its
          reason or not. To me the fact that the mouth of God hath spoken it
          stands in the place of all argument, either for or against. If Jehovah
          says so, so it is. Do you accept the witness of God? If not, you have
          made him a liar, and the truth is not in you; but if you have received
          "the witnesses of God," then this is his witness, that "He hath given
          to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son." I say again, if your
          faith stands in the wisdom of men, and is based upon the cleverness of
          a preacher, it will fail you; but if it stands on the sure Word of the
          Lord it will stand for ever, and this may be to you a special token
          that you have eternal life. I have said enough upon this subject; oh
          that God may bless it to you! May we be enabled, from what John has
          written, to gather beyond doubt that we have the life of God within
          our souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, John wrote that we might know our spiritual life to be
          eternal. Please notice this, for there are some of God's children who
          have not yet learned this cheering lesson. The life of God in the soul
          is not transient, but abiding; not temporary but eternal. Some think
          that the life of God in the believer's soul may die out; but how,
          then, could it be eternal? If it die it is not eternal life. If it be
          eternal life it cannot die. I know that modern deceivers deny that
          eternal means eternal, but you and I have not learned their way of
          pumping the meanings out of the words which the Holy Spirit uses. We
          believe that "eternal" means endless, and that if I have eternal life,
          I shall live eternally, Brethren, the Lord would have us know that we
          have eternal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learn, then, the doctrine of the eternality of life given in the new
          birth. It must be eternal life, because it is "the life of God." We
          are born again of the Spirit of God by a living and incorruptible
          seed, which liveth and abideth for ever. We are said to be "made
          partakers of the divine nature." Surely, this means, among other
          things, that we receive an undying life; for immortality is of the
          essence of the Life of God. His name is "I am that I am." He hath life
          in himself, and the Son hath life in himself, and of this life we are
          the receivers. This was his purpose concerning his Son, that he might
          give eternal life to as many as the Father had given him. If it be the
          life of God which is in a believer -- and certainly it is, for he hath
          begotten us again -- then that life must be eternal. As children of
          God, we partake of his life, and as heirs of God, we inherit his
          eternity. "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only
          true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, our Lord Jesus Christ calls the life of his people eternal
          life. How often do I quote this text! It seems to lie on the tip of my
          tongue: "I give unto my sheep eternal life; and they shall never
          perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand." And again,
          "He that believeth in him hath everlasting life." It is not temporary
          life, not life which at a certain period must grow old and die, but
          everlasting life. "It shall be in him a well of water springing up
          into everlasting life." This is the life of Christ within the soul.
          "For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God." "I live;
          yet not I, but Christ liveth in me." "When Christ, who is our life,
          shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory." If our
          life is Christ's life, we shall not die until Christ dies. If our life
          is hidden in him, it will never be discovered and destroyed until
          Christ himself is destroyed. Let us rest in this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark again how our Lord has put it: "Because I live, ye shall live
          also." As long, then, as Jesus lives, his people must live, for the
          argument will always be the same, "Because I live, ye shall live
          also." We are so one with Christ that while the head lives the members
          cannot die. We are so one Christ that the challenge is given, "Who
          shall separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
          Lord?" A list is added of things which may be supposed to separate,
          but we are told that they cannot do so, for "in all these things we
          are more than conquerors through him that loved us." Is it not clear,
          then, that we are quickened with a life so heavenly and divine that we
          can never die? John tells us in this very chapter, "We know that
          whosoever is born of God sinneth not." He does not go back to his old
          sin, he does not again come under the dominion of sin; but, "he that
          is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him
          not."
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, I entreat you to keep a hard and firm grip of this blessed
          doctrine of the perseverance of the saints. How earnestly do I long
          "that ye may know that ye have eternal life"! Away with your doctrine
          of being alive in Christ to-day and dead tomorrow. Poor, miserable
          doctrine that! Hold fast to eternal salvation through the eternal
          covenant carried out by eternal love unto eternal life; for the Spirit
          of God has written these things unto you that believe on the name of
          the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, according to the Authorized text, though not according to
          the Revised Version, John desired the increase and confirmation of
          their faith. He says, "That ye might believe on the name of the Son of
          God." John wrote to those who believed, that they might believe in a
          more emphatic sense. As our Saviour has come not only that we may have
          life, but that we may have it more abundantly, so does John write,
          that having faith we may have more of it. Come beloved, listen for a
          moment to this! You have the milk of faith, but God wills that you
          should have this cream of assurance! He would increase your faith. May
          you believe more extensively. Perhaps you do not believe all the
          truth, because you have not yet perceived it. There were members of
          the Corinthian church who had not believed in the resurrection of the
          dead, and there were Galatians who were very cloudy upon justification
          by faith. Many a Christian man is narrow in the range of his faith
          from ignorance of the Lord's mind. Like certain tribes of Israel, they
          have conquered a scanty territory as yet, though all the land is
          theirs from Dan to Beersheba. John would have us push out our fences,
          and increase the enclosure of our faith. Let us believe all that God
          has revealed, for every truth is precious and practically useful.
          Perhaps your doctrinal belief has been poor and thin. Oh that the Lord
          would turn the water into wine! Many of you live upon milk, and yet
          your years qualify you to feed on meat. Why keep the babes' diet? You
          that believe are exhorted to "go in and out, and find pasture"; range
          throughout the whole revelation of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will be well for you if your faith also increases intensively. Oh
          that you may more fully believe what you do believe! We need deeper
          insight and firmer conviction. We do not half believe, as yet, any of
          us. Many of you only skim the pools of truth. Blessed is the wing
          which brushes the surface of the river of life; but infinitely more
          blessed is it to plunge into the depths of it. This is John's desire
          for you, that you would believe with all you heart, and soul, and
          strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would have you believe more constantly, so that you may say, "My
          heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give
          praise." It is not always so with us. We are at times chicken-hearted.
          We play the man today, and the mouse tomorrow. Lord have mercy upon
          us: we are an inconsistent people, fickle as the wind. The Lord would
          have us abide always in him with strong and mighty confidence, being
          rooted and built up in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would have us trust courageously. Some can believe in a small way
          about small things. Oh for a boundless trust in the infinite God! We
          need more of a venturesome faith: the faith to do and dare. Often we
          see the way of power, but have not the faith which would be equal to
          it. See Peter walking on the sea! I do not advise any of you to try
          it, neither did our Lord advise Peter to do so: we do well enough if
          we walk uprightly on land. But when Peter had once taken a few steps
          on the sea, he ought to have known that his Lord could help him all
          the rest of the way; but alas! His faith failed, and he began to sink.
          He could have walked all the way to Jesus if he had believed right on.
          So is it with us: our faith is good enough for a spurt, but it lacks
          staying power. Oh, may God give us to believe, so that we may not only
          trip over a wave or two, but walk on the water to the end! If the Lord
          bids you, you may go through fire and not be burned, through the
          floods and not be drowned. Such a fearless, careless, conquering faith
          may the Lord work in us!
        </p>
        <p>
          We need also to have our faith increased in the sense of its becoming
          more practical. Some people have a fine new faith, as pretty as the
          bright poker in the parlour, and as useless. We want an everyday
          faith, not to look at, but to use. Brothers and sisters, we need faith
          for the kitchen and the pantry, as well as for the drawing-room and
          the conservatory. We need workshop faith, as well as prayer-meeting
          faith. We need faith as to the common things of life, and the trying
          things of death. We could do with less paint if we had more power. We
          need less varnish and more verity. God give to you that you may
          believe on the name of the Son of God with a sound, common-sense
          faith, which will be found wearable, and washable, and workable
          throughout life.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need to believe more joyfully. Oh what a blessed thing it is when
          you reach the rest and joy of faith! If we would truly believe the
          promise of God, and rest in the Lord's certain fulfillment of it, we
          might be as happy as the angels. I notice how very early in the
          morning how the birds begin to sing: before the sun is up or even the
          first grey tints of morning light are visible, the little songsters
          are awake and singing. Too often we refuse to sing until the sun is
          more than up, and noon is near. Shame on us! Will we never trust our
          God? Will we never praise him for favours to come? Oh for a faith that
          can sing through the night and through the winter! Faith that can live
          on a promise is the faith of God's elect. You will never enjoy heaven
          below until you believe without wavering. The Lord give you such
          faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Thus I have gone through my first head, and taken nearly all the
          time. I must now come to push of pike, as the old soldiers used to
          say. We must drive our teaching home. THE PURPOSE WHICH JOHN HAD IN
          HIS MIND WE OUGHT TO FOLLOW UP. If he wished us to know that we have
          eternal life, brothers and sisters, let us try to know it. The Word of
          God was written for this purpose; let us use it for its proper end.
          The whole of these Scriptures were written that "we might believe that
          Jesus is the Christ, and that believing we might have life through his
          name." This Book is written to you who believe, that you may know that
          you believe. Will you suffer your Bibles to be a failure to you? Will
          you live in perpetual questioning and doubt? If so, the Book has
          missed its mark for you. The Bible is sent that you may have full
          assurance of of your possession of eternal life; do not, therefore,
          dream that it will be presumptuous on your part to aspire to it. Our
          conscience tells us that we ought to seek full assurance of salvation.
          It cannot be right for us to be children of God, and not to know our
          own Father. How can we kneel down and say, "Our Father which art in
          heaven," when we do not know whether he is our Father or not? Will not
          a life of doubt tend to be a life of falsehood? May we not be using
          language which is not true to our consciousness? Can you sing joyful
          hymns which you fear are not true to you? Will you join in worship
          when your heart does not know that God is your God? Until the spirit
          of adoption enables you to cry, "Abba, Father," where is your love to
          God? Can you rest? Dare you rest, while it is a question whether you
          are saved or not? Can you go home to your dinner to-day and enjoy your
          meal, while there is a question about your soul's eternal life? Oh, be
          not so foolhardy as to run risks on that matter! I pray you, make sure
          work for eternity. If you leave anything in uncertainty, let it
          concern your body or your estate, but not your soul. Conscience bids
          you seek to know that you have eternal life, for without this
          knowledge many duties will be impossible of performance. Many
          Scriptures which I cannot quote this morning stir you up to this duty.
          Are you not bidden to make your calling and election sure? Are you not
          a thousand times over exhorted to rejoice in the Lord, and to give
          thanks continually? But how can you rejoice, if the dark suspicion
          haunts you, that perhaps, after all, you have not the life of God? You
          must get this question settled, or you cannot rest in the Lord, and
          wait patiently for him. Come, brothers and sisters, I beseech you, as
          you would follow Scripture, and obey the Lord's precepts, get the
          assurance without which you cannot obey them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Listen, as I close, to this mass of reasons why each believer should
          seek to know that he has eternal life. Here they are. Assurance of
          your salvation will bring you "the peace of God, which passeth all
          understanding." If you know that you are saved, you can sit down in
          poverty, or in sickness, or under slander, and feel perfectly content.
          Full assurance is the Koh-i-noor amongst the jewels wherewith the
          heavenly Bridegroom adorns his spouse. Assurance is a mountain of
          spices, a land that floweth with milk and honey. To be the assured
          possessor of eternal life is to find a paradise beneath the stars,
          where the mountains and the hills break forth before you into singing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Full assurance will sometimes overflow in cataracts of delight. Peace
          flows like a river, and here and there it leaps in cascades of
          ecstatic joy. There are seasons when the plant of peace is in flower,
          and then it sheds a perfume as of myrrh and cassia. Oh, the
          blessedness of the man who knows that he has eternal life! Sometimes
          in our room alone, when we have been enjoying this assurance, we have
          laughed outright, for we could not help it. If anybody had wondered
          why a man was laughing by himself alone, we could have explained that
          it was nothing ridiculous which had touched us, but our mouth was
          filled with laughter because the Lord had done great things for us,
          whereof we were glad. That religion which sets no sweatmeats on the
          table is a niggardly housekeeper. I do not wonder that some people
          give up their starveling religion: it is hardly worth the keeping. The
          child of God who knows that he has eternal life goes to school, be he
          has many a holiday; and he anticipates that day of home-going when he
          shall see the face of his Beloved for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, full assurance will give us the full result of the gospel.
          The gospel ought to make us holy; and so it will when we are in full
          possession of it. The gospel ought to make us separate from the world,
          the gospel ought to make us lead a heavenly life here below; and so it
          will if we drink deep draughts of it; but it we take only a sip of it
          now and again, we give it no chance of working out its design in us.
          Do not paddle about the margin of the water of life, but first wade in
          up to your knees, and then hasten to plunge into the waters to swim
          in. Beware of contentment with shallow grace. Prove what the grace of
          God can do for you by giving yourself up to its power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Full assurance gives a man a grateful zeal for the God he loves. These
          are the people that will go to the Congo for Jesus, for they know they
          are his. These are the people that will lay down their all for Christ,
          for Christ is theirs. These are the people that will bear scorn and
          shame and misrepresentation for the truth's sake, for they know that
          they have eternal life. These are they that will keep on preaching and
          teaching, spending and working, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven,
          and they know it. Men will do little for what they doubt, and much for
          what they believe. If you have lost your title deeds, and you do not
          know whether your house is your own or not, you are not going to spend
          much in repairs and enlargements. When you know that heaven is yours,
          you are anxious to get ready for it. Full assurance finds fuel for
          zeal to feed upon.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also creates and sustains patience. When we know that we have
          eternal life, we do not fret about the trials of this passing life. I
          could point to the brethren here this morning, and I could mention
          sisters at home, who amaze me by their endurance of pain and weakness.
          This I know concerning them, that they never have a doubt about their
          interest in Christ; and for this cause they are able to surrender
          themselves into those dear hands which were pierced for them. They
          know that they are the Lord's, and so they say, "Let him do what
          seemeth him good." A blind child was in his father's arms, and a
          stranger came into the room, and took him right away from his father.
          Yet he did not cry or complain. His father said to him, "Johnny, are
          you afraid? You do not know the person who has got hold of you." "No,
          father," he said, "I do not know who he is, but you do." When pain
          gives us an awkward nip, and we do not know whether we shall live or
          die, when we are called to undergo a dangerous operation, and pass
          into unconciousness, then we can say, "I do not know where I am, but
          my Father knows, and I leave all with him." Assurance makes us strong
          to suffer.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, dear friends, will give you constant firmness in your confession
          of divine truth. You who do not know whether you are saved or not, I
          hope the Lord will keep you from denying the faith; but those who have
          a firm grip of it, these are the men who will never forsake it. A
          caviller in an omnibus said to a Christian man one day, "Why, you have
          nothing after all to rest upon. I can prove to you that your
          Scriptures are not authentic." The humble Christian man replied, "Sir,
          I am not a learned man, and I cannot answer you questions; but I
          believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and I have experienced such a change
          in character, and I feel such a joy and peace through believing, that
          I wish you knew my Saviour, too." The answer he received was a very
          unexpected one: the unbeliever said, "You have got me there; I cannot
          answer that." Just so: we have got them there. If we know what has
          been wrought in us by grace, they cannot overcome us. The
          full-assurance man baffles the very devil. Satan is cunning enough,
          but those who know and are persuaded, are birds which he cannot take
          in the snares of hell. When you know that your Lord is able to keep
          that which you have committed to him until that day, then you are firm
          as a rock. God make you so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear brethren, this is the kind of thing that will enable you to bear
          a telling testimony for your Lord. It is of no use to stand up and
          preach things that may or may not be true. I am charged with being a
          dreadful dogmatist, and I am not anxious to excuse myself. When a man
          is not quite sure of a thing, he grows very liberal: anybody can be a
          liberal with money which he cannot claim to be his own. The
          broad-school man says, "I am not sure, and I do not suppose that you
          are sure, for indeed nothing is sure." Does this sandy foundation suit
          you? I prefer rock. The things which I have spoken to you from my
          youth up have been such as I have tried and proved, and to me they
          wear an absolute certainty, confirmed by my personal experience. I
          have tried these things: they have saved me, and I cannot doubt them.
          I am a lost man if the gospel I have preached to you be not true; and
          I am content to bide the issue of the day of Judgement. I do not
          preach doubtingly, for I do not live doubtingly. I know what I have
          told you to be true; why should I speak as if I were not sure? If you
          want to make your own testimony tell in such a day as this, you must
          have something to say that you are sure about; and until you are sure
          about it I would advise you to hold you tongue. We do not require any
          more questionings; the market is overstocked. We need no more doubt,
          honest or dishonest; the air is dark with these horrible blacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, if you know that you have eternal life, you are prepared to
          live, and equally prepared to die. How frequently do I stand at the
          bedside of our dying members! I am every now and then saying to
          myself, "I shall certainly meet with some faint-hearted one. Surely I
          shall come across some child of God who is dying in the dark." But I
          have not met with any such. Brethren, a child of God may die in the
          dark. One said to old Mr. Dodd, the quaint old Puritan -- "How sad
          that our brother should have passed away in the darkness! Do you doubt
          his safety?" "No," said old Mr. Dodd, "no more than I doubt the safety
          of him who said, when he was dying, "My God, my God, why hast thou
          forsaken me?"" Full assurance, as we have said before, is not of the
          essence of salvation. Still, I beg of you to note this, that all along
          through these many years, in each case, when I have gone to visit any
          of our brethren and our sisters at death, I have always found them
          departing in sure and certain hope of seeing the face of their Lord in
          glory. I have often marvelled that this should be without exception,
          and I glory in it. Often have they said to me, "We have fed on such
          good food that we may well be strong in the Lord." God grant that you
          may have this assurance, all of you! May sinners begin to believe in
          Jesus, and saints believe more firmly, for Christ's sake! Amen.
