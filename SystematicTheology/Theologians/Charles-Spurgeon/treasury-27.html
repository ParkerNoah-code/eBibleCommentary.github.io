<p align="justify">Preface to Volume 2, Psalms 27-52<br/>
 </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Greatly encouraged by the generous reception given my 
    first volume, I labored diligently and am now able to present the second 
    installment of work. Whether life and health will be given to complete my 
    task, which probably extend to six volumes, remains with our gracious 
    Preserver. With His aid and allowance, my face is set toward that goal. I 
    pray my purpose may be achieved, if for the divine glory and the good of His 
    church.</p>
<p align="justify">In this volume, which, like the first, contains 
    twenty-six sacred odes, we have several of Zion's more memorable and 
    precious songs. In commenting on some of them, I have been overwhelmed with 
    awe and said with Jacob, "How awesome is place! This is none other than the 
    house of God, and this is the gate of Heaven" (Genesis 28:17). Especially 
    was this the case with the fifty-first Psalm; I postponed expounding it week 
    after week, feeling more and more my inability. Often I sat and rose again 
    without having penned a line. It is a bush burning with fire but not 
    consumed. Out of it a voice seemed to cry, "Do not draw near this place. 
    Take your sandals off your feet, the place where you stand is holy ground" 
    (Exodus 3:5). The Psalm is human. Its cries and sobs are of one born of a 
    woman. It is freighted with an inspiration all divine, as if the Great 
    Father were putting words in His child's mouth. Such a Psalm may be wept 
    over, absorbed into the soul, and exhaled again in devotion, but commented 
    on—Ah! Where is one who, having attempted it, can do other than blush.</p>
<p align="justify">I have followed the same format as in the former volume, 
    not only because I am committed to it by the law of uniformity, but also 
    because it is advantageous. Some people suggested alternatives, but many 
    more have commended the very features that I would have been improved 
    anyway. Thus, I have continued with the same method.</p>
<p align="justify">Greater use has been made of the Latin writers. Extracts 
    have been made not only from those condensed in Poole's Synopsis, but also 
    from many others. These works are a mine of exposition and far too little 
    known. If this serves to introduce fresh expositions to my ministerial 
    readers, I will not have labored in vain.</p>
<p align="justify">The acknowledgments made in Volume One can justly be 
    repeated in Volume Two. Please consider them as again recorded. It may be 
    necessary to repeat that each author quoted is personally responsible for 
    his own sentiments. <i>I do not wish it to be supposed that I endorse all 
    that is inserted. </i>It is often useful to know what has been said by 
    authors whose views we could by no means accept.</p>
<p align="justify">Frequently, the conviction is forced on my heart that <i>
    people must personally travel the territory of the Psalms if they would know 
    what a goodly land it is. </i>The Psalms flow with milk and honey, but not 
    to strangers. They are only fertile to lovers of their hills and valleys. 
    None but the Holy Spirit can give you the <i>key </i>to the Treasury of 
    David, and even He gives it more to experience than to study. Happy are they 
    who know the secret of the Psalms.</p>
<p align="justify">If permitted by the Great Master whom I serve, I will now 
    proceed with another portion of this Treasury of David. The labor and 
    research are exceedingly great, and my other occupations are pressing. I ask 
    the patience of the Christian public.</p>
