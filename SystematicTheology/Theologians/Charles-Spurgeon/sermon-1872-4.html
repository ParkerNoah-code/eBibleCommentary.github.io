          |So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.| --
          Romans 10:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          IT IS DIFFICULT to make men understand that the salvation of the
          gospel is not by works but entirely by grace, that it is not presented
          to men as the reward of their own endeavors, but is given to them
          freely upon their accepting it by an act of simple faith or trust in
          Jesus Christ. However plainly we may preach this truth, there will
          always be some who will misunderstand us, and as many more who will
          raise objections against it, as if it were their part to give an
          opinion, and not to do as they are bidden by the Lord. But when men
          are brought under the teaching of the word, to see that the pardon of
          their sins, and the acceptance of their souls does not lie with any
          merit of their own, or any doings of their own, another difficulty
          generally presents itself: they say, |What is this faith of which you
          speak?| and when we assure them that it is a simple trust or
          confidence in the finished work of Christ, then straightway they say,
          |How can we get this faith? How can we obtain this confidence?| To us,
          who have faith, this question is very easy to answer, for when we
          heard the gladsome news of a finished salvation for lost sinners,
          complete forgiveness for the guilty, and acceptance for the ungodly,
          simply upon believing in Jesus we came to Jesus, and we trusted in
          him, and we continue still to trust, and we have joy and peace through
          believing. We see far more reasons for belief than for doubt. Yet,
          nevertheless, there are hundreds and thousands who are awakened, and
          seriously enquiring, to whom this is a great difficulty -- |How can I
          get the faith which gives me possession of Christ Jesus, and brings me
          salvation?| Our text is the ready answer, practically a complete
          answer; not doctrinally or theologically complete, but practically
          perfect. |Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.|
          |But faith is the work of the Holy Spirit in the soul is it not?|
          Certainly. |And it is given by the Spirit to God's own chosen?|
          Assuredly; yet, nevertheless, it was not necessary for the apostle to
          mention those facts here. Some persons are always for having a whole
          system of theology in every sermon, but it is not needful that they
          should be gratified. Paul is clear enough about the work of the Spirit
          in other places, and it is not needful that he should introduce that
          subject into every line he writes. It was practically unnecessary for
          him to mention that subject in the present instance, and, therefore,
          he did not do so. It would sometimes puzzle rather than instruct an
          enquirer if we were to go into the full details of a matter. For
          instance, if I am thirsty, how shall I quench my thirst? By a draught
          of water. But in what way can I obtain water? It quite suffices for
          practical purposes for you to tell me to go to the tap or the
          fountain. There is no need to explain to me before I drink that the
          water is supplied by a company, and forced to the spilt by sundry
          machines, having been first extracted from the great fountains beneath
          by artesian wells, or drawn from the river at Thames Ditton. Nor would
          it be needful in answer to my question to trace the river to the
          clouds, and to treat upon the formation of vapor by the skill and
          wisdom of God. Practically, to the thirsty man all you want to say is,
          |There's the water, drink.| I will add another illustration. A man is
          hungry, and he asks you, |How can I get bread?| |Go to the baker's,|
          you say. The answer is complete enough for him; it meets the case at
          once. If he wants a larger declaration of how bread is obtained, we
          can give it to him at another time when he is no longer hungry; we
          will tell him how the corn is sown in the furrow of earth, and how by
          mysterious processes of nature it germinates, grows, and ripens; we
          will trace it from the reaper to the thresher, and from the thresher
          to the mill, and we will also show that daily bread is as much a gift
          from heaven as the manna which dropped down upon the hungry people in
          the wilderness. But, it is not needful for the feeding, of the hungry
          that we should on every occasion go into all those details, although
          we hold very sound views upon them. And when you are dealing with an
          anxious person, it will suffice to say to him, |Faith cometh by
          hearing;| further information can be supplied under happier
          circumstances. I mean to keep to our text this morning, and if any
          shall charge me with an omission of the work of the Spirit, or a
          failure to trace all saving faith to the electing grace of God, I
          shall bear the charge without murmuring, only saying that my soul
          rejoices as much as that of any man living in the work of the Spirit
          of God; and, that the electing love of God and his determinate
          purposes are precious truths to me. If the text was sufficient for
          Paul; it will, I trust, be sufficient for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          May the Spirit of God assist us while we meditate upon the way by
          which faith cometh. This shall be followed by a brief indication of
          certain obstructions which often lie in that way; and then we will
          conclude by dwelling upon the importance that faith should come to us
          by that appointed road.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, THE WAY BY WHICH FAITH COMES TO MEN. |Faith cometh by
          hearing.|
        </p>
        <p>
          It may help to set the truth out more clearly, if we say, negatively,
          that it does not come by any other process than by hearing; -- not by
          any mysterious and strange method, but in the most simple and natural
          mode conceivable, namely, by the hearing of the word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some imagine that faith comes by hereditary descent, and they act upon
          the supposition. Hence, in certain churches, birthright membership is
          thought to be a proper practice, and the child of a Christian is
          thought to be a Christian. In some other churches, though the theory
          would not be stated in so many words, yet it is practically accepted,
          and children of pious parents are regarded as scarcely needing
          conversion. The text is forgotten which saith that the heirs of
          salvation are born, |not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, but
          of God.| The typical covenant secured outward privileges to the
          children born after the flesh, but under the covenant of grace the
          blessing is secured to the spiritual and not to the natural seed. |He
          who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the
          freewoman was by promise.| (Galatians 4:23). That which is born of the
          flesh is flesh, and nothing more: the new-born nature is not
          transmissible from father to son like a natural temperament or a cast
          of countenance. I know the answer will be that |the promise is to us
          and to our children,| but it will be well for the objector to reply to
          himself by completing the quotation -- |even to as many as the Lord
          your God shall call.| The fact is, that nothing spiritual is inherited
          by carnal generation. Our children, even if we are far advanced in
          grace, will still be |shapen in iniquity.| No matter how high the
          sainthood of the professing Christian, his child (when capable of
          understanding) must for himself become a personal believer in Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          It appears to be thought possible to infuse grace by sacraments. There
          are persons yet alive who teach that a babe may be regenerated by
          certain aqueous processes, and be thereby placed in |a state of
          salvation.| But is not faith a perpetual concomitant of regeneration?
          and what is that regeneration worth which leaves a person an
          unbeliever, and, consequently, |condemned already, because he hath not
          believed on the Son of God?| Rest assured, that as faith does not come
          by descent, neither can it be produced by any rite which recognizes
          that descent: it comes in one way, and in one way only in every case,
          and that is, by the hearing of the word. To every person, whoever he
          may be, though nursed in the bosom of the church, and introduced to
          that church by the most solemn ritual, we are bound to say, you must
          hear as well as others, and you must believe as the result of that
          hearing as well as others, or else you will remain short of saving
          grace. Faith is not a mystery juggled into us by the postures,
          genuflexions, and mumblings of priests. We have heard a great deal
          about sacramental efficacy, but I think a man must have extraordinary
          hardihood who would say that either baptism, or the so-called
          Eucharist, are the sure creators of faith; yet see I not what saving
          service these forms can render to unbelieving men if they leave them
          in an unbelieving condition, and, consequently, in a state of
          condemnation. Seeing that without faith it is impossible to please
          God, the grace supposed to be conveyed by the mere participation in
          sacraments is of small value, it cannot give the cardinal requisite
          for acceptance before God. Faith cannot be washed into us by
          immersion, nor sprinkled upon us in christening; it is not to be
          poured into us from a chalice, nor generated in us by a consecrated
          piece of bread. There is no magic about it; it comes by hearing the
          word of God, and by that way only.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are superstitions, you tell me, and scarcely need to be
          mentioned here; very well then, we will have done with them, and treat
          of superstitions which linger in our own congregations. There are some
          who fancy that faith cometh by feeling. If they could feel emotions
          either of horror or of exquisite delight, they would then, they think,
          be the possessors of faith; but till they have felt what they have
          heard described in certain biographies of undoubtedly good men, they
          cannot believe, or even if they have a measure of faith, they cannot
          hope that it is true faith. Faith doth not come by feeling, but
          through faith arises much of holy feeling, and the more a man lives in
          the walk of faith, as a rule, the more will he feel and enjoy the
          light of God's countenance. Faith hath something firmer to stand upon
          than those ever-changing frames and feelings which, like the weather
          of our own sunless land, is fickle and frail, and changeth speedily
          from brightness into gloom. You may get feeling from faith, and the
          best of it, but you will be long before you will find any faith that
          is worth the having, if you try to evoke it from frames and feelings.
        </p>
        <p>|My hope is built on nothing less</p>
        <p>Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;</p>
        <p>I dare not trust the sweetest frame;</p>
        <p>But wholly lean on Jesus' name;</p>
        <p>On Christ the solid rock I stand,</p>
        <p>All other ground is sinking sand.|</p>
        <p>
          Some, also, have supposed that true faith will come to men by dreams
          and visions. It is surprising how a belief in these things lingers
          still in what is called this age of light; the notion is still current
          that if you dream of seeing Jesus, or fancy you have seen him while
          awake, or if a passage of Scripture strikes you, or if you hear or
          imagine that you hear a voice speaking to you, you are then a
          believer. Now, faith in Christ is like faith in anyone else, it comes
          to us by the same kind of mental processes, and is based upon simple
          principles and plain matters of fact, and needs no vision of the
          night. Though you should see all the angels in heaven, it would not
          prove that you would go to heaven, any more than my having seen the
          Pope's body guard would be a proof that I shall be made a Cardinal.
          Things which are seen of the eye save not, for the things which are
          seen are temporal, and cannot work eternal salvation. Moreover, men
          saw Christ, and yet pierced him and blasphemed him. Visions have been
          seen by heathens like Nebuchadnezzar, and angels have appeared to bad
          men like Balaam who, though he sighed out, |Let me die the death of
          the righteous,| yet perished, fighting against the God of Israel. True
          faith has a more solid basis for its fabric than the fleeting fancies
          of the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          I beg you to notice, too, that it does not say in the text that faith
          comes through the eloquence, earnestness, or any other good quality of
          the preacher. Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word, not of
          man, but of God. The word of God is the substance of faith-creating
          preaching; it is by the hearing of God's word, and not by any other
          hearing that saving faith comes to the soul. I may hear a man descant
          upon the gospel with all the eloquence that can be commanded by the
          most fluent tongue, yet if my faith comes to me because the man spoke
          pathetically, or poetically, or argumentatively, or rhetorically, it
          is a poor miserable faith; being, of the power of the flesh, it will
          die, and so prove itself unlike the faith which springs from the
          incorruptible word of God, for that liveth and abideth for ever. On
          the other hand, I may hope for faith if I am listening to the true
          gospel, the very word of God, though the man who speaks it may be of
          stammering lips, and his voice may be disagreeable to my ear, and
          there may be much about his manner that does not commend itself to me.
          If he preaches truth it is by hearing not him, the man, but by hearing
          the word of God, that I shall come to faith. I do desire ever, as a
          preacher, to feel that it is not my word but God's word that saves
          souls; we are to explain it and expound it, but we are not to add to
          it, take from or conceive that we can improve it. We must not go into
          the pulpit and say, |I have been working out a subject from my own
          mind, and I am going to give you the result of my thoughts.| We had
          better keep our own thoughts for some other place, and give the people
          the revealed truth of God. The theory now-a-days is that all preachers
          worth hearing by this refined generation must be profound thinkers,
          and inventors of improved theologies. Brethren, let man's thoughts
          perish for ever; the thoughts of God and not the thoughts of man will
          save souls. The truth of God should be spoken simply, with as little
          as possible of the embellishments of metaphysics, and philosophy, and
          high culture, and all that stuff. I say the word of God delivered as
          we find it is that which, when heard, brings faith to the souls of
          men. I counsel you, my occasional hearers, you who perhaps have come
          freshly to this city, or who reside where you have a choice of
          ministry, seek not that which tickles your ear, but that which your
          conscience approves as consistent with the word of God; and, though we
          or an angel from heaven should preach to you that which is not God's
          word, do not listen to us, for it will be mischievous to you. Hear you
          what God the Lord speaketh, and hear nothing else. What though he
          shall sound forth his word through a ram'shorn, if it be God's Spirit
          that giveth forth a certain sound, it shall be more profitable to your
          soul than though the silver trumpet should be set to the mouth of
          falsehood, and the sweetest music should regale your ear. The matter
          of a discourse is far more important than the manner. Saving faith
          never comes from hearing falsehood, but from the word of God alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I ought, perhaps, to add that the expression |by hearing,| though of
          course literally it must be confined to the hearing of words vocally
          uttered, is meant to include in its spirit the reading of the word;
          for reading is a sort of hearing with the eyes, and faith has often
          come and will often come to men while they are reading the word of God
          for themselves. We must not kill the spirit of the text by excessive
          regard to the mere letter of it, and we should do so if we excluded
          readings, which is a quiet hearing of the still small voice of the
          printed page. Faith comes by the word of God reaching our minds, and
          our knowing and understanding it. The entrance of God's word giveth
          light. |Incline your ear and come unto me, hear and your soul shall
          live.| Thus, we have spoken of it negatively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, positively: |Faith cometh by hearing.| Sometimes faith has come
          into men's minds by hearing the simple statement of the gospel. They
          have longed to be saved, and they have been told that Jesus the Son of
          God condescended to come into this world and to take upon himself the
          form of man, and as man to be partaker of our infirmities, and to
          offer himself as a sacrifice in the room, place, and stead of sinners;
          they have, moreover, been told that whosoever trusts in this
          substitutional sacrifice shall be saved, and straightway they have
          believed. All they have wanted has been merely to be informed of the
          way of salvation. God's Spirit has so prepared them that they have
          believed almost as soon as they have heard the saving truth. In many
          cases the only difficulty in the way of salvation has been a want of
          understanding the word. I know in my own case I would have given all I
          had, if I might but have been informed what I must do to be saved.
          Though I frequented places where the gospel was preached, I did not
          catch the meaning of believing, it puzzled me much. I do not remember
          to have heard the simple declaration that to trust in Jesus Christ
          would save my soul; or, possibly, I did hear it with my outward ears,
          but I must have been strangely infatuated, for I did not understand
          the sense; and I have often thought if I could have heard the way of
          faith simply stated, my soul would have leaped into liberty long
          before. I will not so say; but I am persuaded that faith often comes
          by hearing the simple declaration that God accepts sinners, not for
          what they are in themselves but for what Christ is, and that when
          sinners believe in Jesus they are saved there and then, and are
          acceptable with God through Jesus Christ his dear Son. The mere
          statement of this has brought, by the operation of the Spirit of God,
          faith into the soul. |How is this?| saith one. Well, it is because the
          gospel commends itself to some hearts as true upon the very first
          blush of it, it strikes them as being undoubtedly the gospel of God.
          It is the same in other matters; you sometimes hear a story about
          which you say, |Well, I do not know, it may be correct, but I shall
          have to look a little into that before I am certain;| but you often
          hear statements which you accept at once, because they commend
          themselves to your understanding, and you feel that they must be true.
          There are minds which God has so prepared that the moment they hear
          the gospel they respond to it. I think I hear the seeker after truth
          exclaim when he heard the gospel, |True? Why, how could it be
          otherwise? It is so divinely grand, so harmonious, so good, so
          gracious, so unexpected -- nobody could have thought of it but God
          himself -- it must be the truth.| Having long sought goodly pearls of
          truth, the illuminated eye catches the gleam of the gospel and
          discerns it to be a priceless gem. Those are blessed indeed who are
          thus at once brought unto faith by the statement of the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          To some others, the convincing point has been the suitability of the
          gospel to their case, for while they have heard it preached as a
          gospel for sinners, they have felt that they were certainly among that
          class. When the preacher has gone on to describe the misery of the
          fall, the utter ruin of human nature, its deceitfulness, feebleness,
          fickleness, and folly, the hearer has said, |Is the gospel sent to
          those who are thus lost, guilty, and impotent? Why, I am precisely in
          that condition?| And, then, when its great command is stated, namely,
          simple trust in Jesus, the soul perceives the suitability of the way
          of grace. We do not go to heaven to bring Christ down, or dive into
          the deeps to bring him up from the dead; we can neither keep the law
          nor find an atonement for our transgressions; but this simple trust,
          oh how suitable it is to undone sinners. Nothing to do -- I can do
          nothing; noticing to bring -- I have nothing to bring; it suits my
          case. Glory be to God for devising a plan so adapted to our wants.
          From the suitabilty of the gospel to the sinner, many have been by
          God's Spirit led to saving faith in Jesus, and so faith has come by
          hearing.
        </p>
        <p>
          In many, I do not doubt, faith has come through hearing of the
          condescending pity and the melting love of Jesus. Oh, that we dwelt
          more on this; that he loved his enemies, that he died for the ungodly,
          that his heart yearns over the lost sheep, that he is willing to
          receive prodigal sons, for he is full of grace and truth.
        </p>
        <p>|His heart is made of tenderness,</p>
        <p>His bowels melt with love.|</p>
        <p>
          When such texts as the following have been preached on: -- |This man
          receiveth sinners.| |Come unto me all ye that labor.| |Ho, every one
          that thirsteth,| etc. |All manner of sin and transgression shall be
          forgiven unto men.| |Whosoever will, let him come and take the water
          of life freely.| |Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out,|
          that melting strain has touched the heart, and led the most hardened
          to believe in a Savior so kind to the undeserving. Men have found it
          impossible not to believe in a friend so self-sacrificing, a Redeemer
          so altogether lovely. The sweet love of Jesus has an omnipotence in it
          to win souls. They yield |by mighty love subdued,| unable to resist
          its charms, and as if they could hold out no longer, they throw
          themselves by an act of faith into the Savior's arms. I can well
          understand their singing, |I do believe, I must believe in such a
          friend as this.| Faith comes by hearing of the free forgiveness
          procured by the agony, the stripes, the wounds, the death of Jesus,
          the lover of our souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          At other times, faith has come not so much through hearing the
          statement of the gospel as from hearing of its authority. I may
          believe a statement because it looks like truth. I may, on the other
          hand, accept it not at all because I have myself perceived the
          apparent truth of it, but because of the person who tells it to me.
          And this is a very right and acceptable kind of faith. What has God
          said about my salvation? Before I hear it I am prepared to believe it
          on the testimony of God. He says it, and that is enough for me. I
          believe this Bible to be his book; I hear what it says, and whatsoever
          the Lord God hath said I must and will receive, whether it appears
          plain or not. There are persons who when they have heard the gospel
          preached have not at first believed it, but if it has pleased the
          Spirit of God to lead the minister to show that the gospel is of
          divine appointment, that the way proclaimed is ordained by God
          himself, and that God has set the sanction of his promise upon it --
          |He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved| -- and has also set
          upon it the second sanction of his threatening -- |He that believeth
          not shall be damned| -- then they have yielded and given over all
          further question. God bids them trust in Jesus, and they do so through
          his grace. Without canvassing the statement itself they receive what
          God teaches, and since he hath set forth Christ to be a propitiation
          for sin they receive him us such: since he has said, |Look unto me and
          be saved,| they look because God bids them look, and they are saved.
          To believe in Jesus is a command from God's own mouth, and is,
          therefore, to be obeyed, and the more so, because |he that believeth
          not God hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the record that
          God gave of his Son; and this is the record, that God hath given to us
          eternal life, and this life is in his Son.|
        </p>
        <p>
          In some cases, too, the coming of faith has been helped by hearing and
          perceiving the veracity of the subordinate testifiers of the gospel,
          -- I mean the writers of the sacred book, the prophets, and chiefly
          the apostles. These men are worthy of credit -- they were honest,
          unsophisticated men, and they certainly gained nothing by testifying
          that Christ was the Messiah, and that he died and rose again from the
          dead. One of them, the Apostle Paul, lost his position, which was one
          of great eminence, and spent his whole life in toil, and suffering,
          and reproach, and ended with a bloody death because of what he
          preached, and thus he proved that he was a sincere, honest, upright
          man. If Paul or any other of the apostles were in the witness-box,
          nobody could demur to their evidence; whatever they said we should
          believe, because the men were truthful witnesses. Now, sometimes,
          persons have been led into faith in Christ, by feeling that those whom
          he sent to be testifiers to his person, death, and resurrection were
          evidently true to the core, and, therefore, their word was worthy of
          all acceptation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe, dear friends, that faith has come by hearing in another
          way. Perhaps the preacher has not so much stated the gospel, and
          brought forward its authority, as explained it. and so faith has come.
          If we spent our time in nothing else but just explaining the text, |He
          that believeth and is baptised shall be saved,| we might achieve a
          blessed life-work, and perhaps might see greater results than when our
          ministry takes a wider range. When the preacher takes up one by one
          the soul difficulties which prevent man from seeing what faith is, and
          keep him away from looking to Christ, and when he tries to show, as he
          should, that all the hope of the sinner lies out of himself, none of
          it in himself, that all his help for salvation is laid upon one that
          is mighty, even Jesus Christ the Son of God, and that he must look
          away from his own feelings, and prayings, and doings, and even away
          from his own believings as any ground of confidence, and must rest
          simply and alone upon the one sacrifice of Jesus; it has often
          happened that faith has come through the hearing of such an
          explanatory word.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some cases, too, faith has come when the word has possessed a
          peculiar soul-revealing pointedness in it to the hearer's particular
          case. Remember the Samaritan Woman. Our Lord Jesus Christ explained to
          her the gospel, but she does not appear to have been enlightened by
          his explanations: it was that home stroke of his -- |Go, call thy
          husband and come hither,| which won her to faith. Such revealings of
          the thoughts and intents of the heart will occur in any God-sent
          preaching of the gospel, just because the Word pierces to the dividing
          of soul and spirit, and lays bare the secrets of the soul. Then it is
          that hearers cry, |Come, see a man that told me all things that ever I
          did; is not this the Christ?| Thus, by the guidance of the Spirit, the
          word finds out the man, and faith cometh by hearing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faith, also, comes in to many by hearing, when we detail the
          experience of those who have tasted and handled the good word of life;
          when the preacher or teacher tells how he trusted in Jesus, and found
          pardon, peace, and life eternal; when he is able to point to others
          who have felt the same, some of whom, perhaps, were even greater
          offenders than the person addressed, then conviction and faith are
          wrought in the mind. We bid you see what Jesus has done for us, in the
          hope that you will trust and try him for yourselves. Jesus prayed for
          those who shall believe on him through our word, and we hope you will
          be among the number.
        </p>
        <p>
          To set the whole matter clearly, we will suppose that you are laboring
          under a very serious disease, and a physician professes to heal you.
          You are quite willing to believe in him, but you cannot blindly follow
          any man, for there are thousands of quacks and impostors. You
          naturally want to know something about him. Now, in what way would you
          go to work to get faith in him? How would faith be likely to come to
          you? It would come by hearing. You hear him speak and you perceive
          that he understands your case, for he describes exactly all your
          symptoms, even those which none know but yourself and a skillful
          physician. You feel already some confidence in him. He next describes
          to you as much of the method of cure as you can comprehend, and it
          seems to you to be very reasonable, and withal suitable to the
          requirements of your case. His proposal commends itself to your best
          judgment, and you are already a stage nearer submission to his mode of
          operation. Then you enquire as to the man's character; you find that
          he is no mere pretender, but an authorized skillful, longestablished
          practitioner, well known for truthfulness, uprightness, and every good
          quality. Moreover, suppose in addition to this he charges you nothing
          whatever, but does everything gratis, having evidently no motive of
          gain, but being altogether disinterested, moved only by real pity for
          you, and a kind desire to remove your pain and save your life. Can you
          any longer refuse to believe and submit? But if, in addition to all
          this, he allows you his case-book, and bids you read case after case
          similar to your own in which he has affected perfect cure, and if some
          of these are your own acquaintances, if they are persons whom you know
          and esteem, why, sir, you will not insult him by saying, |I wish I
          could believe you;| but you will be unable to help trusting him,
          unless you are unwilling to be cured. Faith, in such a case, does not
          depend upon the will at all; you are convinced by hearing, and you
          become a believer. In the same way faith comes by hearing. You are
          unreasonable if you sit still and say, |I cannot make myself believe;|
          of course you cannot, but you hear, do you not, of how Christ heals
          sinners; you hear that he is backed by divine authority; you see that
          he really does save those who trust him, and what more of evidence do
          you want? O soul! it seems to me a harder thing not to believe in
          Jesus than to believe in him, if you are indeed willing to be made
          whole. When one has heard these things, and understands them, surely
          the mind, if it be not wilfully blinded, must receive the Savior. May
          God forgive your long perverseness, and by his Spirit open your eyes
          to see the simplicity of that faith which comes by hearing the word of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. My time, however, flies much too rapidly this morning, and I must
          be brief on the second very important head, namely, OBSTRUCTIONS WHICH
          OFTEN BLOCK UP THIS WAY.
        </p>
        <p>
          One is a want of intention, by which I mean that many persons come to
          hear, but they have no wish to be led into faith. Like the butterflies
          which flit from flower to flower, they extract no honey because they
          come not for such a purpose: while the bees dive into the cups and
          bells of the flowers, and come up loaded with their luscious food. Oh,
          if men came to hear, praying to be endowed with faith in Jesus, faith
          would surely come to them by hearing. Many persons in hearing a
          sermon, are like children looking, at a cornfield -- it is full of
          yellow garlic, or perhaps of scarlet poppies, and they cry |What a
          lovely field;| but the farmer thinks not so, he is looking for the
          wheat. Many a hearer watches for pretty speeches and flowery
          metaphors, and cries, |How well he puts it! What a well-turned
          sentence! How sweetly he quotes poetry!| and so on. Bah! Is that what
          you come to God's house for? O fools and slow of heart, is this your
          end in hearing the life-giving gospel of the bleeding Lamb? I assure
          you it is not this that we are aiming at in preaching to you. If you
          came to look after the good corn, you would care little for the gaudy
          poppies of a flaunting eloquence so much regarded by the men of these
          days. Come with the intent to find faith in Jesus; cry to God to make
          his word effectual to our salvation, and then hearing will be quite
          another business with you. Alas I fear you will perish, let us preach
          as we may, while we are regarded by you as mere orators to be
          criticized, and not as witnesses whose testimony is to be weighed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some do not hear aright for want of attention. Sleepy hearers are not
          likely to be led to faith. Eutychus may fall from the third loft and
          be taken up for dead, but he is not likely to become a believer by
          sleeping, even though Paul should be the preacher. We want attention
          in order to the real reception of the word. Oh how pleasant it is to
          preach to earnest hearers who lean forward to catch every syllable,
          anxious to know how they can be saved. Wandering hearts lose the
          benefit of the truth, and vain minds trifle away the privilege of a
          gospel ministry. Take heed how ye hear, otherwise ye may remain
          hearers only, and so perish in unbelief.
        </p>
        <p>
          With many a want of candor is another reason why faith does not come
          by hearing. If a man hears with a prejudiced heart, making up his mind
          before hand what he will believe, he is not likely to be convinced, he
          puts himself as far as he can out of the reach of benefit. When the
          heart rebels against the word: when it says, |If this be true I am
          living a bad life, and I shall have to give up my pleasures, therefore
          will not accept it.| Well then, faith does not come and cannot come by
          such hearing. Faith comes by hearing when a man does, as it were, give
          himself up to the word of God, like a person who is badly wounded and
          surrenders himself to the surgeon's hand. Oh, if I had a gangrened
          limb and it must be taken off, I think I would pray for patience
          enough to say, |O sir, if you can but spare my life cut to the very
          bone.| When it is the soul that is concerned I would say to the
          preacher, |Sir, do not flatter me, do not tell me that which will
          please but delude me; I do not want your flattery, I do not want your
          fine words. |Sir, tell me what I am, and where I am in the sight of
          God, and how I can be saved; for it will little satisfy me to wake up
          in hell and remember that I used to hear a fine orator. I want to be
          saved in deed and of a truth.| |Ah,| says one, |but some preachers are
          not only bold, but rough in their expression.| Yes, but suppose you
          were nearly drowned, and a strong swimmer plunged into the stream and
          plucked you out just as you were sinking for the last time, if he
          dislocated your arm would you grumble? No, you would say, |The bone
          can be set at another time, but my life could not have been restored.|
          And so with the preacher, though he be rough, if it be the truth which
          he speaks, only pray that it may save your soul, and be content to put
          up with the man's infirmity, if by any means you may attain to
          salvation by Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          With some, how ever, hearing does not bring faith, because they hear
          without any after meditation. There is a great trial going on, as you
          know, in the Tichborne case. Every juryman, I doubt not, wants to
          judge righteously. I am sure the sleepy one is not likely to do so,
          and I am pretty clear that the juryman who is most likely to get at
          the truth will be the man who, when he gets away from the court,
          having heard attentively all the time, takes home the notes of the
          evidence, weighs it, and makes comparisons, and endeavors to sift out
          the truth. So I would say to you when you hear us preach, sift the
          sermon afterwards, turn our sermons over, pick holes in them if you
          like, and find out our mistakes; but oh, do search into the truth, and
          be not content till you find it. If you want to find Christ, the
          wisdom of God, you should seek for him as for silver. You are likely
          to believe the truth when your mind turns it over and over. Here is a
          bag, and I am willing to make a man rich, and, therefore, I drop into
          it pound after pound, but I find that the bag is just as empty as
          before; the reason is plain, -- there are holes in the bag, and the
          money drops through. Too many hearers are as a bag full of holes, and
          golden sermons will not bless them because they wilfully forget all.
          They will never come to faith because they do but look at their face
          in the glass of the word, and go their way and forget what manner of
          men they are. Oh for hearers who only need to know the gospel, and the
          evidence of it, and then consent thereto, saying, |It is the truth of
          God, I cannot quarrel with it; I joyfully receive it.| Such are saved
          souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But, now, I am sorry to be so brief, but I must conclude by
          speaking, of THE IMPORTANCE THAT FAITH SHOULD COME TO US BY HEARING. I
          will let my words drop rapidly without any ornament, and remind you,
          dear friend, that if you have been a hearer and faith has not come to
          you, you are, this moment, in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds
          of iniquity. You believe not in Christ, and you make God a liar,
          because ye have not believed in his only-begotten Son. The wrath of
          God abideth on you. You are dead while you live. Without God, without
          Christ, and strangers to the covenant of promise. My soul pities you
          -- will you not pity yourselves? Hearers only; faithless, graceless,
          Christless! Christ died, but you have no part in his death. His blood
          cleanses from sin, but your sin remains upon you. Christ has risen,
          and he pleads before the throne, -- you have no part in that
          intercession. He is preparing a place for his people, but that place
          is not for you. Oh, unhappy soul! oh, wretched soul! out of favor with
          God, at enmity with eternal love, destitute of eternal life! Truly, if
          Jesus were here he would weep over you, as he did over Jerusalem, and
          say, |How often would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her
          chickens under her wings, and ye would not.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah, remember, though your present state is terrible it is not all. You
          will soon die, and you will die without faith. Remember that word of
          Christ, it is one of the most terrible I know of, |if ye believe not
          that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.| To die in a ditch, to die in
          a prison, to die on the gallows, none of us would desire it; but to
          die in your sins! O God, it is hell, it is eternal damnation. May the
          great Lord save you! But to perish for ever will be your lot as surely
          as you live, except you believe in Jesus and that speedily, for soon
          you will be out of the reach of all hearing. No more sermons, no more
          invitations of grace. Oh, what would you give to have the gospel once
          more when you are cast away from it! No more the preacher's voice,
          saying, |Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die!| No more the pitiful
          accents of one who loves your souls, and fain would snatch you as
          firebrands from the flame: around you all will be dark, and hard, and
          the only message for you will be this, -- |He that is filthy, let him
          be filthy still.|
        </p>
        <p>|There are no acts of pardon passed,</p>
        <p>In that cold grave to which we haste;</p>
        <p>But darkness, death, and long despair,</p>
        <p>Reign in eternal silence there.|</p>
        <p>
          Ah! then it will he no assuagement of your miseries that you once
          heard the gospel; it will rather increase your torment. Conscience
          will cry aloud -- |I heard the gospel of grace, and I heard the
          arguments which proved it true, but I rejected a gospel which God
          himself proclaimed, a gospel which was genuine on the face of it, a
          gospel full of such love as ought to have melted a rock, a gospel that
          was brought to me without money and without price, a gospel that was
          pressed upon me from my infancy to my hoar hairs -- I rejected it, I
          wilfully rejected it, not because it was not true, but because I would
          believe a lie, and would not believe the living God.| Eternal Father,
          thou who art mighty to save, let not one among us go down into the pit
          with a lie in his right hand, refusing to accept the gospel of thy
          blessed Son! The Lord save you all, for Christ's sake. Amen.
