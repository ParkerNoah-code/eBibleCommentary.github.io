        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.192)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Tuesday Evening, May 4, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Bloomsbury Chapel,</p>
        <p>On behalf of the Sunday School Union</p>
        <p>"Give an account of thy stewardship." -- Luke 16:2.</p>
        <p>
          WE HAVE HEARD many times in our lives, that we are all stewards to
          Almighty God. We hold it as a solemn truth of our religion, that the
          rich man is responsible for the use which he makes of his wealth; that
          the talented man must give an account to God of the interest which he
          getteth upon his talents; that every one of us, in proportion to our
          time and opportunities, must give an account for himself before
          Almighty God. But, my dear brothers and sisters, our responsibility is
          even deeper and greater than that of other men. We have the ordinary
          responsibility which falls upon all professors of religion, to give an
          account of all we have to God; but besides this, you and I have the
          extraordinary responsibilities of our official standing -- you, as
          teachers for Christ in your classes; and others of us as preachers for
          him before the great congregation. The first responsibility is too
          heavy for any man to fulfill. Apart from divine grace, it is not
          possible that any man should so use all that God has given him as to
          be accepted at last with a "Well done thou good and faithful servant;"
          yet even if that were possible, it would still remain an utter
          impossibility for us fully to sustain the fearful weight of
          responsibility which rests upon us as teachers of the Word of God to
          our fellow immortals. Upon our necks there are two yokes; Sovereign
          grace can make them light and easy, but apart from that they will gall
          our shoulders; for they are, of themselves, too heavy for us to bear.
          Common responsibility is as Solomon's whip; but extraordinary
          responsibility derived from official standing when not regarded, will
          be as the scorpion of Rehoboam, its little finger shall be thicker
          than its father's loins. Woe unto the watchman who warns them not; woe
          unto the minister who fails to teach the truth; woe unto the
          Sabbathschool teacher who is unfaithful to his trust. Now, let us try
          to stir one another up, upon this seriously important matter. You will
          pray for me while I preach, that I may utter some things that may do
          good to all now present, and I will labor that God may, in answer to
          your prayers, give me words and thoughts which shall be blessed to
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, first, let me show the meaning of our being stewards then let us
          consider what kind of account we shall have to give; and lastly, let
          us notice the days of reckoning when we OUGHT to cast up our account,
          and the days of reckoning when we MUST give in our account.
        </p>
        <p>I. First, then, THE STEWARD -- WHAT IS HE?</p>
        <p>
          In the first place, the steward is a servant. He is one of the
          greatest of servants; but he is only a servant. Perhaps he is the
          bailiff of a farm, and looks, to all intents and purposes, like a
          country farmer: he rides over his master's estate, and has many men
          under him; still he is only a servant, he is under authority, he is
          only a steward. Perhaps he is steward in the house of some gentleman,
          who employs him to see after the whole of his establishment, in order
          that he may be free from cares. In that capacity he is himself a
          master, but still he is a servant; for he has one over him. Let him be
          as proud as he pleases, he has little to be proud of, for the only
          rank he holds in life, is the rank of a servant, Now, the minister,
          and the Sunday-school teacher specially stand in the rank of servants.
          Why, we are none of us our own masters; we are not independent
          gentlemen. who may do as we please, our classes are not our own farms,
          which we may till in our own manner, and neglect if we please, out of
          which we may produce any harvest, or none at all, at our own
          discretion. No, we are nothing better than stewards, and we are to
          labor for our Master in heaven. What a strange thing it is to see a
          minister or a teacher giving himself fine airs, as if he were
          everybody in the world and might do as he pleased. Is it not an
          anomaly? How is he to talk about the sacrifices that he makes, when he
          is spending only his master's property? How is he to boast about the
          time which he expends, when his time is not his own? It is all his
          Master's. He is a servant, and therefore, do he what he may, lie only
          discharges the duty for which he is well rewarded. He has no reason to
          be proud, or to lord it over others, for whatever his power among them
          may be, he is himself neither more nor less than a servant. Let each
          of us try to recollect that henceforth "I am only a servant." If a
          superintendent puts a teacher to a class which she does not like, she
          will recollect that she is a servant. She does not allow her servants
          at home to stand up and say, they are not going to do scullerywork but
          will only wait at table; they are servants, and must do as they are
          bidden; and if we felt that we were servants, we should not object to
          do what we are told for Christ's sake: though we would not do it at
          the dictation of men yet for Christ's sake we do it as unto the Lord.
          We do not suppose that our servants will come to us at night, and
          expect us to say to them, "You have done your work very well to-day,"
          we do not imagine that they will look for constant commendation. They
          are servants, and when they get their wages, that is their encomium on
          their work. They may judge they are worth their money, or else we
          should not keep them. When you do your work for Jesus, recollect you
          are only a servant. Do not expect always to have that encouragement,
          which some people are constantly crying after. If you get
          encouragement from your pastor from other teachers, from your friends,
          be thankful; but if you do not get it, go on with your work
          notwithstanding. You are a servant, and when you receive your reward,
          that is of grace, and not of debt, then you will have the highest
          encomium that can be passed upon you, the plaudit of your Lord, and
          eternal glow with him whose you are, and whom you desire to serve.
        </p>
        <p>
          But still while the steward is a servant, he is an honorable one. It
          does not do for the other servants in the house to tell him that he is
          a servant. He will not endure that: he knows it, and feels it he
          desires to act and work as such, but at the same time, he is an
          honored servant. Now, those who serve Christ in the office of
          teaching, are honorable men and women. I remember to have heard a very
          unseemly discussion between two persons, as to whether the minister
          was not superior to the Sabbath-school teacher. It reminded me of that
          talk of the disciples, as to who among them was the greatest. Why, we
          are all of us "the least," if we feel aright, and though we must each
          of us exalt our office as God hath given it to us, yet, I see not
          anywhere in the Bible, anything that should lead me to believe that
          the office of the preacher is more honorable than that of the teacher.
          It seems to me, that every Sunday-school teacher has a right to put
          "Reverend" before his name as much as I have, or if not, if he
          discharges his trust he certainly is a "Right Honourable." He teaches
          his congregation and preaches to his class. I may preach to more, and
          he to less, but still he is doing the same work, though in a smaller
          sphere. I am sure I can sympathies with Mr. Carey, when he said of his
          son Felix, who left the missionary work to become an ambassador,
          "Felix has drivelled into an ambassador;" meaning to say, that he was
          once a great person as a missionary, but that he had afterwards
          accepted a comparatively insignificant office. So I think we may say
          of the Sabbath-school teacher, if he gives up his work because he
          cannot attend to it, on account of his enlarged business, he drivels
          into a rich merchant. If he forsakes his teaching because he finds
          there is so much else to do, he drivels into something less than he
          was before; with one exception, if he is obliged to give up to attend
          to his own family, and makes that family his Sabbath-school class,
          there is no drivelling there; he stands in the same position as he did
          before. I say they who teach, they who seek to pluck souls as brands
          from the burning, are to be considered as honored persons, second far
          to him from whom they received their commission; but still in some
          sweet sense lifted up to become fellows with him, for he calls them
          his brethren and his friends. "The servant knoweth not what his Lord
          doeth, but I have called you friends, for all things I have heard of
          my Father I have made known unto you."
        </p>
        <p>
          Only one more thought here. The steward is also a servant who has very
          great responsibility attached to his position. A sense of
          responsibility seems to a right man always a weighty thing. To do a
          thing where there is no responsibility involved at all, is a very
          slight matter, and hence we find in ordinary affairs that the labor
          which involves no trust is but poorly paid. But where there is a large
          amount of trust reposed the labor is paid in proportion. Now the work
          of the Sabbath-school teacher is one of the most responsible in the
          world. It has sometimes staggered me to think how greatly God trusts
          you and me. You remember the story of the prodigal. It finds a
          counterpart in each of us, who after long wandering in sin have come
          home to Jesus. I sometimes think that a prudent father, when the
          prodigal was restored to his house, could receive him to his heart,
          would press him to his bosom, and give him a share of all his wealth,
          but would be very slow to trust him in any matter of responsibility.
          The next market-day the old gentlemen would say, "Now John I love you
          with all my heart, but you know you ran away once, and spent your
          living riotously; I must send your elder brother to market; I cannot
          trust you with my purse: I love you; I have totally forgiven you, at
          the same time I cannot yet rely upon you." Why does not God say so to
          us? Instead of that, when he takes poor prodigals to his heart, he
          trusts us with his most precious jewels, he trusts us with immortal
          souls. He permits us to be the means of seeking his lost sheep, and
          then allows us to feed the lambs after they are gathered. He puts the
          prodigal into the most important station, and hath confidence in him.
          Then my brethren and sisters, seeing he hath been gracious enough to
          repose confidence in such unworthy persons, shall we deceive him? Oh
          no; let us earnestly labor as stewards that every part of the estate
          committed to us shall be found in good order when our Master comes;
          that every jot and tittle of our account shall be found correct when
          he sums it up in the great day of the audit before his throne. Our
          office is a very very solemn one. Some think little of it. Some take
          it upon themselves very lightly. Giddy youths are enticed into the
          school and not rendered more sober by their connection with it. Let
          such depart from us. We want none but those who are sober, none but
          those who solemnly weigh what they are doing, and who enter upon the
          work as a matter involving life or death, not as a trivial affair
          which concerns the interests of time, but an awfully solemn thing
          which even an angel would be incapable of performing, unless he had
          the abundant assistance of God the Holy Spirit. I have thus endeavored
          very simply to set forth the idea couched in the word "stewardship."
          We are servants highly honored, very responsible, and much trusted.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now, THE ACCOUNT -- "Give an account of thy stewardship." Let
          us briefly think of this giving an account of our stewardship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us first notice that when we shall come to give an account of our
          stewardship before God, that account must be given in personally, by
          every one of us. While we are here, we talk in the mass; but when we
          come before God, we shall have to speak as individuals. You hear
          persons boasting about "our Sabbathschool." Many persons are wicked
          enough to call the Sabbath-school "their school," when they never see
          it by the year together. They say, "I hope our school is flourishing,"
          when they never subscribe a halfpenny, when they never give the
          teachers a word of encouragement, or even a smile, and do not know how
          many children the school contains. Yet they call it theirs. Thieves
          that they are, taking to themselves that which does not belong to
          them! Well, but we, in our measure, make the same mistake. As a
          ministry, we often talk of the doings of the "body," and what wonders
          have been done by the "denomination" Now, let us recollect, when we
          come before God, there will be no judging us in denominations, no
          dealing with us in schools and in churches, but the account must be
          given for each one by himself: So, then, thou that hast the infant
          class, thou wilt have to give thine own account. It was but the other
          day thou wast finding fault with the conduct of the senior class, and
          thou west told then to look at home. Conscience told thee so. But at
          last, when thou shalt have to stand before God, thou wilt have no
          account to give of the senior class, but of that infant class
          committed to thee. And you, my sister, you have been seven or eight
          years a teacher -- you must give an account for yourself, not for that
          other teacher of another class, of whom you have often boasted,
          because she has been the means of bringing six seven children to
          Christ lately. Remember, her six won't be put with your none at all,
          in order to make the total at the year's end look respectable; but
          there will stand your great blank at the end of your labors, and there
          will remain the dark mark for your negligence, for your unpunctuality,
          your carelessness in your class, without the relief of the bright side
          of the diligent teacher's success. You must be judged each of you for
          yourself, not in parties, but one by one. This makes it terrible work,
          for a man to be looked at all alone. I have known people who could not
          bear to stand up in a pulpit; the very fact of so many eyes looking
          upon them seemed so horrible, but how will it be when we must stand up
          and hear our hearts read by the all-searching eye of God, and when the
          whole of our career in the offices which we now hold will be published
          before the sun, and that, I repeat it, without the salvo of the
          success of others, without any addition to our labors derived from the
          diligence of other teachers? Come, Mr. Steward, what is your account?
          Not that one, sir, not that one; your account. "Lord, I have brought
          in the account of the Sunday-school books." "No, not that, the account
          of your own class?" "Well, my Master, I have brought in the account of
          the class for the last twentyfive years, showing how many were
          converted." "No, not that; the account of your own class while you
          were its teacher." "Well, I have brought in the account of the class
          during the time I was teacher with So-and-so." "No, not that; the
          account of the class while you were the teacher of it alone, the
          account of how you taught what you taught, how you prayed, how
          earnestly you labored, how diligently you studied, and what you sought
          to do for Christ." Not the addenda of the other teacher who helped you
          in another part of the duty, but your own personal account alone must
          be brought in before God. "Give an account of thy stewardship."
          Putting it in this light, what account will some of you give in at the
          last and great day? Just let me stop a minute to charge your memories.
          What kind of account will it be? I trust a very large number here can
          humbly in their hearts say "I have done but little, but I did that
          sincerely and prayerfully; may God accept it through Jesus Christ!"
          But I fear there are some others, who, if they are true to their
          consciences, will say, "I have done but little; I did that little
          carelessly. I did it without prayer; I did it without the help of the
          Holy Spirit." Then, my brother and sister, I hope you will add after
          that, "Oh, my God, forgive me, and help me from this good hour to be
          diligent in this divine business, fervent in my spirit, serving the
          Lord." And may God bless you in that prayer! Make no resolve, but
          offer a prayer which is better far; and may you be heard in heaven,
          the dwellingplace of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And note again, that while this account must be personal it must be
          exact. You will not, when you present your account before God, present
          the gross total, but every separate item. When thou givest in thine
          account of thy stewardship, it will be thus. Thou hadst so many
          children. What didst thou say to this child, and to this, and to this,
          and to the other? How often didst thou pray for that child with his
          bitter temper; for that child with his unbending obstinacy, for that
          child with its quickness, and its sweet affection; for that child,
          that sulky one; for that child, the headstrong, vicious one, that had
          learned all the evils of the street, and seemed to taint others? What
          didst thou do for each one of these? How didst thou labor for the
          conversion of every one? And to make the account still more particular
          it will run thus -- What didst thou do for each child on each Sabbath?
          Thou heardest one child utter an ill word: didst thou reprove it? Thou
          sawest another child oppress a little one: didst thou deliver the less
          out of his hand and reprove him and teach both children to love each
          other? Didst thou notice the follies of each and strive to understand
          the temperament of each, so that thou shouldest fit thy discourse or
          thy prayer to each? Didst thou travail in birth for the conversion of
          each one? Didst thou agonise in prayer with God, and then didst thou
          agonise in exhortation with them, beseeching them to be reconciled to
          Christ? I believe the account will be far more minute than this, when
          God shall come to try our hearts and reins as well as our works and
          ways. My poor way of putting it does but becloud the truth which I
          seek to bring forth, but nevertheless so shall it be; a special and
          exact account shall be given. And then there shall be an account
          given, for every opportunity; not only for every child, but for every
          opportunity of doing good to the child. Did you avail yourself of that
          afternoon, when the child was in a peculiarly solemn frame because his
          little brother lay at home dead? Did you seek to send the arrows home
          when providence had made a wound in his little heart because he had
          lost his dear mother? Did you seek to turn every event which occurred
          in the school to account, whether it was joyous or the reverse? God
          gave you the opportunity, and he will at last ask you what you did
          with it. We shall many of us make but a sorry account, for we have
          neglected much that we ought to have done; and the general confession
          must be ours as teachers, "We have done those things which we ought
          not to have done, and we have left undone those things which we ought
          to have done."
        </p>
        <p>
          And then remember, again, the account will be exact as to everything
          that we did. We shall not only be examined as to how we addressed the
          school; we may have had peculiar gifts for that, and we may have done
          well; it will be, "How did you address your own class?" and not that
          alone, but "How did you study the lessons?" If thou hadst no time it
          will not be required of thee to do what thou couldst not do, but if
          thou hadst much leisure how didst thou spend it? Was it for thy
          children, for thy Master's good, that thou mightest find polished
          shafts to shoot forth from thy bow, that God might bless thee, by
          giving thee strength to send them home into the heart? And then, what
          didst thou do in thy closet? Wast thou cold and careless there? Were
          thy children forgotten, or didst thou bring them on thy heart, and in
          thine arms, and with tears and cries commend them to Christ? Ah,
          Sunday-school teachers, your closet shall be turned into the open air
          one day, and the contents of your secret chambers be published before
          the sun. Oh, ye whose cobwebbed closets witness against you; oh, ye
          against whom the beam out of the wall explaineth because your voice
          has not been heard there, against whom the very floor might bear
          witness, because it hath never felt the weight of your knees, how will
          you stand this searching test? How will you endure this day of
          burning, when God shall try you for everything you did, and everything
          you did not do which you ought to have done, in connection with the
          work of teaching your children? The account must be exact and precise,
          as well as personal. I shall not stop to enlarge upon that; your own
          conscience and judgment can enlarge upon it at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, remember, once again, that the account must be complete. You will
          not be allowed to leave out something, you will not be allowed to add
          anything. Perhaps some of you would like to begin with to-morrow, or
          next Sabbathday, and strike out the past. No, Sunday-school teacher,
          when God says, "Give an account of thy stewardship," you will have to
          begin with the day when you first were a teacher. Ah, my God, how many
          there are who profess to preach the Word, who might well beg that thou
          wouldest let many a year of their ministry be buried in forgetfulness!
          Ah, might not some of us fall upon our knees and say "Lord, let me
          give account of my diligent years, not of my idle years?" But we must
          begin with our ordination, we must end with our death, and you must
          begin with the first hour when you sat down in your class, and you
          must end when life ends, and not till then. Does not this put a very
          solemn aspect upon your account, some of you? You are always saying,
          "I will be better to morrow." Will that blot out yesterday? "I must be
          more diligent in future." Will that redeem the lost opportunities
          which have departed in the years gone by No; if you have loitered
          long, and lingered much, you will find the hardest running of to-day
          will not make up for the loitering of yesterday. There have been some
          men who, after spending many years in sin, have been doubly diligent
          for Christ afterwards, but they have always felt that they have only
          done the day's work in the day, and they mourned over those years
          which the locusts had eaten, as gone beyond recall. Oh! catch the
          moments as they fly, Sabbath-school teachers; use the days as they
          come. Do not be talking about making up for the badness of the first
          part of the account by the brilliant character of the conclusion; you
          cannot do it, you must give an account for each day separately, for
          each year by itself; and do what you may to retrieve your losses, the
          losses still stand upon the book, and the Master will say, at last,
          "How came these here?" And, though they are all covered up in
          Sovereign grace, if thou believest in Christ Jesus, yet thou wouldest
          not wish to have any the more stains for that. Because Christ hath
          washed thee, thou dost not desire to make thyself filthy; because he
          hath atoned thou dost not desire to commit sin. No, live, my brothers
          and sisters, as Sundayschool teachers should live. Live as if your own
          salvation depended upon the strictness of your fulfilling your duty;
          and yet recollect your salvation does not depend upon that, but on
          your personal interest in the everlasting covenant, and in the
          all-prevailing blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is Israel's
          strength and Redeemer.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, though there are many other things I might say, I fear
          lest I might weary you, therefore, let me notice some occasions when
          it will be WELL for you all to give an account of your stewardship;
          and then notice when you MUST give an account of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You know there is a proverb, that "short reckonings make long
          friends," and a very true proverb it is. A man will always be at
          friendship with his conscience as long as he makes short reckonings
          with it. It was a good rule of the old Puritans, that of making frank
          and full confession of sin every night; not to leave a week's sin to
          be confessed on Saturday night, or Sabbath morning, but to recall the
          failures, imperfections, and mistakes of the day, in order that we
          might learn from one day of failure how to achieve the victory on the
          morrow, and that washing ourselves daily from our sins we might
          preserve the purity and whiteness of our garments. Brothers and
          sisters, do the same; make short reckonings. And it will be well for
          you every Sabbath evening, or at any other time, if so it pleaseth
          you, to make a reckoning of what you do on the Sabbath. I do not say
          this in order that you may be encouraged in any self-righteous
          congratulation that you have done well; because, if you make your
          reckoning correct, you will never have much cause to congratulate
          yourself, but always cause to mourn that you did your duty so ill
          compared with what you ought to have done. When the Sabbath is over
          and you have been twice to the house of God to teach your class, just
          sit down and try to recollect what were the points in which you
          failed. Perhaps you exhibited a hasty temper; you spoke to a boy too
          sharply when he was a little rebellious. Perhaps you were too
          complacent; you saw sin committed, and ought to have reproved it, and
          you did not do so. If you find out your own failing, that is half the
          way to a cure. Next Sabbath you can try and set it right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, there are times which Providence puts in your way, which will be
          excellent seasons for reckoning. For instance, every time a boy or
          girl leaves the school, there is an opportunity afforded you of
          thinking to yourselves, "Well, how did I deal with Betsy? How did I
          treat John? Did I give William such teaching as will help him in his
          future life, to maintain integrity in the midst of temptation, and
          preserve righteousness when he shall be subjected to imminent perils?
          How did I teach the girl? Did I so teach her that she will know her
          duty when she goes into the world? Did I strive with all my might to
          lead her to the foot of the cross?" There are many solemn questions
          which you may put concerning the child. And when you meet with any of
          them grown up in after years, you will find that a very proper season
          for giving an account of your stewardship to your conscience, by
          seeing whether you really did with that person, when a child, as you
          could have desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, there is a peculiar time for casting up accounts when a child
          dies. Ah! what a host of thoughts cluster around the dying-bed of a
          child whom we have taught. Next to the father and the mother, I should
          think the Sabbath-school teacher will take the most interest in the
          dying one. You will recollect, "There lies withering the flower which
          my hand hath watered; there is an immortal soul about to pass the
          portals of eternity, whom I have taught. O God, have I taught this
          dying child the truth, or have I deceived him! Have I dealt faithfully
          with him? Have I told him of his ruin? Have I set before him how he
          was fallen in Adam and depraved in himself? Have I told him about the
          great redemption of Christ? Have I shown him the necessity of
          regeneration and the work of the Holy Spirit? or have I amused him
          with tales about the historical parts of the Bible and pieces of
          morality, and kept back the weightier matters of the law? Can I put my
          hand into his dying hand, and silently lifting my heart to heaven, can
          I say, "O God thou knowest I am clear of his blood?" Ah! that is a
          thing that stings the minister often -- when he recollects that any of
          his congregation are dying. When I stand sometimes by the dying-bed of
          any of the ungodly in my congregation, it brings many a tearful
          thought to me. Have I been as earnest as I ought to have been? Did I
          cry to this man, "Escape for thy life, look not behind thee, stay not
          in all the plain, flee to the mountains! Did I pray for him, weep over
          him, tell him of his sin, preach Christ simply, plainly, boldly, to
          him? Was there not an occasion when I used lightness when I ought to
          have been solemn? Might there not have been a season when I uttered
          something by mistake, which may have been a pillow for the armhole of
          his conscience on which he might rest? Have not I helped to smooth his
          path to hell, instead of putting blocks in his way, and chains across
          his path that he might be turned out of it and led to seek the
          Saviour?" Ah! while we know that salvation is all of grace let none of
          us imagine we are free from the blood of souls, unless we warn them
          with diligence, unless we preach with faithfulness; for this same
          Bible which tells me that Christ shall see of the travail of his soul
          and be satisfied, tells me that if I warn them not, their blood, if
          they perish, shall be required at my hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, teacher, let me tell you an occasion when you must give in
          your account. You may put off all these seasons if you like; you may
          live as carelessly as you please, but if you have a particle of heart
          in you, you will have to give an account when you are sick, and cannot
          go to your class. If your conscience is worth having -- which some
          people's consciences are not, for they are dead and seared -- if your
          conscience is an awakened one, when you are put out of your work, you
          will begin to think how you did it. You should read the letters of
          that holy man Rutherford. If ever there was a man who preached the
          gospel sweetly and with divine unction, I should think it must have
          been he; and yet when he was shut up in Aberdeen, and could not get
          out to his much-loved flock, he begun to say, "Ah, if the Lord will
          let me go out to preach again, I will never be such a dull drone as I
          was wont to be. I will preach with tears in mine eyes, so that the
          people may be comforted, and the sinners converted." Perhaps when you
          are lying ill in your bed-room, little Jane comes to see you, and
          says, "I hope you will soon get well, teacher;" or William, or Thomas
          calls and enquires about you every Sunday afternoon, and asks the
          servant to give his love to you, and hopes that teacher will soon come
          back again. Then is the time when I know you will be sure to cast up
          your account. You will say, "Ah, when I get back to my class, I won't
          teach them as I used to do. I will study my lesson more, I will pray
          more. I won't be so hot or so fast with them as I was wont to be. I
          will bear with their ill manners. Ah, if my Master will give me, like
          Hezekiah, another fifteen years of labor, and will give me more grace,
          I will strive to be better." You will be sure to cast up your accounts
          when you get sick.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if you do not do it then, I will tell you when you must; that is
          when you come to die. What a dreadful thing it must be to be an
          unfaithful preacher on a dying-bed. (Oh that I may be saved from
          that!) To be upon one's bed when life is over; to have had great
          opportunities, mighty congregations, and to have been so diligent
          about something else as to have neglected to preach the full and free
          gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ! methinks as I lie in my bed a-dying,
          I should see spectres and grim things in the room. One would come and
          stare upon me and say, "Ah! you are dying. Remember how many times I
          sat in the front of the gallery, and listened to you, but you never
          once told me to escape from the wrath to come; you were talking to me
          about something I did not understand; but the simple matter of the
          gospel you never preached to me, and I died in doubt and trembling.
          And now you are coming to me to the hell which I have inherited
          because you were unfaithful." And when in our grey and dying age we
          see the generations which have grown up around our pulpits, we shall
          think of them all. We shall think of the time when as striplings we
          first began to preach; we shall recollect the youths that then
          crowded, then the men, and then the grey heads that passed away. And
          methinks as they come on in grim procession, they will everyone leave
          a fresh curse upon our conscience because we were unfaithful. The
          death-bed of a man who has murdered his fellows, of some grim tyrant
          who has let the bloodhounds of war loose upon mankind, must be an
          awful thing. When the soldier, and the soldier's widow, and the
          murdered man of peace rise up before him; when the smoke of devastated
          countries seems to blow into his eyes and make them sore and red; when
          the blood of men hangs on his conscience like a great red pall; when
          bloody murder, the grim chamberlain, draws red curtains round his bed,
          and when he begins to approach the last end where the murderer must
          inherit his dreary doom, it must be a fearful time indeed. But,
          methinks to have murdered souls must be more awful still -- to have
          distributed poison to children instead of bread, to have given them
          stones when they asked us for right food, to have taught them error
          when we ought to have taught them the truth as it is in Jesus, or to
          have spoken to them with cold listlessness when earnestness was
          needed. Oh, how your children seem to curse you, when you lie there
          and have been unfaithful to your charge. Yes, you will have to cast up
          your account then; and let me tell you, though your hope must all be
          fixed on Jesus, and that must be the consolation of your life and
          death, yet it will be very sweetest; remember when you come to die
          that you have been successful in winning souls to Christ. Ah! that
          will bring a little life into the cheek of the consumptive teacher,
          who sickens young when you remind her that there was a little girl
          who, a year before she was taken ill, kissed her hand, and said, "Good
          bye, teacher, we shall meet in heaven. Do not you recollect, teacher,
          telling me the story of Jesus on the cross, and taking me home one
          Sunday afternoon, and putting your arms around my neck, and kneeling
          down and praying that God would bless me? Oh my teacher, that brought
          me to Jesus." Yes, teacher, when you are lying on your bed, pale and
          consumptive, you will recollect that there is one up there beside your
          Saviour who will receive you into eternal habitations -- that young
          spirit who has gone before you, who by your means was emancipated from
          the wickedness and bondage of a sinful world. Happy is the teacher who
          has the hope of meeting a whole band of such in heaven. Such a thought
          often cheers me. Let the world say what it will, I know when I die
          there is many a spirit that will think of me in after years as the man
          who preached the gospel to him; many a drunkard brought to Jesus, and
          many a harlot reclaimed. And to the teacher it must be the same to
          think that when he claps his wings and mounts from this lower valley
          of earth to heaven, he will see a bright spirit coming down to meet
          him, and he will hear the Spirit saying --
        </p>
        <p>"Sister spirit, come away,"</p>
        <p>
          And when he opens his eyes, he will see that the song came from the
          lips of one to whom he had been blessed as the means of conversion.
          Happy you who shall be welcomed at the gates of Paradise by your
          spiritual sons and daughters, and who shall have beside your Master's
          welcome, the welcome of those whom he hath given you to be jewels in
          your crown of glory for ever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now to conclude. We must all give an account to God in the day of
          judgment. That is the thing which makes death so terrible. Oh, Death,
          if thou wert all, what art thou but a pinch, and all is over! But
          after Death the judgment. This is the sting of the dragon to the
          ungodly. The last great day is come. The books are opened -- men,
          women, and children are assembled. Many have come, and some on the
          right, and some on the left, have already heard the sentence. It is
          now your turn. Teacher! what account will you render? In the first
          place, are you in Christ yourself? or have you taught to others what
          you did not know yourself? Have I any such here? Doubtless, I have.
          for alas! there are many such in our schools. Oh, my friend, what wilt
          thou say when the Master, opening the book, shall ask thee, "What
          hadst thou to do, to declare my statutes?" Will you look at him and
          say, "Lord I taught in thy schools, and thou hast eaten and drunk in
          our streets." If you should say so, he will say, "Verily, I never knew
          you, depart from me ye cursed." Then, what have you to say with regard
          to your schools -- for although our state at last will really be
          settled according to our interest in Christ, you will be judged by
          your works, as evidences. The Scripture always says that we are to be
          judged according to our works. Well, then, the book is opened. You
          hear your own name read, and you hear that one brief sentence --
          "Inasmuch as thou hast been faithful over a few things I will make
          thee a ruler over many things -- enter thou into the joy of thy Lord!"
          Oh heaven of heavens! and is this the reward of the little trouble of
          teaching a few children? Oh, Master, thou givest ingots of gold for
          our grains of dust -- our fragments of service thou rewardest with
          crowns and kingdoms! But he turns to others, and to you he says,
          "Inasmuch as ye did it not unto the least of these my brethren, ye did
          it not unto me. Depart from me into everlasting fire in hell, prepared
          for the devil and his angels." Which of these two shall be said to me?
          Which of these two shall be said to you? "Oh! as in God's sight I
          charge you by him who is the Judge of quick and dead, by the swiftness
          of his chariot-wheels which now are bringing him here, by the
          solemnity of his awful tribunal, by that sentence which shall never be
          reversed, judge yourselves, for then ye shall not be judged. Give an
          account of your stewardship to your conscience, and to your God.
          Confess your sins, seek his help, and begin from this hour, by his
          Holy Spirit, to undertake his work afresh; so shall ye stand before
          his face, clothed in the righteousness of your Redeemer and washed in
          his blood. Though not boasting in your works you shall be able to
          stand accepted in him, and your works shall follow when you rise from
          your labors, and you shall be among the blessed that die in the Lord.
