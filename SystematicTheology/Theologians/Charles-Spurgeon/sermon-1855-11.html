        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.12)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, March 4, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>"For so he giveth his beloved sleep." -- Psalm 127:2.</p>
        <p>
          The sleep of the body is the gift of God. So said Homer of old, when
          he described it as descending from the clouds and resting on the tents
          of the warriors around old Troy. And so sang Virgil, when he spoke of
          Palinurus falling asleep upon the prow of his ship. Sleep is the gift
          of God. We think that we lay our heads upon our pillows, and compose
          our bodies in a peaceful posture, and that, therefore we naturally and
          necessarily sleep. But it is not so. Sleep is the gift of God; and not
          a man would close his eyes, did not God put his fingers on his
          eyelids; did not the Almighty send a soft and balmy influence over his
          frame which lulled his thoughts into quiescence, making him enter into
          that blissful state of rest which we call sleep. True, there be some
          drugs and narcotics whereby men can poison themselves well nigh to
          death, and then call it sleep; but the sleep of the healthy body is
          the gift of God. He bestows it; he rocks the cradle for us every
          night; he draws the curtain of darkness; he bids the sun shut up his
          burning eyes; and then he comes and says, "Sleep, sleep, my child; I
          give thee sleep." Have you not known what it is at times to lie upon
          your bed and strive to slumber? and as it is said of Darius, so might
          it be said of you: "The king sent for his musicians, but his sleep
          went from him." You have attempted it, but you could not do it; it is
          beyond your power to procure a healthy repose. You imagine if you fix
          your mind upon a certain subject until it shall engross your
          attention, you will then sleep; but you find yourself unable to do so.
          Ten thousand things drive through your brain as if the whole earth
          were agitated before you. You see all things you ever beheld dancing
          in a wild phantasmagoria before your eyes. You close your eyes, but
          still you see; and there be things in your ear, and head, and brain,
          which will not let you sleep. It is God alone, who alike seals up the
          sea boy's eyes upon the giddy mast, and gives the monarch rest: for
          with all appliances and means to boot, he could not rest without the
          aid of God. It is God who steeps the mind in lethe, and bids us
          slumber, that our bodies may be refreshed, so that for tomorrow's toil
          we may rise recruited and strengthened. O my friends, how thankful
          should we be for sleep. Sleep is the best physician that I know of.
          Sleep hath healed more pains of wearied bones than the most eminent
          physicians upon earth. It is the best medicine; the choicest thing of
          all the names which are written in all the lists of pharmacy. There is
          nothing like to sleep! What a mercy it is that it belongs alike to
          all! God does not make sleep the boon of the rich man, he does not
          give it merely to the noble, or the rich, so that they can keep it as
          a peculiar luxury for themselves; but he bestows it upon all. Yea, if
          there be a difference, the sleep of the labouring man is sweet,
          whether he eat little or much. He who toils, sleeps all the sounder
          for his toil. While luxurious effeminacy cannot rest, tossing itself
          from side to side upon a bed of eider down, the hard-working labourer,
          with his strong and powerful limbs, worn out and tired, throws himself
          upon his hard couch and sleeps: and waking, thanks God that he has
          been refreshed. Ye know not, my friends, how much ye owe to God, that
          he gives you rest at night. If ye had sleepless nights, ye would then
          value the blessing. If for weeks ye lay tossing on your weary bed, ye
          then would thank God for this favour. But as it is the gift of God, it
          is a gift most precious, one that cannot be valued until it is taken
          away; yea, even then we cannot appreciate it as we ought.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Psalmist says there are some men who deny themselves sleep. For
          purposes of gain, or ambition, they rise up early and sit up late.
          Some of us who are here present may have been guilty of the same
          thing. We have risen early in the morning that we might turn over the
          ponderous volume, in order to acquire knowledge; we have sat at night
          until our burned-out lamp has chidden us, and told us that the sun was
          rising; while our eyes have ached, our brain has throbbed, our heart
          has palpitated. We have been weary and worn out; we have risen up
          early, and sat up late, and have in that way come to eat the bread of
          sorrow. Many of you business men are toiling in that style. We do not
          condemn you for it; we do not forbid rising up early and sitting up
          late; but we remind you of this text: -- "It is vain for you to rise
          up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he
          giveth his beloved sleep." And it is of this sleep, that God gives to
          his beloved, that we mean to speak this morning, as God shall help us
          -- a sleep peculiar to the children of God -- a sleep which he gives
          to "his beloved."
        </p>
        <p>
          Sleep is sometimes used in a bad sense in the Word of God, to express
          the condition of carnal and worldly men. Some men have the sleep of
          carnal ease and sloth: of whom Solomon tells us, they are unwise sons
          that slumber in the harvest, causing shame; so that when the harvest
          is spent, and the summer is ended, they are not saved. Sleep often
          expresses a state of sloth, of deadness, of indifference, in which all
          ungodly men are found, according to the words, "It is time for us to
          awake out of sleep. -- "Let us not sleep as do others, but let us who
          are of the day be sober." There be many who are sleeping the
          sluggard's sleep, who are resting upon the bed of sloth; but an awful
          waking shall it be to them, when they shall find that the time of
          their probation has been wasted; that the golden sands of their life
          have dropped unheeded from the hourglass; and that they have come into
          that world where there are no acts of pardon passed, no hope, no
          refuge, no salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In other places you find sleep used as the figure of carnal security,
          in which so many are found. Look at Saul, lying asleep in fleshly
          security -- not like David, when he said, "I will lay me down and
          sleep, for thou Lord makest me to dwell in safety." Abner lay there,
          and all the troops lay around him, but Abner slept. Sleep on, Saul,
          sleep on. But there is an Abishai standing at thy pillow, and with a
          spear in his hand he says, "Let me smite him even to the earth at
          once." Still he sleeps; he knows it not. Such are many of you,
          sleeping in jeopardy of your soul; Satan is standing, the law is
          ready, vengeance is eager, and all saying, "Shall I smite him? I will
          smite him this once, and he shall never wake again." Christ says,
          "Stay, vengeance, stay." Lo, the spear is even now quivering -- "Stay,
          spare it yet another year, in the hope that he may yet wake from the
          long sleep of his sin." Like Sisera, I tell thee, sinner, thou art
          sleeping in the tent of the destroyer; thou mayest have eaten butter
          and honey out of lordly dish; but thou art sleeping on the doorstep of
          hell; even now the enemy is lifting up the hammer and the nail, to
          smite thee through thy temples, and fasten thee to the earth, that
          there thou mayest lie for ever in the death of everlasting torment --
          if it may be called a death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there is also mentioned in the Scripture, a sleep of lust, like
          that which Samson had when he lost his locks, and such sleep as many
          have when they indulge in sin, and wake to find themselves stripped,
          lost, and ruined. There is also the sleep of negligence, such as the
          virgins had, when it is said, "they all slumbered and slept;" and the
          sleep of sorrow, which overcame Peter, James, and John. But none of
          these are the gifts of God. They are incident to the frailty of our
          nature; they come upon us because we are fallen men; they creep over
          us because we are the sons of a lost and ruined parent. These sleeps
          are not the benisons of God; nor does he bestow them on his beloved.
          We now come to tell you what those sleeps are, which he does bestow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, there is a miraculous sleep which God has sometimes given to
          his beloved -- which he does not now vouchsafe. Into that kind of
          miraculous sleep, or rather trance, fell Adam, when he slept
          sorrowfully and alone; but when he awoke he was no more so, for God
          had given him that best gift which he had then bestowed on man. The
          same sleep Abram had, when it is said that a deep sleep came on him,
          and he laid him down, and saw a smoking furnace and a burning lamp,
          while a voice said to him, "Fear not, Abram; I am thy shield, and thy
          exceeding great reward." Such a hallowed sleep also was that of Jacob,
          when, with a stone for his pillow, the hedges for his curtains, he
          laid him down and slumbered. Dreaming, he saw a ladder set upon the
          earth, the top of which reached to heaven, the angels of God ascending
          and descending upon it. Such a sleep had Joseph, when he dreamed that
          the other sheaves made obeisance to his sheaf, and that the sun, moon,
          and seven stars were subject unto him. So ofttimes did David rest,
          when his sleep was sweet unto him, as we have just read. And such a
          sleep was that of Daniel, when he said, "I was asleep upon my face,
          and behold the Lord said unto me, Arise, and stand upon thy feet." And
          such, moreover, was the sleep of the reputed father of our blessed
          Lord, when in a vision of the night, an angel said to him, "Arise,
          Joseph, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt,
          for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him." These are
          miraculous slumbers. God's angel hath touched his servants with the
          magic wand of sleep, and they have slept, not simply as we do, but
          slept a wondrous sleep; they have dived into the tenfold depths of
          slumber; they have plunged into a sea of sleep, where they have seen
          the invisible, talked with the unknown, and heard mystic and wondrous
          sounds: and when they awoke, they have said, "What a sleep! Surely, my
          sleep was sweet unto me." "So he giveth his beloved sleep."
        </p>
        <p>
          But, now-a-days, we do not have such sleeps as these. Many persons
          dream very wonderful things, but most people dream nonsense. Some
          persons put faith in dreams: and, certainly God doth warn us in dreams
          and visions even now. I am sure he does. There is not a man but can
          mention one or more instances of a warning, or a benefit, he has
          received in a dream. But we never trust dreams. We remember what
          Rowland Hill said to a lady, who knew she was a child of God, because
          she dreamed such- and-such a thing: "Never mind, ma'am, what you did
          when you were asleep; let us see what you will do when you are awake."
          That is my opinion of dreams. I never will believe a man to be a
          Christian merely because he has dreamed himself one; for a dreamy
          religion will make a man a dreamer all his life -- and such dreamers
          will have an awful waking at last, if that is all they have to trust
          in.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. He gives his beloved, in the second place, the sleep of a quiet
          conscience. I think most of you saw that splendid picture, in the
          Exhibition of the Royal Academy -- the Sleep of Argyle -- where he lay
          slumbering on the very morning before his execution. You saw some
          noblemen standing there, looking at him, almost with compunction; the
          jailer is there, with his keys rattling; but positively the man
          sleeps, though tomorrow morning his head shall be severed from his
          body, and a man shall hold it up, and say, "This was the head of a
          traitor." He slept because he had a quiet conscience: for he had done
          no wrong. Then look at Peter. Did you ever notice that remarkable
          passage, where it is said that Herod intended to bring out Peter on
          the morrow; but, behold, as Peter was sleeping between two guards, the
          angel smote him? Sleeping between two guards, when on the morrow he
          was to be crucified or slain! He cared not, for his heart was clear;
          he had committed no ill. He could say, "If it be right to serve God or
          man, judge ye;" and, therefore, he laid him down and slept. O sirs! do
          ye know what the sleep of a quiet conscience is? Have you ever stood
          out and been the butt of calumny -- pelted by all men; the object of
          scorn -- the laugh, the song of drunkards? And have ye known what it
          is, after all, to sleep, as if you cared for nothing, because your
          heart was pure? Ah! ye who are in debt -- ah! ye who are dishonest --
          ah! ye who love not God, and love not Christ -- I wonder ye can sleep,
          for sin doth put pricking thorns in the pillow. Sin puts a dagger in a
          man's bed, so that whichever way he turns it pricks him. But a quiet
          conscience is the sweetest music that can lull the soul to sleep. The
          demon of restlessness does not come to that man's bed who has a quiet
          conscience -- a conscience right with God -- who can sing --
        </p>
        <p>With the world, myself, and thee,</p>
        <p>I, ere I sleep, at peace shall be.</p>
        <p>"So he giveth his beloved sleep."</p>
        <p>
          But let me tell you who have no knowledge of your election in Christ
          Jesus, no trust in the ransom of a Saviour's blood -- you, who have
          never been called by the Holy Ghost -- you, who were never regenerated
          and born again -- let me tell you that you do not know this slumber.
          You may say your conscience is quiet; you may say, you do no man any
          wrong, and that you believe at the bar of God you shall have little to
          account for. But, sirs, you know that the soul that sinneth, if it
          sins but once, must die. If the picture has a single flaw, it is not a
          perfect one. If ye have sinned but once, ye shall be damned for it,
          unless ye have something to take away that one sin. Ye do not know
          this sleep, but the Christian does, for all his sins were numbered on
          the "scape-goat's head of old." Christ has died for all his sins
          however great or enormous; and there is not now a sin written against
          him in the Book of God. "I, even I," says God, "am he that blotteth
          out thy transgressions for my name's sake, and I will not remember thy
          sins." Now thou mayest sleep; for "so he giveth his beloved sleep."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Again: there is the sleep of contentment which the Christian
          enjoys. How few people in this world are satisfied. No man ever need
          fear offering a reward of a thousand pounds to a contented man; for if
          any one came to claim the reward, he would of course prove his
          discontent. We are all in a measure, I suspect, dissatisfied with our
          lot; the great majority of mankind are always on the wing; they never
          settle; they never light on any tree to build their nest; but they are
          always fluttering from one to the other. This tree is not green
          enough, that is not high enough, this is not beautiful enough, that is
          not picturesque enough; so they are ever on the wing, and never build
          a peaceful nest at all. The Christian builds his nest; and as the
          noble Luther said, "Like yon little bird upon the tree, he hath fed
          himself tonight -- he knoweth not where his breakfast is tomorrow. He
          sitteth there while the winds rock the tree; he shuts his eyes, puts
          his head under his wing, and sleeps; and, when he awakes in the
          morning sings,
        </p>
        <p>Mortals cease from toil and sorrow;</p>
        <p>God provideth for the morrow."</p>
        <p>
          How few there are who have that blessed contentment -- who can say, "I
          want nothing else; I want but little here below -- yea, I long for
          nothing more -- I am satisfied -- I am content." You sung a beautiful
          hymn just now; but I suspect that many of you had no right to it,
          because you did not feel it.
        </p>
        <p>With thy will I leave the rest,</p>
        <p>Grant me but this one request;</p>
        <p>Both in life and death to prove</p>
        <p>Tokens of thy special love.</p>
        <p>
          Could you say there was nothing you wanted on earth, save Jesus? Did
          you mean that you are perfectly content -- that you had the sleep of
          contentment? Ah! no. You, who were apprentices, are sighing till you
          shall be journeymen; you who are journeymen, are groaning to be
          masters; masters are longing till they shall retire from business, and
          when they have retired, they are longing that all their children shall
          be settled in life. Man always looks for a yet-beyond; he is a mariner
          who never gets to port; an arrow which never reaches the target. Ah!
          the Christian hath this text and communed with it: -- "So he giveth
          his beloved sleep." In my reverie, as I was on the border of the land
          of dreams, methought I was in a castle. Around its massive walls there
          ran a deep moat. Watchmen paced the walls both day and night. It was a
          fine old fortress, bidding defiance to the foe; but I was not happy in
          it. I thought I lay upon a couch; but scarcely had I closed my eyes,
          ere a trumpet blew, "To arms! To arms!" and when the danger was
          overpast I lay me down again. "To arms! To arms! once more resounded,
          and again I started up. Never could I rest. I thought I had my armour
          on, and moved about perpetually clad in mail, rushing each hour to the
          castle top, aroused by some fresh alarm. At one time a foe was coming
          from the west; at another from the east. I thought I had a treasure
          somewhere down in some dep part of the castle, and all my care was to
          guard it. I dreaded, I feared, I trembled lest it should be taken from
          me. I awoke, and I thought I would not live in such a tower as that
          for all its grandeur. It was the castle of discontent, the castle of
          ambition, in which man never rests. It is ever "To arms! To arms! To
          arms!" There is a foe here or a foe there. His dear-loved treasure
          must be guarded. Sleep never crosses the drawbridge of the castle of
          discontent. Then I thought I would supplant it by another reverie. I
          was in a cottage. It was in what poets call a beautiful and pleasant
          place, but I cared not for that. I had no treasure in the world, save
          one sparkling jewel on my breast; and I thought I put my hand on that
          and went to sleep, nor did I wake till morning light. That treasure
          was a quiet conscience and the love of God -- "the peace that passeth
          all understanding." I slept, because I slept in the house of content,
          satisfied with what I had. Go ye, overreaching misers! Go ye, grasping
          ambitious men! I envy not your life of inquietude. The sleep of
          statesmen is often broken; the dream of the miser is always evil; the
          sleep of the man who loves gain is never hearty; but God "giveth," by
          contentment, "his beloved sleep."
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Once more: God giveth his beloved the sleep of quietness of soul
          as to the future. O that dark future! that future! The present may be
          well; but ah! the next wind may wither all the flowers, and where
          shall I be? Clutch thy gold, miser; for "riches make to themselves
          wings and fly away." Hug that babe to thy breast, mother; for the
          rough hand of death may rob thee of it. Look at thy fame and wonder at
          it, O thou man of ambition! But one slight report shall wound thee to
          the heart, and thou shalt sink as low as e'er thou hast been lifted
          high by the voices of the multitude. The future! All persons have need
          to dread the future, except the Christian. God giveth to his beloved
          sleep with regard to the events of coming time.
        </p>
        <p>What may be the future lot,</p>
        <p>High or low concerns me not;</p>
        <p>This doth set my heart at rest,</p>
        <p>What my God appoints is best.</p>
        <p>
          Whether I am to live or die is no matter to me; whether I am to be the
          "offscouring of all things," or "the man whom the king delighteth to
          honour," matters not to me. All is alike, provided my Father doth but
          give it. "So he giveth his beloved sleep." How many of you have
          arrived at that happy point that you have no wish of your own at all?
          It is a sweet thing to have but one wish; but it is a better thing to
          have no wish at all -- to be all lost in the present enjoyment of
          Christ and the future anticipation of the vision of his face. O my
          soul! what would the future be to thee, if thou hadst not Christ? If
          it be a bitter and a dark future, what matters it, so long as Christ
          thy Lord sanctifies it, and the Holy Ghost still gives thee courage,
          energy, and strength? It is a blessed thing to be able to say with
          Madame Guyon --
        </p>
        <p>To me tis equal, whether love ordained,</p>
        <p>My life or death, appoint me pain or ease;</p>
        <p>My soul perceives no real ill in pain,</p>
        <p>In ease or health, no real good she sees.</p>
        <p>One good she covets, and that good alone,</p>
        <p>To choose thy will, from selfish bias free,</p>
        <p>And to prefer a cottage to a throne,</p>
        <p>And grief to comfort, if it pleases thee.</p>
        <p>That we should bear the cross is thy command --</p>
        <p>Die to the world, and live to sin no more;</p>
        <p>Suffer unmoved beneath the rudest hand,</p>
        <p>As pleased when shipwrecked, as when safe on shore.</p>
        <p>
          It is a happy condition to attain. "So he giveth his beloved sleep."
          Ah! if you have a self-will in your hearts, pray to God to uproot it.
          Have you self-love? Beseech the Holy Spirit to turn it out; for if you
          will always will to do as God wills, you must be happy. I have heard
          of some good old woman in a cottage, who had nothing but a piece of
          bread and a little wafer, and lifting up her hands, she said, as a
          blessing, "What! all this, and Christ too?" It is "all this," compared
          with what we deserve. And I have read of some one dying, who was asked
          if he wished to live or die; and he said, "I have no wish at all about
          it." "But if you might wish, which would you choose?" "I would not
          choose at all." "But if God bade you choose?" "I would beg God to
          choose for me, for I should not know which to take." Happy state!
          happy state! to be perfectly acquiescent --
        </p>
        <p>To lie passive in his hand,</p>
        <p>And to know no will but his.</p>
        <p>"So he giveth his beloved sleep."</p>
        <p>
          V. In the fifth place: there is the sleep of security. Solomon slept
          with his armed men round his bed, and thus slumbered securely; but
          Solomon's father slept one night on the bare ground -- not in a palace
          -- with no moat round his castle wall, -- but he slept quite as safely
          as his son, for he said, "I laid me down and slept, and I awaked, for
          the Lord sustained me." Now, some persons never feel secure in this
          world at all; I query whether one half of my hearers feel themselves
          so. Suppose I burst out in a moment, and sing this --
        </p>
        <p>I to the end shall endure,</p>
        <p>As sure as the earnest is given;</p>
        <p>More happy, but not more secure,</p>
        <p>Are the glorified spirits in heaven.</p>
        <p>
          You would say, that is too high doctrine; and I would reply, very
          likely it is for you, but it is the truth of God, and it is sweet
          doctrine for me. I love to know, that if I am predestinated according
          to the foreknowledge of God the Father, I must be saved; if I was
          purchased by the Son's blood, I cannot be lost, for it would be
          impossible for Jesus Christ to lose one whom he has redeemed,
          otherwise he would be dissatisfied with his labours. I know that where
          he has begun the good work he will carry it on. I never fear that I
          shall fall away, or be lost; my only fear is, lest I should not have
          been right at first; but, provided I am right, if I be really a child
          of God, I might believe that the sun would be smitten with madness,
          and go reeling through the universe like a drunken man -- I might
          believe that the stars would urn form their courses, and instead of
          marching with their measured tramp, as now they do, whirl on in wild
          courses like the dance of Bacchanals -- I could even conceive that
          this great universe might all subside in God, "even as a moment's foam
          subsides again upon the wave that bears it;" but neither reason,
          heresy, logic, eloquence, nor a conclave of divines, shall make me pay
          a moment' attention to the vile suggestion that a child of God may
          ever perish. Hence I tread this earth with confidence. Arguing a
          little while ago with an Arminian, he said, "Sir, you ought to be a
          happy man; for if what you say be true, why you are as secure of being
          in heaven as if you were there." I said, "Yes, I know it." "Then you
          ought to live above cares and tribulations, and sing happily from
          morning to night." I said, "So I ought, and so I will, God helping
          me." This is security. "He giveth his beloved sleep." To know that if
          I died I should enter heaven -- to be as sure as I am of my own
          existence that God, having loved me with an everlasting love, and he
          being immutable, will never hate me if he has once loved me -- to know
          that I must enter the kingdom of glory -- is not this enough to make
          all burdens light, and give me the hind's feet wherewith I may stand
          upon my high places. Happy state of security! "So he giveth his
          beloved sleep."
        </p>
        <p>
          And there is a sleep, my dear friends, of security, which is enjoyed
          on earth even in the midst of the greatest troubles. Do you remember
          that passage in the book of Ezekiel, where it is said, "They shall
          dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods?" A queer
          place to sleep in! "In the woods." There is a wolf over yonder; there
          is a tiger in the jungle; and eagle is soaring in the air; a horde of
          robbers dwell in the dark forest. "Never mind," says the child of God:
        </p>
        <p>He that hath made his refuge God,</p>
        <p>Shall find a most secure abode;</p>
        <p>Shall walk all day beneath his shade,</p>
        <p>And there at night shall rest his head.</p>
        <p>
          I have often admired Martin Luther, and wondered at his composure.
          When all men spoke so ill of him, what did he say? Turn to that Psalm
          -- "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in time of
          trouble; therefore we will not fear, though the earth be removed, and
          though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea." In a far
          inferior manner, I have been called to stand up in the position of
          Martin Luther, and have been made the butt of slander, a mark for
          laughter and scorn; but it has not broken my spirit yet; not will it,
          while I am enabled to enjoy that quiescent state of -- "So he giveth
          his beloved sleep." But thus far I beg to inform all those who choose
          to slander or speak ill of me, that they are very welcome to do so
          till they are tired of it. my motto is cedo nulli -- I yield to none.
          I have not courted any man's love; I asked no man to attend my
          ministry; I preach what I like, and when I like, and as I like. Oh!
          happy state -- to be bold, though downcast, and distressed -- to go
          and bend my knee and tell my Father all, and then to come down from my
          chamber, and say --
        </p>
        <p>If on my face, for thy dear name,</p>
        <p>Shame and reproach shall be;</p>
        <p>I'll hail reproach, and welcome shame,</p>
        <p>For thou'lt remember me.</p>
        <p>
          VI. The last sleep God giveth his beloved is the sleep of a happy
          dismission. I have stood by the graves of many servants of the Lord. I
          have buried some of the excellent of the earth; and when I bid
          farewell to my brother down below there slumbering in his coffin, I
          usually commence my speech with those words, "So he giveth his beloved
          sleep." Dear servants of Jesus! There I see them! What can I say of
          them, but that "so he giveth his beloved sleep?" Oh! happy sleep! This
          world is a state of tossing to and fro; but in that grave they rest.
          No sorrows there; no sighs, no groans, to mingle with the songs that
          warble from immortal tongues. Well may I address the dead thus: -- "My
          brother, oftentimes hast thou fought the battles of this world; thou
          hast had thy cares, thy trials, and thy troubles; but now thou art
          gone -- not to worlds unknown, but to yonder land of light and glory.
          Sleep on, brother! Thy soul sleepeth not, for thou art in heaven; but
          thy body sleepeth. Death hath laid thee in thy last couch; it may be
          cold, but it is sanctified; it may be damp, but it is safe; and on the
          resurrection morning, when the archangel shall set his trumpet to his
          mouth, thou shalt rise. Blessed are they dead that die in the Lord:
          yea, saith the Spirit, for they rest from their labours, and their
          works do follow them.' Sleep on in thy grave, my brother, for thou
          shalt rise to glory." "So he giveth his beloved sleep."
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of you fear to die, and have good reason to do so, for death for
          you would be the beginning of sorrows; and on its approach ye might
          hear the voice of the angel of the Apocalypse: "One woe is past, but
          behold two woes more are to come." If, sirs, ye were to die
          unprepared, and unconverted, and unsaved, "There remaineth nothing but
          a fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation." I need not
          speak like a Boanerges, for it is to you a well known truth, that
          without God, without Christ, "strangers from the commonwealth of
          Israel," your portion must be amongst the damned -- the fiends -- the
          tortured -- the shrieking ghosts -- the wandering souls who find no
          rest --
        </p>
        <p>On waves of burning brimstone toss'd,</p>
        <p>For ever, O for ever lost!</p>
        <p>"The wrath to come!" "The wrath to come!" "The wrath to come!"</p>
        <p>
          But beloved Christian brother, wherefore dost thou fear to die? Come
          let me take thy hand:
        </p>
        <p>To you and me by grace tis given,</p>
        <p>To know the Saviour's precious name;</p>
        <p>And shortly we shall meet in heaven,</p>
        <p>Our end, our hope, our way the same.</p>
        <p>
          Do you know that heaven is just across that narrow stream? Are you
          afraid to plunge in and swim across? Do you fear to be drowned? I feel
          the bottom -- it is good. Dost thou think thou shalt sink? Hear the
          voice of the Spirit: "Fear not, I am with thee; be not dismayed, I am
          thy God: when thou passest through the river, I will be with thee, and
          the floods shall not overflow thee." Death is the gate of endless
          joys, and dost thou dread to enter there? What! fear to be emancipated
          from corruption? Oh! say not so! but rather, gladly lay down and sleep
          in Jesus, and be blessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have finished expounding my subject. There is only one question I
          want to ask of you before you pass out of those doors. Do you
          seriously and solemnly believe that you belong to the "beloved" here
          mentioned? I may be impertinent in asking such a question; I have been
          accused of that before now, but I have never denied it. I rather take
          the credit of it than not. But seriously and solemnly I ask you -- Do
          you know yourselves to be amongst the beloved? And if it happens that
          you want a test, allow me to give you three tests, very briefly, and I
          have done. It has been said that there are three kinds of preachers --
          doctrinal preachers, experimental preachers, and practical preachers.
          Now I think there are three things that make up a Christian -- true
          doctrine, real exzperience, and good practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, then, as to your doctrine. You may tell whether you are the
          Lord's beloved partly by that. Some think it matters not what a man
          believes. Excuse me: truth is alway precious, and the least atom of
          truth is worth searching out. Now- a-days the sects do not clash so
          much as they did. Perhaps that is good; but there is one evil about
          it. People do not read the Bibles so much as they did. They think we
          are all right. Now, I believe we may be all right in the main, but we
          cannot be all right where we contradict one another; and it becomes
          every man to search the Bible to see which is right. I am not afraid
          to submit my Calvinism, or my doctrine of believer's baptism, to the
          searching of the Bible. A learned lord, an infidel, once said to
          Whitfield, "Sir I am an infidel, I do not believe the Bible, but if
          the Bible be true, you are right, and your Arminian opponents are
          wrong. If the Bible be the Word of God, the doctrines of grace are
          true;" adding that if any man would grant him the Bible to be the
          truth, he would challenge him to disprove Calvinism. The doctrines of
          original sin, election, effectual calling, final perseverance, and all
          those great truths which are called Calvinism -- though Calvin was not
          the author of them, but simply an able writer and preacher upon the
          subject -- are, I believe, the essential doctrines of the Gospel that
          is in Jesus Christ. Now, I do not ask you whether you believe all this
          -- it is possible you may not; but I believe you will before you enter
          heaven. I am persuaded, that as God may have washed your hearts, he
          will wash your brains before you enter heaven. He will make you right
          in your doctrines. But I must enquire whether you read your Bibles. I
          am not finding fault with you this morning for differing from me, I
          may be wrong; but I want to know whether you search the Scriptures to
          find what is truth. And, if you are not a reader of the Bible, if you
          take doctrines second-hand, if you go to chapel, and say, "I do not
          like that:' what matters your not liking it, provided it is in the
          Bible? Is it Biblical truth, or is it not? If it is God's truth, let
          us have it exalted. It may not suit you; but let me remind you, that
          the truth that is in Jesus never was palatable to carnal men, and I
          believe never will be. The reason you love it not, is because it cuts
          too much at your pride; it lets you down too low. Search yourselves,
          then, in doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then take care that you remember the experimental test. I am afraid
          there is very little experimental religion amongst us; but where there
          is true doctrine, there ought always to be a vital experience. Sirs,
          try yourselves by the experimental test. Have you ever had an
          experience of your wretchedness, of your depravity, your inability,
          your death in sin? Have you ever felt life in Christ, an experience of
          the light of God's countenance, of wrestling with corruption? Have you
          had a grace-given Holy Ghost-implanted experience of a communion with
          Christ? If so, then you are right on the experimental test.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, to conclude, take care of the practical test. "Faith without
          works is dead, being alone." He that walketh in sin is a child of the
          devil; and he that walketh in righteousness is a child of light. Do
          not think, because you believe the right doctrines, therefore you are
          right. There are many that believe right, act wrong, and they perish.
          "Be not deceived; God is not mocked; whatsoever a man soweth that
          shall he also reap."
        </p>
        <p>
          I have done. Now let me beseech thee, you, by the frailty of your own
          lives -- by the shortness of time -- by the dreadful realities of
          eternity -- by the sins you have committed -- by the pardon that you
          need -- by the blood and wounds of Jesus -- by his second coming to
          judge the world in righteousness -- by the glories of heaven -- by the
          awful horrors of hell -- by time -- by eternity -- by all that is good
          -- by all that is sacred -- let me beg of you, as you love your own
          souls, to search and see whether ye are amongst the beloved, to whom
          he giveth sleep. God bless you.<br />
