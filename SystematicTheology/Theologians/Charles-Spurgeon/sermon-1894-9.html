          And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the
          voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments which
          I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on high
          above all the nations of the earth: and all these blessings shall come
          upon thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of
          the LORD thy God. Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt
          thou be in the field. Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the
          fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy
          kine, and the young of thy flock. Blessed shall be thy basket and thy
          kneadingtrough. Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed
          shalt thou be when thou goest out. The LORD shall cause thine enemies
          that rise up against thee to be smitten before thee: they shall come
          out against thee one way, and shall flee before thee seven ways. The
          LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy barns, and in all
          that thou puttest thine hand unto; and he shall bless thee in the land
          which the LORD thy God giveth thee. The LORD shall establish thee for
          an holy people unto himself, as he hath sworn unto thee; if thou shalt
          keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, and walk in his ways. And
          all the peoples of the earth shall see that thou art called by the
          name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee. And the LORD shall
          make thee plenteous for good, in the fruit of thy body, and in the
          fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which
          the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give thee. The LORD shall open unto
          thee his good treasury the heaven to give the rain of thy land in its
          season, and to bless all the work of thine hand: and thou shalt lend
          unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow. And the LORD shall make
          thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and
          thou shalt not be beneath; if thou shalt hearken unto the commandments
          of the LORD thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and to
          do them; and shalt not turn aside from any of the words which I
          command you this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after
          other gods to serve them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of
          the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his
          statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall
          come upon thee, and overtake thee. Cursed shalt thou be in the city,
          and cursed shalt thou be in the field. Cursed shall be thy basket and
          thy kneadingtrough. Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the
          fruit of thy ground, the increase of thy kine, and the young of thy
          flock. Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou
          be when thou goest out. The LORD shall send upon thee cursing,
          discomfiture, and rebuke, in all that thou puttest thine hand unto for
          to do, until thou be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because
          of the evil of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me. The LORD
          shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have consumed
          thee from off the land, whither thou goest in to possess it. The LORD
          shall smite thee with consumption, and with fever, and with
          inflammation, and with fiery heat, and with the sword, and with
          blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou
          perish. And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the
          earth that is under thee shall be iron. The LORD shall make the rain
          of thy land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon thee,
          until thou be destroyed. The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten
          before thine enemies: thou shalt go out one way against them, and
          shalt flee seven ways before them: and thou shalt be tossed to and fro
          among all the kingdoms of the earth. And thy carcase shall be meat
          unto all fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth, and there
          shall be none to fray them away. The LORD shall smite thee with the
          boil of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scurvy, and with the
          itch, whereof thou canst not be healed. The LORD shall smite thee with
          madness, and with blindness, and with astonishment of heart: and thou
          shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou
          shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and
          spoiled alway, and there shall be none to save thee. Thou shalt
          betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build
          an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a
          vineyard, and shalt not use the fruit thereof. Thine ox shall be slain
          before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof: thine ass shalt be
          violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not be restored
          to thee: thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt
          have none to save thee. Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto
          another people, and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for
          them all the day: and there shall be nought in the power of thine
          hand. The fruit of thy ground, and all thy labours, shall a nation
          which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and
          crushed alway: so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes
          which thou shalt see. The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in
          the legs, with a sore boil, whereof thou canst not be healed, from the
          sole of thy foot unto the crown of thy head. The LORD shall bring
          thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation which
          thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers; and there shalt thou serve
          other gods, wood and stone. And thou shalt become an astonishment, a
          proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples whither the LORD shall
          lead thee away. Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and
          shalt gather little in; for the locust shall consume it. Thou shalt
          plant vineyards and dress them, but thou shalt neither drink of the
          wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worm shall eat them. Thou shalt
          have olive trees throughout all thy borders, but thou shalt not anoint
          thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast its fruit. Thou shalt
          beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be thine; for they shall
          go into captivity. All thy trees and the fruit of thy ground shall the
          locust possess. The stranger that is in the midst of thee shall mount
          up above thee higher and higher; and thou shalt come down lower and
          lower. He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall
          be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.
        </p>
        <p>
          And all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and
          overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not
          unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his
          statutes which he commanded thee: and they shall be upon thee for a
          sign, and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever. Because thou
          servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of
          heart, by reason of the abundance of all things: therefore shalt thou
          serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger,
          and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he
          shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.
          The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of
          the earth, as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not
          understand; a nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the
          person of the old, nor shew favour to the young: and he shall eat the
          fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy ground, until thou be
          destroyed: which also shall not leave thee corn, wine, or oil, the
          increase of thy kine, or the young of thy flock, until he have caused
          thee to perish. And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy
          high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout
          all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout
          all thy land, which the LORD thy God hath given thee. And thou shalt
          eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy
          daughters which the LORD thy God hath given thee; in the siege and in
          the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall straiten thee. The man
          that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil
          toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the
          remnant of his children which he hath remaining: so that he will not
          give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat,
          because he hath nothing left him; in the siege and in the straitness,
          wherewith thine enemy shall straiten thee in all thy gates. The tender
          and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the
          sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her
          eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son,
          and toward her daughter; and toward her young one that cometh out from
          between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear; for
          she shall eat them for want of all things secretly: in the siege and
          in the straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall straiten thee in thy
          gates.

          If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are
          written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful
          name, THE LORD THY GOD; then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful,
          and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long
          continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance. And he will
          bring upon thee again all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast
          afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee. Also every sickness, and
          every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will
          the LORD bring upon thee until thou be destroyed. And ye shall be left
          few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude;
          because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God. And
          it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you
          good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to cause
          you to perish, and to destroy you; and ye shall be plucked from off
          the land whither thou goest in to possess it. And the LORD shall
          scatter thee among all peoples, from the one end of the earth even
          unto the other end of the earth; and there thou shalt serve other
          gods, which thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers, even wood and
          stone. And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, and there
          shall be no rest for the sole of thy foot: but the LORD shall give
          thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and pining of soul:
          and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear
          night and day, and shalt have none assurance of thy life: in the
          morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt
          say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart which thou
          shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see. And
          the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way
          whereof I said unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there
          ye shall sell yourselves unto your enemies for bondmen and for
          bondwomen: and no man shall buy you.
