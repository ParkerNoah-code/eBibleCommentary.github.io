          1. And inasmuch as the apostle has not pronounced against the very
          substance of flesh and blood, that it cannot inherit the kingdom of
          God, the same apostle has everywhere adopted the term "flesh and
          blood" with regard to the Lord Jesus Christ, partly indeed to
          establish His human nature (for He did Himself speak of Himself as the
          Son of man), and partly that He might confirm the salvation of our
          flesh. For if the flesh were not in a position to be saved, the Word
          of God would in no wise have become flesh. And if the blood of the
          righteous were not to be inquired after, the Lord would certainly not
          have had blood [in His composition]. But inasmuch as blood cries out
          (vocalis est) from the beginning [of the world], God said to Cain,
          when he had slain his brother, "The voice of thy brother's blood
          crieth to Me." And as their blood will be inquired after, He said to
          those with Noah, "For your blood of your souls will I require, [even]
          from the hand of all beasts;" and again, "Whosoever will shed man's
          blood, it shall be shed for his blood." In like manner, too, did the
          Lord say to those who should afterwards shed His blood, "All righteous
          blood shall be required which is shed upon the earth, from the blood
          of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias the son of Barachias, whom
          ye slew between the temple and the altar. Verily I say unto you, All
          these things shall come upon this generation." He thus points out the
          recapitulation that should take place in his own person of the
          effusion of blood from the beginning, of all the righteous men and of
          the prophets, and that by means of Himself there should be a
          requisition of their blood. Now this [blood] could not be required
          unless it also had the capability of being saved; nor would the Lord
          have summed up these things in Himself, unless He had Himself been
          made flesh and blood after the way of the original formation [of man],
          saving in his own person at the end that which had in the beginning
          perished in Adam.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But if the Lord became incarnate for any other order of things, and
          took flesh of any other substance, He has not then summed up human
          nature in His own person, nor in that case can He be termed flesh. For
          flesh has been truly made [to consist in] a transmission of that thing
          moulded originally from the dust. But if it had been necessary for Him
          to draw the material [of His body] from another substance, the Father
          would at the beginning have moulded the material [of flesh] from a
          different substance [than from what He actually did]. But now the case
          stands thus, that the Word has saved that which really was [created,
          viz.,] humanity which had perished, effecting by means of Himself that
          communion which should be held with it, and seeking out its salvation.
          But the thing which had perished possessed flesh and blood. For the
          Lord, taking dust from the earth, moulded man; and it was upon his
          behalf that all the dispensation of the Lord's advent took place. He
          had Himself, therefore, flesh and blood, recapitulating in Himself not
          a certain other, but that original handiwork of the Father, seeking
          out that thing which had perished. And for this cause the apostle, in
          the Epistle to the Colossians, says, "And though ye were formerly
          alienated, and enemies to His knowledge by evil works, yet now ye have
          been reconciled in the body of His flesh, through His death, to
          present yourselves holy and chaste, and without fault in His sight."
          He says, "Ye have been reconciled in the body of His flesh," because
          the righteous flesh has reconciled that flesh which was being kept
          under bondage in sin, and brought it into friendship with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If, then, any one allege that in this respect the flesh of the Lord
          was different from ours, because it indeed did not commit sin, neither
          was deceit found in His soul, while we, on the other hand, are
          sinners, he says what is the fact. But if he pretends that the, Lord
          possessed another substance of flesh, the sayings respecting
          reconciliation will not agree with that man. For that thing is
          reconciled which had formerly been in enmity. Now, if the Lord had
          taken flesh from another substance, He would not, by so doing, have
          reconciled that one to God which had become inimical through
          transgression. But now, by means of communion with Himself, the Lord
          has reconciled man to God the Father, in reconciling us to Himself by
          the body of His own flesh, and redeeming us by His own blood, as the
          apostle says to the Ephesians, "In whom we have redemption through His
          blood, the remission of sins;" and again to the same he says, "Ye who
          formerly were far off have been brought near in the blood of Christ;"
          and again, "Abolishing in His flesh the enmities, [even] the law of
          commandments [contained] in ordinances." And in every Epistle the
          apostle plainly testifies, that through the flesh of our Lord, and
          through His blood, we have been saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. If, therefore, flesh and blood are the things which procure for us
          life, it has not been declared of flesh and blood, in the literal
          meaning (proprie) of the terms, that they cannot inherit the kingdom
          of God; but [these words apply] to those carnal deeds already
          mentioned, which, perverting man to sin, deprive him of life. And for
          this reason he says, in the Epistle to the Romans: "Let not sin,
          therefore, reign in your mortal body, to be under its control: neither
          yield ye your members instruments of unrighteousness unto sin; but
          yield yourselves to God, as being alive from the dead, and your
          members as instruments of righteousness unto God." In these same
          members, therefore, in which we used to serve sin, and bring forth
          fruit unto death, does He wish us to [be obedient] unto righteousness,
          that we may bring forth fruit unto life. Remember, therefore, my
          beloved friend, that thou hast been redeemed by the flesh of our Lord,
          re-established by His blood; and "holding the Head, from which the
          whole body of the Church, having been fitted together, takes increase"
          -- that is, acknowledging the advent in the flesh of the Son of God,
          and [His] divinity (deum), and looking forward with constancy to His
          human nature (hominem), availing thyself also of these proofs drawn
          from Scripture -- thou dost easily overthrow, as I have pointed out,
          all those notions of the heretics which were concocted afterwards.
