          15. The voice of shouting and salvation is in the tabernacles of the
          just: the right hand of Jehovah hath done valiantly.16. The right hand
          of Jehovah is exalted, the right hand of Jehovah hath done
          valiantly.17. I shall not die, yea, I shall live, and speak of the
          works of God.18. God chastising has chastised me; but he did not
          deliver me unto death.19. Open to me the gates of righteousness; and
          having entered into them, I will praise God.20. This is the gate of
          Jehovah, the just shall enter into it.21. I will praise thee, because
          thou hast heard me, and hast been my salvation.

          15. The voice of shouting and salvation is in the tabernacles of the
          just. He affirms that the kindness which God had conferred upon him
          was so extensive, that it would not do to render thanks to him
          privately. In the benefits which he had received, God's power appeared
          both remarkable and memorable, and the fruit of it also was extended
          to the whole Church. Therefore, as David's deliverance was wonderful
          and advantageous generally to all the godly, he promises that he would
          make a public thanksgiving; and invites them to join him in this holy
          exercise. By this circumstance, he chiefly aims at magnifying the
          grace of God, and also by its effects to demonstrate, that not merely
          his individual preservation, but that of the whole Church, in his
          person, was accomplished. Intercommunion among believers does, indeed,
          bind them alternately to render thanks to God for each other; in
          David's case, there was the specific reason which I have mentioned,
          his wonderful preservation from many deaths, and his having assigned
          to him the sovereignty of God's chosen people. It is worthy of notice,
          that he combines the voice of joy and gladness with the praise of God,
          by which he shows that believers ought to mingle with their mirth a
          sense of the grace of God. To do valiantly, is tantamount to a
          magnificent display of his power, so that there may be a bright
          manifestation of its effulgence. God ofttimes secretly, and when
          apparently feeble, grants deliverance to his faithful people, that
          they may be sensible that it comes from him; but this is not so well
          known to others. Here, however, David asserts that the operation of
          God was so plainly developed, no one could doubt whence his safety
          came. The other phrase, that the right hand of God was exalted, refers
          to the same subject, because, by working powerfully and unwontedly,
          God had exalted his hand.
        </p>

          17. I shall not die David speaks like one emerging from the sepulcher.
          The very same person who says, I shall not die, acknowledges that he
          was rescued from death, to which he was near as one condemned to it.
          For a series of years his life was in imminent danger, exposed every
          moment to a thousand deaths, and no sooner was he delivered from one
          than he entered into another. Thus he declares that he would not die,
          because he regained life, all hope of which he had entirely abandoned.
          We, whose life is hid with Christ in God, ought to mediate upon this
          song all our days, Colossians 3:3. If we occasionally enjoy some
          relaxation, we are bound to unite with David in saying, that we who
          were surrounded with death are risen to newness of life. In the
          meantime, we must constantly persevere through the midst of darkness:
          as our safety lies in hope, it is impossible that it can be very
          visible to us. In the second member of the verse, he points out the
          proper use of life. God does not prolong the lives of his people, that
          they may pamper themselves with meat and drink, sleep as much as they
          please, and enjoy every temporal blessing, but to magnify him for his
          benefits which he is daily heaping upon them. Of this subject we have
          spoken on Psalm 115
        </p>
        <p>
          18. In chastising God has chastised me. In these words David owns that
          his enemies assailed him unjustly, that they were employed by God to
          correct him, that this was fatherly chastisement, God not inflicting a
          deadly wound, but correcting him in measure and in mercy. He seems to
          anticipate the perverse decisions of perverse men which grievously
          pressed upon him, as if all the ills which he had endured were so many
          evidences of his being cast off by God. These calumnies which the
          reprobate cast upon him he applies very differently, by declaring that
          his correction was mild and paternal. The main thing in adversity is
          to know that we are laid low by the hand of God, and that this is the
          way which he takes to prove our allegiance, to arouse us from our
          torpidity, to crucify our old man, to purge us from our filthiness, to
          bring us into submission and subjection to God, and to excite us to
          meditate on the heavenly life.
        </p>
        <p>
          If these things were recollected by us, there is not one of us who
          would not shudder at the thought of fretting against God, but would
          much rather yield submission to him with a mild and meek spirit. Our
          champing the bit, and rushing forward impatiently, certainly proceeds
          from the majority of men not looking upon their afflictions as God's
          rods, and from others not participating in his paternal care. The last
          clause of the verse, therefore, merits particular attention, That God
          always deals mercifully with his own people, so that his correction
          proves their cure. Not that his paternal regard is always visible, but
          that in the end it will be shown that his chastisements, so far from
          being deadly, serve the purpose of a medicine, which, though it
          produce a temporary debility, rids us of our malady, and renders us
          healthy and vigorous.

          19 Open unto me the gates of righteousness Under the influence of
          ardent zeal, David here sets himself to testify his gratitude,
          commanding the temple to be opened to him, as if the oblations were
          all already prepared. He now confirms what he said formerly, That he
          would render thanks to God publicly in the properly constituted
          assembly of the faithful. It was the practice of the priests to open
          the doors of the temple to the people; it appears, however, that David
          here alludes to his long exile, which supposition is corroborated by
          the following verse. Having been for a long period prevented from
          having access to the sanctuary, and even from coming within sight of
          it, he now rejoices and exults at being again admitted to offer
          sacrifice unto God. And he declares that he will not approach as the
          hypocrites were wont to do, whom God, by the prophet Isaiah,
          reproaches with treading his courts in vain, but that he will come
          with the sacrifice of praise, (Isaiah 1:12) Fully persuaded that he
          drew near in the spirit of genuine devotion, he says it is proper that
          the doors of the temple, which lately he durst not enter, should be
          opened to him and such as he. It is, says he, the gate of Jehovah,
          and, therefore, he will open it for the just. The meaning is, that
          banished as David had been from the temple and from his country, now
          that the kingdom is in a better condition, both he and all the true
          worshippers of God regained their right to approach his sanctuary.
          Thus he indirectly mourns over the profanation of the temple, in that,
          while under the tyranny of Saul, it was occupied by the profane
          contemners of God, as if it had been a kennel for dogs and other
          unclean animals. This abomination, the temple being for a long time a
          den of thieves, is here inveighed against; but now that it is patent
          to the righteous, he declares it to be God's holy house. What occurred
          in the days of Saul is visible in these days, God's bitter enemies
          most wickedly and shamefully occupying his sanctuary. The Pope would
          not be Antichrist if he did not sit in the temple of God, (2
          Thessalonians 2:4). Having, by his vile pollutions, converted all
          temples into brothels, let us endeavor as much as we can to purge
          them, and prepare them for the pure worship of God. And as it has
          pleased Him to choose his holy habitation among us, let us exert
          ourselves to remove all the defilements and abominations which
          disfigure the purity of the Church. David then relates briefly the
          reason of his offering the sacrifice of praise to God, namely, that he
          had been preserved by his grace.<br />
