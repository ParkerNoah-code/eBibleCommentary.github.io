          "O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for
          thine own sake, O my God; for thy city and thy people are called by
          thy name." -- Daniel 9:19.
        </p>
        <p>
          DANIEL was a man in very high position in life. It is true he was not
          living in his own native land, but, in the providence of God, he had
          been raised to great eminence under the dominion of the country in
          which he dwelt. He might, therefore, naturally have forgotten his poor
          kinsmen; many have done so. Alas! we have known some that have even
          forgotten their poor fellow Christians when they have grown in grace,
          and have thought themselves too good to worship with the poorer sort
          when they themselves have grown rich in this world's goods. But it was
          not so with Daniel. Though he had been made a president of the empire,
          yet he was still a Jew; he felt himself still one with the seed of
          Israel. In all the afflictions of his people he was afflicted, and he
          felt it his honour to be numbered with them, and his duty and his
          privilege to share with them all the bitterness of their lot. If he
          could not become despised and as poor as they, if God's providence had
          made him to be distinguished, yet his heart would make no distinction:
          he would remember them and pray for them, and would plead that their
          desolation might yet be removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel was also a man very high in spiritual things. Is he not one of
          God's three mighties in the Old Testament? He is mentioned with two
          others in a celebrated verse as being one of three whose intercessions
          God would have heard if he had heard any intercessions. But though
          thus full of grace himself (and for that very reason) he stooped to
          those who were in a low state. Rejoicing as he did before God as to
          his own lot, he sorrowed and cried by reason of those from whom joy
          was banished. It is a sad fault with those Christians who think
          themselves full of grace, when they begin to despise their fellows.
          They may rest assured they are greatly mistaken in the estimate they
          have formed of themselves. But it is a good sign when thine own heart
          is fruitful and healthy before God, when thou dost condescend to those
          that backslide, and search after such as are weak, and bring again
          such as were driven away. When thou hast, like thy Master, a tender
          sympathy for others, then art thou rich in divine things. Daniel
          showed his intimate sympathy with his poorer and less gracious
          brethren in the way of prayer. He would have shown that sympathy in
          other ways had occasions occurred, and no doubt he did; but this time
          the most fitting way of proving his oneness with them was in becoming
          an intercessor for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          My object here and now will be to stir up the people of God, and
          especially the members of this church, to abound exceedingly in
          prayer; more and more to plead with God for the prosperity of his
          Church, and the extension of the Redeemer's kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, our text gives us a model of prayer; and secondly, it and its
          surroundings give us encouragement for prayer. First, then, our text
          gives us: --
        </p>
        <p>I. A MODEL OF PRAYER.</p>
        <p>
          I think I may notice this first as to the antecedents of the prayer.
          This prayer of Daniel was not offered without consideration. He did
          not come to pray as some people do, as though it were a thing that
          required no forethought whatever. We are constantly told we ought to
          prepare our sermons, and I surely think that if a man does not prepare
          his sermons he is very blameworthy. But are we never to prepare when
          we speak to God, and only when we speak to man? Is there to be no
          preparation of the heart of man from God when we open our mouth before
          the Lord? Do not you think we often do, both in private and public,
          begin to pray without any kind of consideration, and the words come,
          and then we try to quicken the words rather than the desires coming,
          and the words coming like garments to clothe them withal?
        </p>
        <p>
          But Daniel's considerations lay in this first, he studied the books.
          He had with him an old manuscript of the prophet Jeremiah. He read
          that through. Perceiving such and such things spoken of, he prayed for
          them. Perceiving such and such a time given, and knowing that that
          time was almost come, he prayed the more earnestly! Oh! that you
          studied your Bibles more! Oh! that we all did! How we could plead the
          promises! How we could plead the promises! How often we should prevail
          with God when we could hold him to his word, and say, "Fulfil this
          word unto thy servant, whereon thou hast caused me to hope." Oh! it is
          grand praying when our mouth is full of God's word, for there is no
          word that can prevail with him like his own. You tell a man, when you
          ask him for such and such a thing, "You yourself said you would do so
          and so." You have him then. And so when you can lay hold on the
          covenant angel with this consecrated grip, "Thou hast said! thou hast
          said!" then have you every opportunity of prevailing with him. May our
          prayers then spring out of our scriptural studies; may our
          acquaintance with the Word be such that we shall be qualified to pray
          a Daniel prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had, moreover, it is clear if you read the prayer again, studied
          the history of his people. He gives a little outline of it from the
          day in which they came out of Egypt. Christian people should be
          acquainted with the history of the Church -- if not with the Church of
          the past, certainly with the Church of today. We make ourselves
          acquainted with the position of the Prussian army, and we will buy new
          maps about once a week to see all the places and the towns. Should not
          Christians make themselves acquainted with the position of Christ's
          army, and revise their maps to see how the kingdom of God is
          progressing in England, in the United States, on the Continent, or in
          the mission stations throughout the world? All our prayers would be
          much better if we knew more about the Church, and especially about our
          own Church. I am afraid I must say it -- I am afraid there are some
          members of the Church that do not know what is doing -- hardly know
          what is meant by some of our enterprises. Brethren, know well the
          Church's needs as far as you can ascertain them; and then, like
          Daniel, your prayer will be a prayer founded upon information; and
          with the promises of God and the fact of the Church's wants, you will
          pray prayers of the spirit, and of the understanding. Let that stand
          for earnest consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          But next, Daniel's prayer was mingled with much humiliation. According
          to the Oriental custom which expresses the inward thought and feeling
          by the outward act, he put on a coarse garment made of hair, black,
          called sackcloth; and then taking handfuls of ashes, he cast them on
          his head and over the cloth that covered him, and then he knelt down
          in the very dust in secret, and these outward symbols were made to
          express the humiliation which he felt before God. We always pray best
          when we pray out of the depths; when the soul gets low enough she gets
          a leverage; she can then plead with God. I do not say we ought to ask
          to see all the evil of our own hearts. One good man prayed that prayer
          very often. He is mentioned in some of the Puritan writers -- a
          minister of the gospel. It pleased God to hear his prayer, and he
          never rejoiced afterwards. It was with great difficulty that he was
          even kept from suicide, so deep and dreadful was the agony he
          experienced when he did begin to see his sin as he wanted to see it.
          It is best to see as much of that as God would have us see of it. You
          cannot see too much of Christ, but you might see even too much of your
          sin. Yet, brethren, this is rarely the case. We need to see much our
          deep needs, our great sins, for ah! that prayer shall go highest that
          comes from the lowest. To stoop well is a grand art in prayer. To pour
          out the last drop of anything like self-righteousness; to be able to
          say from the very heart, "Not for our righteousness' sake do we plead
          with thee, O God, for we have sinned, and our fathers too." Put the
          negative, the weightiest negative, upon any idea of pleading human
          merit. When thou canst do this, then art thou in the right way to pray
          a prayer that will move the arm of God, and bring thee down a
          blessing. Oh! some of you ungodly ones have tried to pray, but you
          have not bowed yourselves. Proud prayers may knock their heads on
          mercy's lintel, but they can never pass through the portal. You cannot
          expect anything of God unless you put yourself in the right place,
          that is, as a beggar at his footstool; then will he hear you, and not
          until then.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel's prayer instructs us in the next point. It was excited by zeal
          for God's glory. We may sometimes pray with wrong motives. If I seek
          the conversion of souls in my ministry, is not that a good motive?
          Yes, it is; but suppose I desire the conversion of souls in order that
          people may say, "What a useful minister he is," that is a bad motive,
          which spoils it all. If I am a member of a Christian Church, and I
          pray for its prosperity, is not that right? Certainly; but if I desire
          its prosperity merely that I and others may be able to say, "See our
          zeal for the Lord! See how God blesses us rather than others!" that is
          a wrong motive. The motive is this, "Oh! that God could be glorified,
          that Jesus might see the reward of his sufferings! Oh! that sinners
          might be saved, so that God might have new tongues to praise him, new
          hearts to love him! Oh! that sin were put an end to, that the
          holiness, righteousness, mercy, and power of God might be magnified!"
          This is the way to pray; when thy prayers seek God's glory, it is
          God's glory to answer thy prayers. When thou art sure that God is in
          the case, thou art on a good footing. If thou art praying for that
          which will greatly glorify him, thou mayest rest assured thy prayer
          will speed. But if it do not speed, and it be not for his glory, why,
          then thou mayest be better content to be without it than with it. So
          pray thou,but keep thy bowstring right; it will be unfit to shoot the
          arrow of prayer unless this be thy bowstring, "God's glory, God's
          glory" -- this above all; first, last, and midst; the one object of my
          prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then coming closer to the prayer, I would have you notice how intense
          Daniel's prayer was. "O Lord, hear: O Lord, forgive: O Lord, hearken
          and do, defer not for thine own sake." The very repetitions here
          express vehemence. It is a great fault of some people in public prayer
          when they repeat the name, "O Lord, O Lord, O Lord," so often -- it
          often amounts to taking God's name in vain, and is, indeed, a vain
          repetition. But when the reiteration of that sacred name comes out of
          the soul, then it is no vain repetition; then it cannot be repeated
          too often, and is not open to anything like the criticism which I used
          just now. So you will notice how the prophet here seems to pour out
          his soul with "O Lord, O Lord, O Lord," as if, if the first knock at
          mercy's door does not open it, he will knock again, and make the gate
          to shake, and then the third time come with another thundering stroke
          if, perhaps, he may succeed. Cold prayers ask God to deny them: only
          importunate prayers will be replied to. When the Church of God cannot
          take "No" for an answer, she shall not have "No" for an answer. When a
          pleading soul must have it; when the Spirit of God works mightily in
          him so that he cannot let the angel go without a blessing, the angel
          shall not go till he has given the blessing to such a pleading one.
          Brethren, if there be only one among us that can pray as Daniel did,
          with intensity, the blessing will come. Let this encourage any earnest
          man or woman here that fears that others are not excited to prayer as
          they should be. Dear brother, do you undertake it? Dear sister, in
          God's name, do you undertake it? and God will send a blessing to many
          through the prayer of one. But how much better would it be if many a
          score of men here, ay, the entire Church of God, were stirred up to
          this, that we give him no rest until he establish and make Jerusalem a
          praise in the earth! Oh! that our prayers could get beyond praying,
          till they got to agonizing. As soon as Zion travailed -- you know that
          word -- as soon as she travailed she brought forth children. Not till
          it comes to travail -- not till then -- may we expect to see much
          done. God send us such travailing to each one of us, and then the
          promise is near to fulfilling.
        </p>
        <p>
          But coming still to the text, and a little more closely, I want to
          observe that this remarkable prayer was a prayer of understanding as
          well as earnestness; for some people in their earnestness talk
          nonsense, and I think I have heard prayers which God might understand,
          but I am sure I did not. Now here is a prayer which we can understand
          as well as God. It begins thus, "O Lord, hear." He asks an audience.
          This is how the petitioner does if he comes before an earthly majesty:
          he asks to be heard. He begins with that, "O Lord, hear. I am not
          worthy to be heard: if thou shut me and my case out of hearing, it
          will be just." He asks an audience: he gets it, and now he goes at
          once to his point without delay, "O Lord, forgive." He knows what he
          wants. Sin was the mischief, the cause of all the suffering: he puts
          his hand on it. Oh! it is grand when one knows what one is praying
          for. Many prayers maunder and wander -- the praying person evidently
          thinks he is doing a good thing in saying certain good phrases, but
          the prayer that hits the target in the centre is the prayer it is good
          to pray. God teach us to pray so. "O Lord, forgive."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then observe how he presses the point home. "O Lord, hearken and do."
          If thou hast forgiven -- he does not stop a minute, but here comes
          another prayer quick on the heels of it. Do, good Lord, interpose for
          the rebuilding of Jerusalem -- do interpose for the redemption of thy
          captive people; do interpose for the re-establishment of sacred
          worship. It is well when our prayers can fly fast, one after another,
          as we feel we are gaining ground. You know in wrestling (and that is a
          model of prayer) much depends on the foothold, but oftentimes there is
          much depending upon swiftness and celerity of action. So in prayer.
          "Hear, me, my Lord! Thou hast heard me, forgive me. Have I come so
          far, then work for me -- work the blessings I want." Follow up your
          advantage; build another prayer on the answer that you have. If you
          have received a great blessing, say, "Because he hath inclined his ear
          unto me, therefore will I call upon him; because he has heard me once,
          therefore will I call again." Such a prayer proves the thoughtfulness
          of him who prays. It is a prayer offered in the spirit, and with
          understanding also.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now one other thing. The prayer of Daniel was a prayer of holy
          nearness. You catch that thought in the expression, "O my God." Ah! we
          pray at a distance oftentimes: we pray to God as if we were slaves
          lying at his throne-foot; as if we might, perhaps, be heard, but we
          did not know. But when God helps us to pray as we should we come right
          to him, even to his feet, and we say, "Hear me, O my God." He is God;
          therefore, we must be reverent. He is my God; therefore, we may be
          familiar; we may come close to him. I believe some of the expressions
          that Martin Luther used in prayer, if I were to use them, would be
          little short of blasphemy, but as Martin Luther used them I believe
          they were deeply devout and acceptable with God, because he knew how
          to come close to God. You know how your little child climbs your knee:
          he gives you a kiss, and he will say to you many little things that if
          a person in the market were to say, you could not bear; they must not
          be said. No other being may be so familiar with you as your child. But
          oh! a child of God -- when his heart is right -- how near he gets to
          his God; he pours out his childlike complaint in childlike language
          before the Most High. Brethren, this is to be noted well, that though
          he is thus pleading and in the position of humility, yet still not in
          the position of slavery. It is still "O my God" -- he grasps the
          covenant: faith perceives the relationship to be unbroken between the
          soul and God, and pleads that relation. "O my God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the last thing I shall call your attention to in this model prayer
          is this, that the prophet uses argument. Praying ought always to be
          made up of arguing. "Bring forth your strong reasons" is a good canon
          for a prevalent prayer. We should urge matters with God, and bring
          reasons before him -- not because he wants reasons, but he desires us
          to know why we desire the blessing. In this text we have a reason
          given, first -- "Defer not for thine own sake," as much as if he had
          said, "If thou suffer this people of thine to perish, all the world
          will revile thy name; thine honour will be stained. This is thine own
          people, and because they are thy property, suffer not thine own estate
          to be endamaged, but save Jerusalem for thine own sake."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then next, he puts it on the same footing in another shape, "For thy
          city and thy people"; he urges that this people were not like other
          people. They had sinned truly, but still there was a relationship
          between them and God that existed between God and no other people. He
          pleads the covenant, in fact, between Abraham and Abraham's seed and
          the God of the whole earth. Good pleading that! And then he puts in
          next, "For they are called by thy name." They were said to be
          Jehovah's people; they were named by the name of the God of Israel. "O
          God! let not a thing that bears thy name be trundled about like a
          common thing. Suffer it not to be trailed in the dust; come to the
          rescue of it. Thy stamp, thy seal is upon Israel. Israel belongs to
          thee; therefore, come and interpose." Now from this I gather that if
          we would prevail we should plead arguments with God, and these are
          very many; and discreet minds when they are fervent will readily know
          how far to go in pleading, and where to stop. I remember one morning a
          dear brother now present praying in a way that seemed to me to be very
          prevalent when he spoke thus, "O Lord, thou hast been pleased to call
          thy Church thy Bride; now we, being evil, have such love towards our
          spouse that if there were anything in the world that would be for her
          good, we would not spare to give it to her; and wilt thou not, O
          Husband of the Church, do the like with thy spouse, and let thy Church
          receive a blessing now that she pleads for it?" It seemed good
          arguing, after Christ's own sort, "If ye, being evil, know how to give
          good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Heavenly
          Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him!" Get a promise, and
          spread it before the Lord, and say, "O Lord, thou hast said it; do
          it." God loves to be believed in. He loves you to think he means what
          he says. He is a practical God himself. His word has power in it, and
          he does not like us to treat his promises as some of us do, as if they
          were waste paper, as if they were things to be read for the
          encouragement of our enthusiasm, but not to be used as matters of real
          practical truth. Oh! plead them with God: fill your mouths with
          reasonings, and come before him. Make this your determination, that as
          a Church, seeing we need his Spirit, and need renewed prosperity, we
          will not spare nor leave a single argument unused by which we may
          prevail with the God of mercy to send us what we want. Thus much then
          upon this as a model of prayer. Now I shall want a little longer time
          to speak upon: --

          II. THE ENCOURAGEMENT WHICH THE TEXT AND ITS SURROUNDINGS GIVE TO US
          IN PRAYER.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, it is always an encouragement to do a thing when you see the
          best of men doing it. Many a person has taken a medicine only because
          he has known wiser men than himself take it. The best and wisest of
          persons in all ages have adopted the custom of prayer in times of
          distress, and, indeed, in all times. That ought to encourage us to do
          the same. I heard a dear Welsh brother speak last Thursday evening,
          who interested and amused me too, but I cannot profess to repeat the
          way in which he told us a Biblical story. It was something in this
          way. He told it as a Welshman, and not quite as I think I might. He
          said that after the Lord Jesus Christ had gone up to heaven, having
          told his disciples to wait at Jerusalem until the Spirit of God was
          given, Peter might have said, "Well, now we must not go out preaching
          till this blessing comes, so I shall be off a-fishing." And John might
          have said, "Well, there is the old boat over at the lake of
          Gennesaret; I think I shall go and see how that is getting on; it is a
          long time since I saw after it." And each one might have said, "Well,
          I shall go about my business, for it is not many days hence when it is
          coming, and we may as well be at our earthly calling." "No," saith he,
          "they did not say that at all, but Peter said, 'Where shall we hold a
          prayer meeting?' and Mary said she had got a nice large room that
          would do for a prayer meeting. True it was in a back street, and the
          house was not very respectable, and, 'Besides,' says she, 'it is up at
          the very top of the house, but it is a big room.' 'Never mind,' says
          Peter, 'it will be nearer to heaven.' So they went into the upper
          room, and there began to pray, and did not cease the prayer meeting
          till the blessing came." Then the brother told us the next story of a
          prayer meeting in the Bible. Peter was in prison, and Herod was so
          afraid that he would get out again that he had sixteen policemen to
          look after him, and the brethren knew they could not get Peter out in
          any other way than one; so they said, "We will hold a prayer meeting."
          Always the way with the Church at that time, when anything was amiss,
          to say, "Where shall we have a prayer meeting?" So Mistress Mark said
          she had got a good room which would do very well for a prayer meeting.
          It was in a back street, so nobody would know of it, and they would be
          quiet. So they held that prayer meeting, and began to pray. I do not
          suppose they prayed the Lord to knock the prison walls down, nor to
          kill the policemen, nor anything of that kind, but they only prayed
          that Peter might get out, and they left how he was to get out to God.
          While they were praying there came a knock at the door. "Ah!" said
          they, "that is a policeman come after another of us. But Rhoda went to
          the door to look, and when she looked she started back in affright.
          What could she see? She looked again, however, and she was persuaded
          that it was no other than Peter. She went back to her mistress, and
          said, "There is Peter at the gate." Good souls! they had been praying
          that Peter might come out, but they could not believe it, and they
          said, "Why, it is his spirit -- his angel." "No," said the girl, "I
          know Peter well enough; he has been here dozens of times, and I know
          it is Peter"; and in came Peter, and they all wondered at their
          unbelief. They had asked God to set Peter free, and free Peter was. It
          was the prayer meeting that did it. And rest assured we should,
          everyone, find it our best resource in every hour of need to draw near
          to God.
        </p>
        <p>Prayer makes the darkest cloud withdraw,</p>
        <p>Prayer mounts the ladder Jacob saw,</p>
        <p>Gives exercise to faith and love,</p>
        <p>Brings every blessing from above.</p>
        <p>Restraining prayer, we cease to fight;</p>
        <p>Prayer makes the Christian armour bright;</p>
        <p>And Satan trembles when he sees</p>
        <p>The weakest saint upon his knees.</p>
        <p>
          It is prayer that does it, and this fact should encourage us to pray.
        </p>
        <p>
          The success of Daniel's prayer is the next encouragement. He had not
          got to the end of his prayer before a soft hand touched him, and he
          looked up, and there stood Gabriel in the form of a man. That was
          quick work surely. So Daniel thought, but it was much quicker than
          Daniel expected, for as soon as ever he began to pray, the word went
          forth for the angel to descend. The answer to prayer is the most rapid
          thing in the world. "Before they call I will answer, and while they
          are yet speaking I will hear." I believe electricity travels at the
          rate of two hundred thousand miles in a second -- so it is estimated;
          but prayer travels faster than that, for it is, "Before they call I
          will answer." There is no time occupied at all. When God wills to
          answer, the answer may come as soon as the desire is given. And if it
          delay, it is only that it may come at a better time -- like some ships
          that come home more slowly because they bring the heavier cargo.
          Delayed prayers are prayers that are put out to interest awhile, to
          come home, not only with the capital, but with the compound interest
          too. Oh! prayer cannot fail -- prayer cannot fail. Heaven may as soon
          fall as prayer fail. God may sooner change the ordinances of day and
          night, than he can cease to reply to the faithful, believing
          spirit-wrought prayer of his own quickened, earnest, importunate
          people. Therefore, because he sends success, brethren, pray much.
        </p>
        <p>
          It ought to encourage us, too, in the next place, to recollect that
          Daniel prayed for a very hard case. Jerusalem was in ruins; the Jews
          were scattered; their sins were excessive; but, nevertheless, he
          prayed, and God heard him. We are not in so bad a case as that with
          the Church; we have not to mourn that God has departed from us; our
          prayer is that he may not, even in any measure, withdraw his hand. I
          do pray God that I may long be buried ere he shall suffer this Church
          to lose his presence. There is nothing that I know of in connection
          with our church life that is worth a single farthing, if the Spirit of
          God be gone. He must be there. Brethren, if you are not prayerful, if
          you are not holy, if you are not earnest, God does not keep priests,
          deacons, elders, and church members living near to him. The sorrow of
          heart which one will feel if one be kept right himself cannot be
          expressed. May the Lord prevent our declining. If you are declining,
          may he bring you back. Some of you, I am afraid, are so -- getting
          cold. Now and then I hear of a person who finds it too far to come to
          the Tabernacle. It used to be very short one time, though it was four
          or five miles. But when the heart gets cold, the road gets long. Ah!
          there are some who want this little attention and the other. Time was
          when they stood in the aisle, in the coldest and draughtiest place --
          if the word was blessed to them, they would not have minded it. May
          God grant that you may be a living people always, for years and years
          to come, until Christ himself comes. But oh! you that are living near
          to God, make this your daily, hourly, nightly prayer, that he would
          not withdraw from us for our sins, but continue to stretch out his
          hand in lovingkindness, even until he gathers us to our Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          It ought, further, to encourage us in prayer to remember that Daniel
          was only one man, and yet he won his suit. But if two of you agree as
          touching any one thing, it shall be done -- but a threefold cord -- a
          fifty-fold cord -- oh! if, out of our four thousand members, every one
          prayed instantly, day and night, for the blessing, oh! what prevalence
          there must be! Would God it were so!
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, how about your private prayers: are they what they should
          be? Those morning prayers, those evening prayers, and that midday
          prayer (for surely your soul must go up to heaven, even if your knees
          are not bent) -- are those prayers as they should be? It will bring
          leanness upon you; there cannot be fat soul and neglected prayer.
          There must be much praying if there be much rejoicing in the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then your family prayers: do you keep them up? I was in a railway
          carriage the other day, and a gentleman said to me, who was sitting
          beside me, "My son is going to be married tomorrow -- going to be
          married to one of your members." "I am glad to hear it," I said. "I
          hope he is a believer." "Oh! yes, sir; he has been a member of your
          church for some years. I wish you would write me something to give
          them tomorrow." Well, you know how the carriage will shake, but I
          managed to jot down something on a little bit of paper with a pencil.
          The words, I think, that I put were something like this, "I wish you
          every joy. May your joys be doubled; may your sorrows be divided and
          lightened." But then I put, "Build the altar before you build the
          tent. Take care that daily prayer begins your matrimonial life." I am
          sure we cannot expect our children to grow up a godly seed if there is
          no family prayer. Are your family prayers, then, what they ought to
          be?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then next, let me say to each one, how about your prayers as members
          of the Church? Perhaps I am the last person that might complain about
          a prayer meeting. It really is a grand sight to see so many of you,
          but I must confess I don't feel quite content, for there are some
          members whom I used to see, but don't see now. I know I see some fresh
          ones, and we are never short of praying men, but I want to see the
          others as well. I know those who are constantly at prayer meetings can
          say it is good to be there. It is the best evening in the week often
          to us, when we come together to entreat for the blessing. Do not, I
          pray you, get into the habit of neglecting the assembling of
          yourselves together for prayer. How often have I said, "All our
          strength lies in prayer"! When we were very few, God multiplied us in
          answer to prayer. What prayers we put up night and day when we
          launched out to preach the gospel in a larger building! And what an
          answer God sent us. Since then, in times of need and trouble we have
          cried to God, and he has heard us. Daily he sends us help for our
          college, for our orphanage, and for our other works, in answer to
          prayer. Oh! you that come here as members of the Church, if you do not
          pray, the very beams out of these walls and the stones will cry out
          against you. This house was built in answer to prayer. If anybody had
          said that we, who were but few and poor, could have erected such a
          structure. I think it would have sounded impossible. But it was done
          -- you know how readily it was done, how God raised us up friends, how
          he has helped us to this day. Oh! don't stop your prayers. You seem to
          me, good people, to be very like that king who, when he went to the
          dying prophet, was told, "Take your arrows and shoot," and he went to
          the window, and he shot but once, and the prophet was angry and said,
          "Thou shouldest have shot many times, and then thou wouldest have
          utterly destroyed thy enemies." And so we pray, as it were, but
          little. We ask but little, and God gives it. Oh! that we could ask
          much, and pray for much, and shoot many arrows and plead very
          earnestly. Look at this city of ours. I would not say a word in
          derogation of my country, but I am afraid there is not much to choose
          between the sin of London and the sin of Paris. And see what has come
          on that was going on there without fearing that national sin would
          bring national chastisement. And oh! this wicked City of London, with
          its dens of vice and filthiness! Ye are the salt of the earth; ye that
          love Christ, let not your salt lose its savour. God forbid that you
          should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for this wicked people.
          Everywhere, sea and land, is compassed by the adversaries of the
          truth, to make proselytes. I beseech you, compass the mercy-seat, that
          their machinations may be defeated. At this time there ought to be
          special prayer. When God in providence seems to be shaking the Papacy
          to its base, now should we cry aloud and spare not. Out of these
          convulsions God may bring lasting blessings. Let us not neglect to
          work when God works. Let the hand of the man be lifted up in prayer
          when the wing of the angel is moved in providence. We may expect great
          things if we can pray greatly, and wrestle earnestly. I call you, in
          God's name, to the mercy-seat. Draw near thither, with intense
          importunity; and such a blessing shall come as ye have not yet
          imagined. Pray for some here present that are unconverted. There are a
          good many of them. They will not pray for themselves; let us pray them
          into prayer; let us pray God for them, until they at last pray God for
          themselves. Prayer can mercy's door unlock, for others as well as for
          our own persons; let us, therefore, abound in prayer, and God send us
          the blessing, for Jesus' sake. Amen.
        </p>
        <p>Daniel 9:1-11.</p>
        <p>
          Verses 1, 2. In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the
          seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the
          Chaldeans; In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books
          the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah
          the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations
          of Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel was himself a prophet, but he studied the inspired prophecies
          of Jeremiah. If such a man need read Scripture, how much more ought
          we! Whatever light we may suppose to dwell within us, we shall do well
          to walk by the more sure word of prophecy.
        </p>
        <p>
          3-5. And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and
          supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes: And I prayed
          unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the
          great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that
          love him, and to them that keep his commandments; We have sinned, and
          have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled,
          even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel certainly had rebelled less than any of his countrymen, and yet
          he is the first to make confession on their behalf. So, my brethren,
          when we have confessed our own sins, and have found mercy, then we
          should begin to be intercessors for others. We should make confession
          for the sins of our families, for the sins of our city, for the sins
          of our country. If no longer need we plead for salvation for ourselves
          because we have obtained it, let us give the full force of our prayers
          for the benefit of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which
          spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to
          all the people of the land.
        </p>
        <p>
          It greatly increases sin when we sin against warnings sent from God.
          Daniel confesses this.
        </p>
        <p>
          7-9. O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion
          of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants
          of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far
          off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because
          of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee. O Lord, to
          us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to
          our fathers, because we have sinned against thee. To the Lord our God
          belong mercies and forgiveness, though we have rebelled against him;
        </p>
        <p>
          What a gracious verse that is! Surely it might be printed in letters
          of gold, and every trembling, penitent sinner might look at it till at
          last beams of light should dart into the darkness of his despair.
        </p>
        <p>
          10, 11. Neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk
          in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets. Yea,
          all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they
          might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and
          the oath that is written in the law ofMoses the servant of God,
          because we have sinned against him.<br />
