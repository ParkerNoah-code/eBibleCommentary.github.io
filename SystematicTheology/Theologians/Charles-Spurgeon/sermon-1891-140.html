          1. For in no other way could we have learned the things of God, unless
          our Master, existing as the Word, had become man. For no other being
          had the power of revealing to us the things of the Father, except His
          own proper Word. For what other person |knew the mind of the Lord,| or
          who else |has become His counsellor?| Again, we could have learned in
          no other way than by seeing our Teacher, and hearing His voice with
          our own ears, that, having become imitators of His works as well as
          doers of His words, we may have communion with Him, receiving increase
          from the perfect One, and from Him who is prior to all creation. We --
          who were but lately created by the only best and good Being, by Him
          also who has the gift of immortality, having been formed after His
          likeness (predestinated, according to the prescience of the Father,
          that we, who had as yet no existence, might come into being), and made
          the first-fruits of creation -- have received, in the times known
          beforehand, [the blessings of salvation] according to the ministration
          of the Word, who is perfect in all things, as the mighty Word, and
          very man, who, redeeming us by His own blood in a manner consonant to
          reason, gave Himself as a redemption for those who had been led into
          captivity. And since the apostasy tyrannized over us unjustly, and,
          though we were by nature the property of the omnipotent God, alienated
          us contrary to nature, rendering us its own disciples, the Word of
          God, powerful in all things, and not defective with regard to His own
          justice, did righteously turn against that apostasy, and redeem from
          it His own property, not by violent means, as the [apostasy] had
          obtained dominion over us at the beginning, when it insatiably
          snatched away what was not its own, but by means of persuasion, as
          became a God of counsel, who does not use violent means to obtain what
          He desires; so that neither should justice be infringed upon, nor the
          ancient handiwork of God go to destruction. Since the Lord thus has
          redeemed us through His own blood, giving His soul for our souls, and
          His flesh for our flesh, and has also poured out the Spirit of the
          Father for the union and communion of God and man, imparting indeed
          God to men by means of the Spirit, and, on the other hand, attaching
          man to God by His own incarnation, and bestowing upon us at His coming
          immortality durably and truly, by means of communion with God, -- all
          the doctrines of the heretics fall to ruin.

          2. Vain indeed are those who allege that He appeared in mere seeming.
          For these things were not done in appearance only, but in actual
          reality. But if He did appear as a man, when He was not a man, neither
          could the Holy Spirit have rested upon Him, -- an occurrence which did
          actually take place -- as the Spirit is invisible; nor, [in that
          case], was there any degree of truth in Him, for He was not that which
          He seemed to be. But I have already remarked that Abraham and the
          other prophets beheld Him after a prophetical manner, foretelling in
          vision what should come to pass. If, then, such a being has now
          appeared in outward semblance different from what he was in reality,
          there has been a certain prophetical vision made to men; and another
          advent of His must be looked forward to, in which He shall be such as
          He has now been seen in a prophetic manner. And I have proved already,
          that it is the same thing to say that He appeared merely to outward
          seeming, and [to affirm] that He received nothing from Mary. For He
          would not have been one truly possessing flesh and blood, by which He
          redeemed us, unless He had summed up in Himself the ancient formation
          of Adam. Vain therefore are the disciples of Valentinus who put forth
          this opinion, in order that they my exclude the flesh from salvation,
          and cast aside what God has fashioned.

          3. Vain also are the Ebionites, who do not receive by faith into their
          soul the union of God and man, but who remain in the old leaven of
          [the natural] birth, and who do not choose to understand that the Holy
          Ghost came upon Mary, and the power of the Most High did overshadow
          her: wherefore also what was generated is a holy thing, and the Son of
          the Most High God the Father of all, who effected the incarnation of
          this being, and showed forth a new [kind of] generation; that as by
          the former generation we inherited death, so by this new generation we
          might inherit life. Therefore do these men reject the commixture of
          the heavenly wine, and wish it to be water of the world only, not
          receiving God so as to have union with Him, but they remain in that
          Adam who had been conquered and was expelled from Paradise: not
          considering that as, at the beginning of our formation in Adam, that
          breath of life which proceeded from God, having been united to what
          had been fashioned, animated the man, and manifested him as a being
          endowed with reason; so also, in [the times of] the end, the Word of
          the Father and the Spirit of God, having become united with the
          ancient substance of Adam's formation, rendered man living and
          perfect, receptive of the perfect Father, in order that as in the
          natural [Adam] we all were dead, so in the spiritual we may all be
          made alive. For never at any time did Adam escape the hands of God, to
          whom the Father speaking, said, |Let Us make man in Our image, after
          Our likeness.| And for this reason in the last times (fine), not by
          the will of the flesh, nor by the will of man, but by the good
          pleasure of the Father, His hands formed a living man, in order that
          Adam might be created [again] after the image and likeness of God.<br />
