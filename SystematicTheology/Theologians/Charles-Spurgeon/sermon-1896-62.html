          and to Israel for an everlasting covenant: 11. Saying, I will give

          6 Ye seed of Abraham his servant. The Psalmist addresses himself by
          name to his own countrymen, whom, as has been stated, God had bound to
          himself by a special adoption. It was a bond of union still more
          sacred, that by the mere good pleasure of God they were preferred to
          all other nations. By calling them the seed of Abraham, and the sons
          of Jacob, he reminds them that they had not attained so great dignity
          by their own power, but because they were descended from the holy
          fathers. He, however, affirms at the same time, that the holiness of
          their fathers flowed exclusively from God's election, and not from
          their own nature. He expressly states both these truths, first, that
          before they were born children of Abraham, they were already heirs of
          the covenant, because they derived their origin from the holy fathers;
          and, secondly, that the fathers themselves had not acquired this
          prerogative by their own merit or worth, but had been freely chosen;
          for this is the reason why Jacob is called God's chosen Although
          Abraham is also here called God's servant, (Genesis 26:24) because he
          purely and sincerely worshipped him, yet in the second clause it is
          testified that the commencement of this distinction was not to be
          traced to men, but to God alone, who conferred upon the Israelites the
          honor of choosing them to be his peculiar possession.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this covenant the Psalmist infers that although the government of
          God extends through the whole world, and although he executes his
          judgment in all places, he was nevertheless especially the God of that
          one people, (verse 7) according to the statement in the song of Moses,
        </p>
        <p>
          "When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he
          separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people, according
          to the number of the children of Israel: For the Lord's portion is his
          people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance." Deuteronomy 32:8, 9
        </p>
        <p>
          The prophet again intended to show that the reason why the children of
          Israel excelled others was not because they were better than others,
          but because such was the good pleasure of God. If the divine judgments
          are extended through all the regions of the globe, the condition of
          all nations is in this respect equal. Whence it follows that the
          difference referred to proceeded from the love of God, -- that the
          source of the superiority of the Israelites to other nations was his
          free favor. Although, then, He is the rightful proprietor of the whole
          earth, it is declared that he chose one people over whom he might
          reign. This is a doctrine which applies to us also at the present day.
          If we duly ponder our calling, we will undoubtedly find that God has
          not been induced from anything out of himself to prefer us to others,
          but that he was pleased to do so purely from his own free grace.

          8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever The Psalmist now celebrates
          the effect and actual fulfillment of the covenant, and proves from the
          deliverance wrought for the Israelites what he had stated before,
          namely, That God, while he reigned alike over all nations, extended
          his peculiar favor to the offspring of Abraham alone. How comes it to
          pass that God, in delivering his people, displayed the might of his
          arm by so many miracles, if it was not that he might faithfully
          perform the promise which he had made to his servants in time past? It
          is evident, then, that the ancient covenant was the cause of the
          deliverance granted to the chosen tribes; for in order that God might
          faithfully keep his promises, it behooved him first to be merciful. As
          a long series of years had elapsed between the promise and the
          performance, the prophet uses the word remember, intimating that the
          Divine promises do not become obsolete by length of time, but that
          even when the world imagines that they are extinguished and wholly
          forgotten, God retains as distinct a remembrance of them as ever, that
          he may accomplish them in due season. This is more strongly confirmed
          in the next clause, where the correspondence between the form or tenor
          of the covenant and the accomplishment is celebrated. It is not for a
          day, he would say, or for a few days, that God has made a covenant
          with Abraham, nor has he limited the continuance of his covenant to
          the life of man, but he has promised to be the God of his seed even to
          a thousand generations. Although, therefore, the fulfillment was for a
          long time suspended, God nevertheless showed by the effect that his
          promise did not fail by length of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Abraham was the first who was called when he was mingled with
          idolaters, the prophet begins with him. He, however, afterwards
          declares that the covenant was also confirmed in the hand of his son
          and his son's son. God then deposited his covenant with Abraham, and
          by solemn oath engaged to be the God of his seed. But to give greater
          assurance of the truth of his promise, he was graciously pleased to
          renew it to Isaac and Jacob. The effect of such an extension of it is,
          that his faithfulness takes deeper hold on the hearts of men; and,
          besides, his grace, when it is thus testified on frequent recurring
          occasions, becomes better known and more illustrious among men.
          Accordingly, it is here declared by gradation how steadfast and
          immovable this covenant is; for what is affirmed concerning each of
          the patriarchs belongs equally to them all. It is said that God swore
          to Isaac. But had he not sworn to Abraham before? Undoubtedly he had.
          It is also said that it was established to Jacob for a law, and for an
          everlasting covenant Does this mean that the covenant was previously
          only temporal and transitory, and that then it had changed its nature?
          Such an idea is altogether at variance with the meaning of the sacred
          writer. By these different forms of expression he asserts that the
          covenant was fully and perfectly confirmed, so that, if perhaps the
          calling was obscure in one man, it might be more evident, by God's
          having transmitted the testimony of it to posterity; for by this means
          the truth of it was the better manifested. Here again we must remember
          that God with great kindness considers our weakness when, both by his
          oath, and by frequently repeating his word, he ratifies what he has
          once promised to us. Our ingratitude then appears the fouler in
          disbelieving him when he not only speaks but also swears.

          11. Saying, I will give thee the land of Canaan As this was only a
          small portion of the blessings offered to the fathers, the prophet
          seems at first view too much to limit the covenant of God, which
          extended even to the hope of an eternal inheritance. But he considered
          it enough to show, by the figure synecdoche, that a part of what God
          had promised to the fathers had received its complete accomplishment.
          His drift is to intimate that they did not possess the land of Canaan
          by any other right than because it was the legitimate inheritance of
          Abraham according to the covenant which God had made with him. If man
          exhibit the promised earnest of a contract, he does not violate the
          contract. When, therefore, the prophet proves by a visible symbol that
          God did not make a covenant with his servants in vain, and that he did
          not disappoint their hope, he does not take away or abolish the other
          blessings included in it. Nay, rather, when the Israelites heard that
          they possessed the land of Canaan by right of inheritance, because
          they were the chosen people of God, it became them to look beyond
          this, and to take comprehensive view of all the privileges by which He
          had vouchsafed to distinguish them. Hence it is to be noted, that when
          He in part fulfills his promises towards us, we are base and
          ungrateful if this experience does not conduce to the confirmation of
          our faith. Whenever he shows himself to be a father towards us, he
          undoubtedly really seals on our hearts the power and efficacy of his
          word. But if the land of Canaan ought to have led the children of
          Israel in their contemplations to heaven, since they knew that they
          had been brought into it on account of the covenant which God had made
          with them, the consideration that He has given to us his Christ, "in
          whom all the promises are yea and amen," (2 Corinthians 1:20) ought to
          have much greater weight with us. When it is said, I will give thee
          the measuring line of Your inheritance, the change of the number
          points out that God made a covenant with all the people in general,
          though he spake the words only to a few individuals; even as we have
          seen a little before that it was a decree or an everlasting law. The
          holy patriarchs were the first and principal persons into whose hands
          the promise was committed; but they did not embrace the grace which
          was offered to them as what belonged only to themselves, but as what
          their posterity in common with them were to became sharers of.<br />
