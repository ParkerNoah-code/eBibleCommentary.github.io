          Bring not every man into thine house; for many are the plots of the
          deceitful man. As a decoy partridge in a cage, so is the heart of a
          proud man; and as one that is a spy, he looketh upon thy falling. For
          he lieth in wait to turn things that are good into evil; and in things
          that are praiseworthy he will lay blame. From a spark of fire a heap
          of many coals is kindled; and a sinful man lieth in wait for blood.
          Take heed of an evil-doer, for he contriveth wicked things; lest haply
          he bring upon thee blame for ever. Receive a stranger into thine
          house, and he will distract thee with brawls, and estrange thee from
          thine own.
        </p>
        <p>
          If thou do good, know to whom thou doest it; and thy good deeds shall
          have thanks. Do good to a godly man, and thou shalt find a recompense;
          and if not from him, yet from the Most High. There shall no good come
          to him that continueth to do evil, nor to him that giveth no alms.
          Give to the godly man and help not the sinner. Do good to one that is
          lowly, and give not to an ungodly man; keep back his bread, and give
          it not to him, lest he overmaster thee thereby; for thou shalt receive
          twice as much evil for all the good thou shalt have done unto him. For
          the Most High also hateth sinners, and will repay vengeance unto the
          ungodly. Give to the good man, and help not the sinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          A man's friend will not be fully tried in prosperity; and his enemy
          will not be hidden in adversity. In a man's prosperity his enemies are
          grieved; and in his adversity even his friend will be separated from
          him. Never trust thine enemy, for like as the brass rusteth, so is his
          wickedness: though he humble himself, and go crouching, yet take good
          heed, and beware of him, and thou shalt be unto him as one that hath
          wiped a mirror, and thou shalt know that he hath not utterly rusted
          it. Set him not by thee, lest he overthrow thee and stand in thy
          place; let him not sit on thy right hand, lest he seek to take thy
          seat, and at the last thou acknowledge my words, and be pricked with
          my sayings. Who will pity a charmer that is bitten with a serpent? or
          any that come nigh wild beasts? Even so who will pity him that goeth
          to a sinner, and is mingled with him in his sins? For a while he will
          abide with thee, and if thou give way, he will not hold out. And the
          enemy will speak sweetly with his lips, and in his heart take counsel
          how to overthrow thee into a pit; the enemy will weep with his eyes,
          and if he find opportunity, he will not be satiated with blood. If
          adversity meet thee, thou shalt find him there before thee; and as
          though he would help thee, he will trip up thy heel. He will shake his
          head, and clap his hands, and whisper much, and change his
          countenance.

          He that toucheth pitch shall be defiled; and he that hath fellowship
          with a proud man shall become like unto him. Take not up a burden
          above thy strength; and have no fellowship with one that is mightier
          and richer than thyself. What fellowship shall the earthen pot have
          with the kettle? this shall smite, and that shall be dashed in pieces.
          The rich man doeth a wrong, and he threateneth withal: the poor is
          wronged, and he shall entreat withal. If thou be profitable, he will
          make merchandise of thee; and if thou be in want, he will forsake
          thee. If thou have substance, he will live with thee; and he will make
          thee bare, and will not be sorry. Hath he had need of thee? then he
          will deceive thee, and smile upon thee, and give thee hope: he will
          speak thee fair, and say, What needest thou? and he will shame thee by
          his meats, until he have made thee bare twice or thrice. And at the
          last he will laugh thee to scorn; afterward will he see thee, and will
          forsake thee, and shake his head at thee. Beware that thou be not
          deceived, and brought low in thy mirth. If a mighty man invite thee,
          be retiring, and so much the more will he invite thee. Press not upon
          him, lest thou be thrust back; and stand not far off, lest thou be
          forgotten. Affect not to speak with him as an equal, and believe not
          his many words: for with much talk will he try thee, and in a smiling
          manner will search thee out. He that keepeth not to himself words
          spoken is unmerciful; and he will not spare to hurt and to bind. Keep
          them to thyself, and take earnest heed, for thou walkest in peril of
          thy falling.

          Every living creature loveth his like, and every man loveth his
          neighbour. All flesh consorteth according to kind, and a man will
          cleave to his like. What fellowship shall the wolf have with the lamb?
          so is the sinner unto the godly. What peace is there between the hyena
          and the dog? and what peace between the rich man and the poor? Wild
          asses are the prey of lions in the wilderness; so poor men are pasture
          for the rich. Lowliness is an abomination to a proud man; so a poor
          man is an abomination to the rich. A rich man when he is shaken is
          held up of his friends; but one of low degree being down is thrust
          away also by his friends. When a rich man is fallen, there are many
          helpers; he speaketh things not to be spoken, and men justify him: a
          man of low degree falleth, and men rebuke him withal; he uttereth
          wisdom, and no place is allowed him. A rich man speaketh, and all keep
          silence; and what he saith they extol to the clouds: a poor man
          speaketh, and they say, Who is this? and if he stumble, they will help
          to overthrow him. Riches are good that have no sin; and poverty is
          evil in the mouth of the ungodly.
