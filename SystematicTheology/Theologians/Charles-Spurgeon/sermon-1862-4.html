        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.456)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Evening, May 25th, 1862, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give
          you an heart of flesh." -- Ezekiel 36:26.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE FALL of man was utter and entire. Some things when they have
          become dilapidated may be repaired; but the old house of mankind is so
          thoroughly decayed that it must be pulled down even to its foundation,
          and a new house must be erected. To attempt mere improvement is to
          anticipate a certain failure. Manhood is like an old garment that is
          rent and rotten; he that would mend it with new cloth doth but make
          the rent worse. Manhood is like one of the old skin bottles of the
          Orientals; he who would put the new wine into it shall find that the
          bottles will burst, and his wine will be lost. Old shoes and clouted
          might be good enough for Gibeonites; but we are so thoroughly outworn
          that we must be made new, or thrown upon the dunghill. It is a wonder
          of wonders that such a thing is possible. If a tree loses its branch,
          a new branch may spring out; if you cut into the bark and mark the
          letters of your name, in process of time the bark may heal its own
          wound, and the mark may be erased. But who could give a new heart to
          the tree? Who could put new sap into it? By what possibility could you
          change its inner structure? If the core were smitten with death, what
          power but the divine could ever restore it to life? If a man has
          injured his bones, the fractured parts soon send forth a healing
          liquid, and the bone is by-and-bye restored to its former strength, if
          a man hath youth on his side. But if a man's heart were rotten, how
          could that be cured? If the heart were a putrid ulcer, if the very
          vitals of the man were rotten, what human surgery, what marvellous
          medicine could touch a defect so radical as this? Well did our hymn
          say:
        </p>
        <p>"Can aught beneath a power divine</p>
        <p>The stubborn will subdue?</p>
        <p>'Tis thine, eternal Spirit, thine,</p>
        <p>To form the heart anew.</p>
        <p>To chase the shades of death away</p>
        <p>And bid the sinner live!</p>
        <p>A beam of heaven, a vital ray,</p>
        <p>'Tis thine alone to give."</p>
        <p>
          But while such a thing would be impossible apart from God, it is
          certain that God can do it. Oh, how the Master delighteth to undertake
          impossibilities! To do what others can do were but like unto man; but
          to accomplish that which is impossible to the creature is a mighty and
          noble proof of the dignity of the Creator. He delighteth to undertake
          strange things; to bring light out of darkness; order out of
          confusion; to send life into the dead; to heal the leprosy; to work
          marvels of grace and mercy, and wisdom, and peace -- these, I say, God
          delighteth to do; and so, while the thing is impossible to us, it is
          possible to him. And more, its impossibility to us commends it to him,
          and makes him the more willing to undertake it, that he may thus
          glorify his great name.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the Word of God, man's heart is by nature like a stone;
          but God, through his grace, removes the stony heart and gives a heart
          of flesh. It is this prodigy of love, this miracle of grace, which is
          to engage our attention to-night. I trust we shall speak now, not of
          something that has happened to others only, but of a great wonder
          which has been wrought in ourselves. I trust we shall talk
          experimentally, and hear personally, and feel that we have an interest
          in these splendid deeds of divine love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two things we shall talk of to-night. First, the stony heart and its
          dangers; secondly, the heart of flesh and its privileges.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Some few words upon THE STONY HEART AND ITS DANGERS. Why is the
          heart of man compared to a stone at all?
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, because, like a stone it is cold. Few persons like to be
          always treading upon cold stones in their houses, and hence we floor
          our habitations; and it is thought to be a part, of the hardship of
          the prisoner if he has nothing to sit down or rest upon but the cold,
          cold stone. You may heat a stone for a little season if you thrust it
          into the fire, but for how short a time will it retain its heat; and
          though it glowed just now, how very soon it loses all its warmth and
          returns again to its native coldness. Such is the heart of man. It is
          warm enough towards sin; it it grows hot as coals of juniper, towards
          its own lusts; but naturally the heart is as cold as ice towards the
          things of God. You may think you have heated it for a little season
          under a powerful exhortation, or in presence of a solemn judgment, but
          how soon it returns to its natural state! We have heard of one who,
          seeing a large congregation all weeping under a sermon, said, "What a
          wonderful thing to see so many weeping under the truth!" and another
          added, "But there is a greater wonder than that -- to see how they
          leave off weeping as soon as the sermon is over, concerning those
          things which ought to make them weep always and constantly." Ah, dear
          friends, no warmth of eloquence can ever warn the stony heart of man
          into a glow of love to Jesus; nay, no force of entreaty can get so
          much as a spark of gratitude out of the flinty heart of man. Though
          your hearts renewed by grace should be like a flaming furnace, yet you
          cannot warm your neighbour's heart with the divine heat; he will think
          you a fool for being so enthusiastic; he will turn upon his heel and
          think you a madman to be so concerned about matters that seem so
          trivial to him: the warmth that is in your heart you cannot
          communicate to him, for he is not, while unconverted, capable of
          receiving it. The heart of man, like marble, is stone-cold.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Then, again, like a stone, it is hard. You get the hard stone,
          especially some sorts of stone which have been hewn from granite-beds,
          and you may hammer as you will, but you shall make no impression. The
          heart of man is compared in Scripture to the nether millstone, and in
          another place it is even compared to the adamant stone; it is harder
          than the diamond; it cannot be cut; it cannot be broken; it cannot be
          moved. I have seen the great hammer of the law, which is ten times
          more ponderous than Nasmyth's great steam hammer, come down upon a
          man's heart, and the heart has never shown the slightest signs of
          shrinking. We have seen a hundred powerful shots sent against it, we
          have marked the great battery of the law with its ten great pieces of
          ordnance all fired against the heart of man, but man's heart has been
          harder even than the sheathing of the iron-clad ships, and the great
          shots of the law have dropped harmlessly against a man's conscience --
          he did not, he would not feel. What razor-edged sentence can cut your
          hearts? What needle-warning can prick your consciences? Alas, all
          means are unavailing! No arguments have power to move a soul so
          steeled, so thoroughly stony, hard, and impenetrable. Some of you now
          present, have given more than enough evidence of the hardness of your
          hearts. Sickness has befallen you, death has come in at your windows,
          affliction has come up against you, but like Pharaoh, you have said,
          "Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice? I will not bow my
          neck, neither will I do his will. I am my own master, and I will have
          my own pleasure and my own way. I will not yield to God." O rocks of
          iron and hills of brass, ye are softer than the proud heart of man!
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Again, a stone is dead. You can find no feeling in it. Talk to it;
          it will shed no tears of pity, though you recount to it the saddest
          tales; no smiles will gladden it, though you should tell it the most
          happy story. It is dead; there is no consciousness in it; prick it and
          it will not bleed; stab it and it cannot die, for it is dead already.
          You cannot make it wince, or start, or show any signs of sensibility.
          Now, though man's heart is not like this as to natural things, yet
          spiritually this is just its condition. You cannot make it show one
          spiritual emotion. "Ye are dead in trespasses and sins ," powerless,
          lifeless, without feeling, without emotion. Transient emotions towards
          good men have, even as the surface of a slab is wet after a shower,
          but real vital emotions of good they cannot know, for the showers of
          heaven reach not the interior of the stone. Melancthon may preach, but
          old Adam is too dead for him to quicken him. Ye may go down into the
          grave where the long sleep has fallen on humanity, and ye may seek to
          revive it, but there is no power in human tongue to revive the dead.
          Man is like the deaf adder which will not be charmed, charm we never
          so wisely. Tears are lost on him; threatenings are but as the
          whistlings of the wind, the preachings of the law, and even of Christ
          crucified -- all these are null and void and fall hopelessly to the
          ground, so long as the man's heart continues what is by nature --
          dead, and hard, and cold.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Those three adjectives might be sufficient to give a full
          description, for if we add two more we shall but in some degree repeat
          ourselves. Man's heart is like a stone because it is not easily to be
          softened. Lay a stone in water as long as you will and you shall not
          find it readly subdued. There are some sorts of stone that yield to
          the stress of weather, especially in the smoky atmosphere and the
          sulphurous vapours of London; certain stones crumble to decay, but the
          stone of a man's heart no climate can affect, no weathers can subdue;
          it grows harder whether it be the soft sunshine of love or the harsh
          tempest of judgment that falls upon it. Mercy and love alike make it
          more solid, and knit its particles closer together; and surely until
          the Omnipotent himself speak the word, the heart of man grows harder,
          and harder, and harder, and refuses to be broken. There is an
          invention, I believe, for liquifying flints, and then afterwards they
          may be poured out in a solution which is supposed to have the virtue
          of resisting the action of the atmosphere when put upon certain
          limestones; but you never can liquify, except by a divine power, the
          flinty heart of man. Granite may be ground, may be broken into pieces,
          but unless God gets the hammer in his hand, and even he must put both
          hands to it, the great granitic heart of man will not yield in any
          way. Certain stones have their veins, and certain crystallic stones
          may be so dexterously struck, that they will frequently break even
          with a slight blow; but you can never find a vein in man's heart by
          which the attempt to conquer it will be assisted from within. You may
          smite right and left with death, with judgment, with mercy, with
          privileges with tears, with entreaties, with threatenings, and it will
          not break; nay, even tthe fires of hell, do not melt man's heart, for
          the damned in hell grow more hard by their agonies, and they hate God,
          and blaspheme him all the more because of the suffering they endure.
          Only Omnipotence itself, I say, can ever soften this hard heart of
          man.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. So, then, man's heart is cold, and dead, and hard, and cannot be
          softened; and then, again -- and this is but an enlargement of a
          former thought -- it is utterly senseless, incapable of receiving
          impressions. Remember, again, I am not speaking of the heart of man
          physically, I am not speaking of it even as I would if I were teaching
          mental science; we are only now regarding it from a spiritual point of
          view. Men do receive mental impressions under the preaching of the
          Word; they often get so uneasy that they cannot shake off their
          thoughts; but alas! their goodness is as the early cloud, and as the
          morning dew, and it vanishes as a dream. But, spiritually, you can no
          more impress the heart of man than you might leave a bruise upon a
          stone. Wax receives an impression from a seal, but not the stern,
          unyielding stone; if you have hot running wax you may make what mark
          you please upon it, but when you have the cold, cold stone, though you
          bear never so hard upon the stamp, there is no impression, the surface
          shows no trace of your labour. So is man's heart by nature. I know
          some who say it is not so, they do not like to hear human nature
          slandered, so they say. Well, friend, if though hast not this hard
          heart, why is it thou art not saved? I remember an anecdote of Dr.
          Gill which hits this nail on the head. It is said that a man came to
          him in the vestry of his chapel and said, "Dr. Gill, you have been
          preaching the doctrine of human inability, I don't believe you. I
          believe that man can repent and can believe, and is not without
          spiritual power." "Well," said the doctor, "have you repented and
          believed?" "No," said the other. "Very well, then." said he, "you
          deserve double damnation." And so I say to the man who boats that he
          has not such a hard heart as this -- have you laid hold of Christ?
          have you come to him? if you have not, then out of your own heart be
          you condemned, for you deserve double destruction from the presence of
          God, for having resisted the influences of God's Spirit and rejected
          his grace. I need not say more abut the hardness of the human heart,
          as that will come up incidentally by-and-bye, when we are speaking of
          the heart of flesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, let us notice the danger to which this hard heart is exposed.
          A hard heart is exposed to the danger of final impenitence. If all
          these years the processes of nature have been at work with your heart,
          and have not softened it, have you not reason to conclude that it may
          be so even to the end? And then you will certainly perish. Many of you
          are no strangers to the means of grace. I speak to some of you who
          have been hearing the gospel preached ever since you were little ones:
          you went to the Sabbath school; mayhap, you were wont in your boy hood
          to listen to old Mr. So-and-so, who often brought tears to your eyes,
          and of late you have been here, and there have been times with this
          congregation when the word seemed enough to melt the very rocks and
          make the hard hearts of steel flow down in repentance, and yet you are
          still the same as ever. What does reason tell you to expect? Surely
          this should be the natural inference from the logic of facts you will
          continue as you are now, means will be useless to you, privileges will
          but become accumulated judgments, and you will go on till time is
          over, and eternity approaches, unblest, unsaved, and you will go down
          to the doom of the lost soul. "Oh!" saith one, "I hope not;" and I
          add, I hope not too; but I am solemnly afraid of it, especially with
          some of you. Some of you are growing old under the gospel, and you are
          getting so used to my voice that you could almost go to sleep under
          it. As Rowland Hill says of the blacksmith's dog, that at first he
          used to be afraid of the sparks, but afterwards got so used to it,
          that he could lie and sleep under the anvil; and there are some of you
          who can sleep under the anvil, with the sparks of God's wrath flying
          about your nostrils, asleep under the most solemn discourse. I do not
          mean with your eyes shut, for I might then point to you, but asleep in
          your hearts, your souls being given to slumber while your eyes may
          regard the preacher, and your ears may be listening to his voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          And further, there is another danger, hearts that are not softened
          grow harder and harder; what little sensibility they seemed to have,
          at last departs. Perhaps there are some of you that can recollect what
          you were when you were boys. There is a picture in the Royal Academy
          at this hour, which teaches a good moral: there is a mother putting
          her children to bed, the father happens to be in just when they are
          going to their slumbers; the little ones are kneeling down saying
          their prayers; there is only a curtain between them and the room where
          the father is, and he is sitting down; he is putting his hand to his
          head, and the tears are flowing very freely, for somehow he cannot
          stand it; he recollects when he too was taught to pray at his mother's
          knee, and though he has grown up forgetful of God and the things of
          God, he remembers the time when it was not so with him. Take care, my
          dear hearers, that you do not grow worse and worse; for it will be so;
          we either grow ripe or rotten, one of the two, as years pass over us.
          Which is it with you?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then further, a man who has a hard heart is Satan's throne. There is a
          stone they tell us, in Scotland, at Scone, where they were wont to
          crown their old kings: the stone on which they crown the old king of
          hell is a hard heart; it is his choicest throne; he reigns in hell,
          but he counts hard hearts to be his choicest dominions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then again, the hard heart is ready for anything. When Satan sits upon
          it and makes it is throne, there is no wonder that from the seat of
          the scorner flow all manner of evil. And besides that, the hard heart
          is impervious to all instrumentality. John Bunyan, in his history of
          the "Holy War," represents old Diabolus, the devil, as providing for
          the people of Mansoul a coat of armour, of which the breastplate was a
          hard heart. Oh! that is a strong breastplate. Sometimes when we preach
          the gospel, we wonder that there is not more good done. I wonder that
          there is so much. When men sit in the house of God, armed up to their
          very chins in a coat of mail, it is not much wonder that the arrows do
          not pierce their hearts. If a man has an umbrella, it is no marvel if
          he does not get wet; and so when the showers of grace are falling,
          there are many of you who put up the umbrella of a hard heart, and it
          is no marvel if the dew of grace and the rain of grace do not drop
          into your souls. Hard hearts are the devil's life-guards. When he once
          gets a man in an armour of proof -- that of a hard heart -- "Now,"
          says he, "you may go anywhere." So he sends them to hear the minister,
          and they make fun of him; he lets them read religious books, and they
          can find something to mock at there; he will then turn them even to
          the Bible, and with their hard heart they may read the Bible pretty
          safely, for even the Word of God the hard heart can turn to mischief,
          and find something to find fault with even in the person of Christ,
          and in the glorious attributes of God himself. I shall not stay longer
          upon this very painful subject; but if you feel that your hearts are
          hard, may your prayer go up to God, "Lord, melt my heart. None but a
          bath of blood divine can take the flint away; but do it Lord, and thou
          shalt have the praise."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, and briefly, A HEART OF FLESH AND ITS PRIVILEGES. "I
          will take away the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh." In
          many -- very many who are present to-night my text has been fulfilled.
          Let us join in praying for others whose hearts are still stony, that
          God would work this miracle in them, and turn their hearts to flesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is meant by a heart of flesh? I means a heart that can feel on
          account of sin -- a heart that can bleed when the arrows of God stick
          fast in it; it means a heart that can yield when the gospel makes its
          attacks -- a heart that can be impressed when the seal of God's word
          comes upon it; it means a heart that is warm, for life is warm -- a
          heart that can think, a heart that can aspire, a heart that can love
          -- putting all in one -- a heart of flesh means that new heart and
          right spirit which God giveth to the regenerate. But wherein does this
          heart of flesh consist; wherein does its tenderness consist? Well, its
          tenderness consists in three things. There is a tenderness of
          conscience. Men who have lost their stony hearts are afraid of sin,
          even before sin they are afraid of it. The very shadow of evil across
          their path frightens them. The temptation is enough for them, they
          flee from it as from a serpent; they would not dally and toy with it,
          lest they should be betrayed. Their conscience is alarmed even at the
          approach of evil, and away they fly; and in sin, for even tender
          hearts do sin, they are uneasy.; As well might a man seek to obtain
          quiet rest on a pillow stuffed with thorns, as the tender conscience
          get any peace while a man in sinning. And then, after sin -- here
          comes the pinch -- the heart of flesh bleeds as though it were wounded
          to its very core. It hates and loathes and detests itself that ever it
          should have gone astray. Ah, stony heart, you can think of sin with
          pleasure, you can live in sin and not care about it; and after sin you
          can roll the sweet morsel under your tongue and say, "Who is my
          master? I care for none; my conscience does not accuse me." But not so
          the tender broken heart. Before sin, and in sin, and after sin, it
          smarts and cries out to God. So also in duty as well as in sin, the
          new heart is tender. Hard hearts care nothing for God's commandment;
          hearts of flesh wish to be obedient to every statute. "Only let me
          know my Master's will and I will do it." The hearts of flesh when they
          feel that the commandment has been omitted, or that the command has
          been broken, mourn and lament before God. Oh! there are some hearts of
          flesh that cannot forgive themselves, if they have been lax in prayer,
          if they have not enjoyed the Sabbath-day, if they feel that they have
          not given their hearts to God's praise as they should. These duties
          which hearts of stone trifle with and despise, hearts of flesh value
          and esteem. If the heart of flesh could have its way, it would never
          sin, it would be as perfect as its Father who is in heaven, and it
          would keep God's command without flaw of omission or of commission.
          Have you, dear friends, such a heart of flesh as this?
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe a heart of flesh, again, is tender, not only with regard to
          sin and duty, but with regard to suffering. A heart of stone can hear
          God blasphemed and laugh at it; but our blood runs cold to hear God
          dishonoured when we have a heart of flesh. A heart of stone can bear
          to see its fellow creatures perish and despise their destruction; but
          the heart of flesh is very tender over others. "Faith its pity would
          reclaim, and snatch the firebrand from the flame." A heart of flesh
          would give its very life-blood if it might but snatch others from
          going down to the pit, for its bowels yearn and its soul moves toward
          its fellow sinners who are on the broad road to destruction. Have you,
          oh, have you such a heart of flesh as this?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then to put it in another light, the heart of flesh is tender in three
          ways. It is tender in conscience. Hearts of stone make no bones, as we
          say, about great mischiefs; but hearts of flesh repent even at the
          very thought of sin. To have indulged a foul imagination, to have
          flattered a lustful thought, and to have allowed it to tarry even for
          a minute is quite enough to make a heart of flesh grieved and rent
          before God with pain. The heart of stone says, when it has done great
          iniquity, "Oh, it is nothing, it is nothing! Who am I that I should be
          afraid of God's law?" But not so the heart of flesh. Great sins are
          little to the stony heart, little sins are great to the heart of flesh
          -- if little sins there be. Conscience in the heart of stone is seared
          as with a hot iron; conscience in the heart of flesh is raw and very
          tender; like the sensitive plant, it coils up it's leaves at the
          slightest touch, it cannot bear the presence of evil; it is like a
          delicate consumptive, who feels every wind and is affected by every
          change of atmosphere. God give us such a blessedly tender conscience
          as that. Then again, the heart of flesh grows tender of God's will. My
          Lord Will-be-will is a great blusterer, and it is hard to bring him
          down to subject himself to God's will. When you have a man's
          conscience on God's side, you have only half the battle if you cannot
          get his will. The old maxim --
        </p>
        <p>"Convince a man against his will</p>
        <p>He's of the same opinion still."</p>
        <p>
          is true with regard to this as well as regard to anything else. Oh!
          there are some of you that know the right, but you will do the wrong.
          You know what is evil, but you will to pursue it. Now, when the heart
          of flesh is given, the will bends like a willow, quivers like an aspen
          leaf in every breath of heaven, and bows like an osier in every breeze
          of God's Spirit. The natural will is stern and stubborn, and you must
          rend it up by the roots; but the renewed will is gentle and pliable,
          feels the divine influence, and sweetly yields to it. To complete the
          picture, in the tender heart there is a tenderness of the affections.
          The hard heart does not love God, but the renewed heart does. The hard
          heart is selfish, cold, stolid. "Why should I weep for sin? Why should
          I love the Lord? Why should I give my heart to Christ?" The heart of
          flesh says --
        </p>
        <p>"Thou know'st I love thee, dearest Lord,</p>
        <p>But oh! I long to soar</p>
        <p>Far from this world of sin and woe,</p>
        <p>And learn to love thee more."</p>
        <p>
          O may God give us a tenderness of affection, that we may love God with
          all our heart, and our neighbour as ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the privileges of this renewed heart are these. "'Tis here the
          Spirit dwells, 'tis here that Jesus rests." The soft heart is ready
          now to receive every spiritual blessing. It is fitted to yield every
          heavenly fruit to the honour and praise of God. Oh! if we had none but
          tender hearts to preach to, what blessed work our ministry would be.
          What happy success! What sowings on earth! What harvests in heaven! We
          may indeed pray that God may work this change if it were only that our
          ministry might be more often a saviour of life unto life, and not of
          death unto death. A soft heart is the best defence against sin, while
          it is the best preparative for heaven. A tender heart is the best
          means of watchfulness against evil, while it is also the best means of
          preparing us for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall
          shortly descend from heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my voice fails me, and in your hearts I certainly shall not be
          heard for my much speaking. Great complaints have been brought against
          somebody's sermons for being too long, though I hardly think they
          could have been mine. So let us be brief, and let us conclude; only we
          must press this enquiry home -- Has God taken away the heart of stone
          and has he given you the heart of flesh. Dear friend, you cannot
          change your own heart. Your outward works will not change it; you may
          rub as long as ever you like outside of a bottle, but you could not
          turn ditch-water into wine; you may polish the exterior of your
          lanthorn, but it will not give you light until the candle burns
          within. The gardener may prune a crab tree, but all the pruning in the
          world won't into an apricot; so you may attend to all the moralities
          in the world, but these won't change your heart. Polish your shilling,
          but it will not change into gold; nor will your heart alter its own
          nature. What, then, is to be done? Christ is the great heart changer.
          "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be be saved." The
          Holy Spirit gives faith, and then through faith the mature is renewed.
          What sayest thou, sinner? Dost thou believe that Christ is able to
          save thee? Oh, trust him then to save thee, and if thou doest that
          thou art saved; thy nature is renewed, and the work of sanctification
          which shall begin to-night, shall go on until it shall come to its
          perfection, and thou, borne on angel's wings to heaven, "glad the
          summons to obey," shalt enter into felicity and holiness, and be
          redeemed with the saints in white, made spotless through the
          righteousness of Jesus Christ.
