          "These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also."
          -- Acts 17:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS IS JUST an old version of an oft-repeated story. When
          disturbances arise in a state, and rebellions and mutinies cause blood
          to be shed, it is still the custom to cry, "The Christians have done
          this." In the days of Jesus we know that it was laid to the charge of
          our blessed and divine Master, that he was a stirrer of sedition,
          whereas he himself had refused to be a king, when his followers would
          have taken him by force to make him one, for he said, "My kingdom is
          not of this world;" yet was he crucified under the two false charges
          of sedition and blasphemy. The same thing occurred with the Apostles.
          Wherever they went to preach the gospel, the Jews who opposed them
          sought to stir up the refuse of the city to put an end to their
          ministry; and then, when a great tumult had been made by the Jews
          themselves, who had taken unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser
          sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city in an uproar, and
          assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring him out to the
          people, then the Jews laid the tumult and the uproar at the door of
          the Apostles, saying, "These that have turned the world upside down
          are come hither also." This plan was followed all through the Roman
          empire, until Christianity became the state religion. There was never
          a calamity befel Rome, never a war arose, never a famine or a plague,
          but the vulgar multitude cried, "The Christians to the lions! The
          Christians have done this." Nero himself imputed the burning of Rome,
          of which he himself doubtless was the incendiary, to the Christians.
          The believers in Jesus were slandered as if they were the common
          sewer, into which all the filth of sin was to be poured; whereas, they
          were like Solomon's great brazen sea, which was full of the purest
          water, wherein even priests themselves might wash their robes. And you
          will remark that to this day the world still lays its ills at the door
          of the Christians. Was it not the foolish cry a few months ago, and
          are there not some weak-minded individuals who still believe it, that
          the great massacre and mutiny in India was caused by the missionaries.
          Forsooth; the men who turned the world upside down had gone there
          also; and because men broke through all the restraints of nature and
          of law, and committed deeds for which fiends might blush, this must be
          laid at the door of Christ's holy gospel, and the men of peace must
          bear on their shoulders the blame of war! Ah! we need not refute this:
          the calumny is too idle to need a refutation. Can it be true, that he
          whose gospel is love should be the fomenter of disturbance? Can it be
          fair for a moment to lay mutiny and rebellion at the door of the
          gospel, the very motto of which is, "Peace on earth, good will towards
          men?" Did not our Master say, "Render unto Caesar the things that are
          Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's?" Did he not himself
          pay tribute though he sent to the fish of the sea, to get the shekel?
          And have not his followers at all times been a peaceful generation? --
          save only and except where the liberty of their conscience was
          touched, and then they were not the men to bow their knees to tyrants
          and kings, but with brave old Oliver they did bind their kings in
          chains, and their nobles in fetters of iron, as they will do again, if
          their liberty ever should be infringed, so that they should not have
          power to worship God as they ought.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that what these Jews said of the Apostles, was just a
          downright wilful lie. They knew better. The Apostles were not the
          disturbers of states. It is true, they preached that which would
          disturb the sinful constitution of a kingdom and which would disturb
          the evil practices of false priests, but they never meant to set men
          in an uproar. They did come to set men at arms with sin; they did draw
          the sword against iniquity; but against men as men, against kings as
          kings, they had no battle; it is with iniquity and sin, and wrong
          everywhere, that they proclaimed an everlasting warfare. But still,
          brethren, there is many a true word spoken in jest, we say, and surely
          there is many a true word spoken in malice. They said the Apostles
          turned the world upside down. They meant by that, that they were
          disturbers of the peace. But they said a great true thing; for
          Christ's gospel does turn the world upside down. It was the wrong way
          upwards before, and now that the gospel is preached, and when it shall
          prevail, it will just set the world right by turning it upside down.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I shall try to show how, in the world at large, Christ's
          gospel turns the world upside down. and then I shall endeavor, as well
          as God shall help me, to show how the little world that is within
          every man is turned upside down, when he becomes a believer in the
          gospel of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, the gospel of Christ turns the world upside down, WITH
          REGARD TO THE POSITION OF DIFFERENT CLASSES OF MEN.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the esteem of men, the kingdom of heaven is something like this.
          High there on the summit, there sits the most grand rabbi, the right
          venerable, estimable and excellent doctor of divinity, the great
          philosopher, the highly learned, the deeply instructed, the immensely
          intellectual man. He sits on the apex: he is the highest, because he
          is the wisest. And just below him there is a class of men who are
          deeply studied -- not quite so skilled as the former, but still
          exceeding wise, -- who look down at those who stand at the basement of
          the pyramid, and who say to them, "Ah, they are the ignoble multitude,
          they know nothing at all." A little lower down, we come to the sober,
          respectable, thinking men, not those who set up for teachers, but
          those who seldom will be taught, because they already in their own
          opinion know all that is to be learned. Then after them there come a
          still larger number of very estimable folks, who are exceeding wise in
          worldly wisdom, although not quite so exalted as the philosopher and
          the rabbi. Lower still come those who have just a respectable amount
          of wisdom and knowledge, and then at the very basement there come the
          fool, and the little child, and the babe. When we look at these we
          say, "This is the wisdom of this world. Behold how great a difference
          there is between the babe at the bottom, and the learned doctor on the
          summit! How wide the distinction between the ignorant simpleton who
          forms the hard, rocky, stubborn basement, and the wise man of polished
          marble, who there stands resplendent at the apex of the pyramid." Now,
          just see how Christ turns the world upside down. There it stands. He
          just reverses it. "Except ye be converted, and become as little
          children, ye can in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven." "Not
          many great men after the flesh, not many mighty men are chosen; but
          God hath chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, heirs of the
          kingdom." It is just turning the whole social fabric upside down; and
          the wise man finds now that he has to go upstairs towards his
          simplicity. He has been all his life trying as far as he could, to get
          away from the simplicity of the credulous child, he has been thinking,
          and judging, and weighing, and bringing his logic to cut up every
          truth he heard, and now he has to begin, and go up again: he has to
          become a little child, and turn back to his former simplicity. This is
          the world turned upside down, with a vengeance; and therefore the wise
          seldom love it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish to see the world turned upside down to perfection, just
          turn to the fifth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew: here you have a
          whole summary of the world reversed. Jesus Christ turned the world
          upside down the first sermon he preached. Look at the third verse.
          "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
          Now, we like a man who has an ambitious spirit -- a man who, as we
          say, knows how to push his way in the world -- who looks up -- is not
          contented with the position that he occupies, but is always for
          climbing higher and higher. And we have a very fair opinion too of a
          man, who has a very fair opinion of himself -- a man who is not going
          to bow and cringe. He will have his rights, that he will, he will not
          give way to anybody. He believes himself to be somewhat, and he will
          stand on his own belief, and will prove it to the world yet. He is not
          one of your poor, mean-spirited fellows, who are content with poverty,
          and sit still. He will not be contented. Now such a man as this the
          world admires. But Christ just turns that upside down, and says,
          "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for their's is the kingdom of
          heaven." The men who have no strength of their own, but look for all
          to Christ -- the men who have no spirit to run with a wicked world,
          but who would rather suffer an injury than resent one -- the men who
          are lowly and of a humble carriage, who seek not to lift their heads
          above their fellows; who if they be great have greatness thrust upon
          them, but never seek it -- who are content along the cool, sequestered
          vale of life, to keep the even tenour of their way -- who seem to have
          always ringing in their ears, "Seekest thou great things for thyself?
          Seek them not" -- "the poor in spirit," happy in their poverty, who
          are content with the Lord's providence, and think themselves far more
          rich than they deserve to be. Now, these men Christ says, are blessed.
          The world says, they are soft, they are fools; but Christ puts those
          on the top whom the world puts at the bottom. "Blessed are the poor in
          spirit for their's is the kingdom of heaven."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there is another lot of people in the world; they are always
          mourning. They do not let you see it often, for their Master has told
          them when they fast, to anoint their face, that they appear not unto
          men to fast, but still secretly before God they have to groan; they
          hang their harps upon the willows; they mourn for their own sin, and
          then they mourn for the sin of the times. The world says of these,
          "They are a moping, melancholy set; I would not care to belong to
          their number;" and the gay reveller comes in, and he almost spits upon
          them in his scorn. For what are they? They love the darkness. They are
          the willows of the stream, but this man, like the proud poplar, lifts
          his head, and is swayed to and fro in the wind of his joy, boasting of
          his greatness, and his freedom. Hear how the gay youth talks to his
          mourning friend, who is under conviction of sin. "Ah! yours is a
          morbid disposition; I pity you; you ought to be under the hand of a
          physician. You go mourning through this world. What a miserable thing,
          to be plunging through waves of tribulation! What a dismal case is
          yours! I would not stand in your shoes and be in your position for all
          the world." No, but Christ turns the world upside down; and so those
          people whom you think to be mournful and sorrowful, are the very ones
          who are to rejoice. For read the fourth verse, "Blessed are they that
          mourn; for they shall be comforted." Yes, worldling, your joy is like
          the crackling of thorns under a pot. It blazeth a little, and maketh a
          great noise: it is soon done with. But "light is sown for the
          righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart." You cannot see the
          light now, because it is sown. It lies under the clods of poverty, and
          shame, and persecution, mayhap. But when the great harvest day shall
          come, the blades of light, upstarting at the second coming, shall
          bring forth "the full corn in the ear" of bliss and glory everlasting.
          O ye mourning souls, be glad; for whereas the world puts you beneath
          it, Christ puts you above the world's head. When he turns the world
          upside down, he says you shall be comforted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there is another race of people, called "the meek." You may have
          met with them now and then. Let me describe the opposite. I know a man
          who never feels happy unless he has a law-suit; he would never pay a
          bill unless be had a writ about it. He is fond of law. The idea of
          pulling another up before the court is a great delicacy to him. A
          slight affront he would not easily forget. He has a very large amount
          of meek dignity; and if he be never so slightly touched, if a harsh
          word be spoken against him, or one slander uttered he is down upon his
          enemy at once; for he is a man of a hard temper, and he casts the
          debtor into prison, and verily I say unto thee, if thou gettest in
          there by his writ, thou shalt never come out until thou hast paid the
          uttermost farthing. Now the meek are of a very different disposition.
          You may revile them, but they will not revile again; you may injure
          them, but they know that their Master has said, "I say unto thee,
          resist not evil." They do not put themselves into airs and passions on
          a slight affront, for they know that all men are imperfect, and
          therefore they think that perhaps their brother made a mistake, and
          did not wish to hurt their feelings, and therefore they say, "Well, if
          he did not wish to do it, then I will not be hurt by it, I dare say he
          meant well, and therefore I will take the will for the deed, and
          though he spoke harshly, yet he will be sorry for it to morrow; I will
          not mention it to him, -- I will put up with whatever he chooses to
          say." There is a slander uttered against him: he says, "Well, let it
          alone; it will die of itself; where no wood is, the fire goeth out."
          Another speaketh exceeding ill against him in his hearing; but he
          justs holds his tongue; he is dumb and openeth not his mouth. He is
          not like the sons of Zeruiah, who said to David, "Let us go and take
          off that dead dog's head, because he cursed the king" He says, "No, if
          the Lord hath bidden him curse; let him curse." "Vengeance is mine; I
          will repay, saith the Lord." He is quite content to bear and forbear,
          and put up with a thousand injuries, rather than inflict one; meekly
          and quietly he goes his way through the world, and people say, "Ah!
          such a man as that will never get on; he will always be taken in. Why,
          he will be lending money, and will never get it back again; he will be
          giving his substance to the poor, and he will never receive it. How
          stupid he is! He allows people to infringe on his rights; he has no
          strength of mind; he does not know how to stand up for himself, fool
          that he is." Ay, but Christ turns it upside down, and he says,
          "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth." Is not that
          provoking to you graspers, you high spirited people, you lawyers, you
          that are always trying to bring your neighbor into trouble touching
          your rights? you do it in order that you may inherit the earth: see
          how Christ spites you, and treads your wisdom under feet. He says,
          "The meek shall inherit the earth." After all, very often, the best
          way to get our rights is to let them alone. I am quite certain that
          the safest way to defend your character is never to say a word about
          it. If every person in this place chooses to slander me and utter the
          most furious libels that he pleases, he may rest quite assured he will
          never have a law-suit from me. I am not quite fool enough for that. I
          have always noticed that when a man defends himself in a court of law
          against any slander, he just does his enemy's business with his own
          hand. Our enemies cannot hurt us, unless we hurt ourselves. No man's
          character was ever really injured except by himself. Be you among the
          meek, and you shall inherit the earth. Bear all things, hope all
          things, believe all things, and it shall be the best, even on this
          earth, in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you see that very respectable gentleman yonder, who has never
          omitted to attend his church or his chapel twice every Sunday ever
          since he became a man. He reads his Bible too, and he has family
          prayers. It is true that there are certain stories flying about, that
          he is rather hard upon his laborers, and exacting at times in his
          payments, but does justice to all men, although no further will he go.
          This man is on very good terms with himself; when he gets up in the
          morning he always shakes hands with himself, and compliments himself
          on being a very excellent person. He generally lives in a front
          street, in his opinion, and the first number in the street, too. If
          you speak to him about his state before God, he says, that if he does
          not go to heaven nobody will; for he pays twenty shillings in the
          pound to everybody; he is strictly upright, and there is no one who
          can find any fault with his character. Isn't he a good man? Don't you
          envy him? -- a man who has so excellent an opinion of himself that he
          thinks himself perfect; or if he is not quite perfect, yet he is so
          good that he believes that with a little help, he shall enter into the
          kingdom of heaven. Well, now, do you see standing at the back of the
          church there, a poor woman with tears running down her eyes? Come
          forward, ma'am; let us hear your history. She is afraid to come
          forward; she dares not speak in the presence of respectable persons;
          but we gather thus much from her: She has lately found out that she is
          full of sin, and she desires to know what she must do to be saved. Ask
          her. She tells you she has no merits of her own. Her song is, "I the
          chief of sinners am. Oh! that mercy would save me!" She never
          compliments herself upon her good works, for she says she has none;
          all her righteousnesses are as filthy rags; she puts her mouth in the
          very dust when she prays, and she dares not lift so much as her eyes
          towards heaven. You pity that poor woman. You would not like to be in
          her case. The other man whom I have just mentioned, stands at the very
          top of the ladder, does he not? But this poor woman stands at the
          bottom. Now just see the gospel process -- the world turned upside
          down. "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
          righteousness: for they shall be filled;" while the man who is content
          with himself has this for his portion -- "As many as are of the works
          of the law are under the curse;" publicans and harlots enter into the
          kingdom of heaven before you, because you seek not the righteousness
          which is of faith, but you seek it as it were by the works of the law.
          So here you see again is the world turned upside down in the first
          sermon Christ ever preached.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now turn to the next beatitude -- in the seventh verse -- "Blessed are
          the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy." Of this I have already
          spoken. The merciful are not much respected in this world -- at least
          if they are imprudently merciful, the man who forgives too much, or
          who is too generous, is not considered to be wise. But Christ declares
          that he who has been merciful -- merciful to supply the wants of the
          poor, merciful to forgive his enemies and to pass by offenses, shall
          obtain mercy. Here, again, is the world turned upside down.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God." The world
          says, "Blessed is the man who indulges in a gay life." If you ask the
          common run of mankind who is the happy man, they will tell you, "The
          happy man is he who has abundance of money, and spends it freely, and
          is freed from restraint -- who leads a merry dance of life, who drinks
          deep of the cup of intoxication -- who revels riotously -- who, like
          the wild horse of the prairie, is not bitted by order, or restrained
          by reason, but who dashes across the broad plains of sin, unharnessed,
          unguided, unrestrained." This is the man whom the world calls happy:
          the proud man, the mighty man, the Nimrod; the man who can do just as
          he wishes, and who spurns to keep the narrow way of holiness. Now, the
          Scripture says, Not so; "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall
          see God."
        </p>
        <p>"Blest is the man who shuns the place</p>
        <p>Where sinners love to meet;</p>
        <p>Who fears to tread their wicked ways,</p>
        <p>And hates the scoffer's seat," --</p>
        <p>
          the man who cannot touch one thing because that would be lascivious,
          nor another because that would spoil his communion with his Master; a
          man who cannot frequent this place of amusement, because he could not
          pray there, and cannot go to another, because he could not hope to
          have his Master's sanction upon an hour so spent. That man, pure in
          heart, is said to be a Puritanical moralist, a strict Sabbatarian, a
          man who has not any mind of his own; but Jesus Christ puts all
          straight, for he says, these are the blessed men these are the happy
          ones. "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now look at the ninth verse. What a turning of the world upside
          down that is! You walk through London, and who are the men that we put
          upon our columns and pillars, and upon our park gates, and so on? Read
          the ninth verse, and see how that turns the world upside down. There
          upon the very top of the world, high, high up, can be seen the armless
          sleeve of a Nelson: there he stands, high exalted above his fellows;
          and there, in another place, with a long file up his back, stands a
          duke; and in another place, riding upon a war horse, is a mighty man
          of war. These are the world's blest heroes. Go into the capital of
          what empire you choose to select, and you shall see that the blessed
          men, who are put upon pedestals, and who have statues erected to their
          memory, who are put into our St. Paul's Cathedral, and our Westminster
          Abbey, are not exactly the men mentioned in the ninth verse. Let us
          read it. "Blessed are the peace-makers; for they shall be called the
          children of God." Ah! but you do not often bless the peace-makers, do
          you? The man who comes between two beligerents, and bears the stroke
          himself -- the man who will lie down on the earth, and plead with
          others that they would cease from warfare -- these are the blessed.
          How rarely are they set on high. They are generally set aside, as
          people who cannot be blessed, even though it seem that they try to
          make others so. Here is the world turned upside down. The warrior with
          his garment stained in blood, is put into the ignoble earth, to die
          and rot; but the peace-maker is lifted up, and God's crown of blessing
          is put round about his head, and men one day shall see it, and struck
          with admiration they shall lament their own fully, that they exalted
          the blood-red sword of the warrior, but that they did rend the modest
          mantle of the noon who did make peace among mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          And to conclude our Saviour's sermon, notice once more, that we find
          in this world a race of persons who have always been hated -- a class
          of men who have been hunted like the wild goat; persecuted, afflicted,
          and tormented. As an old divine says, "The Christian has been looked
          upon as if he had a wolfs head, for as the wolf was hunted for his
          head everywhere, so has the Christian been hunted to the uttermost
          ends of the earth." And in reading history we are apt to say, "These
          persecuted persons occupy the lowest room of blessedness; these who
          have been sawn asunder, who have been burned, who have seen their
          houses destroyed, and have been driven as houseless exiles into every
          part of the earth -- these men who have wandered about in sheep's
          skins, and goat's skins, -- these are the very least of mankind." Not
          so. The gospel reverses all this, and it says, "Blessed are they who
          are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for their's is the kingdom of
          heaven." I repeat it: The whole of these beatitudes are just in
          conflict with the world's opinion. and we may quote the words of the
          Jew, and say, "Jesus Christ was the man who turned the world upside
          down.' "
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I find I must be very brief for I have taken so much time in
          endeavoring to show how Christ's gospel turned the world upside down,
          in the position of its characters, that I shall have no space left for
          anything else. But will you have patience with me, and I will briefly
          pass through the other points?
        </p>
        <p>
          I have next to remark, that the Christian religion turns the world
          upside down in its maxims. I will just quote a few texts which show
          this very clearly. "It was said by them of old time, eye for eye and
          tooth for tooth; but I say unto you, resist not evil" It has generally
          been held by each of us, that we are not to allow anyone to infringe
          upon our rights; but the Saviour says, "Whosoever would sue thee at
          the law and take thy cloak, let him take thy coat also." "If any man
          smite thee on the one cheek, turn unto him the other also." If these
          precepts were kept, would it not turn the world upside down? "It has
          been said by them of old time, love thy neighbor and hate thine
          enemy;" but Jesus Christ said, "Let love be unto all men." He commands
          us to love our enemies, and to pray for them who despitefully use us.
          He says, "If thine enemy hunger, feed him, and if he thirst give him
          drink, for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head."
          This would indeed be turning the world upside down; for what would
          become of our war ships and our warriors, if at the port-holes where
          now we put our cannons, we should have sent out to some burning city
          of our enemies -- for instance, to burning Sebastapol, -- if we had
          sent to the houseless inhabitants, who had been driven from their
          homes, barrels of beef, and bundles of bread and clothes, to supply
          their wants. That would have been a reversal of all human policy, but
          yet it would have been just the carrying out of Christ's law, after
          all. So shall it be in the days that are to come, our enemies shall be
          loved, and our foemen shall be fed. We are told too, in these times,
          that it is good to a man to heap unto himself abundant wealth, and
          make himself rich, but Jesus Christ turned the world upside down, for
          he said, there was a certain rich man who was clothed in scarlet, and
          fared sumptuously every day, and so on, and his fields brought forth
          abundantly; and he said, "I will pull down my barns, and build
          greater;" but the Lord says, "Thou fool!" That is reversing everything
          in this world. You would have made an Alderman of him, or a Lord
          Mayor; and fathers would have patted their boys on the head, and said,
          "That is all through his frugality and taking care; see how he has got
          on in the world; when he had got a good crop, he did not give it away
          to the poor, as that extravagant man does who has kept on working all
          his life, and never be able to retire from business; he saved it all
          up; -- be as good a boy as So-and-so, and get on too." But Christ said
          "Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee." A turning
          of everything upside down. And others of us will have it, that we
          ought to be very careful every day, and always looking forward to the
          future, and always fretting about what is to be. Here is a turning of
          the world upside down, when Jesus Christ says, "Remember the ravens;
          they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns, and yet
          your heavenly Father feedeth them, are ye not better than they?" I do
          believe that at this day the maxims of business are clean opposed to
          the maxims of Christ. But I shall be answered by this, "Business is
          business." Yes, I know business is business, but business has no
          business to be such business as it is. Oh! that it might be altered,
          till every man could make his business his religion, and make a
          religion of his business
        </p>
        <p>
          I have not detained you long upon that point; and therefore I am free
          to mention a third. How Christ has turned the world upside down, as to
          our religious notions. Why, the mass of mankind believe, that if any
          man wills to be saved, that is all which is necessary. Many of our
          preachers do in effect preach this worldly maxim. They tell men that
          they must make themselves willing. Now, just hear how the gospel
          upsets that. "It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,
          but of God that showeth mercy." The world will have an universal
          religion too; but how Christ overturns that. "I pray for them; I pray
          not for the world." He hath ordained us from among men. "Elect
          according to the foreknowledge of God, through sanctification of the
          Spirit, and belief of the truth." "The Lord knoweth them that are
          his." How that runs counter to all the world's opinion of religion!
          The world's religion is this -- "Do, and thou shalt live." Christ's
          religion is -- "Believe and live." We will have it, that if a man be
          righteous, sober upright, he shall enter the kingdom of heaven; but
          Christ says -- This thou oughtest to have done; but still, not this
          can ever cleanse thee. "As many as are under the works of the law are
          under the curse." "By the works or the law shall no flesh living be
          justified." " Believe and live," is just the upsetting of every human
          notion. Cast thyself on Christ: trust in him. Have good works
          afterwards; but first of all trust in him that died upon the tree.
          This is the overturning of every opinion of man. And hence mortals
          will always fight against it, so long as the human heart is what it
          is. Oh! that we knew the gospel! Oh! that we felt the gospel! For it
          would be the upsetting of all self-righteousness, and the casting down
          of every high look, and of every proud thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now, beloved, spare me a little time, while I try to show THAT
          WHICH IS TRUE IN THE WORLD, IS TRUE IN THE HEART. Instead, however, of
          enlarging at full length upon the different topics, I shall make my
          last point the subject of examination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Man is a little world, and what God does in the outer world, he does
          in the inner. If any of you would be saved your hearts must be turned
          upside down. I will now appeal to you, and ask you whether you have
          ever felt this -- whether you know the meaning of it?
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, your judgment must be turned upside down. Cannot
          many of you say, that which you now believe to be the truth of God is
          very far opposed to your former carnal notions? Why, if anyone had
          told you, that you should be a believer in the distinguishing
          doctrines of free and sovereign grace, you would have laughed him in
          the face. "What! I believe the doctrine of election? What! I ever hold
          the doctrine of particular redemption, or final perseverance? Pshaw!
          nonsense! It cannot be!" But now you do hold it, and the thing which
          you thought unreasonable and unjust, now seems to you to be for God's
          glory, and for man's eternal benefit. You can kiss the doctrine which
          once you despised, and you meekly receive it as sweeter than the
          droppings of honey from the honeycomb, though once you thought it to
          be as the very poison of asps, and gall, and wormwood. Yes, when grace
          enters the heart, there is a turning upside down of all our opinions;
          and the great truth of Jesus sits reigning on our soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is there not, again, a total change of all your hopes? Why, your hopes
          used to be all for this world. If you could but get rich, if you could
          but be great and honored, you would be happy! You looked forward to
          it. All you were expecting was a paradise this side the flood. And now
          where are your hopes? -- not on earth; for where your treasure is,
          there must your heart be also. You are looking for a city that hands
          have not piled; your desires are heavenly, whereas they were gross and
          carnal once. Can ye say that? Oh! all ye members of this congregation,
          can ye say that your hopes and your desires are changed? Are ye
          looking upward, instead of downward? Are you looking to serve God on
          earth, and to enjoy him for ever? Or are you still content with
          thinking "What ye shall eat, and what ye shall drink, and wherewithal
          ye shall be clothed?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, it is a complete upsetting of all your pleasures. You loved the
          tavern once, you hate it now. You hated God's house once; it is now
          your much-loved habitation. The song, the Sunday newspaper, the lewd
          novel -- all these were sweet to your taste; but you have burned the
          books that once enchanted you, and now the dusty Bible from the back
          of the shelf is taken down, and there it lies wide open upon the
          family table, and it is read both morn and night, much loved, much
          prized and delighted in. The Sabbath was once the dullest day of the
          week to you. you either loitered outside the door in your
          shirt-sleeves, if you were poor, or if you were rich you spent the day
          in your drawing-room, and had company in the evening: now, instead
          thereof, your company you find in the church of the living God, and
          you make the Lord's house the drawing-room where you entertain your
          friends. Your feast is no longer a banquet of wine, but a banquet of
          communion with Christ. There are some of you who once loved nothing
          better than the theater, the low concert room, or the casino: over
          such places you now see a great black mark of the curse, and you never
          go there. You seek now the prayer meeting, the church meeting, the
          gathering of the righteous, the habitation of the Lord God of hosts.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is marvellous how great a change the gospel makes in a man's house
          too. Why, it turns his house upside down. Look over the mantle-piece
          -- There is a vile daub of a picture there, or a wretched print, and
          the subject is worse than the style of the thing. But when the man
          follows Jesus he takes that down, and he gets a print of John Bunyan
          in his prison, or his wife standing before the magistrate, or a print
          of the apostle Paul preaching at Athens, or some good old subject
          representing something Biblical. There is a pack of cards and a
          cribbage board in the cupboard; he turns them out, and instead he puts
          there perhaps the monthly magazine, or mayhaps few works of old
          divines, just here and there one of the publications of the Religious
          Tract Society, or a volume of a Commentary. Every thing is upside down
          there. The children say, "Father is so altered." They never knew such
          a thing. He used to come home sometimes drunk of a night, and the
          children used to run up stairs and be in bed before he came in; and
          now little John and little Sarah sit at the window and watch till he
          comes home; and they go toddling down the street to meet him, and he
          takes one in his arms, and the other by the hand, and brings them home
          with him. He used to teach them to sing "Begone dull care" or
          something worse, now he tells them of "Gentle Jesus meek and mild" or
          puts into their mouth some sweet song of old. A jolly set of
          companions he used to have come to see him, and a roaring party there
          used to be of them, on a Sunday afternoon; but that is all done with.
          The mother smiles upon her husband: she is a happy woman now; she
          knows that he will no longer disgrace himself by plunging into the
          vilest of society, and being seduced into the worst of sins. Now, if
          you could take a man's heart out, and put a new heart right into him,
          it would not be half so good, if it were another natural heart, as the
          change that God works, when he takes out the heart of stone, and puts
          in a heart of flesh --
        </p>
        <p>"A heart resigned, submissive, meek,</p>
        <p>Our dear Redeemer's throne</p>
        <p>Where only Christ is heard to speak,</p>
        <p>Where Jesus reigns alone."</p>
        <p>
          I put, then, the question to you again: Have you been turned upside
          down? How about your companions? You loved those the best who could
          swear the loudest, talk the fastest, and tell the greatest falsehoods:
          now you love those who can pray the most earnestly, and tell you the
          most of Jesus. Everything is changed with you. If you were to meet
          your old self going down the street, you would not know him, except by
          hearsay; you are no relation to him at all. Sometimes the old
          gentleman comes to your house, and he begins to tempt you to go back;
          but you turn him out of doors as soon as you can, and say, "Begone! I
          never got on so long as I knew you; I had a ragged coat to my back
          then, and I was always giving the publican all my money; I never went
          to God's house, but cursed my Maker, and added sin to sin, and tied a
          mill-stone round my neck. So away from me, I will have nothing to do
          with you; I have been buried with Christ, and I have risen with him. I
          am a new man in Christ Jesus, old things have passed away, and behold
          all things have become new."
        </p>
        <p>
          I have some here, however, who belong to a different class of society,
          who could not indulge in any of these things; but ah! ladies and
          gentlemen, if you are ever converted, you must have as great a
          sweeping out as the poorest man that ever lived. There must be as true
          a turning upside down in the salvation of an earl, or a duke, or a
          lord, as in the salvation of a pauper or a peasant. There is as much
          sin in the higher ranks as in the lower, and sometimes more, because
          they have more light, more knowledge, more influence, and when they
          sin, they not only damn themselves, but others too. O you that are
          rich, have you had a change too? Have the frivolities of this world
          become sickening things to you? Do you turn away with loathing from
          the common cant and conventionalism of high life? Have you forsaken
          it? and can you now say, "Although I am in the world, yet am I not of
          it; its pomps and vanities I do eschew; its pride and its glory I
          trample under feet; these are nothing to me; I would follow my Master
          bearing his cross, through evil report and through good report?" If
          such be not the case, if you are not changed, remember, there are no
          exceptions; one truth is true for all -- "Except ye be born again, ye
          cannot see the kingdom of heaven." And that amounts in substance to my
          test: except ye be thoroughly renewed, turned upside down, ye cannot
          be saved. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved;"
          for he that believeth shall be sanctified and renewed -- shall he
          saved at last -- but he that believeth not must be cast away in the
          great day of God's account.
        </p>
        <p>The Lord bless you; for Jesus' sake!<br /></p>
