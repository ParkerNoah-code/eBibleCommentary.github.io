        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.2082)</p>
        <p>Intended for Reading on Lord's-day, May 5th, 1888.</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington,</p>
        <p>On Thursday Evening, October 11th, 1888.</p>

          "And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of
          the Lord shall be delivered." -- Joel 2:32.
        </p>
        <p>
          VENGEANCE was in full career. The armies of divine justice had been
          called forth for war: "They shall run like mighty men; they shall
          climb the wall like men of war." They had invaded and devastated the
          land, and turned the land from being like the garden of Eden into a
          desolate wilderness. All faces gathered blackness: the people were
          "much pained" The sun itself was dim, the moon was dark, and the stars
          withdrew themselves: the earth quaked, and the heavens trembled. At
          such a dreadful time, when we might least have expected it, between
          the peals of thunder and the flashes of lightning, was heard this
          gentle word, "It shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the
          name of the Lord shall be delivered." Let us carefully read the
          passage: "And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth,
          blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into
          darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible
          day of the Lord come. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall
          call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered." In the worst times
          that can ever happen, there is still salvation for men. When day turns
          to night, and life becomes death, and the staff of life is broken, and
          the hope of man has fled, there still remains in God, in the person of
          his dear Son, deliverance to all those who will call upon the name of
          the Lord. We do not know what is to happen: reading the roll of the
          future, we prophesy dark things; but still this light shall always
          shine between the rifts of the cloud-wrack: "Whosoever shall call on
          the name of the Lord shall be delivered."
        </p>
        <p>
          This passage was selected by the apostle at Pentecost to be set in its
          place as a sort of morning star of gospel times. When the Spirit was
          poured out upon the servants and the handmaids, and sons and daughters
          began to prophesy, it was clear that the wondrous time had come, which
          had been foretold so long before. Then Peter, as he preached his
          memorable sermon, told the people, "Whosoever shall call on the name
          of the Lord shall be saved"; thus giving a fuller and yet more
          evangelical meaning to the word "delivered." "Whosoever shall call on
          the name of the Lord shall be delivered" from sin, death and hell --
          shall, in fact, be so delivered as to be, in divine language, "saved"
          -- saved from the guilt, the penalty, the power of sin, saved from the
          wrath to come. These gospel times are still the happy days in which
          "whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved." In the
          Year of Grace we have reached a day and an hour in which "whosoever
          shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved." To you at this
          moment is this salvation sent. The dispensation of immediate
          acceptance proclaimed at Pentecost has never ceased: its fulness of
          blessing has grown rather than diminshed. The sacred promise stands in
          all its certainty, fulness, and freeness: it has lost none of all its
          breadth and length: "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord
          shall be saved."
        </p>
        <p>
          I have nothing to do to-night but to tell you over again the old, old
          story of infinite mercy come to meet infinite sin -- of free grace
          come to lead free will into a better line of things -- of God himself
          appearing to undo man's ruin wrought by man, and to lift him up by a
          great deliverance. May the Holy Spirit graciously aid me while I shall
          talk to you very simply, thus: --
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, THERE IS SOMETHING ALWAYS WANTED. That something is
          deliverance, or "salvation." It is always wanted. It is the requisite
          of man, wherever man is found. As long as there are men on the face of
          the earth, there will always be a need of salvation. I could wish that
          some of you had the instructive schooling which I received last
          Tuesday, when I was sitting to see enquirers. I had a very happy time
          in seeing a very large number of persons who had joyfully put their
          trust in Christ; but among them were some who could not trust -- poor
          hearts, conscious of sin, though they did not think they were. These
          seemed bound hand and foot, shut up in the prison of despair, and
          darkened in heart. I tell you, I felt dismayed as they baffled me: I
          felt a fool as they refused to be comforted. I could do nothing for
          them so far as argument and persuasion were concerned. I could pray
          with them: I could also set them praying, and they did pray: but they
          were cases in which, unless the arm of God were revealed, I was as
          powerless with them as when a man stands weeping over the body of his
          dead wife, and would restore her to life even at the cost of his own
          life, and yet he could produce neither hearing nor motion. Dear
          friends, while we mingle only with those who are saved, we forget how
          much need there is still of a divine salvation. If we could go through
          London, into its dens and slums, we should think very differently of
          human need from what we do when we simply come from our own quiet
          domestic circle, and step into our pew and hear a sermon. The world is
          still sick and dying. The world is still corrupting and rotting. The
          world is a ship in which the water is rising fast, and the vessel is
          going down into the deep of destruction. God's salvation is wanted as
          much to-day as when the spirit preached it in Noah's day to the
          spirits in prison. God must step in, and bring deliverance, or there
          remains no hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some want deliverance from present trouble. If you are in this need
          to-night through very sore distress, I invite you to take my text as
          your guide, and believe that "whosoever shall call on the name of the
          Lord shall be delivered." Depend upon it, in any form of distress,
          physical, mental, or whatever it may be, prayer is wonderfully
          available. "Call upon me," says God, "in the day of trouble: I will
          deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." If you are so down at the
          heel that your foot is on the bare pavement; if you have come to this
          place in bodily sickness, and feel as if you should die on the seat in
          which you sit; if there be no physician to help you, and no friend to
          stretch out a generous hand, call upon God, I beseech you. You have
          come to the end of men; you are now at the beginning of God. See
          whether your Maker will forget you. See whether the great, generous
          heart of God does not still beat tenderly towards the sorrowful and
          the afflicted. If I saw you lying wounded on a battle-field, bleeding
          to death, I would say, "Call upon God." If I knew that you had not a
          house to go to, but must walk these streets all night, I would say,
          "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered." I
          will take the text in the broadest sense, and bid you, nay, command
          you, to test your good and gracious God in the day of your calamity.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is true whenever you come into a position of deep personal
          distress, even though it should not be of a physical kind. When you do
          not know how to act, but are bewildered and at your wits' end, when
          wave of trouble has followed wave of trouble till you are like the
          sailor in the storm who reels to and fro, and staggers like a drunken
          man; if now you cannot help yourself, because your spirit sinks and
          your mind fails, call upon God, call upon God, call upon God! Lost
          child in the wood, with the night fog thickening about you, ready to
          lie down and die, call upon your Father! Call upon God, thou
          distracted one; for "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord
          shall be delivered." In the last great day when all secrets are known,
          it will seem ridiculous that ever persons took to writing tales and
          romances; for the real stories of what God has done for those who cry
          to him are infinitely more surprising. If men and women could but tell
          in simple, natural language how God has come to their rescue in the
          hour of imminent distress, they would set the harps of heaven
          a-ringing with new melodies, and the hearts of saints on earth
          a-glowing with new love to God for his wonderful kindness to the
          children of men. Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness!
          Oh that we could abundantly utter the memory of his great goodness to
          ourselves in the night of our weeping!
        </p>
        <p>
          The text holds good concerning deliverance from future troubles. What
          is to happen in the amazing future we do not know. Some try to startle
          and alarm you with prophecies of what will soon happen; concerning
          whom I would warn you to be well upon your guard. Take small heed of
          what they say. Whatever is to happen according to the Word of God --
          if the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood -- if
          God shall show great wonders in the heavens, and the earth, blood and
          fire, and pillars of smoke, yet remember that though you will then
          assuredly want deliverance, deliverance will still be near at hand.
          The text seems put in a startling connection in order to advise us
          that when the worst and most terrible convulsions shall occur,
          "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved." The
          star Wormwood may fall, but we shall be saved if we call upon the name
          of the Lord. Plagues may be poured out, trumpets may sound, and
          judgments may follow one another as quickly as the plagues of Egypt,
          but "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved."
          When the need of deliverance shall apparently increase, the abundance
          of salvation shall increase with it. Fear not the direst of all wars,
          the bitterest of all famines, the deadliest of all plagues; for still,
          if we call upon the Lord, he is pledged to deliver us. This word of
          promise meets the most terrible of possibilities with a sure
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, and when you come to die, when to you the sun has turned into
          darkness, and the moon into blood, this text ensures deliverance in
          the last dread hour. Call upon the name of the Lord, and you shall be
          saved. Amid the pains of death, and the gloom of departure, you shall
          enjoy a glorious visitation, which shall turn darkness into light, and
          sorrow into joy. When you wake up amid the realities of the eternal
          future there will be nothing for you to dread in resurrection, or in
          judgment, or in the yawning mouth of hell. If you have called upon the
          name of the Lord, you shall still be delivered. Though the unpardoned
          are thrust down to the depth of woe, and the righteous scarcely are
          saved, yet you who have called upon the name of the Lord must be
          delivered. Stands the promise firm, whatever may be hidden in the
          great roll of the future; God cannot deny himself, he will deliver
          those who call upon his name.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is wanted, then, is salvation; and I do think, beloved brethren,
          that you and I who preach the Word, and long to save souls, must very
          often go over this grand old truth about salvation to the guilty,
          deliverance to all who call upon the name of the Lord. Sometimes we
          talk to friends about the higher life, about attaining to very high
          degrees of sanctity; and all this is very proper and very good; but
          still the great fundamental truth is, "Whosoever shall call on the
          name of the Lord shall be saved." We urge our friends to be sound in
          doctrine, and to know what they do know, and to understand the
          revealed will of God; and very proper is this also; but still, first
          and foremost, this is the elementary, all-important truth --
          "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved." To this
          old foundation truth we come back for comfort. I sometimes rejoice in
          God, and joy in the God of my salvation, and spread my wings and mount
          up into communion with the heavenlies; but still there are other
          seasons when I hide my head in darkness, and then I am very glad of
          such a broad, gracious promise as this, "Whosoever shall call on the
          name of the Lord shall be saved." I find that my sweetest, happiest,
          safest state, is just as a poor, guilty, helpless sinner, to call upon
          the name of the Lord, and take mercy at his hands as one who deserves
          nothing but his wrath, while I dare hang the weight of my soul on such
          a sure promise as this, "Whosoever shall can on the name of the Lord
          shall be saved." Get where you may, however high your experience; be
          what you may, however great your usefulness, you will always want to
          come back to the same ground upon which the poorest and weakest of
          hearts must stand, and claim to be saved by almighty grace, through
          simply calling upon the name of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus have I said enough upon what is always wanted -- this
          deliverance, this salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, secondly, let us attentively observe THE WAY IN WHICH THIS
          DELIVERANCE IS TO BE HAD. Help us, blessed Spirit, in this our
          meditation. It is to be had, according to the text, by calling upon
          the name of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is not the most obvious sense of this language, prayer? Are we not
          brought to the Lord by a prayer which trusts in God -- by a prayer
          which asks God to give the deliverance that is needed, and expects to
          have it from the Lord, as a gift of grace ? It amounts to much the
          same thing as that other word, "Believe and live"; for how shall they
          call on him of whom they have not heard? And if they have heard, yet
          vain is their calling if they have not believed as well as heard. But
          to "call on the name of the Lord," is briefly to pray a believing
          prayer; to cry to God for his help, and to leave yourself in his
          hands. This is very simple, is it not? There is no cumbersome
          machinery here, nothing complex and mysterious. No priestly help is
          wanted, except the help of that great High Priest, who intercedes for
          us within the veil. A poor, broken heart pours its distress into the
          ear of God, and calls upon him to fullfil his promise of help in the
          time of need -- that is all. Thank God, nothing more is mentioned in
          our text. The promise is -- "Whosoever shall call on the name of the
          Lord shall be saved."
        </p>
        <p>
          What a suitable way of salvation it is to those who feel that they can
          do nothing! Ah, dear hearts! if we had to preach to them a very
          difficult and elaborate salvation, they would perish. They have not
          the mind, some of them, to follow our directions if they were at all
          intricate; and they have not enough hope to venture upon anything that
          looks at all difficult. But if it be true that "Whosoever shall call
          on the name of the Lord shall be saved," this method is simple and
          available, and they catch at it. He can pray to God who can do nothing
          else. Thank God, he need not want to do anything else; for if he can
          call for help, he gets deliverance, and, in that deliverance, he gets
          all that he will ever want between this place and heaven. He has
          called upon the name of the Lord, and all that is deficient in him
          will be supplied for time and for eternity. He will be delivered, not
          only now, but throughout all the future of his life, until he sees the
          face of God in glory everlasting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text, however, contains within it a measure of specific
          instruction: the prayer must be to the true God. "Whosoever shall call
          on the name of Jehovah shall be saved." There is something distinctive
          here; for one would call on Baal, another would call on Ashtaroth, and
          a fourth on Moloch; but these would not be saved. The promise is
          special: "Whosoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be saved."
          You know that triune name, "Father, Son, and Holy Ghost " -- call upon
          it. You know how the name of Jehovah is set forth most conspicuously
          in the person of the Lord Jesus -- call upon him. Call upon the true
          God. Call upon no idol, call on no Virgin Mary, no saint, dead or
          living. Call on no image. Call on no impression of your mind! Call
          upon the living God -- call upon him who reveals himself in the Bible
          -- call upon him who manifests himself in the person of his dear Son;
          for whosoever shall call upon this God shall be saved. You may call
          upon the idols, but these will not hear you: "Ears have they, but they
          hear not. Eyes have they, but they see not." You may not call upon
          men, for they are all sinners like yourselves. Priests cannot help
          their most zealous admirers; but, "Whosoever shall call on the name of
          Jehovah shall be saved." Mind, then, it is not the mere repetition of
          a prayer as a sort of charm, or a piece of religious witchcraft, but
          you must make a direct address to God, an appeal to the Most High to
          help you in your time of need. In presenting true prayer to the true
          God you shall be delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the prayer should be intelligently presented. We read,
          "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord." Now, by the word
          "name" we understand the person, the character of the Lord. The more,
          then, you know about the Lord, and the better you know his name, the
          more intelligently will you call upon that name. If you know his
          power, you will call upon that power to help you. If you know his
          mercy, you will call upon him in his grace to save you. If you know
          his wisdom, you feel that he knows your difficulties, and can help you
          through them. If you understand his immutability, you will call upon
          him, as the same God who has saved other sinners, to come and save
          you. It will be well, therefore, for you to study the Scriptures much,
          and to pray the Lord to manifest himself to you that you may know him;
          since, in proportion to your acquaintance with him, will you with
          greater confidence be able to call upon his name. But, little as you
          may know, call on him according to the little you do know. Cast
          yourself upon him, whether your trouble to-night be external or
          internal; but especially if it be internal, if it be the trouble of
          sin, if it be the burden of guilt, if it be a load of horror and fear
          because of wrath to come, call upon the name of the Lord, for you
          shall be delivered. There stands his promise. It is not, "He may be
          delivered," but he "shall be." Note well the everlasting "shall" of
          God -- irrevocable, unalterable, unquestionable, irresistible. His
          promise stands eternally the same. Hath he said, and shall he not do
          it? "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved."
        </p>
        <p>
          This way of salvation, by calling upon the name of the Lord, glorifies
          God. He asks nothing of you but that you ask everything of him. You
          are the beggar, and he is the benefactor. You are in the trouble, and
          he is the Deliverer. All you have to do is to trust him, and beg of
          him. This is easy enough. This puts the matter into the hands of the
          Lord, and takes it out of your hands. Do you not like the plan? Put it
          in practice immediately! It will prove itself gloriously effectual.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear friends, I speak to some whom I know to be now present, who are
          under severe trial. You dare not look up. You seem to be given up; at
          any rate you have given yourself up; and yet, I pray you, call upon
          the name of the Lord. You cannot perish praying; no one has ever done
          so. If you could perish praying, you would be a new wonder in the
          universe. A praying soul in hell is an utter impossibility. A man
          calling on God and rejected of God! -- the supposition is not to be
          endured. "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be
          saved." God himself must lie, he must quit his nature, forfeit his
          claim to mercy, destroy his character of love, if he were to let a
          poor sinner call upon his name, and yet refuse to hear him. There will
          come a day, but that is not now -- there will come a day in the next
          state when he will say, "I called, but ye refused" ; but it is not so
          now. While there is life there is hope. "To-day if ye will hear his
          voice, harden not your heart," but call upon God at once; for this
          warrant of grace runneth through all the regions of mortality,
          "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved."
        </p>
        <p>
          I recollect a time when, if I had heard a sermon on this subject,
          putting it plainly to me, I should have leaped into comfort and light
          in a single moment. Is it not such a time with you? I thought, I must
          do something, I must be something, I must in some way prepare myself
          for the mercy of God. I did not know that a calling upon God, a
          trusting myself in his hand, an invocation of his sacred name, would
          bring me to Christ, the Saviour. But so it stands, and happy, indeed,
          was I when I found it out. Heaven is given away. Salvation may be had
          for the asking. I hope that many a captive heart here will at once
          leap to loose his chains, and cry, "It is even so. If God has said it,
          it must be true. There it is in his own Word. I have called upon him,
          and I must be delivered."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now I come to notice, in the third place, THE PEOPLE TO WHOM THIS
          PROMISE AND THIS DELIVERANCE WILL BE GIVEN. "Whosoever shall call upon
          the name of the Lord shall be delivered."
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the connection, the people had been greatly afflicted --
          afflicted beyond all precedent, afflicted to the very brink of
          despair; but the Lord said, "Whosoever shall call on the name of the
          Lord shall be saved." Go down to the hospital. You may select, if you
          please, the hospital which deals with the effects of vice. In that
          house of misery you may stand at each bed and say, "Whosoever shall
          call on the name of the Lord shall be saved." You may then hasten
          every door of every cell, yes, even at the grating of the condemned
          cell, if there lie men and women there given up to death, and you may
          with safety say to each one, "Whosoever shall call upon the name of
          the Lord shall be delivered."
        </p>
        <p>
          I know what the Pharisees will say -- "If you preach this, men will go
          on in sin." It has always been so, that the great mercy of God has
          been turned by some into a reason for continuing in sin; but God (and
          this is the wonder of it) has never restricted his mercy because of
          that. It must have been a terrible provocation of Almighty grace when
          men have perverted his mercy into an excuse for sin, but the Lord has
          never even taken the edges off from his mercy because men have misused
          it: he has still made it stand out bright and clear: "Whosoever shall
          call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." Still he cries, "Turn
          and live." "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man
          his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy
          upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon." Undimmed is
          that brave sun that shineth on the foulest dunghills of vice. Trust
          Christ, and live. Call upon the name of the Lord, and you shall be
          pardoned; yea, you shall be rescued from the bondage of your sin, and
          be made a new creature, a child of God, a member of the family of his
          grace. The most afflicted, and the most afflicted by sin, are met with
          by this gracious promise, "Whosoever shall call on the name of the
          Lord shall be saved."
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, but there were some, according to Joel, who had the Spirit of God
          poured out upon them. What about them? Were they saved by that ? Oh
          no! Those who had the Spirit of God so that they dreamed dreams and
          saw visions, yet had to come to the palace of mercy by this same gate
          of believing prayer -- "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord
          shall be saved." Ah, poor souls! you say, to yourselves, "if we were
          deacons of churches, if we were pastors, oh, then we should be saved!"
          You do not know anything about it: church officers are no more saved
          by their office than you are by being without office. We owe nothing
          to our official position in this matter of salvation: in fact, we may
          owe our damnation to our official standing unless we look well to our
          ways. We have no preference over you plain folks. I do assure you, I
          am quite happy to take your hand, whoever you may be, and come to
          Christ on the same footing as yourself.
        </p>
        <p>"Nothing in my hand I bring,</p>
        <p>Simply to thy cross I cling."</p>
        <p>
          Often, when I have been cheering up a poor sinner, and urging him to
          believe in Christ, I have thought, "Well, if he will not drink this
          cup of comfort, I will even drink it up myself." I assure you, I need
          it as much as those to whom I carry it. I have been as big a sinner as
          any of you, and therefore I take the promise to myself. The divine
          cordial shall not be lost: I will accept it. I came to Jesus as I was,
          weary, and worn, and faint, and sick, and full of sin, and I trusted
          him on my own account, and found peace -- peace on the same ground as
          my text sets before all of you. If I drink of this consolation, you
          may drink it too. The miracle of this cup is that fifty may drink, and
          yet it is just as full as ever. There is no restriction in the word
          "Whosoever." You maidens that have the Spirit of God upon you, and you
          old men that dream, it is neither the Spirit of God nor the dreaming
          that will save you; but your calling on the sacred name. It is,
          "whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved."
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, there were some upon whom the Spirit of God did not fall. They
          did not speak with tongues, nor prophesy the future, nor work
          miracles; but though they did none of these marvels, yet it stood true
          to them -- "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be
          saved." What though no supernatural gift was bestowed, though they saw
          no vision and could not speak with tongues, they called upon the name
          of the Lord, and they were saved. There is the same way of salvation
          for the little as well as for the great, for the poorest and most
          obscure as well as for those that are strong in faith, and lead the
          hosts of God to the battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          But some were terribly afraid. I should think that a good many must
          have been sadly alarmed when there were in the earth blood and fire
          and pillars of smoke, the sun turned into darkness and the moon into
          blood: but, afraid as they were, if they called upon the name of the
          Lord, they were delivered. Now, Mrs. Much-afraid, what do you say to
          that? Mr. Ready-to-halt, did I hear your crutches sounding in the
          aisle just now, or was it an umbrella? Never mind, if you call upon
          the name of the Lord, you shall be saved. You that are so feeble in
          mind, so weak, so wounded that you hardly dare to trust, still it is
          written for your sakes also, "Whosoever shall call on the name of the
          Lord shall be saved."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah!" says another, "but I am worse than that. I have no good
          feelings. I would give all that I have to own a broken heart. I wish I
          could even feel despair, but I am hard as a stone." I have been told
          that sorrowful story many times, and it almost always happens that
          those who most mourn their want of feeling are those who feel most
          acutely. Their hearts are like hell-hardened steel, so they say; but
          it is not true. But if it were true, "Whosoever shall call on the name
          of the Lord shall be saved." Do you think that the Lord wants you to
          give yourself a new heart first, and that then he will save you? My
          dear soul, you are saved when you have a new heart, and you do not
          want him to save you then, since you are saved. "Oh, but I must get
          good feelings!" Must you? Where are you going for them? Are you to
          rake the dunghill of your depraved nature to find good feelings there?
          Come without any good feeling. Come just as you are. Come, you that
          are like a frozen iceberg, that have nothing about you whatever, but
          that which chills and repels; come and call upon the name of the Lord,
          and you shall be saved. "Wonders of grace to God belong." It is not a
          small gospel that he has sent us to preach to small sinners, but ours
          is a great gospel for great sinners. "Whosoever shall call on the name
          of the Lord shall be saved."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah, well!" says one, "I cannot think it is meant for me, for I am
          nobody." Nobody, are you there? I have a great love for nobodies. I am
          worried with somebodies, and the worst somebody in the world is my own
          somebody. How I wish I could always turn my own somebody out, and keep
          company with none but nobodies! Then I should make Jesus everybody.
          Nobody, where are you? You are the very person that I am sent to look
          after. If there is nothing of you, there shall be all the more of
          Christ. If you are not only empty, but cracked and broken; if you are
          done for, destroyed, ruined, utterly crushed and broken, to you is
          this word of salvation sent: -- "Whosoever shall call on the name of
          the Lord shall be saved."
        </p>
        <p>
          I have set the gate wide open. If it were the wrong track, all the
          sheep would go through; but as it is the right road, I may set the
          gate open as long as I will, but yet the sheep will shun it, unless
          thou, Great Shepherd, shall go around the field to-night, and lead
          them in. Take up in thine own arms some sheep that thou hast purchased
          long ago with thy dear heart's blood -- take him upon thy gracious
          shoulders, rejoicing as thou doest it, and place him within the field
          where the good pasture grows.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. I want you to dwell for a minute upon THE BLESSING ITSELF.
          "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered." I
          need not say much about it because I have already expounded it. It is
          a very good rule, when a man makes you a promise, to understand it in
          the narrowest sense. It is fair to him that you should do so. Let him
          interpret it liberally, if he pleases; but he is actually bound to
          give you no more than the bare terms of his promise will imply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, it is a rule which all God's people may well practise, always to
          understand God's promises in the largest possible sense. If the words
          will bear a bigger construction than at the first sight they naturally
          suggest to you, you may put the larger construction upon them. "He is
          able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or even think."
          God never draws a line in his promise, that he may go barely up to it;
          but it is with the great God as it was with his dear Son, who, though
          he was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, yet spent the
          greater part of his time in Galilee, which was called, "Galilee of the
          Gentiles"; and went to the very verge of Canaan to find out a
          Canaanitish woman, that he might give her a blessing. Thou mayest put
          the biggest and most liberal sense, then, on such a text as this, for
          Peter did so. The New Testament is wont to give a broader sense to Old
          Testament words; and it does so most rightly, for God loves us to
          treat his words with the breadth of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, then, if you are the subject of the judgments of God; if you
          believe that God's hand has visited you on account of sin, call upon
          him, and he will deliver you both from the judgment, and from the
          guilt that brought the judgment -- from the sin, and from that which
          follows the sin. He will help you to escape. Try him now, I pray you.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if your case should be different: if you are a child of God and
          you are in trouble, and that trouble eats into your spirit, and causes
          you daily wear of spirit and tear of heart -- call upon the Lord. He
          can take away from you the fret and the trouble too. "Whosoever shall
          call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered." You may have to bear
          the trouble, but it shall be so transformed as to be rather a blessing
          than an evil, and you shall fall in love with your cross, since the
          nature of it has been changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          If sin be the great cause of your present trouble, and that sin has
          brought you into bondage to evil habits, if you have been a drunkard
          and do not know how to learn sobriety, if you have been unchaste and
          have become entangled in vicious connections; call upon God, and he
          can break you away from the sin, and set you free from all its
          entanglements. He can cut you loose to-night with the great sword of
          his grace, and make you a free man. I tell you that, though you should
          be like a poor sheep between the jaws of a lion, ready to be devoured
          immediately by the monster, God can come and pluck you out from
          between the lion's jaws. The prey shall be taken from the mighty, and
          the lawful captive shall be delivered. Only call upon the name of the
          Lord! Call upon the name of the Lord, and you shall be delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, and I repeat what I said just now. If you have come under the
          power of disease, if you are near to die, if already death has written
          his name legibly upon your body, and you are afraid of death and hell;
          yet call upon the name of the Lord, and you shall be delivered at this
          last moment. Even now, when the pit gapes wide for you, and like
          Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, you are ready to go down alive into it,
          call upon the name of the Lord and you shall be delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I were telling you what I had made up, or hammered out of my own
          brain, I could not expect you to believe me; but, as this Book is
          inspired, and as Joel spoke in the name of God, and as the apostles
          spoke in the name of Jehovah, this is the very truth of the God that
          made the heavens and the earth. "Whosoever shall call on the name of
          the Lord shall be delivered."
        </p>
        <p>
          V. In conclusion, I must remind you of one mournful thought. Let me
          warn you OF THE SADLY COMMON NEGLECT OF THIS BLESSING. You would think
          that everybody would call upon the name of the Lord; but read the
          text, "For in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the
          Lord hath said." It shall be there as the Lord hath said. Will they
          not have it then? Notice! "And in the remnant whom the Lord shall
          call." It seems to shrivel me up altogether, that word "remnant."
          What! Will they not come ? Are they madmen? Will they not come? No,
          only a remnant; and even that remnant will not call upon the name of
          the Lord until first God calls them by his grace. This is almost as
          great a wonder as the love which so graciously invites them. Could
          even devils behave worse? If they were invited to call upon God, and
          be saved, would they refuse?
        </p>
        <p>
          Unhappy business! The way is plain, but "few there be that find it."
          After all the preaching, and all the invitation, and the illimitable
          breadth of the promise, yet all that are saved are contained "in the
          remnant whom the Lord shall call." Is not our text a generous
          invitation; the setting open of the door, yea, the lifting of the door
          from off its hinges, that it never might be shut? And yet "broad is
          the gate, and wide is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many
          there be that go in thereat." There they come, streams of them,
          hurrying impatiently, rushing down to death and hell -- yes, eagerly
          panting, hurrying, dashing against one another to descend to that
          awful gulf from which there is no return! No missionaries are wanted,
          no ministers are needed to plead with men to go to hell. No books of
          persuasion are wanted to urge them to rush onward to eternal ruin.
          They hurry to be lost: they are eager to be destroyed. As when the
          wild bisons of the prairie hasten onward in their madness, until they
          come to a great gulf, and then rush down headlong, a cataract of life
          leaping to death, so is it with the sons of men! They choose their own
          delusions, and covet their own damnations, and that without end. This
          is all that sovereign mercy rescues after all -- a remnant, and that
          remnant only because the arm of the Lord is revealed, and a miraculous
          power exerted upon their wills. This is the misery of it, that the
          guilty are not willing to be parted from their sins. They will not
          seek that which alone is their life, their joy, their salvation. They
          prefer hell to heaven, sin to holiness. Never spake the Master a word
          which observation more clearly proves than when he said, "Ye will not
          come to me, that ye might have life." You will attend your chapels,
          but you will not call on the Lord. Jesus cries, "Ye search the
          scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are
          they which testify of me; but ye will not come to me, that ye might
          have life." You will do anything rather than come to Jesus. You stop
          short of calling upon him. O my dear hearers, do not let it be so with
          you! Many of you are saved; I beseech you intercede for those who are
          not saved. Oh, that the unconverted among you may be moved to pray.
          Before you leave this place, breathe an earnest prayer to God, saying,
          "God be merciful to me a sinner. Lord, I need to be saved. Save me. I
          call upon thy name." Join with me in prayer at this moment, I entreat
          you. Join with me while I put words into your mouths, and speak them
          on your behalf -- "Lord, I am guilty. I deserve thy wrath. Lord I
          cannot save myself. Lord, I would have a new heart and a right spirit,
          but what can I do? Lord, I can do nothing, come and work in me to will
          and to do of thy good pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>"Thou alone hast power, I know,</p>
        <p>To save a wretch like me;</p>
        <p>To whom, or whither should I go</p>
        <p>If I should turn from thee?"</p>
        <p>
          But I now do from my very soul call upon thy name. Trembling, yet
          believing, I cast myself wholly upon thee, O Lord. I trust the blood
          and righteousness of thy dear Son; I trust thy mercy, and thy love,
          and thy power, as they are revealed in him. I dare to lay hold upon
          this word of thine, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord
          shall be saved. Lord, save me to-night, for Jesus' sake. Amen."
