        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.128)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, April 19, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>"Wherefore then serveth the law? " -- Galatians 3:19.</p>
        <p>
          THE APOSTLE, by a highly ingenious and powerful argument, had proved
          that the law was never intended by God for the justification and
          salvation of man. He declares that God made a covenant of grace with
          Abraham long before the law was given on Mount Sinai; that Abraham was
          not present at Mount Sinai, and that, therefore, there could have been
          no alteration of the covenant made there by his consent; that,
          moreover, Abraham's consent was never asked as to any alteration of
          the covenant, without which consent the covenant could not have been
          lawfully changed, and, besides that, that the covenant stands fast and
          firm, seeing it was made to Abraham's seed, as well as to Abraham
          himself. "This I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of
          God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after,
          cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect. For
          if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God
          gave it to Abraham by promise." Therefore, no inheritance and no
          salvation ever can be obtained by the law. Now, extremes are the error
          of ignorance. Generally, when men believe one truth, they carry it so
          far as to deny another; and, very frequently, the assertion of a
          cardinal truth leads men to generalise on other particulars, and so to
          make falsehoods out of truth. The objection supposed may be worded
          thus: "You say, O Paul, that the law cannot justify; surely then the
          law is good for nothing at all; Wherefore then serveth the law?' If it
          will not save a man, what is the good of it? If of itself it will
          never take a man to heaven, why was it written? Is it not a useless
          thing?" The apostle might have replied to his opponent with a sneer --
          he must have said to him, "Oh, fool, and slow of heart to understand.
          Is it proved that a thing is utterly useless because it is not
          intended for every purpose in the world? Will you say that, because
          iron cannot be eaten, therefore, iron is not useful? And because gold
          cannot be the food of man, will you, therefore, cast gold away, and
          call it worthless dross? Yet on your foolish supposition you must do
          so. For, because I have said the law cannot save, you have foolishly
          asked me what is the use of it? and you foolishly suppose God's law is
          good for nothing, and can be of no value whatever." This objection is,
          generally, brought forward by two sorts of people. First, by mere
          cavillers who do not like the gospel, and wish to pick all sorts of
          holes in it. They can tell us what they do not believe; but they do
          not tell us what they do believe. They would fight with everybody's
          doctrines and sentiments, but they would be at a loss if they were
          asked to sit down and write their own opinions. They do not seem to
          have got much further than the genius of the monkey, which can pull
          everything to pieces, but can put nothing together. Then, on the other
          hand, there is the Antinomian, who says, "Yes, I know I am saved by
          grace alone;" and then breaks the law -- says, it is not binding on
          him, even as a rule of life; and asks, "Wherefore then serveth the
          law?" throwing it out of his door as an old piece of furniture only
          fit for the fire, because, forsooth, it is not adapted to save his
          soul. Why, a thing may have many uses, if not a particular one. It is
          true that the law cannot save; and yet it is equally true that the law
          is one of the highest works of God, and is deserving of all reverence,
          and extremely useful when applied by God to the purposes for which it
          was intended.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, pardon me my friends, if I just observe that this is a very
          natural question, too. If you read the doctrine of the apostle Paul
          you find him declaring that the law condemns all mankind. Now, just
          let us for one single moment take a bird's eye view of the works of
          the law in this world. Lo, I see, the law given upon Mount Sinai. The
          very hill doth quake with fear. Lightnings and thunders are the
          attendants of those dreadful syllables which make the hearts of Israel
          to melt Sinai seemeth altogether on the smoke. The Lord came from
          Paran, and the Holy One from Mount Sinai; "He came with ten thousand
          of his saints." Out of his mouth went a fiery law for them. It was a
          dread law even when it was given, and since then from that Mount of
          Sinai an awful lava of vengeance has run down, to deluge, to destroy,
          to burn, and to consume the whole human race, if it had not been that
          Jesus Christ had stemmed its awful torrent, and bidden its waves of
          fire be still. If you could see the world without Christ in it, simply
          under the law you would see a world in ruins, a world with God 8 black
          seal put upon it, stamped and sealed for condemnation; you would see
          men, who, if they knew their condition, would have their hands on
          their loins and be groaning all their days -- you would see men and
          women condemned, lost, and ruined; and in the uttermost regions you
          would see the pit that is digged for the wicked, into which the whole
          earth must have been cast if the law had its way, apart from the
          gospel of Jesus Christ our Redeemer. Ay, beloved, the law is a great
          deluge which would have drowned the world with worse than the water of
          Noah's flood, it is a great fire which would have burned the earth
          with a destruction worse than that which fell on Sodom, it is a stern
          angel with a sword, athirst for blood, and winged to slay; it is a
          great destroyer sweeping down the nations; it is the great messenger
          of God's vengeance sent into the world. Apart from the gospel of Jesus
          Christ, the law is nothing but the condemning voice of God thundering
          against mankind. "Wherefore then serveth the law?" seems a very
          natural question. Can the law be of any benefit to man? Can that Judge
          who puts on a black cap and condemns us all this Lord Chief Justice
          Law, can he help in salvation? Yes, he did; and you shall see how he
          does it, if God shall help us while we preach. "Wherefore then serveth
          the law?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The first use of the law is to manifest to man his guilt. When God
          intends to save a man, the first thing he does with him is to send the
          law to him, to show him how guilty, how vile, how ruined he is, and in
          how dangerous a position. You see that man lying there on the edge of
          the precipice; he is sound asleep, and just on the perilous verge of
          the cliff. One single movement, and he will roll over and be broken in
          pieces on the jagged rocks beneath, and nothing more shall be heard of
          him. How is he to be saved? What shall be done for him -- what shall
          be done! It is our position; we, too, are lying on the brink of ruin,
          but we are insensible of it. God, when he begins to save us from such
          an imminent danger, sendeth his law, which, with a stout kick, rouses
          us up, makes us open our eyes, we look down on our terrible danger,
          discover our miseries, and then it is we are in a right position to
          cry out for salvation, and our salvation comes to us. The law acts
          with man as the physician does when he takes the film from the eye of
          the blind. Self-righteous men are blind men, though they think
          themselves good and excellent. The law takes that film away, and lets
          them discover how vile they are, and how utterly ruined and condemned
          if they are to abide under the sentence of the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, however, of treating this doctrinally, I shall treat it
          practically, and come home to each of your consciences. My, hearer,
          does not the law of God convince you of sin this morning? Under the
          hand of God's Spirit does it not make you feel that you have been
          guilty, that you deserve to be lost, that you have incurred the fierce
          anger of God? Look ye here, have ye not broken these ten commandments;
          even in the letter have ye not broken them? Who is there among you who
          hath always honored his father and mother? Who is there among us who
          hath always spoken the truth? Have we not sometimes borne false
          witness against our neighbor? Is there one person here who has not
          made unto himself another God, and loved himself, or his business, or
          his friends, more than he has Jehovah, the God of the whole earth?
          Which of you hath not coveted your neighbour's house, or his
          man-servant, or his ox, or his ass? We are all guilty with regard to
          every letter of the law; we have all of us transgressed the
          commandments. And if we really understood these commandments, and felt
          that they condemned us, they would have this useful influence on us of
          showing us our danger, and so of leading us to fly to Christ. But, my
          hearers, does not this law condemn you, because even if you should say
          you have not broken the letter of it, yet you have violated the spirit
          of it. What, though you have never killed, yet we are told, he that is
          angry with his brother is a murderer. As a negro said once, "Sir, I
          thought me no kill -- me innocent there; but when I heard that he that
          hateth his brother is a murderer, then me cry guilty, for me have
          killed twenty men before breakfast very often, for I have been angry
          with many of them very often." This law does not only mean what it
          says in words, but it has deep things hidden in its bowels. It says,
          "Thou shalt not commit adultery," but it means, as Jesus has it, "He
          that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with
          her already in his heart." It says, "Thou shalt not take the name of
          the Lord thy God in vain," it meaneth that we should reverence God in
          every place, and have his fear before our eyes, and should always pay
          respect unto his ordinances and evermore walk in his fear and love.
          Ay, my brethren, surely there is not one here so fool-hardy in
          self-righteousness as to say, "I am innocent." The spirit of the law
          condemns us. And this is its useful property; it humbles us, makes us
          know we are guilty, and so are we led to receive the Saviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark this, moreover, my dear hearers, one breach of this law is enough
          to condemn us for ever. He that breaketh the law in one point is
          guilty of the whole. The law demands that we should obey every
          command, and one of them broken, the whole of them are injured. It is
          like a vase of surpassing workmanship, in order to destroy it you need
          not shiver it to atoms, make but the smallest fracture in it and you
          have destroyed its perfection. As it is a perfect law which we are
          commanded to obey, and to obey perfectly, make but one breach thereof
          and though we be ever so innocent we can hope for nothing from the
          lay; except the voice, "Ye are condemned, ye are condemned, ye are
          condemned." Under this aspect of the matter ought not the law to strip
          many of us of all our boasting? Who is there that shall rise in his
          place and say, "Lord, I thank thee I am not as other men are?" Surely
          there cannot be one among you who can go home and say, "I have tithed
          mint and cummin; I have kept all the commandments from my youth?" Nay,
          if this law be brought home to the conscience and the heart we shall
          stand with the publican, saying, "Lord, be merciful to me a sinner."
          The only reason why a man thinks he is righteous is because he does
          not know the law. You think you have never broken it because you do
          not understand it. There are some of you most respectable people; you
          think you have been so good that you can go to heaven by your own
          works. You would not exactly say so, but you secretly think so; you
          have devoutly taken the sacrament, you have been mightily pious in
          attending your church or chapel regularly, you are good to the poor,
          generous and upright, and you say, "I shall be saved by my works."
          Nay, sir, look to the flame that Moses saw, and shrink, and tremble,
          and despair. The law can do nothing for us except condemn us. The
          utmost it can do is to whip us out of our boasted self-righteousness
          and drive us to Christ. It puts a burden on our backs and makes us ask
          Christ to take it off. It is like a lancet, it probes the wound. It
          is, to use a parable as when some dark cellar has not been opened for
          years and is full of all kinds of loathsome creatures, we may walk
          through it not knowing they are there. But the law comes, takes the
          shutters down, lets light in, and then we discover what a vile heart
          we have, and how unholy our lives have been; and, then, instead of
          boasting, we are made to fall on our faces and cry, "Lord, save or I
          perish. Oh, save me for thy mercy's sake, or else I shall be cast
          away." Oh, ye self-righteous ones now present, who think yourselves so
          good that ye can mount to heaven by your works -- blind horses,
          perpetually going round the mill and making not one inch of progress
          -- do you think to take the law upon your shoulders as Sampson did the
          gates of Gaza? Do you imagine that you can perfectly keep this law of
          God? Will you dare to say, you have not broken it. Nay, surely, you
          will confess, though it be in but an under tone, "I have revolted."
          Then, this know: the law can do nothing for you in the matter of
          forgiveness. All it can do is just this: It can make you feel you are
          nothing at all; it can strip you; it can bruise you; it can kill you,
          but it can neither quicken, nor clothe, nor cleanse -- it was never
          meant to do that. Oh, art thou this morning, my hearer, sad, because
          of sin? Dost thou feel that thou hast been guilty? Dost thou
          acknowledge thy transgression? Dost thou confess thy wandering? Hear
          me, then, as God's ambassador, God hath mercy upon sinners. Jesus
          Christ came into the world to save sinners. And though you have broken
          the law, he has kept it. Take his righteousness to be yours. Cast
          yourself upon him. Come to him now, stripped and naked and take his
          robe as your covering, Come to him, black and filthy, and wash
          yourself in the fountain opened for sin and uncleanness; and then you
          shall know "wherefore then serveth the law?" That is the first point.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, the second. The law serves to slay all hope of salvation of a
          reformed life. Most men when they discover themselves to be guilty,
          avow that they will reform. They say, "I have been guilty and have
          deserved God's wrath, but for the future I will seek to win a stock of
          merits which shall counterbalance all my old sins." In steps the law,
          puts its hand on the sinner's mouth, and says, "Stop, you cannot do
          that, it is impossible." I will show you how the law does this. It
          does it partly thus, by reminding the man that future obedience can be
          no atonement for past guilt. To use a common metaphor that the poor
          may thoroughly understand me, you have run up a score at your chop.
          Well, you cannot pay it. You go off to Mrs. Brown, your shopkeeper,
          and you say to her, "Well, I am sorry, ma'am, that through my husband
          being out of work," and all that, "I know I shall never be able to pay
          you. It is a very great debt I owe you, but, if you please ma'am, if
          you forgive me this debt I will never get into your debt any more; I
          will always pay for all I have." "Yes," she would say, "but that will
          not square our accounts. If you do pay for all you have, it would be
          no more than you ought to do. But what about the old bills? How are
          they to be receipted? They won't be receipted by all your fresh
          payments." That is just what men do towards God. "True," they say, "I
          have gone far astray I know; but then I won't do so any more." Ah, it
          was time you threw away such child's talk. You do but manifest your
          rampant folly by such a hope. Can you wipe away your trangression by
          future obedience? Ah, no. The old debt must be paid somehow. God's
          justice is inflexible, and the law tells you all your requirements can
          make no atonement for the past. You must have an atonement through
          Christ Jesus the Lord. "But," says the man, "I will try and be better,
          and then I think I shall have mercy given to me." Then the law steps
          in and says, "You are going to try and keep me, are you? Why, man, you
          cannot do it." Perfect obedience in the future is impossible. And the
          ten commandments are held up, and if any awakened sinner will but look
          at them, he will turn away and say, "It is impossible for me to keep
          them." "Why, man, you say you will be obedient in the future. You have
          not been obedient in the past, and there is no likelihood that you
          will keep God's commandments in time to come. You say you will avoid
          the evils of the past. You cannot. Can the Ethiopian change his skin,
          or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good that are accustomed
          to do evil.'" But you say "I will take greater heed to my ways." "Sir,
          you will not; the temptation that overcame you yesterday will overcome
          you to-morrow. But, mark this, if you could, you could not win
          salvation by it." The law tells you that unless you perfectly obey you
          cannot be saved by your doings, it tells you that one sin will make a
          flaw in it all, that one transgression will spoil your whole
          obedience. It is a spotless garment that you must wear in heaven; it
          is only an unbroken law which God can accept. So, then, the law
          answers this purpose, to tell men that their acquirements, their
          amendings, and their doings, are of no use whatever in the matter of
          salvation. It is theirs to come to Christ, to get A new heart and a
          right spirit; to get the evangelical repentance which needeth not to
          be repented of, that so they may put their trust in Jesus and receive
          pardon through his blood. "Wherefore then serveth the law?" It serveth
          this purpose, as Luther hath it, the purpose of a hammer. Luther, you
          know, is very strong on the subject of the law. He says, "For if any
          be not a murderer, an adulterer, a thief, and outwardly refrain from
          sin, as the Pharisee did, which is mentioned in the gospel, he would
          swear that he is righteous, and therefore he conceiveth an opinion of
          righteousness, and presumeth of his good works and merits. Such a one
          God cannot otherwise mollify and humble, that he may acknowledge his
          misery and damnation, but by the law, for that is the hammer of death,
          the thundering of hell, and the lightning of God's wrath, that beateth
          to powder the obstinate and senseless hypocrites. For as long as the
          opinion of righteousness abideth in man, so long there abideth also in
          him incomprehensible pride, presumption, security, hatred of God,
          contempt of his grace and mercy, ignorance of the promises and of
          Christ. The preaching of free remission of sins, through Christ,
          cannot enter into the heart of such a one, neither can he feel any
          taste or savor thereof; for that mighty rock and adamant wall, to wit,
          the opinion of righteousness, wherewith the heart is environed, doth
          resist it. Wherefore the law is that hammer, that fire, that mighty
          strong wind, and that terrible earthquake rending the mountains, and
          breaking the rocks, (1 Kings 19:11-13) that is to say, the proud and
          obstinate hypocrites. Elijah, not being able to abide these terrors of
          the law, which by these things are signified, covered his face with
          his mantle. Notwithstanding, when the tempest ceased, of which he was
          a beholder, there came a soft and a gracious wind, in the which the
          Lord was; but it behoved that the tempest of fire, of wind, and the
          earthquake should pass, before the Lord should reveal himself in that
          gracious wind."

          III. And now, a step further. You that know the grace of God can
          follow me in this next step. The law is intended to show man the
          misery which will, fall upon him through his sin. I speak from
          experience, though young I be, and many of you who hear me will hear
          this with ears of attention, because you have felt the same. There was
          a time with me, when but young in years, I felt with much sorrow the
          evil of sin. My bones waxed old with my roaring all day long. Day and
          night God's hand was heavy upon me. There was a time when he seared me
          with visions, and affrighted me by dreams; when by day I hungered for
          deliverance, for my soul fasted within me: I feared lest the very
          skies should fall upon me, and crush my guilty soul. God's law had got
          hold upon me, and was strewing me my misery. If I slept at night I
          dreamed of the bottomless pit, and when I awoke I seemed to feel the
          misery I had dreamed. Up to God's house I went; my song was but a
          groan. To my chamber I retired, and there with tears and groans I
          offered up my prayer, without a hope and without a refuge. I could
          then say with David, "The owl is my partner and the bittern is my
          companion," for God's law was flogging me with its ten-thonged whip,
          and then rubbing me with brine afterwards, so that I did shake and
          quiver with pain and anguish, and my soul chose strangling rather than
          life, for I was exceeding sorrowful. Some of you have had the same.
          The law was sent on purpose to do that. But, you will ask, "Why that
          misery?" I answer, that misery was sent for this reason: that I might
          then be made to cry to Jesus. Our heavenly Father does not usually
          make us seek Jesus till he has whipped us clean out of all our
          confidence; he cannot make us in earnest after heaven till he has made
          us feel something of the intolerable tortures of an aching conscience,
          which has foretaste of hell. Do you not remember, my hearer, when you
          used to awake in the morning, and the first thing you took up was
          Alleine's Alarm, or Baxter's Call to the Unconverted? Oh, those books,
          those books, in my childhood I read and devoured them when under a
          sense of guilt, but they were like sitting at the foot of Sinai. When
          I turned to Baxter, I found him saying some such things as these: --
          "Sinner, bethink thee, within an hour thou mayest be in hell. Bethink
          thee; thou mayest soon be dying -- death is even now gnawing at thy
          cheek. What wilt thou do when thou standest before the bar of God
          without a Saviour? Wilt thou tell him thou hadst no time to spend on
          religion? Will not that empty excuse melt into thin air? Oh, sinner,
          wilt thou, then, dare to insult thy Maker? Wilt thou, then, dare to
          scoff at him? Bethink thee; the flames of hell are hot and the wrath
          of God is heavy. Were thy bones of steel, and thy ribs of brass, thou
          mightest quiver with fear. Oh, hadst thou the strength of a giant,
          thou couldst not wrestle with the Most High. What wilt thou do when he
          shall tear thee in pieces, and there shall be none to deliver thee?
          What wilt thou do when he shall fire off his ten great guns at thee?
          The first commandment shall say, Crush him; he hath broken me!' The
          second shall say, Damn him; he hath broken me!' The third shall say, A
          curse upon him; he hath broken me!' And so shall they all let fly upon
          thee; and thou without a shelter, without a place to flee to, and
          without a hope." Ah! you have not forgotten the days when no hymn
          seemed suitable to you but the one that began,
        </p>
        <p>"Stoop down my soul that used to rise</p>
        <p>Converse awhile with death</p>
        <p>Think how a gasping mortal lies,</p>
        <p>And pants away his breath."</p>
        <p>Or else,</p>
        <p>"That awful day shall surely come,</p>
        <p>The pointed hour makes haste,</p>
        <p>When I must stand before my Judge,</p>
        <p>And pass the solemn test."</p>
        <p>
          Ay, that was why the law was sent -- to convince us of sin, to make us
          shake and shiver before God. Oh! you that are self-righteous, let me
          speak to you this morning with just a word or two of terrible and
          burning earnestness. Remember, sirs, the day is coming when a crowd
          more vast than this shall be assembled on the plains of earth; when on
          a great white throne the Saviour, Judge of men, shall sit. Now, he is
          come; the book is opened; the glory of heaven is displayed, rich with
          triumphant love, and burning with unquenchable vengeance; ten thousand
          angels are on either hand; and you are standing to be tried. Now,
          self-righteous man, tell me now that you went to church three times a
          day! Come, man, tell me now that you kept all the commandments! Tell
          me now that you are not guilty! Come before him with a receipt of your
          mint, and your anise, and your cummin! Come along with you! Where are
          you? Oh, you are fleeing. You are crying, "Rocks hide us; mountains on
          us fall." What are you after, man? Why, you were so fair on earth that
          none dare to speak to you; you were so good and so comely; why do you
          run away? Come, man, pluck up courage; come before thy Maker; tell him
          that thou wert honest, sober, excellent, and that thou deservest to be
          saved! Why dost thou delay to repeat thy boastings? Out with it --
          come, say it! No, you will not. I see you still flying, with shrieks,
          away from your Maker's presence. There will be none found to stand
          before him, then, in their own righteousness. But look! look! look! I
          see a man coming forward out of that motley throng; he marches forward
          with a steady step, and with a smiling eye. What! is there any man
          found who shall dare to approach the dread tribunal of God? What! is
          there one who dares to stand before his Maker? Yes, there is one; he
          comes forward, and he cries, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of
          God's elect?" Do you not shudder? Will not the mountains of wrath
          swallow him? Will not God launch that dreadful thunderbolt against
          him? No; listen while he confidently proceeds: "Who is he that
          condemneth? It is Christ that died; yea, rather, that hath risen
          again." And I see the right hand of God outstretched -- "Come, ye
          blessed, enter the kingdom prepared for you." Now is fulfilled the
          verse which you once sweetly sang: --
        </p>
        <p>"Bold shall I stand in that great day,</p>
        <p>For who aught to my charge shall lay?</p>
        <p>While, through thy blood, absolv'd I am</p>
        <p>From sin's tremendous curse and shame."</p>
        <p>
          IV. And now, my dear friends, I am afraid of wearying you; therefore,
          let me briefly hint at one other thought. "Wherefore then serveth the
          law." It was sent into the world to shew the value of a Saviour. Just
          as foils set off jewels, and as dark spots make bright tints more
          bright, so doth the law make Christ appear the fairer and more
          heavenly. I hear the law of God curse, but how harsh its voice. Jesus
          says, "come unto me;" oh, what music! all the more musical after the
          discord of the law. I see the law condemns; I behold Christ obeying
          it. Oh! how ponderous that price -- when I know how weighty was the
          demand! I read the commandments, and I find them strict and awfully
          severe -- oh! how holy must Christ have been to obey all these for me!
          Nothing makes me value my Saviour more than seeing the law condemn me.
          When I know this law stands in my way, and like a flaming cherubim
          will not let me enter paradise, then I can tell how sweetly precious
          must Jesus Christ's righteousness be, which is a passport to heaven,
          and gives me grace to enter there.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. And, lastly, "Wherefore serveth the law." It was sent into the
          world to keep Christian men from self-righteousness. Christian men --
          do they ever get self-righteous? Yes, that they do. The best Christian
          man in the world will find it hard work to keep himself from boasting,
          and from being self-righteous. John Knox on his death-bed was attacked
          with self-righteousness. The last night of his life on earth, he slept
          some hours together, during which he uttered many deep and heavy
          moans. Being asked why he moaned so deeply, he replied, "I have during
          my life sustained many assaults of Satan; but at present he has
          assaulted me most fearfully, and put forth all his strength to make an
          end of me at once. The cunning Serpent has labored to persuade me,
          that I have merited heaven and eternal blessedness by the faithful
          discharge of my ministry. But blessed be God, who has enabled me to
          quench this fiery dart, by suggesting to me such passages as these:
          What hast thou that thou hast not received?' and, By the grace of God
          I am what I am.'" Yes, and each of us have felt the same. I have often
          felt myself rather amused at some of my brethren, who have come to me,
          and said, "I trust the Lord will keep you humble," when they
          themselves were not only as proud as they were high, but a few inches
          over. They have been most sincere in prayer that I should be humble,
          unwittingly nursing their own pride by their own imaginary reputation
          for humility. I have long since given up entreating people to be
          humble, because it naturally tends to make them proud. A man is apt to
          say, "Dear me, these people are afraid I shall be proud; I must have
          something to be proud of." Then we say to ourselves, "I will not let
          them see it;" and we try to keep our pride down, but after all, are as
          proud as Lucifer within. I find that the proudest and most
          self-righteous people are those who do nothing at all, and have no
          shadow of presence for any opinion of their own goodness. The old
          truth in the book of Job is true now. You know in the beginning of the
          book of Job it is said, "The oxen were ploughing, and the asses were
          feeding beside them." That is generally the way in this world. The
          oxen are ploughing in the church -- we have some who are laboring hard
          for Christ -- and the asses are feeding beside them, on the finest
          livings and the fattest of the land. These are the people who have so
          much to say about self-righteousness. What do they do? They do not do
          enough to earn a living, and yet they think they are going to earn
          heaven. They sit down and fold their hands, and yet they are so
          reverently righteous, because forsooth they sometimes dole out a
          little in charity. They do nothing, and yet boast of
          self-righteousness. And with Christian people it is the came. If God
          makes you laborious, and keeps you constantly engaged in his service,
          you are less likely to be proud of our self-righteousness than you are
          if you do nothing. But at all times there is a natural tendency to it.
          Therefore, God has written the law, that when we read it we may see
          our faults; that when we look into it, as into a looking-glass, we may
          see the impurities in our flesh, and have reason to abhor ourselves in
          sackcloth and ashes, and still cry to Jesus for mercy. Use the law in
          this fashion, and in no other.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, says one, "Sir, are there any here that you have been
          preaching at?" Yes, I like to preach at people. I do not believe it is
          of any avail to preach to people; preach right into them and right at
          them. I find in every circle a class, who say, in plain English,
          "Well, I am as good a father as is to be found in the parish, I am a
          good tradesman; I pay twenty shillings in the pound; I am no Sir John
          Dean Paul; I go to church, or I go to chapel, and that is more than
          everybody does; I pay my subscriptions -- I subscribe to the
          infirmary; I say my prayers; therefore, I believe I stand as good a
          chance of heaven as anybody in the world." I do believe that three out
          of four of the people of London think something of that sort. Now, if
          that be the ground of your trust, you have a rotten hope; you have a
          plank to stand upon that will not bear your weight in the day of God's
          account As the Lord my God liveth, before whom I stand, "Unless your
          righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees,
          ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven." And if ye think
          the best performance of your hands can save you, this know, that
          "Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not
          attained to the law of righteousness." Those who sought not after it
          have attained it. Wherefore? Because the one hath sought it by faith,
          the other hath sought it by the deeds of the law, where justification
          never was to be found. Hear, now, the gospel, men and women; down with
          that boasting form of your righteousness; away with your hopes, with
          all your trusts that spring from this --
        </p>
        <p>"Could your tears for ever flow,</p>
        <p>Could your zeal no respite know,</p>
        <p>All for sin could not atone;</p>
        <p>Christ must save, and save alone."</p>
        <p>
          If ye would know how we must be saved, hear this -- ye must come with
          nothing of your own to Christ. Christ has kept the law. You are to
          have his righteousness to be your righteousness. Christ has suffered
          in the stead of all who repent. His punishment is to stand instead of
          your being punished. And through faith in the sanctification and
          atonement of Christ, you are to be saved. Come, then, ye weary and
          heavy laden, bruised and mangled by the Fall, come then, ye sinners,
          come, then, ye moralists, come, then, all ye that have broken God's
          law and feel it, leave your own trusts and come to Jesus, he will take
          you in, give you a spotless robe of righteousness, and make you his
          for ever. "But how can I come?" says one; "Must I go home and pray?"
          Nay, sir, nay. Where thou art standing now, thou mayest come to the
          cross. Oh, if thou knowest thyself to be a sinner, now -- I beseech
          you, ere thy foot shall leave the floor on which thou standest -- now,
          say this --
        </p>
        <p>"Myself into thy arms I cast:</p>
        <p>Lord, save my guilty soul at last."</p>
        <p>
          Now, down with you, away with your self-righteousness. Look to me --
          look, now; say not, "Must I mount to heaven and bring Christ down?"
          "The word is nigh thee, on thy mouth and in thy heart; if thou shalt
          confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe with thy heart,
          thou shalt be saved." Yes, thou -- thou -- thou. Oh! I bless God, we
          have heard of hundreds who have in this place believed on Christ. Some
          of the blackest of the human race have come to me but even lately, and
          told me what God has done for them. Oh, that you, too, would now come
          to Jesus. Remember, he that believeth shall be saved, be his sins
          never so many; and he that believeth not, must perish, be his sins
          never so few. Oh, that the Holy Spirit would lead you to believe; so
          should ye escape the wrath to come? and have a place in paradise among
          the redeemed!
