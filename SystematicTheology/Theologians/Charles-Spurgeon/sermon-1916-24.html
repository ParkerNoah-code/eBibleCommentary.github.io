        <p>Unpublished Notes of a Sermon</p>
        <p>Intended for Reading on Lord's-Day, April 17th, 1892,</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>Delivered at Bethesda Chapel, Swansea</p>
        <p>On June 25th, 1861.</p>
        <p>From Sword and Trowel</p>
        <p>
          Note: On Tuesday, June 25th, 1861, the beloved C. H. Spurgeon visited
          Swansea. The day was wet, so the services could not be held in the
          open-air; and, as no building in the town was large enough to hold the
          vast concourses of people who had come from all parts to hear the
          renowned preacher, he consented to deliver two discourses in the
          morning; first at Bethesda, and then at Trinity Chapel. At each place
          he preached for an hour and a quarter. The weather cleared up during
          the day; so, in the evening, Mr. Spurgeon addressed an immense
          gathering of people in the open-air. -- T.W.M.

          "All that the Father giveth Me shall come to Me; and him that cometh
          to Me I will in no wise cast out." -- John 6:37.
        </p>
        <p>
          What a difference there is between the words of Christ, and those of
          all mere men! Most men speak many words, yet say but little; Christ
          speaks few words, yet says very much. In modern books, you may read
          scores of pages, and scarcely come across a new thought; but when
          Christ speaks, every syllable seems to tell. He hits the nail on the
          head each time He lifts the hammer of His Word. The Words of Christ
          are like ingots of solid gold; we preachers too often beat out the
          gold so thin, that whole acres of it would scarcely be worth a
          farthing. The Words of Christ are always to be distinguished from
          those of His creatures, not only for their absolute truthfulness, but
          also for their profound fulness of matter. In all His language He is
          "full of grace and truth." Look at the text before us. Here we have,
          in two small sentences, the sum and substance of all theology. The
          great questions which have divided the Church in all ages, the
          apparently contradictory doctrines which have set one minister of
          Christ against his fellow, are here revealed so simply and plainly,
          "that he may run that readeth" (Habakkuk ii.2). Even a child may
          understand the Words of Christ, though perhaps the loftiest human
          intellect cannot fathom the mystery hidden therein.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take the first sentence of my text: "All that the Father giveth Me
          shall come to Me." What a weighty sentence! Here we have taught us
          what is called, in the present day, "High Calvinistic doctrine" -- the
          purpose of God; the certainty that God's purpose will stand; the
          invincibility of God's will; and the absolute assurance that Christ
          "shall see of the travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied."
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at the second sentence of my text: "And him that cometh to me I
          will in no wise cast out." Here we have the richness, the fulness, the
          unlimited extent of the power of Christ to save those who put their
          trust in Him. Here is a text upon which one might preach a thousand
          sermons. We might take these two sentences as a life-long text, and
          never exhaust the theme.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark, too, how our Lord Jesus Christ gives us the whole truth. We have
          many ministers who can preach well upon the first sentence: "All that
          the Father giveth Me shall come to Me." Just set them going upon
          Election, or everlasting covenant engagements, and they will be
          earnest and eloquent, for they are fond of dwelling upon these points,
          and a well-instructed child of God can hear them with delight and
          profit. Such preachers are often the fathers of the Church, and the
          very pillars thereof; but, unfortunately, many of these excellent
          brethren cannot preach so well upon the second sentence of my text:
          "And him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out." When they get
          to that truth, they are half afraid of it; they hesitate to preach
          what they consider to be a too open salvation. They cannot give the
          gospel invitation as freely as they find it in the Word of God. They
          do not deny it, yet they stutter and stammer sadly, when they get upon
          this theme.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, on the other hand, we have a large number of good ministers who
          can preach on this second clause of the text, but they cannot preach
          on the first clause. How fluent is their language as they tell out the
          freeness of salvation! Here they are much at home in their preaching;
          but, we are sorry to be compelled to say that, very often, they are
          not much at home when they come to doctrinal matters, and they would
          find it rather a difficult matter to preach fluently on the first
          sentence of my text. They would, if they attempted to preach from it,
          endeavour to cut out of it all that savours of Divine Sovereignty.
          They do not preach the whole "truth" which "is in Jesus."
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is it that some of us do not see both sides of God's revealed
          truth? We persist in closing one eye; we will not see all that may be
          seen if we open both our eyes; and, sometimes, we get angry with a
          brother because he can see a little more than we do. I think our text
          is very much like a stereoscopic picture, for it presents two views of
          the truth. Both views are correct, for they are both photographed by
          the same light. How can we bring these two truths together? We get the
          stereoscope of the scripture, and looking with both eyes, the two
          pictures melt into one. God has given us, in His Word, the two
          pictures of divine truth; but we have not all got the stereoscope
          properly adjusted to make them melt into one. When we get to heaven,
          we shall see how all God's truth harmonizes. If we cannot make these
          two parts of truth harmonize now, at any rate we must not dare to blot
          out one of them, for God has given them both.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as God shall help me this morning, I want to expand both
          sentences of my text with equal fidelity and plainness. I shall not
          expect to please some of you while speaking on the first sentence, and
          I shall not be surprised if I fail to please others of you when I come
          to the second sentence; but, in ether case, it will be a small matter
          to me if I have an easy conscience because I have proclaimed what I
          believe to be the whole truth of God. I am sure you will be willing to
          give a patient hearing to that which you may not fully receive, if you
          believe it to be declared in all honesty. Reject what I say, if it be
          not true, but if it be the Word of God, receive it; and, be it known
          unto you that it is at your peril if you dare to reject the truthful
          Word of the glad tidings of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I will begin with the first sentence of the text: "All that the
          Father giveth Me shall come to Me." We have here, first, THE FIRM
          FOUNDATION UPON WHICH OUR SALVATION RESTS.
        </p>
        <p>
          It rests, you perceive, not on something which man does, but on
          something which God the Father does. The Father gives certain persons
          to His Son, and the Son says, "All that the Father giveth Me Shall
          come to Me." I take it that the meaning of the text is this, -- that,
          if any do come to Jesus Christ, it is those whom the Father gave to
          Christ. And the reason why they come, -- if we search to the very
          bottom of things, -- is, that the Father puts it into their hearts to
          come. The reason why one man is saved, and another man is lost, is to
          be found in God; not in anything which the saved man did, or did not
          do; not in anything which he felt, or did not feel; but in something
          altogether irrespective of himself, even in the sovereign grace of
          God. In the day of God's power, the saved are made willing to give
          their souls to Jesus. The language of Scripture must explain this
          point. "As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the
          sons of God, even to them that believe on His name: which were born,
          not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man,
          but of God" (John i.12, 13). "So then it is not of him that willeth,
          nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy" (Romans
          ix.16). If you want to see the fount of grace, you must go to the
          everlasting God; even as, if you want to know why that river runs in
          this direction, and not in that, you must trace it up to its source.
          In the case of every soul that is now in heaven, it was the will of
          God that drew it thither. In the case of every spirit that is on its
          way to glory now, unto God and unto Him alone must be the honour of
          its salvation; for He it is who makes one "differ from another" (1
          Cor. iv.7).
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not care to argue upon this point, except I put it thus: If any
          say, "It is man himself who makes the difference," I reply, "You are
          involving yourself in a great dilemma; if man himself makes the
          difference, then mark -- man himself must have the glory." Now, I am
          certain you do not mean to give man the glory of his own salvation;
          you would not have men throw up their caps in heaven, and shout, "Unto
          ourselves be the glory, for we, ourselves, were the hinge and turning
          point of our own salvation." No, you would have all the saved cast
          their crowns at the feet of Jesus, and give to Him alone all the
          honour and all the glory. This, however, cannot be, unless, in that
          critical point, that diamond hinge upon which man's salvation shall
          turn, God shall have the control, and not the will of man. You know
          that those who do not believe this truth as a matter of doctrine, do
          believe it in their hearts as a matter of experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was preaching, not very long ago, at a place in Derbyshire, to a
          congregation, nearly all of whom were Methodists, and as I preached,
          they were crying out, "Hallelujah! Glory! Bless the Lord!." They were
          full of excitement, until I went on to say in my sermon, "This brings
          me to the doctrine of Election." There was no crying out of "Glory!"
          and "Hallelujah!" then. Instead, there was a great deal of shaking of
          the head, and a sort of telegraphing round the place, as though
          something dreadful was coming. Now, I thought, I must have their
          attention again, so I said, "You all believe in the doctrine of
          Election?" "No, we don't, lad," said one. "Yes, you do, and I am going
          to preach it to you, and make you cry 'Hallelujah!' over it." I am
          certain they mistrusted my power to do that; so, turning a moment from
          the subject, I said, "Is there any difference between you and the
          ungodly world?" "Ay! Ay! Ay!" "Is there any difference between you and
          the drunkard, the harlot, the blasphemer?" "Ay! Ay! Ay!" Ay! there was
          a difference indeed. "Well, now," I said, "there is a great
          difference; who made it, then?" for, whoever made the difference,
          should have the glory of it. "Did you make the difference?" "No, lad,"
          said one; and the rest all seemed to join in the chorus. "Who made the
          difference, then? Why, the Lord did it; and did you think it wrong for
          Him to make a difference between you and other men?" "No, no," they
          quickly said. "Very well, then; if it was not wrong for God to make
          the difference, it was not wrong for Him to purpose to make it, and
          that is the doctrine of Election." Then they cried, "Hallelujah!" as I
          said they would.
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of Election is God's purposing in His heart that He would
          make some men better than other men; that He would give to some men
          more grace than to other men; that some should come out and receive
          the mercy; that others, left to their own free will, should reject it;
          that some should gladly accept the invitations of mercy, while others,
          of their own accord, stubbornly refuse the mercy to which the whole
          world of mankind is invited. All men, by nature, refuse the
          invitations of the gospel. God, in the sovereignty of His grace, makes
          a difference by secretly inclining the hearts of some men, by the
          power of His Holy Spirit, to partake of His everlasting mercy in
          Christ Jesus. I am certain that, whether we are Calvinists or
          Arminians, if our hearts are right with God, we shall all adoringly
          testify: "We love Him, because He first loved us." If that be not
          Election, I know not what it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, in the second place, note THE CERTAINTY OF THE ETERNAL
          SALVATION OF ALL WHO WERE GIVEN TO JESUS; "All that the Father giveth
          Me shall come to Me."
        </p>
        <p>
          This is eternally settled, and so settled that it cannot be altered by
          either man or devil. All whose names are written in the Book of Life
          of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, all whom God the
          Father designed to save when He gave up His well-beloved Son to die
          upon the cross of Calvary, shall in time be drawn by the Holy Spirit,
          and shall surely come to Christ, and be kept by the Spirit, through
          the precious blood of Christ, and be folded for ever with His sheep,
          on the hill-tops of glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark! "All that the Father giveth Me shall come to Me." Not one of
          those whom the Father hath given to Jesus shall perish. If any were
          lost, the text would have to read: "Almost all," or, "All but one;"
          but it positively says "All," without any exception; even though one
          may have been, in his unregenerate state, the very chief of sinners.
          Yet even that chosen one, that given one, shall come to Jesus; and
          when he has come, he shall be held by that strong love that at first
          chose him, and he shall never be let go, but shall be held fast, even
          unto the end. Miss Much-afraid, and Mrs. Despondency, and Mr.
          Feeble-mind, shall as certainly come to the arms of Christ, as Mr.
          Great-heart, and Mr. Faithful, and Mr. Valiant-for-Truth. If one jewel
          were lost from Christ's crown, then Christ's crown would not be
          all-glorious. If one member of the body of Christ were to perish,
          Christ's body would not be complete. If one of those who are one with
          Christ should miss his way to eternal life, Christ would not be a
          perfect Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          "All that the Father giveth Me Shall come to Me." "But suppose they
          will not come?" I cannot suppose any such thing, for He says they
          "shall come." They shall be made willing in the day of God's power.
          God knows how to make a passage through the heart of man; and though
          man is a free agent, yet God can incline him, willingly, to come to
          Jesus. There are many sentences even in Wesley's hymn-book which
          contain this truth. If God took away freedom from man, and then saved
          him, it would be but a small miracle. For God to leave man free to
          come to Jesus, and yet to so move him as to make him come, is a
          divinely-wrought miracle indeed. If we were for a moment to admit that
          man's will could be more than a match for God's will, do you not see
          where we should be landed? Who made man? God! Who made God? Shall we
          lift up man to the sovereign throne of Deity? Who shall be master, and
          have his way, God or man? The will of God, that says they "shall
          come", knows how to make them come.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But suppose it should be one of those who are living in the interior
          of Africa, and he does not hear the gospel; what then?" He shall hear
          the gospel; either he shall come to the gospel, or the gospel shall go
          to him. Even if no minister should go to such a chosen one, he would
          have the gospel specially revealed to him rather than that the promise
          of the Almighty God should be broken.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But suppose there should be one of God's chosen who has become so bad
          that there is no hope for him? He never attends a place of worship;
          never listens to the gospel; the voice of the preacher never reaches
          him; he has grown hardened in his sin, like steel that has been seven
          times annealed in the fire; what then?" That man shall be arrested by
          God's grace, and that obdurate, hard-hearted one shall be made to see
          the mercy of God; the tears shall stream down his cheeks, and he shall
          be made willing to receive Jesus as Saviour. I think that, as God
          could bend my will, and bring me to Christ, He can bring anybody.
        </p>
        <p>"Why was I made to hear His voice,</p>
        <p>And enter while there's room;</p>
        <p>When thousands make a wretched choice,</p>
        <p>And rather starve than come?</p>
        <p>"'Twas the same love the spread the feast,</p>
        <p>That sweetly forced me in;</p>
        <p>Else I had still refused to taste,</p>
        <p>And perish'd in my sin."</p>
        <p>
          Yes, "sweetly forced me in;" -- there is no other word that can so
          accurately describe my case. Oh, how long Jesus Christ stood at the
          door of my heart, and knocked, and knocked, and knocked in vain! I
          asked: "Why should I leave the pleasures of this world?" Yet still He
          knocked, and there was music in every sound of His pleading voice; but
          I said, "Nay, let Him go elsewhere." And though, through the window, I
          could see His thorn-crowned head, and the tears standing in His eyes,
          and the prints of the nails in His hands, as He stood and knocked, and
          said, "Open to Me," yet I heeded Him not. Then He sent my mother to
          me, and she pleaded, "let the Saviour in, Charlie;" and I replied, in
          action, though not in words, "Nay, I love thee, my mother; but I do
          not love Christ, thy Saviour." Then came the black hours of sickness;
          but in effect I said, "Nay, I fear not sickness, nor death itself; I
          will still defy my Maker." But it happened, one day, that He
          graciously put in His hand by the hole of the door, and I moved toward
          Him, and then I opened the door, and cried, "Come in! Come in!" Alas!
          alas! He was gone; and for five long years I stood, with tears in mine
          eyes, and I sought Him weeping, but I found Him not. I cried after
          Him, but He answered me not. I said, "Whither is He gone? Oh, that I
          had never rejected Him? Oh, that He would but come again!" Surely the
          angels must then have said, "A great change has come over that youth;
          he would not let Christ in when He knocked, but now he wants Christ to
          come." And when He did come, do you think my soul rejected Him? Nay,
          nay; but I fell down at His feet, crying, "Come in! Come in! thou
          Blessed Saviour. I have waited for Thy salvation, O my God!"
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no living soul beyond the reach of hope, no chosen one whom
          Christ cannot bring up even from the very gates of hell. He can bare
          His arm, put out His hand, and pluck the brand "out of the fire"
          (Zechariah iii.2). In a horrible pit, in the miry clay, His jewels
          have been hidden; but down from the throne of light He can come, and
          thrusting in His arm of mercy, He can pull them out, and cause them to
          glitter in His crown for ever. Let it be settled in our hearts, as a
          matter of fact, that what God has purposed to do, He will surely
          accomplish.
        </p>
        <p>
          I need not dwell longer upon this point, because I think I have really
          brought out the essence of this first sentence of my text: "All that
          the Father giveth Me shall come to Me." Permit me just to remark,
          before I pass on, that I am sometimes sad on account of the alarm that
          some Christians seem to have concerning this precious and glorious
          doctrine. We have, in the Baptist denomination, -- I am sorry to have
          to say it, -- many ministers, excellent brethren, who, while they
          believe this doctrine, yet never preach it. On the other hand, we have
          some ministers, excellent brethren, who never preach anything else.
          They have a kind of barrel-organ that only plays five tunes, and they
          are always repeating them. It is either Election, Predestination,
          Particular Redemption, Effectual Calling, Final Perseverance, or
          something of that kind; it is always the same note. But we have also a
          great many others who never preach concerning these doctrines, though
          they admit they are doctrines taught in Sacred Scripture. The reason
          for their silence is, because they say these truths are not suitable
          to be preached from the pulpit. I hold such an utterance as that to be
          very wicked. Is the doctrine here -- in this Bible? If it is, as God
          hath taught it, so are we to teach it. "But," they say, "not in a
          mixed assembly." Where can you find an unmixed assembly? God has sent
          the Bible into a mixed world, and the gospel is to be preached in "
          all the world", and "to every creature." "Yes," they say, "preach the
          gospel, but not these special truths of the gospel; because, if you
          preach these doctrines, the people will become Antinomians and
          Hyper-Calvinists." Not so; the reason why people become
          Hyper-Calvinists and Antinomians, is because some, who profess to be
          Calvinists, often keep back part of the truth, and do not, as Paul
          did, "declare all the counsel of God"; they select certain parts of
          Scripture, where their own particular views are taught, and pass by
          other aspects of God's truth. Such preachers as John Newton, and in
          later times, your own Christmas Evans, were men who preached the whole
          truth of God; they kept back nothing that God has revealed; and, as
          the result of their preaching, Antinomianism could not find a
          foot-hold anywhere. We should have each doctrine of Scripture in its
          proper place, and preach it fully; and if we want to have a genuine
          revival of religion, we must preach these doctrines of Jehovah's
          sovereign grace again and again. Do not tell me they will not bring
          revivals. There was but one revival that I have ever heard of, apart
          from Calvinistic doctrine, and that was the one in which Wesley took
          so great a part; but then George Whitefield was there also to preach
          the whole Word of God. When people are getting sleepy, if you want to
          arouse and wake them up thoroughly, preach the doctrine of Divine
          Sovereignty to them; for that will do it right speedily.

        <p>
          III. I shall now turn very briefly to the second sentence of my text:
          "And him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now," says somebody, "he is going to knock down all that he has been
          building up." Well, I would rather be inconsistent with myself than
          with my Master; but I dare not alter this second sentence, and I have
          no desire to alter it. Let it stand as it is, all its glorious
          simplicity: --
        </p>
        <p>"HIM THAT COMETH TO ME I WILL IN NO WISE CAST OUT."</p>
        <p>
          Let the whole world come, still this promise is big enough to embrace
          them all in its arms. There is no mistake here, the wrong man cannot
          come. If any sinner come to Christ, he is sure to be the right one.
          Mark, too, as there is no limitation in the person coming, so there is
          no limitation in the manner of the coming. Says one, "Suppose I come
          the wrong way?" You cannot come the wrong way; it is written, "No man
          can come to Me, except the Father which hath sent Me draw him." "No
          man can come unto Me, except it were given unto him of My Father"
          (John vi.44,65). If, then, you come to Christ in any way, you are
          drawn of the Father, and He cannot draw the wrong way. If you come to
          Christ at all, the power and will to come have been given you of the
          Father. If you come to Christ, He will in no wise cast you out; for no
          possible or conceivable reason will Jesus ever cast out any sinner who
          comes to Him. There is no reason in hell, or on earth, or in heaven,
          why Jesus should cast out the soul that comes to Him. If Satan, the
          foul accuser of the brethren, brings reasons why the coming sinner
          should not be received, Jesus will "cast down" the accuser, but He
          will not "cast out" the sinner. "Come unto Me, all ye that labour, and
          are heavy laden, and I will give your rest," is still His invitation
          and His promise, too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us suppose a case by the way of illustration. Here is a man in
          Swansea, -- ragged, dirty, coal-begrimed, -- who has received a
          message from Her Most Gracious Majesty, Queen Victoria. It reads in
          this wise: "You are hereby commanded to come, just as you are, to our
          palace at Windsor, to receive great and special favours at our hand.
          You will stay away at your peril." The man reads the message, and at
          first scarcely understands it; so he thinks, "I must wash and prepare
          myself." Then, he re-reads the royal summons, and the words arrest
          him: "Come just as your are." So he starts, and tells the people in
          the train where he is going, and they laugh at him. At length he
          arrives at Windsor Castle; there he is stopped by the guard, and
          questioned. He explains why he has come, and shows the Queen's
          message; and he is allowed to pass. He next meets with a gentlemen in
          waiting, who, after some explanations and expressions of astonishment,
          allows him to enter the ante-room. When there, our friend becomes
          frightened on account of his begrimed and ragged appearance; he is
          half inclined to rush from the place with fear, when he remembers the
          works of the royal command: "Stay away at your peril." Presently, the
          Queen herself appears, and tells him how glad she is that he has come
          just as he was. She says she purposes that he shall be suitably
          clothed, and be made one of the princes of her court. She adds, "I
          told you to come as you were. It seemed to be a strange command to
          you, but I am glad you have obeyed, and so come."
        </p>
        <p>
          I do think this is what Jesus Christ says to every creature under
          heaven. The gospel invitation runs thus: "Come, come, come to Christ,
          just as you are." "But, let me feel more." No, come just as you are.
          "But let me get home to my own room, and let me pray." No, no, come to
          Christ just as you are. As you are, trust in Jesus, and He will save
          you. Oh, do dare to trust Him! If anybody shall ask, "Who are you?"
          answer, "I am nobody." If anyone objects, "You are such a filthy
          sinner," reply, "Yes,'tis true, so I am; but He Himself told me to
          come." If anyone shall say, "You are not fit to come," say, "I know I
          am not fit; but He told me to come." Therefore, --
        </p>
        <p>"Come, ye sinners, poor and wretched,</p>
        <p>Weak and wounded, sick and sore;</p>
        <p>Jesus ready stands to save you,</p>
        <p>Full of pity join'd with power;</p>
        <p>He is able,</p>
        <p>He is willing; doubt no more.</p>
        <p>"Let not conscience make you linger,</p>
        <p>Nor of fitness fondly dream;</p>
        <p>All the fitness He requireth,</p>
        <p>Is to feel you need of Him:</p>
        <p>This He gives you;</p>
        <p>'Tis the Spirit's rising beam."</p>
        <p>
          Sinner, trust in Jesus: and if thou dost perish trusting in Jesus, I
          will perish with thee. I will make my bed in hell, side by side with
          thee, sinner, if thou canst perish trusting in Christ, and thou shalt
          lie there, and taunt me to all eternity for having taught thee
          falsely, if we perish. But that can never be; those who trust in Jesus
          shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of His hand. Come
          to Jesus, and He will in no wise cast thee out.
        </p>
        <p>
          May the Lord bless the words I have spoken! Though hastily suggested
          to my mind, and feebly delivered to you, the Lord bless them, for
          Christ's sake! Amen.<br />
