        <p>A Sermon</p>

        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, December 23rd, 1855, by the</p>

        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          |But thou, Beth-lehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the
          thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that
          is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old,
          from everlasting.| -- Micah 5:2.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS is the season of the year when, whether we wish it or not, we are
          compelled to think of the birth of Christ. I hold it to be one of the
          greatest absurdities under heaven to think that there is any religion
          in keeping Christmas-day. There are no probabilities whatever that our
          Saviour Jesus Christ was born on that day, and the observance of it is
          purely of Popish origin; doubtless those who are Catholics have a
          right to hallow it, but I do not see how consistent Protestants can
          account it in the least sacred. However, I wish there were ten or a
          dozen Christmas-days in the year; for there is work enough in the
          world, and a little more rest would not hurt labouring people.
          Christmas-day is really a boon to us; particularly as it enables us to
          assemble round the family hearth and meet our friends once more.
          Still, although we do not fall exactly in the track of other people, I
          see no harm in thinking of the incarnation and birth of the Lord
          Jesus. We do not wish to be classed with those
        </p>
        <p>|Who with more care keep holiday</p>
        <p>The wrong, than others the right way.|</p>
        <p>
          The old Puritans made a parade of work on Christmas-day, just to show
          that they protested against the observance of it. But we believe they
          entered that protest so completely, that we are willing, as their
          descendants, to take the good accidentally conferred by the day, and
          leave its superstitions to the superstitious.
        </p>
        <p>
          To proceed at once to what we have to say to you: we notice, first,
          who it was that sent Christ forth. God the Father here speaks, and
          says, |Out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be the ruler
          in Israel.| Secondly, where did he come to at the time of his
          incarnation? Thirdly, what did he come for? |To be ruler in Israel.|
          Fourthly, had he ever come before? Yes, he had. |Whose goings forth
          have been from of old, from everlasting.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, WHO SENT JESUS CHRIST? The answer is returned to us by
          the words of the text. |Out of thee| saith Jehovah, speaking by the
          mouth of Micah, I out of thee shall he come forth unto me.| It is a
          sweet thought that Jesus Christ, did not come forth without his
          Father's permission, authority, consent, and assistance. He was sent
          of the Father, that he might be the Saviour of men. We are, alas! too
          apt to forget, that while there are distinctions as to the persons in
          the Trinity, there are no distinctions of honor; and we do very
          frequently ascribe the honor of our salvation, or at least the depths
          of its mercy and the extremity of its benevolence, more to Jesus
          Christ than we do to the Father. This is a very great mistake. What if
          Jesus came? Did not his Father send him? If he was made a child did
          not the Holy Ghost beget him? If he spake wondrously, did not his
          Father pour grace into his lips, that he might be an able minister of
          the new covenant? If his Father did forsake him when he drank the
          bitter cup of gall, did he not love him still? and did he not, by-and
          by, after three days, raise him from the dead, and at last receive him
          up on high, leading captivity captive? Ah! beloved, he who knoweth the
          Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost as he should know them, never
          setteth one before another; he is not more thankful to one than the
          other; he sees them at Bethlehem, at Gethsemane, and on Calvary, all
          equally engaged in the work of salvation. |He shall come forth unto
          me.| O Christian, hast thou put thy confidence in the man Christ
          Jesus? Hast thou placed thy reliance solely on him? And art thou
          united with him? Then believe that thou art united unto the God of
          heaven; since to the man Christ Jesus thou art brother and holdest
          closest fellowship, thou art linked thereby with God the Eternal, and
          |the Ancient of days| is thy Father and thy friend. |He shall come
          forth unto me|. Did you never see the depth of love there was in the
          heart of Jehovah, when God the Father equipped his Son for the great
          enterprise of mercy? There had been a sad day in Heaven once before,
          when Satan fell, and dragged with him a third of the stars of heaven,
          and when the Son of God launching from his great right hand the
          Omnipotent thunders, dashed the rebellious crew to the pit of
          perdition; but if we could conceive a grief in heaven, that must have
          been a sadder day, when the Son of the Most High left his Father's
          bosom, where he had lain from before all worlds |Go,| saith the
          Father, |and thy Father's blessing on thy head!| Then comes the
          unrobing. How do angels crowd around to see the Son of God take off
          his robes He laid aside his crown; he said, |My father, I am Lord over
          all, blessed for ever, but I will lay my crown aside, and be as mortal
          men are.| He strips himself of his bright vest of glory; |Father,| he
          says, |I will wear a robe of clay, just such a men wear.| Then he
          takes off all those jewels wherewith he was glorified; he lays aside
          his starry mantles and robes of light, to dress himself in the simple
          garments of the peasant of Galilee. What a solemn disrobing that must
          have been! And next, can you picture the dismissal! The angels attend
          the Saviour through the streets, until they approach the doors: when
          an angel cries, |Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lifted up
          ye everlasting doors, and let the king of glory through!| Oh! methinks
          the angels must have wept when they lost the company of Jesus -- when
          the Sun of Heaven bereaved them of all its light. But they went after
          him. They descended with him; and when his spirit entered into flesh
          and he became a babe, he was attended by that mighty host of angels,
          who after they had been with him to Bethlehem's manger, and seen him
          safely, laid on his mother's breast, in their journey upwards appeared
          to the shepherds and told them that he was born king of the Jews. The
          Father sent him! Contemplate that subject. Let your soul get hold of
          it, and in every period of his life think that he suffered what the
          Father willed; that every step of his life was marked with the
          approval of the great I AM. Let every thought that you have of Jesus
          be also connected with the eternal, ever-blessed God; for |he,| saith
          Jehovah, |shall come forth unto me.| Who sent him, then? The answer
          is, his Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, secondly, WHERE DID HE COME TO? A word or two concerning
          Bethlehem. It seemed meet and right that our Saviour should be born in
          Bethlehem and that because of Bethlehem's history, Bethlehem's name,
          and Bethlehem's position -- little in Judah.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, it seemed necessary that Christ should be born in Bethlehem,
          because of Bethlehem's history. Dear to every Israelite was the little
          village of Bethlehem. Jerusalem might outshine it in splendour; for
          there stood the temple, the glory of the whole earth, and |beautiful
          for situation, the joy of the whole earth was Mount Zion;| yet around
          Bethlehem there clustered a number of incidents which always made it a
          pleasant resting-place to every Jewish mind; and even the Christian
          cannot help loving Bethlehem. The first mention, I think, that we have
          of Bethlehem is a sorrowful one. There Rachel died. If you turn to the
          35th of Genesis you will find it said in the 16th verse -- |And they
          journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to
          Ephrath; and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. And it came to
          pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her,
          Fear not; thou shalt have this son also. And it came to pass, as her
          soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name
          Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin. And Rachel died, and was
          buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. And Jacob set a
          pillar upon her grave, that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this
          day.| A singular incident this -- almost prophetic. Might not Mary
          have called her own son Jesus, her Ben-oni; for he was to be the child
          of Sorrow? Simeon said to her -- |Yea, a sword shall pierce through
          thine own soul also, that the thoughts of many hearts may be
          revealed.| But while she might have called him Ben-oni, what did God
          his Father call him? Benjamin, the son of my right hand. Ben-oni was
          he as a man; Benjamin as to his Godhead. This little incident seems to
          be almost a prophecy that Ben-oni -- Benjamin, the Lord Jesus, should
          be born in Bethlehem. But another woman makes this place celebrated.
          That woman's name was Naomi. There lived at Bethlehem in after days,
          when, perhaps, the stone that Jacob's fondness had raised had been
          covered with moss and its inscription obliterated, another woman named
          Naomi. She too was a daughter of joy, and yet a daughter of
          bitterness. Naomi was a woman whom the Lord had loved and blessed, but
          she had to go to a strange land; and she said, |Call me not Naomi
          (pleasant) but let my name be called Mara (bitter) for the Almighty
          hath dealt very bitterly with me.| Yet was she not alone amid all her
          losses, for there cleaved unto her Ruth the Moabitess, whose Gentile
          blood should unite with the pure untainted stream of the Jew, and
          should thus bring forth the Lord our Saviour, the great king both of
          Jews and Gentiles. That very beautiful book of Ruth had all its
          scenery laid in Bethlehem. It was at Bethlehem that Ruth went forth to
          glean in the fields of Boaz; it was there that Boaz looked upon her,
          and she bowed herself before her lord; it was there her marriage was
          celebrated; and in the streets of Bethlehem did Boaz and Ruth receive
          a blessing which made them fruitful so that Boaz became the father of
          Obed, and Obed the father of Jesse, and Jesse the father of David.
          That last fact gilds Bethlehem with glory -- the fact that David was
          born there -- the mighty hero who smote the Philistine giant, who led
          the discontented of his land away from the tyranny of their monarch,
          and who afterwards, by a full consent of a willing people, was crowned
          king of Israel and Judah. Bethlehem was a royal city, because the
          kings were there brought forth. Little as Bethlehem was, it was much
          to be esteemed; because it was like certain principalities which we
          have in Europe, which are celebrated for nothing but for bringing
          forth the consorts of the royal families of England. It was right,
          then, from history, that Bethlehem should be the birth-place of
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But again: there is something in the name of the place. |Bethlehem
          Ephratah.| The word Bethlehem has a double meaning. It signifies |the
          house of bread,| and |the house of war.| Ought not Jesus Christ to be
          born in |the house of bread?| He is the Bread of his people, on which
          they feed. As our fathers ate manna in the wilderness, so do we live
          on Jesus here below. Famished by the world, we cannot feed on its
          shadows. Its husks may gratify the swinish taste of worldlings, for
          they are swine; but we need something more substantial, and in that
          blest bread of heaven, made of the bruised body of our Lord Jesus, and
          baked in the furnace of his agonies, we find a blessed food. No food
          like Jesus to the desponding soul or to the strongest saint. The very
          meanest of the family of God goes to Bethlehem for his bread; and the
          strongest man, who eats strong meat, goes to Bethlehem for it. House
          of Bread! whence could come our nourishment but from thee? We have
          tried Sinai, but on her rugged steeps there grow no fruits, and her
          thorny heights yield no corn whereon we may feed. We have repaired
          even to Tabor itself, where Christ was transfigured, and yet there we
          have not been able to eat his flesh and drink his blood. But
          Bethlehem, thou house of bread, rightly wast thou called; for there
          the bread of life was first handed down for man to eat. And it is also
          called |the house of war;| because Christ is to a man |the house of
          bread,| or else |the house of war.| While he is food to the righteous
          he causeth war to the wicked, according to his own word -- |Think not
          that I am come to send peace on the earth; I am not come to send
          peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his
          father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law
          against her mother-in-law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own
          household.| Sinner! if thou dost not know Bethlehem as |the house of
          bread,| it shall be to thee a |house of war.| If from the lips of
          Jesus thou dost never drink sweet honey -- if thou art not like the
          bee, which sippeth sweet luscious liquor from the Rose of Sharon, then
          out of the selfsame mouth there shall go forth against thee a
          two-edged sword; and that mouth from which the righteous draw their
          bread, shall be to thee the mouth of destruction and the cause of
          thine ill. Jesus of Bethlehem, house of bread and house of war, we
          trust we know thee as our bread. Oh! that some who are now at war with
          thee might hear in their hearts, as well as in their ears the song --
        </p>
        <p>|Peace on earth, and mercy mild.</p>
        <p>God and sinners reconciled.|</p>
        <p>
          And now for that word Ephratah That was the old name of the place
          which the Jews retained and loved. The meaning of it is,
          |fruitfulness,| or |abundance.| Ah! well was Jesus born in the house
          of fruitfulness; for whence cometh my fruitfulness and any
          fruitfulness, my brother, but from Bethlehem? Our poor barren hearts
          ne'er produced one fruit, or flower, till they were watered with the
          Saviour blood. It is his incarnation which fattens the soil of our
          hearts. There had been pricking thorns on all the ground, and mortal
          poisons, before be came; but our fruitfulness comes from him. |I am
          like a green fir-tree; from thee is my fruit found.| |All my springs
          are in thee.| If we be like trees planted by the rivers of water,
          bringing forth our fruit in our season, it is not because we were
          naturally fruitful, but because of the rivers of water by which we
          were planted. It is Jesus that makes us fruitful. |If a man abide in
          me,| he says, |and my words abide him, he shall bring forth much
          fruit.| Glorious Bethlehem Ephratah! Rightly named! Fruitful house of
          bread -- the house of abundant provision for the people of God!
        </p>
        <p>
          3. We notice, next, the position of Bethlehem. It is said to be
          |little among the thousands of Judah.| Why is this? Because Jesus
          Christ always goes among little ones. He was born in the little one
          |among the thousands of Judah.| No Bashan's high hill, not on Hebron's
          royal mount, not in Jerusalem's palaces. but the humble, yet
          illustrious, village of Bethlehem. There is a passage in Zechariah
          which teaches us a lesson: -- lt is said that the man on the red horse
          stood among the myrtle-trees. Now the myrtle-trees grow at the bottom
          of the hill; and the man on the red horse always rides there. He does
          not ride on the mountain-top; he rides among the humble in heart.
          |With this man will I dwell, saith the Lord, with him who is of a
          humble and contrite spirit, and who trembleth at my word.| There are
          some little ones here this morning -- |little among the thousands of
          Judah.| No one ever heard your name, did they? If you were buried, and
          had your name on your tombstone, it would never be noticed. Those who
          pass by would say, |it is nothing to me: I never knew him.| You do not
          know much of yourself, or think much of yourself; you can scarcely
          read, perhaps. Or if you have some talent and ability, you are
          despised amongst men; or, if you are not despised by them, you despise
          yourself. You are one of the little ones. Well, Christ is always born
          in Bethlehem among the little ones. Big hearts never get Christ inside
          of them; Christ lieth not in great hearts, but in little ones. Mighty
          and proud spirits never have Jesus Christ, for he cometh in at low
          doors, but he will not come in at high ones. He who hath a broken
          heart, and a low spirit, shall have the Saviour, but none else. He
          healeth not the prince and the king, but |the broken in heart, and he
          bindeth up their wounds.| Sweet thought! He is the Christ of the
          little ones. |Thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among
          the thousands of Judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me
          that is to be ruler in Israel.|
        </p>
        <p>
          We cannot pass away from this without another thought here, which is,
          how wonderfully mysterious was that providence which brought Jesus
          Christ's mother to Bethlehem at the very time when she was to be
          delivered! His parents were residing at Nazareth; and what should they
          want to travel at that time for? Naturally, they would have remained
          at home; it was not at all likely that his mother would have taken
          journey to Bethlehem while in so peculiar a condition; but Caesar
          Augustus issues a decree that they are to be taxed. Very well, then,
          let them be taxed at Nazareth. No; it pleases him that they should all
          go to their city. But why should Caesar Augustus think of it just at
          that particular time? Simply because, while man deviseth his way, the
          king's heart is in the hand of the Lord. Why, what a thousand chances,
          as the world has it, met together to bring about this event! First of
          all, Caesar quarrels with Herod; one of the Herods was deposed; Caesar
          says, |I shall tax Judea, and make it a province, instead of having it
          for a separate kingdom. Well, it must be done. But when is it to be
          done? This taxing, it is said, was first commenced when Cyreneus was
          governor. But why is the census to be taken at that particular period
          -- suppose, December? Why not have had it last October and why could
          not the people be taxed where they were living? Was not their money
          just as good there as anywhere else? It was Caesar's whim; but it was
          God's decree. Oh! we love the sublime doctrine of eternal absolute
          predestination. Some have doubted its being consistent with the free
          agency of man. We know well it is so, and we never saw any difficulty
          in the subject; we believe metaphysicians have made difficulties; we
          see none ourselves. It is for us to believe, that man does as he
          pleases, yet notwithstanding he always does as God decrees. If Judas
          betrays Christ, |thereunto he was appointed;| and if Pharaoh hardens
          his heart, yet, |for this purpose have I raised thee up, for to show
          forth my power in thee.| Man doth as he wills; but God maketh him do
          as he willeth, too. Nay, not only is the will of man under the
          absolute predestination of Jehovah; but all things, great or little,
          are of him. Well hath the good poet said, |Doubtless the sailing of a
          cloud hath Providence to its pilot; doubtless the root of an oak is
          gnarled for a special purpose, God compasseth all things, mantling the
          globe like air.| There is nothing great or little, that is not from
          him. The summer dust moves in its orbit, guided by the same hand which
          rolls the stars along; the dewdrops have their father, and trickle on
          the rose leaf as God bids them; yea, the sear leaves of the forest,
          when hurled along by the tempest, have their allotted position where
          they shall fall, nor can they go beyond it. In the great, and in the
          little, there is God -- God in everything, working all things
          according to the counsel of his own will; and though man seeks to go
          against his Maker, yet he cannot. God hath bounded the sea with a
          barrier of sand; and if the sea mount up wave after wave, yet it shall
          not exceed its allotted channel. Everything is of God; and unto him.
          who guideth the stars and wingeth sparrows, who ruleth planets and yet
          moveth atoms, who speaks thunders and yet whispers zephyrs, unto him
          be glory; for there is God in everything,
        </p>

          III. This brings us to the third point: WHAT DID JESUS COME FOR? He
          came to be |ruler in Israel.| A very singular thing is this, that
          Jesus Christ was said to have been |born the king of the Jews.| Very
          few have ever been |born king.| Men are born princes, but they are
          seldom born kings. I do not think you can find an instance in history
          where any infant was born king. He was the prince of Wales, perhaps,
          and he had to wait a number of years, till his father died, and then
          they manufactured him into a king, by putting a crown on his head; and
          a sacred chrism, and other silly things; but he was not born a king. I
          remember no one who was born a king except Jesus; and there is
          emphatic meaning in that verse that we sing
        </p>
        <p>|Born thy people to deliver;</p>
        <p>Born a child, and yet a king.|</p>
        <p>
          The moment that he came on earth he was a king. He did not wait till
          his majority that he might take his empire; but as soon as his eye
          greeted the sunshine he was a king; from the moment that his little
          hands grasped anything, they grasped a sceptre, as soon as his pulse
          beat, and his blood began to flow, his heart beat royally, and his
          pulse beat an imperial measure, and his blood flowed in a kingly
          current. He was born a king. He came |to be ruler in Israel. |Ah!|
          says one, |then he came in vain, for little did he exercise his rule;
          he came unto his own, and his own received him not;' he came to Israel
          and he was not their ruler, but he was despised and rejected of men,'
          cast off by them all, and forsaken by Israel, unto whom he came.| Ay,
          but |they are not all Israel who are of Israel,| neither because they
          are the seed of Abraham shall they all be called. Ah, no! He is not
          ruler of Israel after the flesh, but he is the ruler of Israel after
          the spirit. Many such have obeyed him. Did not the apostles bow before
          him, and own him as their king? And now, doth not Israel salute him as
          their ruler? Do not all the seed of Abraham after the spirit, even all
          the faithful, for he is |the father of the faithful,| acknowledge that
          unto Christ belong the shields of the mighty, for he is the king of
          the whole earth? Doth he not rule over Israel? Ay, verily he doth; and
          those who are not ruled over by Christ are not of Israel. He came to
          be a ruler over Israel. My brother, hast thou submitted to the sway of
          Jesus? Is he ruler in thine heart, or is he not? We may know Israel by
          this: Christ is come into their hearts, to be ruler over them. |Oh!|
          saith one, |I do as I please, I was never in bondage to any man.| Ah!
          then thou hatest the rule of Christ. |Oh!| says another, |I submit
          myself to my minister, to my clergyman, or to my priest, and I think
          that what he tells me is enough, for he is my ruler.| Dost thou? Ah!
          poor slave, thou knowest not thy dignity; for nobody is thy lawful
          ruler but the Lord Jesus Christ. |Ay,| says another, |I have professed
          his religion, and I am his follower.| But doth he rule in thine heart?
          Doth he command thy will? Doth he guide thy judgment? Dost thou ever
          seek counsel at his hand in thy difficulties? Art thou desirous to
          honor him, and to put crowns upon his heart? Is he thy ruler? If so,
          then thou art one of Israel; for it is written, |He shall come to be
          ruler in Israel.| Blessed Lord Jesus! thou art ruler in thy people's
          hearts, and thou ever shalt be; we want no other ruler save thyself,
          and we will submit to none other. We are free, because we are the
          servants of Christ; we are at liberty, because he is our ruler, and we
          know no bondage and no slavery, because Jesus Christ alone is monarch
          of our hearts. He came |to be ruler in Israel;| and mark you, that
          mission of his is not quite fulfilled yet, and shall not be till the
          latter-day glories. In a little while you shall see Christ come again,
          to be ruler over his people Israel, and ruler over them not only as
          spiritual Israel, but even as natural Israel, for the Jews shall be
          restored to their land, and the tribes of Jacob shall yet sing in the
          halls of their temple; unto God there shall yet again be offered
          Hebrew songs of praise, and the heart of the unbelieving Jew shall be
          melted at the feet of the true Messias. In a short time, he who at his
          birth was hailed king of the Jews by Easterns, and at his death was
          written king of the Jews by a Western, shall be called king of the
          Jews everywhere -- yes, king of the Jews and Gentiles also -- in that
          universal monarchy whose dominion shall be co-extensive with the
          habitable globe, and whose duration shall be coeval with time itself.
          He came to be a ruler in Israel, and a ruler most decidedly he shall
          be, when he shall reign among his people with his ancients gloriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And now, the last thing is, DID JESUS CHRIST EVER COME BEFORE? We
          answer, yes: for our text says, |Whose goings forth have been of old,
          from everlasting.|
        </p>
        <p>
          First, Christ has had his goings forth in his Godhead. |From
          everlasting.| He has not been a secret and a silent person up to this
          moment. That new-born child there has worked wonders long ere now;
          that infant slumbering in its mother's arms is the infant of to-day,
          but it is the ancient of eternity; that child who is there hath not
          made its appearance on the stage of this world; his name is not yet
          written in the calendar of the circumcised; but still though you wist
          it not, |his goings forth have been of old, from everlasting.|
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Of old he went forth as our covenant head in election, |according
          as he hath chosen us in Him, before the foundation of the world.|
        </p>
        <p>Christ be my first elect, he said,</p>
        <p>Then chose our souls in Christ our Head.|</p>
        <p>
          2. He had goings forth for his people, as their representative before
          the throne, even before they were begotten in the world. It was from
          everlasting that his mighty fingers grasped the pen, the stylus of
          ages, and wrote his own name, the name of the eternal Son of God; it
          was from everlasting that he signed the compact with his Father, that
          he would pay blood for blood, wound for wound, suffering for
          suffering, agony for agony, and death for death, in the behalf of his
          people; it was from everlasting that he gave himself up, without a
          murmuring word, that from the crown of his head to the sole of his
          foot he might sweat blood, that he might be spit upon, pierced,
          mocked, rent asunder, suffer the pain of death, and the agonies of the
          cross. His goings forth as our Surety were from everlasting. Pause, my
          soul, and wonder! Thou hadst goings forth in the person of Jesus from
          everlasting. Not only when thou wast born into the world did Christ
          love thee, but his delights were with the sons of men before there
          were any sons of men. Often did he think of them; from everlasting to
          everlasting he had set his affection upon them. What! believer, has he
          been so long about thy salvation, and will he not accomplish it? Has
          he from everlasting been going forth to save me, and will he lose me
          now? What! has he had me in his hand, as his precious jewel, and will
          he now let me slip between his precious fingers? Did he choose me
          before the mountains were brought forth, or the channels of the deep
          scooped out, and will he lose me now? Impossible!
        </p>
        <p>|My name from the palms of his hands</p>
        <p>Eternity cannot erase;</p>
        <p>Impress'd on his heart it remains,</p>
        <p>In marks of indelible grace.|</p>
        <p>
          I am sure he would not love me so long, and then leave off loving me.
          If he intended to be tired of me, he would have been tired of me long
          before now. If he had not loved me with a love as deep as hell and as
          unutterable as the grave, it he had not given his whole heart to me, I
          am sure he would have turned from me long ago. He knew what I would
          be, and he has had long time enough to consider of it; but I am his
          choice, and there is an end of it; and unworthy as I am, it is not
          mine to grumble, if he is but contented with me. But he is contented
          with me -- he must be contented with me -- for he has known me long
          enough to know my faults. He knew me before I knew myself; yea, he
          knew me before I was myself. Long before my members were fashioned
          they were written in his book, |when as yet there were none of them,|
          his eyes of affection were set on them. He knew how badly I would act
          towards him, and yet he has continued to love me;
        </p>
        <p>|His love in times past forbids me to think.</p>
        <p>He'll leave me at last in trouble to sink.|</p>
        <p>
          No; since |his goings forth were of old from everlasting,| they will
          be |to everlasting.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, we believe that Christ has come forth of old, even to men,
          so that men have beheld him. I will not stop to tell you that it was
          Jesus who walked in the garden of Eden in the cool of the (lay, for
          his delights were with the sons of men; nor will I detain you by
          pointing out all the various ways in which Christ came forth to his
          people in the form of the angel of the covenant, the Paschal Lamb, the
          and ten thousand types with which the sacred history is so replete;
          but I will rather point you to four occasions when Jesus Christ our
          Lord has appeared on earth as a man, before his great incarnation for
          our salvation. And, first, I beg to refer you to the 18th chapter of
          Genesis, where Jesus Christ appeared to Abraham, of whom we read, |The
          Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent
          door in the heat of the day; and he lift up his eyes and looked, and
          lo, three men stood by him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them
          from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground. |But whom did
          he bow to? He said |My Lord,|only to one of them. There was one man
          between the other two, the most conspicuous for his glory, for he was
          the God-man Christ; the other two were created angels, who for a time
          had assumed the appearance of men. But this was the man Christ Jesus.
          |And he said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass
          not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: Let a little water, I pray
          you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the
          tree.| You will notice that this majestic man, this glorious person,
          stayed behind to talk with Abraham. In the 22nd verse it is said, --
          And the men turned their faces from thence and went towards Sodom;|
          that is, two of them, as you will see in the next chapter -- |but
          Abraham stood yet before the Lord.| You will notice that this man, the
          Lord, held sweet fellowship with Abraham, and allowed Abraham to plead
          for the city he was about to destroy. He was in the positive form of
          man; so that when he walked the streets of Judea it was not the first
          time that he was a man; lie was so before, in |the plain of Mamre, in
          the heat of the day.| There is another instance-his appearing to
          Jacob, which you have recorded in the 32nd chapter of Genesis and the
          24th verse. All his family were gone, |And Jacob was left alone, and
          there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. And when
          he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his
          thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he
          wrestled with him. And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And
          he said, I will not let thee go, unless thou bless me. And he said
          unto him, What is thy name? And be said, Jacob. And he said, Thy name
          shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel; for as a prince hast thou
          power with God.| This was a man, and yet God. |For as a prince bast
          thou power with God and with men, and bast prevailed.| And Jacob knew
          that this man was God, for he says in the 30th verse: ,for I have seen
          God face to face. and my life is preserved.| Another instance you will
          find in the book of Joshua When Joshua had crossed the narrow stream
          of Jordan, and had entered the promised land, and was about to drive
          out the Canaanites, lo! this mighty man-God appeared to Joshua. In the
          5th chapter, at the 13th verse, we read- And it came to pass, when
          Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and,
          behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his
          hand, and Joshua went unto him, and (like a brave warrior, as he was,)
          said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? And he said,
          Nay; but as Captain of the host of the Lord am I now come.| And Joshua
          saw at once that there was divinity in him; for Joshua fell on his
          face to the earth, and did worship, and said to him, |What saith my
          lord unto his servant?| Now, if this had been a created angel lie
          would have reproved Joshua, and said, |I am one of your fellow
          servants.| But no; |the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua,
          Loose thy shoe from thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is
          holy. And Joshua did so.| Another remarkable instance is that recorded
          in the third chapter of the book of Daniel, where we read the account
          of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego being cast into the fiery furnace,
          which was so fierce that it destroyed the men who threw them in.
          Suddenly the king said to his counsellors- Did not we cast three men
          bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the
          king, True, king. He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose,
          walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form
          of the fourth is like the Son of God.| How should Nebuchadnezzar know
          that? Only that there was something so noble and majestic in the way
          in which that wondrous Man bore himself, and some awful influence
          about him, who so marvellously broke the consuming teeth of that
          biting an I devouring flame, so that it could not so much as singe the
          children of God. Nebuchadnezzar recognized his humanity. He did not
          say,|I see three men and an angel,| but he said, |I see four positive
          men, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.' You see,
          then, what is meant by his goings forth being I from everlasting:'
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe for a moment here, that each of these four great occurrences
          happened to the saints when they were engaged in very eminent duty, or
          when they were about to be engaged in it. Jesus Christ does not appear
          to his saints every day. He did not come to see Jacob till he was in
          affliction; he did not visit Joshua before he was about to be engaged
          in a righteous war. It is only in extraordinary seasons that Christ
          thus manifests himself to his people. When Abraham interceded for
          Sodom, Jesus was with him, for one of the highest and noblest
          employments of a Christian is that of intercession, and it is when he
          is so engaged that he will be likely to obtain a sight of Christ.
          Jacob was engaged in wrestling, and that is a part of a Christian's
          duty to which some of you never did attain; consequently, you do not
          have many visits from Jesus. It was when Joshua was exercising bravery
          that the Lord met him. So with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: they
          were in the high places of persecution, on account of their adherence
          to duty, when he came to them, and said, |I will be with you, passing
          through the fire.| There are certain peculiar places we must enter, to
          meet with the Lord. We must be in great trouble, like Jacob; we must
          be in great labour, like Joshua; we must have great intercessory
          faith, like Abraham; we must be firm in the performance of duty, like
          Shadrach Meshach, and Abednego; or else we shall not know him ,whose
          goings forth have been of old, from everlasting;| or, if we know him,
          we shall not be able to |comprehend with all the saints what is the
          height, and depth, and length, and breadth of the love of Christ,
          which passeth knowledge,|
        </p>
        <p>
          Sweet Lord Jesus! thou whose goings forth were of old, even from
          everlasting, thou hast not left thy goings forth yet. Oh! that thou
          wouldst go forth this day, to cheer the faint, to help the weary, to
          bind up our wounds, to comfort our distresses! Go forth, we beseech
          thee, to conquer sinners, to subdue hard hearts-to break the iron
          gates of sinners' lusts, and cut the iron bars of their sirs in
          pieces! O Jesus! go forth; and when thou goest forth, come thou to me!
          Am I a hardened sinner? Come thou to me; I want thee:
        </p>
        <p>|Oh! let thy grace my heart subdue;</p>
        <p>I would be led in triumph too;</p>
        <p>A willing captive to my Lord,</p>
        <p>To sing the honours of thy word.|</p>
        <p>
          Poor sinner! Christ has not left going forth yet. And when he goes
          forth, recollect, he goes to Bethlehem. Have you a Bethlehem in your
          heart? Are you little? will go forth to you yet. Go home and seek him
          by earnest prayer. If you have been made to weep on account of sin,
          and think yourself too little to be noticed, go home, little one!
          Jesus comes to little ones; his goings forth were of old, and he is
          going forth now. He will come to your poor old house; he will come to
          your poor wretched heart; he will come, though you are in poverty, and
          clothed in rags, though you are destitute, tormented, and afflicted;
          he will come, for his goings forth have been of old from everlasting.
          Trust him, trust him, trust him; and he will go forth to abide in your
          heart for ever.<br />
