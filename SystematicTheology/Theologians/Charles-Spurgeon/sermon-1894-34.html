          <i>I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously:</i>
          <i>The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.</i> The LORD
          is my strength and song,<br />And he is become my salvation:<br />This
          is my God, and I will praise him;<br />My father's God, and I will
          exalt him.

          The LORD is a man of war:<br />The LORD is his name.<br />Pharaoh's
          chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: And his chosen
          captains are sunk in the Red Sea.<br />The deeps cover them:<br />They
          went down into the depths like a stone.

          Thy right hand, O LORD, is glorious in power,<br />Thy right hand, O
          LORD, dasheth in pieces the enemy. And in the greatness of thine
          excellency thou overthrowest them that rise up against thee:<br />Thou
          sendest forth thy wrath, it consumeth them as stubble. And with the
          blast of thy nostrils the waters were piled up, The floods stood
          upright as an heap;<br />The deeps were congealed in the heart of the
          sea.<br />The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will
          divide the spoil: My lust shall be satisfied upon them;<br />I will
          draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.<br />Thou didst blow with
          thy wind, the sea covered them: They sank as lead in the mighty
          waters.

          Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods?<br />Who is like thee,
          glorious in holiness,<br />Fearful in praises, doing wonders?<br />Thou
          stretchedst out thy right hand,<br />The earth swallowed them.<br />Thou
          in thy mercy hast led the people which thou hast redeemed: Thou hast
          guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation. The peoples have
          heard, they tremble:<br />Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of
          Philistia. Then were the dukes of Edom amazed;<br />The mighty men of
          Moab, trembling taketh hold upon them: All the inhabitants of Canaan
          are melted away.<br />Terror and dread falleth upon them;<br />By the
          greatness of thine arm they are as still as a stone; Till thy people
          pass over, O LORD,<br />Till the people pass over which thou hast
          purchased. Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of
          thine inheritance,<br />The place, O LORD, which thou hast made for
          thee to dwell in, The sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have
          established. The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.
