        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.550)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Evening, November 8th, 1863, on the</p>
        <p>burning of the Ship "Amazon," by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>"Escape for thy life." -- Genesis 19:17.</p>
        <p>
          "Thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in
          saving my life." -- Genesis 19:19.
        </p>
        <p>
          HERE IS THE ALARM of mercy declaring the sinner's duty -- "Escape for
          thy life." Here is the work of grace, and the gratitude of the sinner
          after he is saved. "Thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast
          shewed unto me in saving my life."
        </p>
        <p>
          The other day, there sailed down the Thames as stout a vessel as had
          ever ploughed the deep. The good ship "Amazon," had sailed the broad
          Pacific many a time, and what is there to hinder her from once more
          reaching America in safety? Who would refuse to underwrite her? Who
          among her crew or passengers has a fear for her safety? But in the
          book of providence, there was a black line against that ship, and
          never more could she reach her desired haven. The wind was exceedingly
          high: the vessel tarried awhile at Gravesend. There was a little
          improvement in the weather: she sailed a little further; but cast
          anchor again, and remained off Broadstairs. Matters went as usual in
          such weather. Night came on; the watch was changed as usual; the
          captain turned in, feeling that all was right and safe. The passengers
          were snug in their berths -- a little the worse, perhaps, for the roll
          of the ship, but as assured of security as men could be. In a moment,
          what a change had taken place! A passenger perceives a smell of fire;
          the warning cry is raised. Everyone rushes upon deck. Attempts arc
          made to quench the fire; but when the hatches are lifted up, the wind
          rushes in, and the fire is fanned to a dreadful, all-devouring
          conflagration. Further effort is of no avail. Rockets are fired, as
          the signals of distress. The boats are let down, crowded with the
          passengers. A lugger puts off to her, and a steam-tug hastens to the
          rescue, and, thanks be unto the God of providence, all the passengers
          -- the captain and chief officers last -- are on board the vessels and
          carried to Margate, where they see the melancholy, and yet
          satisfactory spectacle of their vessel burning to the water's edge,
          and then disappearing from view.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as the good brother who was captain to that vessel, constantly
          comes here when he is on shore, and as he is sitting in the midst of
          you to-night, I thought I might use the burning of this vessel as a
          picture of spiritual things, out of which I might make an illustrated
          sermon These things happen not without design, and should not escape
          without improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two things, then, to-night: they are both in the text and in the story
          of the ship on fire. First, an alarm -- "Escape for thy life;"
          secondly, grateful acknowledgment -- "Thou hast magnified thy mercy,
          which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life."
        </p>
        <p>I. First, AN ALARM.</p>
        <p>
          We come here to-night, to raise an alarm. True ministers of God. are
          great alarmists. It is their duty to be like Barnabas, who was a son
          of consolation; but it is equally their duty to be like Boanerges --
          sons of thunder. Thunder does not rock men to sleep, and plays no
          pleasant tune for fools to dance to; with its crash and roar, it wakes
          a slumbering world, and its dread volleys, echoed peal on peal, afford
          no dulcet notes for dainty ears. God's servants should learn to
          thunder; for when God speaketh through them, the voice of the Lord is
          powerful and full of majesty; and in his temple doth everyone speak of
          his glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          The alarm we have to give to-night, is that of the angel to Lot, with
          an emphasis of meaning -- "Escape for thy life." It is an alarm
          suggested by tremendous danger. When the cry of "Fire! fire! fire!"
          ran along the decks, and the cabins, and the saloons of the "Amazon,"
          everyone knew that there was no small danger to be encountered, for
          flame is a cruel tyrant and devours remorselessly. The very word
          "Fire!" has a razor-edge about it, cutting to the very quick. Terror
          has fire for her first-born. But the alarm we have to raise, is
          concerning a matter more terrific still -- add to the word "Fire,"
          that dreadful syllable "Hell," and then what shall more alarm than
          "Hell fire?" In that cry, we comprehend such weighty matters as
          eternity alone can reveal. The wrath to come! The judgment of the
          Eternal! The wrath of the Most High! Fire, when it is at its most
          furious pitch, is but a plaything compared with hell fire; yea, when
          it consumes a city; when it runs down the red lips of a volcano, and
          buries thousands; when it sets the sky and earth upon a blaze as in
          Egypt's plagues, it is but child's-play compared with the wrath of
          God, and that Tophet which is prepared of old, the pile whereof is
          wood and much smoke. Here is something at which the joints of a man's
          loins may well be loosed, for there is eternity in it, infinity in it,
          deity in it; and where these three are set against a man,. woe unto
          him. It is as when the fire is set in battle array against the
          stubble. Well may it be written by the prophet, "The sinners in Zion
          are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us
          shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with
          everlasting burning?" Sinner, by the crushing terror of the woe which
          cometh, I beseech thee, "Escape for thy life."
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a danger not to be overcome. The fire-engine was brought out
          upon the deck of the burning ship; attempts were made to extinguish
          the fire; but the mischief was far too much in power to be driven from
          its stronghold. The like may be boldly declared of the evil which
          cometh upon the ungodly. Sinner, your danger is such that you cannot
          contend with it by any power of your own. There is a fire of sin
          within you which you cannot quench; there is a fire of hell without
          you which no drops even of your own blood shall be able to extinguish.
          You are in a danger which you are unable to cope with. There is no
          possibility that if you remain in it, your utmost exertions or most
          strenuous efforts can avert the certain ruin which your state must
          bring upon you. If you neglect the only way of salvation, how can you
          escape? What awaits you but a fearful looking for of judgment and of
          fiery indignation? The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at
          the reproof of the Lord of hosts -- how, then, canst thou endure the
          tempest of his anger, and the fury of his hot displeasure?
        </p>
        <p>"O sinner, seek his face,</p>
        <p>Whose wrath thou canst not bear;</p>
        <p>Fly to the dying Savior's wounds,</p>
        <p>And find salvation there."</p>
        <p>
          It is a danger, too, a terrific danger which makes no exception to
          anyone. The captain is as much in danger as the poorest cabin-boy, if
          he cannot escape from the burning ship. The rich man, with ingots of
          gold in his cabin, will as certainly be burned alive as the poor
          traveler who could scarcely pay his passage. There is no distinction
          of persons in the judgments of God. Sinner, you may be great and
          mighty, but you shall go down to hell unless grace shall save you.
          Woman, thou mayst be amiable in thy temper and excellent in thy
          deportment, but thou shalt perish as surely as a harlot, unless Christ
          have pity upon thee. Man, thou mayst be upright, and shine before thy
          fellow-merchants as one of excellent repute, but the wrath of God
          abideth on thee except thou fleest to Jesus; for there is none other
          name given under heaven whereby ye must be' saved; and out of that
          name, and apart from that name, whoever thou mayst be, though thou
          wert monarch of seven empires, thou art still in danger. Rich and
          poor, high and low, learned and ignorant, my cry is to you all, "O
          earth, earth, earth, hear the Word of the Lord!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not forget that we are in danger of a consuming fire -- a danger
          which kills without remedy. It is not a fire which merely singes and
          scorches, but a fire which burns to ashes. As yonder ship must be
          burned up, and every passenger who cannot leave its burning deck must.
          be consumed, so you, O unconverted men, are in danger of utter
          destruction from the presence of the Lord. "For, behold, the day
          cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all
          that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn
          them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither
          root nor branch." I would I could speak upon this dreadful subject in
          a proper manner. Whitfield had tones and emotions which were fitting
          for such a subject. He would cry out, "Oh, the wrath to come! The
          wrath to come! The wrath to come!" He would cry, I say, until all his
          hearers responded. with, "What must we do to be saved?" And good
          Baxter, trembling lest be should he guilty of men's blood, while he
          delivered the message, as a dying man to dying men -- knew the terrors
          of the law, and right earnestly he persuaded men to escape for their
          lives. O sirs, if I saw you. in a burning house, there were not half
          so much need of earnestness as when I see you in the midst of a mass
          of sin and corruption which must be consumed by God's anger, and you
          with it. Sinner, why wilt. thou die? What can ail thee? What besots
          thee that thou dost not perceive anything dreadful in the wrath of him
          who made thee? He can dash whole worlds to pieces -- what can he not
          do with thee? Hast thou. learned to be callous when thou hearest of
          eternity? Hast thine ear grown cold to that dreadful word,
          "Condemnation?" Canst thou read the story of those to whom he said,
          "Depart, ye cursed," and not tremble? Canst thou know that thou art
          this day in danger of the judgment, and not be afraid? When the sword
          is sharp, and furbished, and taken out of its sheath, canst thou play
          about its edge? Canst thou yet make mirth? Then is there indeed, need
          for me to cry to thee, and for all God's faithful ministers to cry
          with louder voice than mine -- "Escape! escape! escape for thy life."
        </p>
        <p>
          The alarm of fire was needed because of the security of the persons in
          danger. Many on board the "Amazon" were sound asleep. Oh, how dreadful
          to be awakened out of sleep with the cry of "Fire! fire! fire! Some of
          them, when they awoke, seemed to have been so startled and so
          confused, that they had fairly to be dragged out of their berths that
          they might be rescued. There were none there, we have reason to
          believe, who would have been kept below through their own drunkenness
          or the carelessness of the crew. They were in a right state, with this
          exception, of course, that they were all alarmed -- and men alarmed
          are not always ready to do the wisest thing, and as for the captain
          and his men they seem to have been as sensible as they were brave. My
          hearers, God's ministers have to deal with passengers much more
          difficult to handle. Are not men asleep? Till the voice of God awakens
          us, we are all asleep. How you and I walked for years, and years, and
          years, upon the brink of the grave, as utterly unconcerned as though
          we were to live for ever; and when sometimes we were a little
          impressed by the passing bell, or an open grave, or an earnest sermon,
          how soon we went back again to our old frivolity, and toyed with the
          flames of hell as though they were fancy's dream. It is not so now.
          God has awakened us; but we had never been awakened if the voice which
          awakes the dead had not cried in our ear, "Escape for thy life." Nay,
          worse, men are not only asleep, but when they do perceive their
          danger, they love their sins too well to leave them, even though hell
          stares them in the face. The best of them cry with Solomon's sluggard,
          "Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands
          to sleep." Sinner, how hard it is to bring thee to serious
          consideration of thy ways. We cannot touch thy wits, or make thee
          reason like a man of sound mind. Thou wilt sooner be damned by
          thoughtlessness thau give an hour's careful meditation to thy soul's
          affairs. We would fain drag thee out of thy sleeping berth, and even
          kick thee and strike thee, treating thee to rough usage, if we could
          by this means drag thee from the devouring flames; thou wouldst thank
          us well enough afterwards for these rough cuffs, if we could but wake
          thee. We hear complaints that the minister speaks too harshly and
          talks too much of judgment. Saved sinners never make that complaint.
          They know that nothing but these terrors will awaken some slumbering
          minds; and if they be awakened themselves, they are but too glad,
          however rough the means may have been. Are there not some in this
          house to-night who are hard, fearfully hard, to be brought to sober
          thinking, because they are drunken and besotted with sin? Some of you,
          with your Sunday trading, will rather gain your sixpences and your
          paltry pence on the Sunday, than find eternal felicity in faith in the
          Lord Jesus. Others of you, with your tap-room companions, with your
          theatres, your balls, and worse places still, where lust wears no
          mask, are cutting the throats of your poor miserable souls. You cannot
          give up your vices; you will sooner be damned than be Christians.
          Well, so it must be, sirs, if ye will have these things, and will pawn
          your souls for them, so it must be; you have chosen your own
          delusions, and you shall inherit them. But O, do listen once more,
          while we warn you in God's name, " Escape for thy life," and trifle no
          more with hell and heaven, with thine own soul and judgment, God and
          his dear bleeding Son. If every preacher in London should suddenly
          begin to preach nothing but alarms, it would all be needed, for what a
          secure and reckless city is this. If every corner in the street had a
          Jonah in it, and that Jonah's sermon were nothing but this -- "Yet a
          few more days and thou shalt be destroyed!" it were not too much for a
          city so given to slumber. We have waxen rich; we have grown careless,
          till we have become like Nineveh of old, a people at ease, and
          dwelling carelessly Isaiah might well say concerning London -- "Thou
          saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst not lay these
          things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it." Let
          us take heed unto ourselves lest in the world to come this carnal
          security of ours should be like faggots to the fire, and the
          remembrance of our sloth should pour oil upon the flames. O God, let
          the alarm be heard, to-night by those who crowd this house, for thou
          knowest that many of them are sound asleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, it is an alarm which requires instant attention. A man on board
          a vessel, when he hears the cry of "Fire!" must not stop to arrange
          his clothes; he must not be concerned to see that his face is washed,
          that he has bound together that little bundle of papers, or packed up
          the portmanteau, or counted over the little purse of gold, or even
          snatched his little property from the cabin. At once, at once, must he
          climb the stairs and reach the deck, or he will never have stairs to
          climb, nor feet to climb with. Now or never. Quick is the word. Waste
          a moment, and it is all over with you; the fire is upon you, for it
          tarries not in its march. So is it with you to-night who fear not God.
          "Escape for thy life," is a cry for the present moment. Now is the
          accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation." Now, now, NOW.
          This is the only period God has allotted to you, take care that you
          use it, lest when your to-days are past, and you hope to see your
          to-morrow, you should have to spend your to-morrows in the pit of
          hell. Procrastination is not only the thief of time, but the thief of
          souls. Now is the day of salvation; I have never heard of any other
          day. I do not know, but I think this is one of the most difficult
          things in the gospel ministry, a matter worthy of the Holy Ghost's
          power -- to make men seriously think about their souls at this
          present. I know, young man, you intend to think of these things when
          you are ill; you expect to have a long time upon a sick-bed, and then
          you suppose all will be right before you die. Who told you you would
          ever lie upon a sick-bed at all? Yours may be a sudden death; and
          sudden death to such as you, are would be sudden damnation. As men
          stand upon the bank, and spring head-first into the water, so may you
          dash into hell. Death enters men's doors without knocking. The
          judgment may follow on the heels of your next sins. And what if you
          should lie upon a bed of sickness? You will have enough to do to bear
          the pain, to mourn over your weeping wife, and worry yourself about
          those little children who will be left fatherless: I tell you, sir, it
          is hard repenting upon a dying bed. Do not sew pillows to thine
          armholes, and make for thyself this fond hope, that thou shalt one day
          be saved. It is now or never, it is now or never with you. I speak as
          a prophet of God at this moment, I know I do; there are some of you to
          whom this now or never is a more applicable thing than you suppose.
          You will not see a new year. No Christmas festivities will be yours.
          You will be at home on Christmas-day, but it will be your long, lost
          home. "Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live." As
          the Lord my God liveth, before whom I stand, thus saith the Lord unto
          some of you -- "There is but a step between you and death." Be warned,
          then, for as I will meet you on the other side the stream, at my
          Master's judgment-seat, I have bidden you give immediate,
          instantaneous attention to the Word of God. Consider your ways, O
          sinners, born to die. Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, O trembler,
          and thou shalt be saved. Trust him, trust him. God help thee to trust
          Jesus to-night, for it is now or never with thy soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, this alarm demands of every one of us who are unsaved, an
          undivided attention. You have fifty things to think about. You tell me
          you have a thousand cares. O sirs, a man whose life is in danger, has
          no other care than to save his life. Did those who were rescued from
          the "Amazon," have time to save their money and their gold? We are
          told that they were utterly destitute when they landed at Margate, and
          what signifies it? Would not a flush of joy be on their cheeks because
          their lives were preserved! If one said to his fellow, "Where is thy
          purse?" "Oh," saith the other, "never mind my purse, I am in the
          lifeboat; my life is saved." What shall it profit you, if you gain the
          whole world, and lose your own soul? And what is the loss after all,
          if you lose the world, if you gain your soul? Nay, those on board the
          ship had not time to save their clothes. The instincts of
          self-preservation made them run, just as they were, half-naked, to the
          vessel's deck, and so must you. I know you will tell me you are not
          living to make money; if you could just make ends meet, keep your
          family, and supply the wants of your children -- that is all -- are
          you not to think of this? It is well and good; far be it from me to
          discourage prudent carefulness in all matters; it is your business to
          see to temporal matters, but still your paramount business must be
          your soul; even necessaries must not come between your soul and your
          most serious thoughts. You must see to this first and foremost, and
          remember there is a promise about it -- "Seek ye first the kingdom of
          God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto
          you." Those persons who escaped from the blazing vessel had, some of
          them, even to suffer in body. We read of one who broke his arm in the
          medley of the escape, but what of that?* (*I hear since, from the
          friends of the second mate, that the man did not break his arm.)
          Better to escape with a broken arm, than fry in those horrible flames
          with every bone in its place. It would be very little comfort to the
          poor passenger to save his bones entire, and to have his body
          consumed. "It is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed,
          rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting
          fire." You are rightly considerate of your bodies, but still, if that
          poor body, which is to become worm's meat one day, is worthy of so
          much thought, how much more ought you to give to your immortal spirit,
          which is to live for ever with God in glory, or with fiends in
          torment? Think first, I pray you, think chiefly, think now to-night
          with undivided heart, with consecrated thought upon your soul. Let
          comforts go, let pelf go, let raiment go, let life itself go -- but do
          see to that which is better than life -- thy soul -- thine everlasting
          destiny.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the alarm which I have tried to give -- "Escape for thy life!"
          seems to me to suggest a very solemn question. "How can I escape?"
          says cue. Dost thou sincerely ask that question -- "What must I do to
          be saved?" Remember there is but one way of rescue -- the lifeboat of
          faith must put thee into the vessel of salvation -- Christ Jesus. Stop
          in thine own vessel, and thou art burned; leap into those floods of
          wrath, and thou art drowned; get into that boat of saving faith, let
          that boat bear thee into the vessel of Christ Jesus, and thou art
          safe. Sinner, the road of salvation is, out of self into Christ. There
          are only two steps to heaven -- out of self, into Christ. That man who
          has left himself as a burning vessel behind, left sin and left
          self-righteousness as a thing to be destroyed -- that man who has
          taken Christ to be his all in all, and takes the cross to be the only
          thing to which he clings, is safe. Escape, I pray thee, for thy life,
          awakened and seeking sinner, for Jesus is the only foundation, he only
          is thy rock and thy salvation; come to him for shelter, and you are
          saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          To conclude this matter of alarm, our meditation arouses a very solemn
          enquiry -- Will all be safe? Will all in the vessel escape? What joy
          must there have been in the captain's heart when he heard that not one
          had been left to burn in the vessel! Will all escape? Will every
          hearer in this huge house of prayer to-night be a singer in heaven?
          Dare we, in the judgment of charity, hope so? Well, well, let us try
          to hope, if so your charity wishes it, but I fear me, I fear me it
          will be hope without any grounds; for there are some here who love the
          drunkard's cup, others who vomit the swearer's oaths, and some who
          have the proud, self-righteous look which God hateth. O that we could
          hope that these would be transformed by grace through Jesus Christ,
          that so they might be saved! I am, I own it, very much afraid that all
          of you will not be saved, but that some of you will perish in your
          iniquities. It is not, however, our duty to pry into futurity, let us
          therefore, turn to that which far more concerns us, our own personal
          salvation. The enquiry changes -- "Shall I be saved? If there be an
          alarm given, Escape for thy life!' Shall I be saved?" And what if it
          should be the preacher's lot to be lost for ever! What, if after
          talking to you this morning of being sick of love to Christ, he should
          have to hear those doleful words, "I never knew you, depart, ye
          cursed!" And what if this were to be the lot of the church-officers
          who sit around me, or of any one amongst you? Brother, you have passed
          the sacramental cup to others, what if the cup of devils be your
          portion for ever and ever! My brethren and sisters in Church
          fellowship, you may well put the question as did the apostles of old,
          "Lord is it I?"
        </p>
        <p>"Shall I be banished for my life,</p>
        <p>And yet forbid to die?</p>
        <p>Shall I endure eternal death,</p>
        <p>Yet death for ever fly?"</p>
        <p>
          Shall it be so! My dear hearer, thou who makest no profession of
          religion, will you ask the question, Shall I, shall I perish in
          devouring flames, or shall I escape? The answer to that question, so
          far as you are concerned, at this moment, must depend upon whether
          there is now a work of grace in your heart. If thou believest that
          Jesus is the Christ, thou canst never perish. If thou dost not, and
          wilt not believe, thy destruction is most sure. O God Almighty, thou
          who alone canst impress the heart, lead everyone of us now to take
          such sure hold of Christ that we may never perish, neither may any
          pluck us out of his hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. My time is fled, woe is me, when I had meant to have spoken with
          my whole heart upon another topic. It was GRATITUDE. Well, we will
          just run over the points, although most briefly. I will hope that you
          and I are saved; I will trust that we have been put into thy
          grace-vessel; I will believe that we have laid hold on Christ; may me
          belief be warranted by facts? Then this calls for gratitude. Gratitude
          of what kind? Gratitude that I was awakened. O my God, I bless thee
          that I was not permitted to sleep the sleep of death. I thank thee for
          that fever which made me fear, that loss which made me think, that
          dear dead babe which brought the parent to a Savior's feet. I bless
          thee, Lord, for the minister's earnest voice which shook me in my
          slumbers, for a mother's tears which fell like cold drops on my
          sleeping brow, and made me wake. I thank thee, O God, that though
          others slumber, yet, thou hast awakened me, and made me look to my
          soul's concerns. It is no slight mercy to be able to hear the trumpet
          of warning. It is a foundation mercy, but it is not the least of
          mercies to have an awakened conscience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I would thank God, and let every believer join with me, that
          when you and I were awakened, the ship was not out to sea. If the
          "Amazon" had been far out to sea when the cry of "Fire" was given,
          what must have been the result? How few could have escaped! But there
          she was, close to land. You and I, when we were awakened, were not in
          hell -- not like the rich man, lifting up our eyes where hope could
          never come -- we were still on praying ground, still on pleading terms
          with God, still off the Foreland, still where mercy could come to us,
          and grace could meet us. Sinner, if you have been awakened to-night,
          thank God for this, thank him that the trumpet which wakes you is not
          the trumpet of the archangel summoning you to judgment, but the silver
          trumpet of God's messenger of mercy, inviting you to mercy banquet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us thank God it did not blow harder, for there might have been
          much trouble in reaching the boat. When you and I were awakened to a
          sense of sin, it might have been just when death was coming, or when
          the terrors of conscience would have been too much for us, and when
          the fears of death might have kept us from a Savior. But, blessed be
          God, when we were aroused there was wind enough, we were
          conscience-stricken and smitten, but still not too much, or else the
          fire had been too vehement, and we had not escaped. Thank God, then,
          that he awakened us while there was really time to avail ourselves of
          the covenant lifeboat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us be thankful again, that we could use the signals. I told you
          that the vessel sent up its rockets -- signals of distress. Ah! what a
          thousand mercies it was that we could pray. I remember well when this
          was the only comfort my bursting spirit had, I could pray. Oh, to be
          on pleading terms with God! Thank God for this, awakened sinner, bless
          God for this. If you have not got so far as being completely saved,
          yet do praise him that you are allowed to fire off the rockets of
          desires, sighs, groans, sobs, tears, longings, and pantings, and that
          you can send them up where God can see them. Your cries, and groans,
          and tears will yet bring comfort and peace from heaven through the
          Lamb's redeeming blood. Rejoice, my beloved brethren, that the Lord
          has not abolished a mercy-seat, nor forgotten to be gracious. He saith
          "not to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain." He waits to be
          gracious. He delighteth in mercy. Before you call he will answer, and
          while you are yet speaking he will hear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank God that there were good officers on board to direct the
          passengers. Without firm authority, men become a mob, and then, with
          every appliance which might save, few are rescued. Awakened sinner, be
          grateful that you have gospel ministers. Oh! what a mercy to have a
          gospel ministry! What an awful thing to sit under a half-and-half
          milk-and-water, yea-and-nay ministry, as was my lot when under
          conviction. I attended different places of worship, but what I heard
          was not the gospel. And I venture to say it, that a few years ago, in
          nine places out of ten in London, and in the suburbs, and throughout
          England, such a thing as the gospel was not preached, except by
          accident. It is preached NOW. It is not preached now as it should be,
          but it is preached now. What I mean by the gospel, is the doctrine
          that Jesus Christ came to save sinners, and that the simple trusting
          upon him is saving faith. This is a doctrine which the revival has
          brought up more clearly, and which the revival keeps before the public
          mind; but before that great movement came, it was a doctrine ignored
          and cast behind; too much of the preaching was a dry morality, or else
          philosophy which might tickle the ears of men who claimed intellect,
          but could never move the heart. Oh, thank God, poor sinner, that you
          do hear it rung in your ears -- Come as you are! Come as you are! You
          hear the gospel sung to you: --
        </p>
        <p>"Just as I am, without one plea,</p>
        <p>But that thy blood was shed for me,</p>
        <p>And that thou bidd'st me come to thee,</p>
        <p>O Lamb of God, I come! I come!</p>
        <p>Just as I aim-thy love I own,</p>
        <p>Has broken every barrier down:</p>
        <p>Now, to be thine, yea, thine alone,</p>
        <p>O Lamb of God, I come! I come!"</p>
        <p>
          We hold up to you no ceremonies, no feelings, no works, no
          orthodoxies; we only hold up Christ, Christ crucified, a substitute
          for sinners, a substitute for you if you trust him; and we tell you
          again and again, till we half fear of tiring you, that, trusting
          Jesus, you are saved. Now we have reason, if saved, to be grateful to
          God for gospel officers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then how grateful ought you and I to be that the ship is come to the
          rescue. Jesus came all the way from heaven to earth to save us -- "Who
          though he was rich, yet for our sakes became poor, that we through his
          poverty might be made rich." How shall we be grateful enough for this
          unspeakable gift?
        </p>
        <p>"O, for this love let rocks and hills</p>
        <p>Their lasting silence break,</p>
        <p>And all harmonious human tongues</p>
        <p>The Savior's praises speak."</p>
        <p>
          Better still: how grateful we ought to be that we have got on board
          that ship. Oh! joy! joy! joy! that blessed step which set me upon
          Christ! that blessed act which made me one with him. My soul would
          repeat now that grace-wrought deed of faith.
        </p>
        <p>"A wounded, weak, and helpless worm,</p>
        <p>On Christ's kind arms I fall;</p>
        <p>Be thou my strength and confidence,</p>
        <p>My Jesus and my all."</p>
        <p>
          Be grateful for this; and, sinner, if thou canst now step into Christ
          and trust him with thyself, make earth ring with thy joy, and make
          heaven resound with thy praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our gratitude, methinks, will be greatest of all when we get safe on
          shore, and look on this old hulk, the burning world, without a fear;
          we, will see her blaze and cast her dreadful splendours over the
          infinite leagues of space, until beings in far-off worlds shall ask,
          "What is this? A world on fire, whose elements dissolve with fervent
          heat." But we, caught up together with the Lord, to dwell for ever
          with him, shall look on with complacency, having lost nothing because
          saved in him; having found in him our Savior, better than all we had
          before, and being, once for all on heaven's terra firma, never to put
          to sea again, never to fear tempest, rock, wreck, or fire; but saved!
          saved! saved eternally!
        </p>
        <p>
          Escape, sinner, escape for thy life. Remember, though thus I talk to
          thee, if thou shalt escape, free grace must have all the praise; and
          in the language of good Lot, thou wilt have to say -- "Thou hast
          magnified thy mercy in saving my life." May God send you away with a
          blessing, for Jesus' sake. Amen.<br />
