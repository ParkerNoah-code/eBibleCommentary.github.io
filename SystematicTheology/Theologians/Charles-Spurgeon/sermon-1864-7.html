        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.555)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, February 21st, 1864, by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>|He found nothing but leaves.| -- Mark 11:13.</p>
        <p>
          MOST of the miracles of Moses were grand displays of divine justice.
          What were the first ten wonders but ten plagues? The same may be said
          of the prophets, especially of Elijah and Elisha. Was it not
          significant both of the character and mission of Elias when he called
          fire from heaven upon the captains of fifties; nor was he upon whom
          his mantle descended less terrible when the she-bears avenged him upon
          the mockers. It remained for our incarnate Lord to reveal the heart of
          God. The only begotten was full of grace and truth, and in his
          miracles pre-eminently God is set forth to us as LOVE. With the
          exception of the miracle before us, and perhaps, a part of another,
          all the miracles of Jesus were entirely benevolent in their character;
          indeed this one is no exception in reality, but only in appearance.
          The raising of the dead, the feeding of the multitude, the stilling of
          the tempest, the healing of diseases -- what were all these but
          displays of the lovingkindness of God? What was this to teach us but
          that Jesus Christ came forth from his Father on an errand of pure
          grace?
        </p>
        <p>|Thine hands, dear Jesus, were not arm'd</p>
        <p>With an avenging rod,</p>
        <p>No hard commission to perform</p>
        <p>The vengeance of a God.</p>
        <p>But all was mercy, all was mild,</p>
        <p>And wrath forsook the throne,</p>
        <p>When Christ on his kind errand came</p>
        <p>And brought salvation down.|</p>
        <p>
          Let us rejoice that God commendeth his love towards us, because in
          |due time Christ died for the ungodly.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, as if to show that Jesus the Savior is also Jesus the Judge, one
          gleam of justice must dart forth. Where shall mercy direct its fall?
          See, my brethren, it glances not upon a man, but lights upon an
          unconscious, unsuffering thing -- a tree. The curse, if we may call it
          a curse at all, did not fall. on man or beast, or even the smallest
          insect; its bolt falls harmlessly upon a fig tree by the wayside. It
          bore upon itself the signs of barrenness, and perhaps was no one's
          property; little, therefore, was the loss which any man sustained by
          the withering of that verdant, mockery, while instruction more
          precious than a thousand acres of fig trees has been left for the
          benefit of all ages. The only other instance at which I hinted just
          now was the permission given to the devils to enter into the swine,
          and the whole herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and
          perished in the waters. In that case, again, what a mercy it was that
          the Savior did not permit a band of men to become the victims of the
          evil one. It was infinitely better that the whole herd of swine should
          perish than that one poor man should be rendered a maniac through
          their influence. The creatures choked in the abyss were nothing but
          swine -- swine which their Jewish owners had no right to keep; and
          even then they did not perish through Jesus Christ's agency, but
          through the malice of the devils, for needs must even swine run when
          the devil drives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, then, with attention, this solitary instance of stern
          judgment wrought by the Savior's hand. Consider seriously that if only
          once in his whole life Christ works a miracle of pure judgment, the
          lesson so unique must be very full of meaning. If there be hut one
          curse, where does it fall? What is its symbolic teaching? I do not
          know that I ever felt more solemnly the need of true fruitfulness
          before God than when I was looking over this miracle -- parable -- for
          such it may justly be called. The curse, you at once perceive, falls
          in its metaphorical and spiritual meaning upon those high professors
          who are destitute of true holiness; upon those who manifest great show
          of leaves, but who bring forth no fruit unto God. Only one
          thunderbolt, and that for boasting pretenders; only one curse, and
          that for hypocrites. O blessed Spirit, write this heart-searching
          truth upon our hearts!
        </p>
        <p>
          I. We will commence our exposition with the remark that THERE WERE
          MANY TREES WITH LEAVES ONLY UPON THEM, AND YET NONE OF THESE WERE
          CURSED BY THE SAVIOR, SAVE ONLY THIS FIG TREE. It is the nature of
          many trees to yield to man nothing but their shade. The hungering
          Savior did not resort to the oak or to the elm to look for food, nor
          could the fir tree, nor the pine, nor the box, offer him any hope of
          refreshment; nor did he breathe one hard word concerning them, for he
          knew what was in them, and that they neither were, nor pretended to be
          fruit-bearing trees. So, dear friends, there are many men whose lives
          bear leaves, but no fruit -- and yet, thanks be unto God, almighty
          patience bears with them. They are allowed to live out their time, and
          then it is true they are cut down and cast into the fire; but while
          they are permitted to stand, no curse withers them: the longsuffering
          of God waiteth to be gracious to them. Here are some of the characters
          who have leaves but no fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are thousands who ignorantly follow the sign and know nothing of
          the substance. In England, we think ourselves far in advance of Popish
          countries; but how much of the essence of Popery peeps out in the
          worship of very many! They go to Church or chapel, and they think that
          the mere going into the place and sitting a certain time and coming
          out again is an acceptable act to God: mere formality, you see, is
          mistaken for spiritual worship! They are careful to have their infants
          sprinkled, but what the ceremony means they know not; and without
          looking into the Bible to see whether the Lord commands any such an
          ordinance, they offer him their ignorant will -- worship either in
          obedience to custom, or in the superstition of ignorance. What the
          thing is, or why it is, they do not enquire, but go through a
          performance as certain parrots say their prayers. They know nothing
          about the inward and spiritual grace, which the Catechism talks about,
          if indeed, inward spiritual grace could ever be connected with an
          unscriptural outward and visible sign. When these poor souls come to
          the Lord's Supper, their thoughts go no farther than the bread and
          wine, or the hands which break the one and pour out the other; they
          know nothing whatever of communion with Jesus, of eating his flesh and
          drinking his blood; their souls have proceeded as far as the shell,
          but they have never broken into the kernel to taste the sweetness
          thereof. They have a name to lives and are dead; their religion is a
          mere show; a signboard without an inn a well-set table without meat; a
          pretty pageant where nothing is gold, but everything gilt nothing
          real, but all pasteboard, paint, plaster, and pretense.
          Nonconformists, your chapels swarm with such, and the houses of the
          Establishment are full of the same! Multitudes live and die satisfied
          with the outward trappings of religion, and are utter strangers to
          internal vital godliness. Yet such persons are not cursed in this
          life! No, they are to be pitied, to be prayed for, to be sought after,
          with words of love and honest truth; they are to be hoped for yet, for
          who knoweth but that God may call them to repentance, and they may yet
          receive the life of God into their souls?
        </p>
        <p>
          Another very numerous class have opinion but not faith, creed but not
          credence. We meet them everywhere. How zealous they are for
          Protestantism! They would not only die for orthodoxy, but kill others
          as well. Perhaps it is the Calvinistic doctrine which they have
          received, and then the five points are as dear to them as their five
          senses. These men will contend, not to say earnestly, but savagely for
          the faith. They very vehemently denounce all those who differ from
          them in the smallest degree; and deal damnation round the land with
          amazing liberality to all who are not full weight according to the
          balance of their little Zoar, Rehoboth, or Jireh: while all the while
          the spirit of Christ, the love of the Spirit, bowels of compassion,
          and holiness of character are no more to be expected from them than
          grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles. Doctrine, my brethren, is
          to be prized above all price! Woe to the Church of God when error
          shall be thought a trifle, for truth be lightly esteemed; and when
          truth is gone, what is left? But, at the same time, we grossly mistake
          if we think that orthodoxy of creed will save us. I am sick of those
          cries of |the truth,| |the truth,| |the truth,| from men of rotten
          lives and unholy tempers. There is an orthodox as well as a heterodox
          road to hell, and the devil knows how to handle Calvinists quite as
          well as Arminians. No pale of any Church can insure salvation, no form
          of doctrine can guarantee to us eternal life. |Ye must be born again.|
          Ye must bring forth fruits meet for repentance. |Every tree which
          bringeth not forth fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.|
          Stopping short of vital union to the Lord Jesus by real faith, we miss
          the great qualification for entering heaven. Yet the time is not come
          when these mere head-knowers are cursed. These trees have leaves only,
          but no fatal curse has withered them hopelessly. No; they are to be
          sought after; they may yet know the Lord in their hearts, and the Holy
          Spirit may yet make them humble followers of the Lamb. O that it may
          be so!
        </p>
        <p>
          A third class have talk without feeling. Mr. Talkative, in |Pilgrim's
          Progress,| is the representative of a very numerous host. They speak
          very glibly concerning divine things. Whether the topic be doctrinal,
          experimental, or practical, they talk fluently upon everything. But
          evidently, the whole thing comes from the throat and the lip; there is
          no welling up from the heart. If the thing came from the heart it
          would be boiling, but now it hangs like an icicle from their lips. You
          know them -- you may learn something from them, but all time while you
          are yourself aware that if they bless others by their words, they
          themselves remain unblessed. Ah! let us be very anxious lest this
          should be our own case. Let the preacher feel the anxiety of the
          apostle Paul, lest, after having preached to others, he himself should
          be a castavay; and let my hearers feel the same concern, lest, after
          talking about the timings of God, they should prove to be mere
          lip-servers, and not accepted children of the Most High.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another tribe springs up just now before my eye -- those who have
          regrets without repentance. Many of you under a heart-searching sermon
          feel grieved on account of your sins, and yet never have the strength
          of mind to give them up. You say you are sorry, but yet go on in the
          same course. You do really feel, when death and judgment press upon
          you, a certain sort of regret that you could have been so foolish, but
          the next day the strength of temptation is such, that you fall a prey
          to the very same infatuation. It is easy to bring a man to the river
          of regret, but you cannot make him drink the water of repentance. If
          Agag would be killed with words, no Amalekite would live. If men's
          transient sorrows for sin were real repentance on account of it, there
          is not a man living who would not, sometime or other, have been a true
          penitent. Here, however, are leaves only, and no fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have yet again, another class of persons who have resolves without
          action. They will! Ah! that they will! but it is always in the future
          tense. They are hearers, and they are even feelers, but they are not
          doers of the Word: it never comes to that. They would be free, but
          they have not patience to file their fetters, nor grace to submit
          their manacles to the hammer. They see the right, but they permit the
          wrong to rule them. They are charmed with the beauties of holiness,
          and yet deluded with the wantonness of sin. They would ran in the ways
          of God's commandments, but the road is too rough, and running is weary
          work. They would fight for God, but victory is hardly won, and so they
          turn back almost as soon as they have set out; they put their hand to
          the plough, and then prove utterly unworthy of the kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          The great majority of persons who have any sort of religion at all,
          bear heaves, but they produce no fruit. I know there are some such
          here, and I solemnly warn you, though no curse falls upon you, though
          we do not think that the miracle now under consideration has any
          relation to you whatever, yet remember, there is nothing to be done
          with trees which bring forth only leaves, but in due time to use the
          axe upon them, and to cast them into the fire: and this must be your
          doom. As sure as you live under the sound of the gospel, and yet are
          not converted by it, so surely will you be cast into outer darkness.
          As certainly as Jesus Christ invites you, and ye will not come, so
          certainly will he send his angels to gather the dead branches
          together, and you among them, to cast them into the fire. Beware!
          beware! thou fruitless tree! thou shalt not stand for ever! Mercy
          waters thee with her tears now; God's lovingkindness digs about thee
          still; still the husbandman comes, seeking fruit upon thee year after
          year. Beware! the edge of the axe is sharp, and the arm which wields
          it is nothing less than almighty. Beware! lest thou fall into the
          fire!
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, THERE WERE OTHER TREES WITH NEITHER LEAVES NOR FRUIT,
          AND NONE OF THESE WERE CURSED!
        </p>
        <p>
          The time of figs was not yet come. Now, as the fig tree either brings
          forth the fig before the leaf, or else produces figs and leaves at the
          same time, the major part of the trees, perhaps all of them, without
          exception of this one, were entirely without figs and without leaves,
          and yet Jesus did not curse any one of them, for the time of figs was
          not yet come.
        </p>
        <p>
          What multitudes are destitute of anything like religion; they make no
          profession of it; they not only have no fruits of godliness, but they
          have no leaves even of outward respect to it; they do not frequent the
          court of the Lord's house; they use no form of prayer; they never
          attend upon ordinances. The great outlying mass of this huge city --
          how does religion affect it? It is a very sad thing to think that
          there are people living in total darkness next door to the light; that
          you may find in the very street where the gospel is preached, persons
          who have never heard a sermon. Are there not, throughout this city,
          tens and hundreds of thousands who know not their right hand from
          their left, in matters of godliness? Their children go to Sabbath
          schools, but they themselves spend the whole Sabbath day in anything
          except the worship of God! In our country parishes, very often neither
          the religion of the Establishment nor of Dissent, at all affects the
          population. Take, for instance, that village which will be
          disgracefully remembem'ed as long as Essex endures, the village of
          Hedingham. Theme are in that place not only parish Churches, but
          Dissenting meetinghouses, and yet the persons who foully murdered the
          poor wretch supposed to be a wizard, must have been as ignorant and
          indifferent to common sense, let alone religion, as even Hottentots or
          Kaffirs, to whom the light of religion has never come. Why was this?
          Is it not because there is not enough of missionary spirit among
          Christian people to seek out those who are in the lowest strata of
          society, so that multitudes escape without ever coming into contact
          with godliness at all? In London, the City Missionaries will bear
          witness that while they can sometimes get at the wives, yet there are
          thousands of husbands who are necessarily away at the time of the
          missionary's visit, who have not a word of rebuke, or exhortation, or
          invitation, or encouragement, ever sounding in their ears at all, from
          the day of their birth to the day of their death; and they might, for
          all practical purposes, as well have been born in the center of Africa
          as in the city of London, for they are without God, without hope,
          aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, far oft; not by wicked works
          only, but by dense ignorance of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          These persons we may divide into two classes, upon neither of whom
          does the withering curse fall in this life. The first we look upon
          with hope. Although we see neither leaves nor fruit, we know that |the
          time of figs is not yet.| They are God's elect, but they are not
          called. Their names are in the Lamb's Book of Life, and were there
          from before the foundations of the world; though they be dead in
          trespasses, they are the objects of divine love, and they must, in due
          time, be called by irresistible grace, and turned from darkness to
          light. |The Lord hath much people in this city,| and this should be
          the encouragement of every one of you, to try to do good, that God has
          among the vilest of the vile, the most reprobate, the most debauched
          and drunken, an elect people who must be saved. When you take the Word
          to them, you do so because God has ordained you to be the messenger of
          life to their souls, and they must receive it, for so the decree of
          predestination runs; they must he called in the fullness of time to be
          the brethren of Christ and children of the Most High. They are
          redeemed, beloved friends, but not regenerated -- as much redeemed
          with precious blood as the saints before the eternal throne. They are
          Christ's property, and yet perhaps, they are waiting around the
          ale-house at this very moment until the door shall open -- bought with
          Jesus' precious blood, and yet spending their nights in a brothel, and
          their days in sin; but if Jesus Christ purchased them he will have
          them. If he counted down the precious drops, God is not unfaithful to
          forget the price which his Son has paid. He will not suffer his
          substitution to be in any case an ineffectual, dead thing. Tens of
          thousands of redeemed ones are not regenerated yet, but regenerated
          they must be; and this is your comfort and mine, when we go out with
          the quickening Word of God. Nay, more, these ungodly ones are prayed
          for by Christ before the throne. |Neither pray I for these alone,|
          saith the great Intercessor, |but for them also which shall believe on
          me through their word.| They do not pray for themselves; poor,
          ignorant souls, they do not know anything about prayer; but Jesus
          prays for them. Their names are on his breast, and ere long they must
          bow their stubborn knee, breathing the penitential sigh before the
          throne of grace. |The time of figs is not yet.| The predestinated
          moment has not struck; but, when it comes, they shall, for God will
          have his own; they must, for the Spirit is not to be withstood when he
          cometh forth with power -- they must become the willing servants of
          the living God. |My people shall be willing in the day of my power.|
          |He shall justify many.| |He shall see of the travail of his soul.|
          |He shall divide a portion with the great, and he shall divide the
          spoil with the strong.|
        </p>
        <p>
          No curse falls upon these; they deserve it, but eternal love prevents
          it. Their sins write it, but the finished sacrifice blots it out. They
          may well perish because they seek not mercy, but Christ intercedes for
          them, and live they shall.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas! however, among those who have neither leaves nor fruit, there is
          another class which never bring forth either the one or the other;
          they live in sin and die in ignorance, perishing without hope. As
          these leave the world, can they upbraid us for neglecting them? Are we
          clear of their blood? May not the blood of many of them cry from the
          ground against us? As they arc condemned on account of sins, may they
          not accuse us because we did not take the gospel to them, but left
          them where they were? Dread thought! but let it not be shaken off,
          there are tens of thousands every day who pass into the world of
          spirits unsaved, and inherit the righteous wrath of God. Yet in this
          life, you see, no special curse falls upon them, and this miracle has
          no special bearing upon them; it bears upon a totally different class
          of people, of whom we will now speak.
        </p>
        <p>III. WE HAVE BEFORE US A SPECAL CASE.</p>
        <p>
          I have already said, that in a fig tree, the fruit takes the
          precedence of the leaves, or the leaves and the fruit come at the same
          time; so that it is laid down as a general rule, that if there be
          leaves upon a fig tree, you may rightly expect to find fruit upon it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin then with the explanation of this special case, in a fig tree
          fruit comes before leaves. So in a true Christian, fruit always takes
          the precedence of profession. Find a man anywhere who is a true
          servant of God, and before he united himself with the Church, or
          attempted to engage in public prayer, or to identify himself with the
          people of God, he searched to see whether he had real repentance on
          account of sin -- he desired to know whether he had a sincere and
          genuine faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and he perhaps tarried some
          little time to try himself to see whether there were the fruits of
          holiness in his daily life. Indeed, I may say that there are some who
          wait too long; they are so afraid lest they should make a profession
          before they have grace in possession, that they will wait year after
          year -- too long -- become unwise, and make what was a virtue become a
          vice. Still this is the rule with Christians: they first give
          themselves to the Lord and afterwards to the Lord's people according
          to his will. You who are the servants of God -- do you not scorn to
          vaunt yourselves beyond your line and measure? Would you not think it
          disgraceful on your part to profess anything which you have not felt?
          Do you not feel a holy jealousy when you are teaching others, lest you
          should teach more than God has taught you? and are you not afraid even
          in your prayers lest you should use expressions which are beyond your
          own depth of meaning? I am sure the true Christian is always afraid of
          anything like having the leaves before he has the fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another remark follows from this -- where we see the leaves we have a
          right to expect the fruit. When I see a man a Church-member, when I
          hear him engage in prayer, I expect to see in him, holiness, the
          character and the image of Christ. I have a right to expect it,
          because the man has solemnly avowed that he is the partaker of divine
          grace. You cannot join a Church without taking upon yourselves very
          solemn responsibilities. What do you desire when you come to see us,
          and ask to be admitted into fellowship? You tell us that you have
          passed from death unto life, that you have been born again, that there
          has been a change in you, the hike of which you never knew before, one
          which only God could have wrought. You tell us you are in the habit of
          private prayer; that you have a desire for the conversion of others.
          If you did not so profess, we dare not receive you. Well now, having
          made these professions, it would be insincere on our part if we did
          not expect to see your characters holy, and your conversation correct;
          we have a right to expect it from your own professions. We have a
          right to expect it from the work of the Spirit which you claim to have
          received. Shall the Holy Spirit work in man's heart to produce a
          trifle? Do you think that the Spirit of God would have written us this
          Book, and that Jesus Christ would have shed his precious blood to
          produce a hypocrite? Is an inconsistent Christian the highest work of
          God? I suppose God's plan of salvation to be that which has more
          exercised his thoughts and wisdom than the making of all worlds and
          the sustenance of all providence; and shall this best, this highest,
          this darling work of God, produce no more than that poor, mean,
          talking, unacting, fruitless deceiver? Ye have no love for souls, no
          care for the spread of the Redeemer's kingdom, and yet think that the
          Spirit, has made you what you are! No zeal, no melting bowels of
          compassion, no cries of earnest entreaty, no wrestling with God, no
          holiness, no self-denial, and yet say that you are a vessel made by
          the Master and fitted for his use! How can this be? No; if you profess
          to be a Christian, from the necessity of the Spirit's work, we have a
          right to expect fruit from you. Besides, in genuine professors we do
          get the fruit, we see a faithful attachment to the Redeemer's cause,
          an endurance to the end, in poverty, in sickness, in shame, in
          persecution. We see other professors holding fast to the truth, they
          are not led aside by temptation, neither do they disgrace the cause
          they have espoused; and, if you profess to be one of the same order,
          we have a right to look for the same blessed fruits of the Spirit in
          you, and if we see them not you have belied us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe further that our Lord hungers for fruit. A hungry person seeks
          for something which may satisfy him, for fruit, not leaves! Jesus
          hungers for your holiness. A strong expression, you will say, but I
          doubt not of its accuracy. For what were we elected? We were
          predestinated to be conformed unto the image of God's Son; we were
          chosen to good works, |which God hath before ordained that we should
          walk in them.| What is the end of our redemption? Why did Jesus Christ
          die? | He gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all
          iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good
          works.| Why have we been called but that we should be called to be
          saints? To what end are any of the great operations of the covenant of
          grace? Do they not all point at our holiness? If you will think of any
          privilege which the Lord confers upon his people through Christ, you
          will perceive that they all aim at the sanctification of the chosen
          people -- the making of them to bring forth fruit that God the Father
          may be glorified in them. O Christian, for this the tears of the
          Savior! for this the agony and bloody sweat! for this the five
          death-wounds! for this the burial and the resurrection, that he makes
          you holy, even perfectly holy like unto himself! And can it be, that
          when he hungers after fruit, you think nothing of fruit-bearing? O
          professor, how base art thou, to call thyself a blood-bought child of
          God, amid yet to live unto thyself! How darest thou, O barren tree,
          professing to be watered by the bloody sweat, and digged by the griefs
          and woes of the wounded Savior -- how darest thou bring forth leaves
          and no fruit? Oh! sacrilegious mockery of a hungry Savior! oh!
          blasphemous tantalizing of a hungry Lord! that thou shouldst profess
          to have cost him all this, and yet yield him nothing! When I think
          that Jesus hungers after fruit in me, it stirs me tip to do more for
          him. Does it not have the same effect on you? He hungers for your good
          works; he hungers to see you useful. Jesus the King of kings, hungers
          after your prayers -- hungers after your anxieties for the souls of
          others; and nothing ever will satisfy him for the travail of his soul
          but seeing you wholly devoted to his cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          This brings us into the very midst and meaning of the miracle. There
          are some, then, who make unusual profession, and yet disappoint the
          Savior in his just expectations. The Jews did this. When Jesus Christ
          came it was not the time of figs. The time for great holiness was
          after the coming of Christ and the pouring out of the Spirit. All the
          other nations were without leaves. Greece, Rome, all these showed no
          signs of progress; but there was the Jewish nation covered with
          leaves. They professed already to have obtained the blessings which he
          came to bring. There stood the Pharisee with his long prayers; there
          were the lawyers and the Scribes with their deep knowledge of the
          things of the kingdom. They said they had the light. The time of figs
          was not come, but yet they had the leaves, though not a single fruit;
          and you know what a curse fell on Israel; how in the day of
          Jerusalem's destruction the tree was withered altogether from its
          root, because it had its leaves, but had no fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same will be true of any Church. There are times when all the
          Churches seem sunken alike in lethargy -- such a time we had, say ten
          years ago -- but one Church, perhaps, seems to be all alive. The
          congregations are large. Much, apparently, is proposed for the growth
          of the Savior's kingdom. A deal of noise is made about it; there is
          much talk, and the people are all expectation; and, if there be no
          fruit, no real consecration to Christ, if there be no genuine
          liberality, no earnest vital godliness, no hallowed consistency, other
          Churches may live on; but such a Church as this, making so high a
          profession, and being so precocious in the produce of leaves, shall
          have a curse from God. No man shall eat fruit of it for ever, and it
          shall wither away.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of individuals the moral of our miracle runs thus. Some
          are looked upon as young believers, who early join the Church. |The
          time of figs is not yet;| it is not a very ordinary case to see
          children converted, but we do see some, and we are very grateful. We
          are jealous however lest we should see leaves but not fruit. These
          juveniles are extraordinary cases; and on that account we look for
          higher results. When we are disappointed what shall come upon such but
          a curse upon their precocity, which led them to the deception. Some of
          us were converted, or profess to have been, when young, and if we have
          lived hitherto, and all we have produced has been merely words,
          resolves, professions, but not fruit unto God, we must expect the
          curse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, professsors eminent in station. There are necessarily but few
          ministers, but few Church officers; but when men so distinguish
          themselves by zeal, or by louder professions than others, as to gain
          the ear of the Christian public and are placed in responsible
          positions -- if they bring forth no fruit, they are the persons upon
          whom the curse will light. It may be with other Christians that |the
          time of figs is not yet;| they have not made the advances which these
          profess to have made; but having been, upon their own profession,
          elected to an office which essentially requires fruit, since they
          yield it not, let them beware.
        </p>
        <p>
          To those who make professions of much love to Christ, the same caution
          may be given. With the most of Christians, I am afraid, I must say
          that |the time of figs is not yet,| for we are too much like the
          Laodicean Church. But you meet with some men -- how much they are in
          love with Christ! How sweetly they can talk about him, but what do
          they do for him? Nothing! nothing! Their love lies just in the wind
          which comes out of their own mouths, and that is all. Now, when the
          Lord has a curse, he will deal it out on such They went beyond all
          others in an untimely declaration of a very fervent love, and now they
          yield him no fruit. |Yes,| said one, |I love God so much, that I do
          not reckon that anything I have is my own. It is all the Lord's -- all
          the Lord's, and I am his steward.| Well, this dear good man, of
          course, joined the Church, and after a time, some mission work wanted
          a little help. What was his reply? |When I pay my seat rent, I have
          done all I intend to do.| A man of wealth and means! After a little
          time, this same man found it inconvenient even to pay for his seat,
          and goes now to a place not quite so full, where he can get a seat and
          do nothing to support the ministry! If there is a special thunderbolt
          anywhere, it is these unctions hypocrites who whine about love to
          Christ, and bow down at the shrine of mammon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, take another case. You meet with others whose profession is not of
          so much love, but it is of much experience. Oh! what experience they
          have had! What deep experience! Ah! they know the humblings of heart
          and the plague of human nature! They know the depths of corruption,
          and the heights of divine fellowship, and so on. Yes, and if you go
          into the shop you find the corruption is carried on behind the
          counter, and the deceit in the day-book; if they do not know the
          plague of their own hearts, at least they are a plague to their own
          household. Such people are abhorrent to all men, and much more to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others you meet with who have a censorious tongue. What good people
          they must be; they can see the faults of other people so plainly! This
          Church is not right, and the other is not right, and yonder preacher
          -- well some people think him a very good man, but they do not. They
          can see the deficiencies in the various denominations, and they
          observe that very few really carry out Scripture as it should be
          carried out. They complain of want of love, and are the very people
          who create that want. Now if you will watch these very censorious
          people, the very faults they indicate in others, they are indulging in
          themselves; and while they are seeking to find out the mote in their
          brother's eye, they have a beam in their own. These are the people who
          are indicated by this fig tree, for they ought, according to their own
          showing, taking t hem on their own ground, to be better than other
          people. If what they say be true, they are bright particular stars,
          and they ought to give special light to the world. They are such that
          even Jesus Christ himself might expect to receive fruit from them, but
          they are nothing but deceivers, with these high soarings and proud
          boastings; they are nothing after all but pretenders. Like Jezebel
          with her paint, which made her all the uglier, they would seem to be
          what they are not. As old Adam says, |They are candles with big wicks
          and no tallow, and when they go out they make a foul and nauseous
          smell.| |They have summer sweating on their brow, and winter freezing
          in their hearts.| You would think them the land of Goshen, but prove
          them the wilderness of sin. Let us search ourselves, lest such be the
          case with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And now to close, SUCH A TREE MIGHT WELL BE WITHERED. Deception is
          abhorred of God. There was the Jewish temple, there were the priests
          standing in solemn pomp, there were the abundant sacrifices of God's
          altar. But was God pleased with his temple? No, because in the temple
          you had all the leaves, you had all the externals of worship, but
          there was no true prayer, no belief in the great Lamb of God's
          passover, no truth, no righteousness, no love of men, no care for the
          glory of God; and so the temple, which had been a house of prayer, had
          become a den of thieves. You do not marvel that the temple was
          destroyed. You and I may become just like that temple. We may go on
          with all the externals of religions, nobody may miss us out of our
          seat at Tabernacle, nay, we may never miss our Christian engagements;
          we may be in all external matters more precise than we used to be, and
          yet for all that, we may have become in our hearts a den of thieves;
          the heart may be given to the world while external ceremonies are
          still kept up and maintained. Let us beware of this, for such a place
          cannot be long without a curse. It is abhorrent to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, it is deceptive to man. Look at that temple! What do men go
          there for? To see holiness and virtue. Why tread they its hallowed
          courts? To get nearer to God. And what do they find there? Instead of
          holiness, covetousness; instead of getting nearer to God, they get
          into the midst of a mart where men are haggling about the price of
          doves, and bickering with one another about the changing of shekels.
          So men may watch to hear some seasonable word from our lips, and
          instead of that, may get evil; and as that temple was cursed for
          deluding men, so may we be, because we deceive and disappoint the
          wants of mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          More than this, this barren fig tree committed sacrilege upon Christ,
          did it not? Might it not have exposed him to ridicule? Some might have
          said, |How goest thou to a tree, thou prophet, whereon there is no
          fruit?| A false professor exposes Christ to ridicule. As the temple of
          old dishonored God, so does a Christian when his heart is not right;
          he does dishonor to God, and makes the holy cause to be trodden under
          foot of the adversary. Such men indeed have reason to beware.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, this tree might well be cursed, because its bringing forth
          nothing but leaves was a plain evidence of its sterility. It had force
          and vitality, but it turned it to ill account, and would continue to
          do so. The curse of Christ was but a confirmation of what it already
          was. He did as good as say, |He that is unfruitful, let him be
          unfruitful still.| And now, what if Christ should come into this
          Tabernacle this morning, and should look on you and on me, and see in
          any of us great profession and great pomp of leaves, and yet no fruit,
          what if he should pronounce the curse on us, what would be the effect?
          We should wither away as others have done. What mean we by this? Why,
          they have on a sudden turned to the world. We could not understand why
          such fair saints should, on a sudden, become such black devils; the
          fact was, Christ had pronounced the word, and they began to wither
          away. If he should pronounce the unmasking word on any mere professor
          here, and say, |Let no man eat fruit of thee for ever,| you will go
          into gross outward sin and wither to your shame. This will take place
          probably on a sudden; and taking place, your case will be
          irretrievable; you never afterwards will be restored. The blast which
          shall fall upon you will be eternal; you will live as a lasting
          monument of the terrible justice of Christ, as the great head of the
          Church; you will be spared to let it be seen that a man outside the
          Church may escape with impunity in this life, but a man inside the
          Church shall have a present curse, and be made to stand as a tree
          blasted by the lightning of God for ever. Now, this is a
          heart-searching matter. It went through me yesterday when I thought,
          |Well, here am I, I have professed to be called of God to the
          ministry; I have forced myself into a leading place in God's Church; I
          have voluntarily put myself into a place where sevenfold damnation is
          my inevitable inheritance if I be not true and sincere.| I could
          almost wish myself back out of the Church, or at least in the
          obscurest place in her ranks, to escape the perils and
          responsibilities of my position; and so may you, if you have not the
          witness of the Spirit in you that you are born of God -- you may wish
          that you never thought of Christ, and never dreamed of taking his name
          upon you. If you have by diligence worked yourself into a high
          position among God's people; if you have mere leaves without the
          fruit, the more sure is the curse, because the greater the
          disappointment of the Savior. The more you profess, the more is
          expected of you; and if you do not yield it, the more just the
          condemnation when you shall be left to stand for ever withered by the
          curse of Christ. O men and brethren, let us tremble before the
          heart-searching eye of God; but let us still remember that grace can
          make us fruitful yet. The way of mercy is open still. Let us apply to
          the wounds of Christ this morning. If we have never begun, let us
          begin now. Now let us throw our arms about the Savior, and take him to
          be ours; and, having done this, let us seek divine grace, that for the
          rest of our lives we may work for God. Oh! I do hope to do more for
          God, and I hope you will. O Holy Spirit, work in us mightily, for in
          thee is our fruit found! Amen.<br />
