 </p>
</b></font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">SUBJECT. The writer sees evildoers in power, and smarts 
    under their oppressions. His sense of the divine sovereignty, of which he 
    had been singing in the previous Psalm, leads him to appeal to God as the 
    great Judge of the earth; this he does with much vehemence and importunity, 
    evidently tingling under the lash of the oppressor. Confident in God's 
    existence, and assured of his personal observation of the doings of men, the 
    psalmist rebukes his atheistic adversaries, and proclaims his triumph in his 
    God. He also <i>interprets the severe dispensation of Providence to be in 
    very deed most instructive chastisements, and so he counts those happy who 
    endure them</i>. The Psalm is another pathetic form of the old enigma, "Why 
    do the wicked prosper?" It is another instance of a good man perplexed by 
    the prosperity of the ungodly, cheering his heart by remembering that there 
    is, after all, a King in Heaven, by whom all things are overruled for good.</p>
<p align="justify">DIVISIONS. </p>
<p align="justify">In 1-7 the psalmist utters his complaint against wicked 
    oppressors. </p>
<p align="justify">From 8-11 he reasons against their skeptical notion that 
    God did not notice the actions of men. </p>
<p align="justify">He then shows that the Lord does bless his people and 
    will deliver them, though for a while they may be chastened, 12-15.</p>
<p align="justify">He again pleads for help in 16, and declares his entire 
    dependence upon God for preservation, 17-19.</p>
<p align="justify">Yet a third time urges his complaint, 20-21; and then 
    concludes with the confident assurance that his enemies, and all other 
    wicked men, would certainly be made to reap the due reward of their deeds, 
    "yes, the Lord our God shall cut them off."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongs; O God, to 
    whom vengeance belongs, show yourself.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Or, God of retribution, Jehovah, God of retribution, 
    shine forth<i>! A very natural prayer when innocence is trampled down, and 
    wickedness exalted on high. </i>If the execution of justice is a right 
    thing—and who can deny the fact?—then it must be a very proper thing to 
    desire it; not out of private revenge, in which case a man would hardly dare 
    to appeal to God—but out of sympathy with right, and pity for those who are 
    made wrongfully to suffer.</p>
<p align="justify">Who can see a nation enslaved, or even an individual 
    downtrodden, without crying to the Lord to arise and vindicate the righteous 
    cause? The toleration of injustice is here attributed to the Lord's being 
    hidden, and it is implied that the bare sight of him will suffice to alarm 
    the tyrants into ceasing their oppressions. God has but to show himself, and 
    the good cause wins the day. He comes, he sees, he conquers! </p>
<p align="justify">Truly in these evil days we need a manifest display of 
    his power, for the ancient enemies of God and man are again struggling for 
    the mastery, and if they gain it, woe unto the saints of God.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. Lift up yourself, judge of the earth. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Ascend your judgment seat and be acknowledged as the 
    ruler of men. Moreover, raise yourself as men do who are about to strike 
    with all their might; for the abounding sin of mankind requires a heavy blow 
    from your hand. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Pay back the proud for what they deserve.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Give them measure for measure, a fair retaliation, blow 
    for blow. The proud look down upon the gracious poor and strike them from 
    above, as a giant might hurl down blows upon his adversary. After the same 
    manner, O Lord, lift up yourself, and return a recompense upon the proud, 
    and let them know that you are far more above them than they can be above 
    the meanest of their fellow men. The psalmist thus invokes the retribution 
    of justice in plain speech, and his request is precisely that which patient 
    innocence puts up in silence, when her looks of anguish appeal to Heaven.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. LORD, how long shall the wicked—how long shall 
    the wicked triumph? </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Shall wrong forever rule? Are slavery, robbery, tyranny, 
    never to cease? Since there is certainly a just God in Heaven, armed with 
    almighty power, surely there must be sooner or later an end to the 
    ascendancy of evil, innocence must one day find a defender. </p>
<p align="justify">This "how long?" of the text is the bitter complaint of 
    all the righteous in all ages, and expresses wonder caused by <i>that great 
    enigma of providence, the existence and predominance of evil</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">The sound "how long?" is very akin to howling, as if it 
    were one of the saddest of all the utterances in which misery bemoans 
    itself. Many a time has this bitter complaint been heard in the dungeons of 
    the Inquisition, at the whipping posts of slavery, and in the prisons of 
    oppression. In due time God will publish his reply—but the full end is not 
    yet.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. How long shall they utter and speak hard things?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The ungodly are not content with <i>deeds </i>of 
    injustice—but they add hard <i>speeches</i>, boasting, threatening, and 
    insulting over the saints. Will the Lord forever endure this? Will he leave 
    his own children much longer to be the prey of their enemies? Will not the 
    insolent speeches of his adversaries and theirs at last provoke his justice 
    to intervene?<i> Words often wound more than swords</i>—they are as hard to 
    the heart as stones to the flesh; and these are poured forth by the ungodly 
    in redundance, for such is the force of the word translated utter; and they 
    use them so commonly that they become their common speech (they utter and 
    speak them)—will this always be endured? </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And all the workers of iniquity boast themselves.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They even soliloquise and talk to themselves, and of 
    themselves, in arrogance of Spirit, as if they were doing some good deed 
    when they crush the poor and needy, and spit their spite on gracious men.<i> 
    It is the nature of workers of iniquity to boast, just as it is a 
    characteristic of godly men to be humble</i>—will their boasts always be 
    suffered by the great Judge, whose ear hears all that they say? Long, very 
    long, have they had the platform to themselves, and loud, very loud, have 
    been their blasphemies of God, and their railings at his saints—will not the 
    day soon come when the threatened heritage of shame and everlasting contempt 
    shall be meted out to them? Thus the oppressed plead with their Lord, and 
    shall not God avenge his own elect? Will he not speak out of Heaven to the 
    enemy and say, "Why do you persecute me"?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. They break in pieces your people, O LORD.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Grinding them with oppression, crushing them with 
    contempt. Yet the men they break in pieces are God's own people, and they 
    are persecuted because they are so; this is a strong plea for the divine 
    interposition. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And afflict your heritage.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Causing them sorrowful humiliation and deep depression of 
    heart. The term, "your heritage," marks out the <i>election </i>of the 
    saints, God's peculiar interest and delight in them, his covenant relation, 
    of long standing, to them and their fathers. This also is a storehouse of 
    arguments with their faithful God. Will he not defend his own people? Will a 
    man lose his inheritance, or permit it to be contemptuously despoiled? Those 
    who are ground down, and trampled on, are not strangers—but the choice and 
    chosen ones of the Lord; how long will he leave them to be a prey to cruel 
    foes?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder 
    the fatherless. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They deal most arrogantly with those who are the most 
    evident objects of compassion. The law of God especially commends these poor 
    ones to the kindness of good men, and it is peculiar wickedness which 
    singles them out to be the victims not only of fraud but of murder. Must not 
    such inhuman conduct as this provoke the Lord? Shall the tears of widows, 
    the groans of strangers, and the blood of orphans be poured forth in vain? 
    As surely as there is a God in Heaven, he will visit those who perpetrate 
    such crimes; though he bear long with them, he will yet take vengeance, and 
    that speedily.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. Yet they say, the Lord shall not see. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This was the reason of their arrogance, and the climax of 
    their wickedness: <i>they were blindly wicked because they dreamed of a 
    blind God</i>. <i>When men believe that the eyes of God are dim, there is no 
    reason to wonder that they give full license to their brutal passions</i>. 
    The persons mentioned above not only cherished an infidel unbelief—but dared 
    to avow it, uttering the monstrous doctrine that God is too far away to take 
    notice of the actions of men.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Neither shall the God of Jacob regard it. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Abominable blasphemy and transparent falsehood! If God 
    has actually become his people's God, and proved his care for them by a 
    thousand acts of grace, how dare the ungodly assert that he will not notice 
    the wrongs done to them? <i>There is no limit to the proud man's profanity, 
    reason itself cannot restrain him; he has broken through the bounds of 
    common sense. </i></p>

<p align="justify">Jacob's God heard him at the brook Jabbok; Jacob's God 
    led him and kept him all his life long, and said concerning him and his 
    family, "Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm;" and yet these 
    brutish ones profess to believe that he neither sees nor regards the 
    injuries wrought upon the elect people! Surely in such unbelievers is 
    fulfilled the saying of the wise, that <i>those whom the Lord means to 
    destroy he leaves to the madness of their corrupt hearts</i>.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. Understand, you brutish among the people. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They said that God did not <i>note</i>, and now, using 
    the same word in the original, the psalmist calls on the wicked to <i>note</i>, 
    and have regard to the truth. He designates them as boors, boarish, swinish 
    men, and well was the term deserved—he bids them understand or consider, if 
    they can. They thought themselves to be wise, and indeed the only men of wit 
    in the world—but he calls them "boars among the people". <i>Wicked men are 
    fools, and the more they know, the more foolish they become. "No fool like a 
    learned fool" is a true proverb</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">When a man has done with God, he has done with his 
    manhood, and has fallen to the level of the ox and the donkey—yes, beneath 
    them, for "the ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master's crib."</p>
<p align="justify">Instead of being humbled in the presence of scientific 
    infidels, we ought to <i>pity </i>them; they affect to look clown upon 
    us—but we have far more cause to look down upon them. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And you fools, when will you be wise?</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Is it not high time? You know the ways of folly, what 
    profit have you in them? Have you no relics of reason left? no shreds of 
    sense? If as yet there lingers in your minds a gleam of intelligence, 
    hearken to argument, and consider the questions now about to be proposed to 
    you.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. He who planted the ear, shall he not hear? </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He fashioned that marvelous organ, and fixed it in the 
    most convenient place near to the brain—and is he deaf himself? Is he 
    capable of such design and invention—and yet can he not discern what is done 
    in the world which he made? He made you hear—can he not himself hear? 
    Unanswerable question! It overwhelms the skeptic, and covers him with 
    confusion. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">He who formed the eye, shall he not see? </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He gives us vision; is it conceivable that he has no 
    sight himself? With skillful hand he fashioned the optic nerve, and the 
    eyeball, and all its intricate mechanism—it surpasses all conception that he 
    can himself be unable to observe the doings of his creatures. If there is a 
    God, he must be a personal intelligent being, and no limit can be set to his 
    knowledge.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. He who chastises the heathen, shall not he 
    correct? </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He reproves whole nations—can he not reprove individuals? 
    All history shows that he visits national sin with national judgment—and can 
    he not deal with single persons? The question which follows is equally full 
    of force, and is asked with a degree of warmth which checks the speaker, and 
    causes the inquiry to remain incomplete. </p>
<p align="justify">It begins, <b>He who teaches man knowledge</b>, and then 
    it comes to a pause, which the translators have supplied with the words, <b>
    shall not he know</b>? But no such words are in the original, where the 
    sentence comes to an abrupt end, as if the inference were too natural to 
    need to be stated, and the writer had lost patience with the brutish men 
    with whom he had argued. </p>
<p align="justify">The earnest believer often feels as if he could say, "Go 
    away, you are not worth arguing with! If you were reasonable men, these 
    things would be too obvious to need to be stated in your hearing. I 
    forbear." </p>
<p align="justify">Man's knowledge comes from God. Science in its first 
    principles was taught to our progenitor Adam, and all after advances have 
    been due to divine aid—does not the author and revealer of all knowledge 
    himself know?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11.</p></b> Whether men admit or deny that God knows, 
    one thing is here declared, namely, that <b>The Lord knows the thoughts of 
    man, that they are vanity</b>. Not their <i>words </i>alone are heard, and 
    their <i>works </i>seen—but he reads the secret motions of their <i>minds</i>, 
    for men themselves are not hard to be discerned of him. Before his glance 
    they themselves are but vanity. <i>It is in the Lord's esteem no great 
    matter to know the thoughts of such transparent pieces of vanity as mankind 
    are, he sums them up in a moment as poor vain things. 
</i>
<p align="justify">This is the sense of the original—but that given in the 
    authorized version is also true—the <i>thoughts</i>, the best part, the most 
    spiritual portion of man's nature, even these are <i>vanity </i>itself, and 
    nothing better. </p>
<p align="justify">Poor man! And yet such a creature as this boasts, plays 
    at monarch, tyrannizes over his fellow worms, and defies his God!<i> Madness 
    is mingled with human vanity</i>, like smoke with the fog, to make it fouler 
    but not more substantial than it would have been alone. How foolish are 
    those who think that God does not know their <i>actions</i>, when the truth 
    is that their vain <i>thoughts </i>are all perceived by him! How absurd to 
    make nothing of God when in fact we ourselves are as nothing in his sight!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. Blessed is the man whom you <i>chasten</i>, O 
    LORD. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The psalmist's mind is growing quiet. He no longer 
    complains to God or argues with men—but tunes his harp to softer melodies, 
    for his faith perceives that with the most afflicted believer, all is well. 
    Though he may not feel blessed while smarting under the rod of 
    chastisement—yet blessed he is. He is precious in God's sight, or the Lord 
    would not take the trouble to correct him, and right blessed will the 
    results of his correction be. </p>
<p align="justify">The psalmist calls the chastened one a "man" in the best 
    sense, using the Hebrew word which implies strength. <i>He is a man, indeed, 
    who is under the teaching and training of the Lord. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And <i>teach </i>him out of your law.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">The <i>book </i>and the <i>rod</i>, the <i>law </i>and 
    the <i>chastening</i>—go together, and are made doubly useful by being found 
    in connection. Affliction without the word is a furnace for the metal—but 
    there is no flux to aid the purifying: the word of God supplies that need, 
    and makes the fiery trial effectual. After all, the blessing of God belongs 
    far rather to those who suffer under the divine hand, than to those who make 
    others suffer: better far to lie and cry out as a "man" under the hand of 
    our heavenly Father, than to roar and rave as a brute, and to bring down 
    upon one's self a death-blow from the destroyer of evil.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The afflicted believer is under God's tutelage, he is in 
    training for something higher and better. All that he meets with is working 
    out his highest good, therefore is he a blessed man, however much his 
    outward circumstances may argue the reverse.</p>
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. That you may give him rest from the days of 
    adversity, until the pit is dug for the wicked. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The <i>chastening hand </i>and <i>instructive book </i>
    are sanctified to us, so that we learn to rest in the Lord. We see that his 
    end is our everlasting benefit, and therefore abide quiet under all trying 
    providences and bitter persecutions, waiting our time. </p>
<p align="justify">The <i>Mighty Hunter </i>is preparing the pit for the 
    brutish ones; they are prowling about at this time, and tearing the 
    sheep—but they will soon be captured and destroyed, therefore the people of 
    the Lord learn to rest in days of adversity, and tarry the leisure of their 
    God. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Wicked men may not yet be ripe for punishment, nor 
    punishment ready for them. Hell is a prepared place for a prepared people. 
    As days of grace ripen saints for glory—so days of wantonness help sinners 
    to rot into the corruption of eternal destruction.</p>
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14. For the LORD will not cast off his people. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He may cast them <i>down</i>—but he never can cast them
    <i>off. </i>During fierce persecutions the saints have been apt to think 
    that the Lord had left his own sheep, and given them over to the wolf. But 
    it has never been so, nor shall it ever be, for the Lord will not withdraw 
    his love, neither will he forsake his inheritance. For a time he may leave 
    his own with the design of benefitting them thereby—yet never can he utterly 
    desert them.</p>
<p align="justify">"He may chasten and correct,<br/>
    But he never can neglect; <br/>
    May in faithfulness reprove,<br/>
    But he never can cease to love."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 15. But judgment shall return unto righteousness.</p></b>

<p align="justify">The great Judge will come, the reign of righteousness 
    will commence, the course of affairs will yet be turned into the right 
    channel—and then all the godly will rejoice. The <i>chariot of righteousness
    </i>will be drawn in triumph through our streets, and all the upright in 
    heart shall follow it, as in happy procession. </p>
<p align="justify">A delightful hope is here expressed in poetic imagery of 
    much beauty. The government of the world has been for a while in the hands 
    of those who have used it for the basest and most wicked ends; but the cry 
    of prayer will bring back righteousness to the throne, and then every 
    upright heart will have its portion of joy.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 16. Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? 
    Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Notwithstanding the psalmist's persuasion that all would 
    be well eventually, he could not at the time perceive anyone who would stand 
    side by side with him in opposing evil; no champion of the right was 
    forthcoming, the faithful failed from among men. This also is a bitter 
    trial, and a sore evil under the sun; yet it<i> has its purpose, for it 
    drives the heart still more completely to the Lord, compelling it to rest 
    alone in him</i>. If we could find friends elsewhere, it may be our God 
    would not be so dear to us; but when, after calling upon Heaven and earth to 
    help, we meet with no support but such as comes from the eternal arm, we are 
    led to prize our God, and rest upon him with undivided trust. <i>Never is 
    the soul safer or more at rest than when, all other helpers failing, she 
    leans upon the Lord alone. </i></p>

<p align="justify">The verse before us is an appropriate cry, now that the 
    church sees error invading her on all sides, while faithful ministers are 
    few, and fewer still are bold enough to "stand up" and defy the enemies of 
    truth. Where are our Luthers and our Calvins? A false charity has enfeebled 
    the most of the valiant men of Israel. Our John Knox would be worth a mint 
    at this hour—but where is he? Our grand consolation is that the <i>God </i>
    of Knox and Luther is yet with us, and in due time will call out his chosen 
    champions.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 17. Unless the Lord had been my help, my soul had 
    almost dwelt in silence. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Without Jehovah's help, the psalmist declares that he 
    would have died outright, and gone into the silent land, where no more 
    testimonies can be borne for the living God. </p>
<p align="justify">Or he may mean that he would not have had a word to speak 
    against his enemies—but would have been wrapped in speechless shame. </p>
<p align="justify">Blessed be God, we are not left to that condition yet, 
    for the Almighty Lord is still the helper of all those who look to him. Our 
    inmost soul is bowed down when we see the victories of the Lord's enemies—we 
    cannot endure it, we cover our mouths in confusion; but he will yet arise 
    and avenge his own cause, therefore have we hope.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 18. When I said, My foot is slipping.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Is slipping even now. I perceived my danger, and cried 
    out in horror, and then, at the very moment of my extremity, came the needed 
    help.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Your mercy, O LORD, held me up. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Often enough is this the case, we feel our weakness, and 
    see our danger, and in fear and trembling we cry out. At such times nothing 
    can help us but mercy; we can make no appeal to any imagined merit, for we 
    feel that it is our inbred sin which makes our feet so ready to fail us; our 
    joy is that mercy endures forever, and is always at hand to pluck us out of 
    the danger, and hold us up—otherwise we would fall to our destruction. </p>
<p align="justify">Ten thousand times has this verse been true in relation 
    to some of us, and especially to the writer of this commentary. The danger 
    was imminent, it was upon us, we were going; the peril was apparent, we saw 
    it, and were aghast at the sight; our own heart was failing, and we 
    concluded that it was all over with us. But then came the almighty 
    interposition: we did not fail, we<i> were held up by an unseen hand</i>, 
    the devices of the enemy were frustrated, and we sang for joy. O faithful 
    Keeper of our souls, be extolled forever and ever. We will bless the Lord at 
    all times, his praise shall continually be in our mouths.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 19. In the multitude of my thoughts within me. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">When I am tossed to and fro with various reasonings, 
    distractions, questions, and forebodings, I will fly to my true rest.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">For your comforts delight my soul.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">From my sinful thoughts, my vain thoughts, my sorrowful 
    thoughts, my griefs, my cares, my conflicts—I will hasten to the Lord; he 
    has divine comforts, and these will not only console but actually delight 
    me. How sweet are the comforts of the Spirit! Who can muse upon eternal 
    love, immutable purposes, covenant promises, finished redemption, the risen 
    Savior, his union with his people, the coming glory, and such like themes, 
    without feeling his heart leaping with joy? </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The little world within is, like the great world without 
    full of confusion and strife</p></i>; but when Jesus enters it, and whispers 
    "Peace be unto you, "there is a calm, yes, a rapture of bliss. 
<p align="justify">Let us turn away from the mournful contemplation of the 
    oppression of man and the present predominance of the wicked, to that 
    sanctuary of pure rest which is found in the God of all comfort. To give us 
    some evidence and assurance of his love and favor towards us; these are his 
    comforts. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Delight.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This is a transcendent expression, which the Holy Spirit 
    in the pen of the prophet David comes up unto. It had been a great matter to 
    have said, they satisfy my soul, or, they quiet me, no more but so, that is 
    the highest pitch which a perplexed spirit can wish to itself. Those who are 
    in great pain, they would be glad if they might have but ease, and they 
    cannot aspire so high as pleasure and delight, this is more than can be 
    expected by them.</p>
<p align="justify">But see here now the notable efficacy of these Divine 
    comforts; they do not only pacify the mind—but they delight it; they not 
    only satisfy it—but ravish it; they not only quiet—but delight it. </p>
<p align="justify">Your comforts delight my soul. That is, not only take 
    away the present grief—but likewise put in the room and place of it most 
    unspeakable comfort and consolation; as the sun does not only dispel 
    darkness—but likewise brings in a glorious light in the stead of it.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 20. Shall the <i>throne of iniquity </i>have 
    fellowship with you? </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Such thrones there are, and they plead a right divine—but 
    their claim is groundless, a fraud upon mankind and a blasphemy of Heaven. 
    God enters into no alliance with unjust authority, he gives no sanction to 
    unrighteous legislation.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Which frames mischief by a law?</p></b> 
<p align="justify">They legalise robbery and violence, and then plead that 
    it is the law of the land; and so indeed it may be—but it is a wickedness 
    for all that. With great care men prepare enactments intended to put down 
    all protests, so as to render wrong-doing a permanent institution—but one 
    element is necessary to true government, namely, righteousness; and lacking 
    that, all their arrangements of the holders of power must come to an end, 
    and all their decrees must in process of time be wiped out of the statute 
    book. Nothing can last forever but impartial right. No injustice can be 
    permanent, for God will not set his seal upon it, nor have any fellowship 
    with it, and therefore down it must come, and happy shall be the day which 
    sees it fall.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 21. They gather themselves together against the 
    soul of the righteous.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">So many are there of them that they crowd their 
    assemblies, and carry their hard measures with enthusiasm; they are the 
    popular party, and are eager to put down the saints. In counsel, and in 
    action, they are unanimous; their one resolve is to hold their own 
    tyrannical position, and put down the godly party. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And condemn the innocent blood. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They are great at slander and false accusation, nor do 
    they stick at murder; no crime is too great for them, if only they can 
    trample on the servants of the Lord. </p>
<p align="justify">This description is historically true in reference to 
    persecuting times; it has been fulfilled in England, and may be again if 
    Popery is to advance in future time at the same rate as in the past few 
    years. The dominant sect has the law on its side, and boasts that it is <i>
    the national church</i>; but the law which establishes and endows one 
    religion rather than another, is radically an injustice. God has no 
    fellowship with it, and therefore the <i>synagogue of Ritualism </i>will yet 
    be a stench in the nostrils of all sane men. What evil times are in store 
    for us it is not for us to prophesy; it is ours to leave the matter in the 
    hands of him who cannot be in fellowship with an oppressive system, and will 
    not always endure to be insulted to his face by Popish idols, and their 
    priests.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 22.</p></b> Let the wicked gather as they may, the 
    psalmist is not afraid—but sweetly sings, <b>The Lord is my defense, and my 
    God is the rock of my refuge</b>. Firm as a rock is Jehovah's love, and 
    there do we betake ourselves for shelter. In him, even in him alone, we find 
    safety, let the world rage as it may<i>. We ask not aid from man—but are 
    content to flee into the bosom of omnipotence.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 23.</p></b> <b>He has brought on them their own 
    iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness.
</b>
<p align="justify">The natural result of oppression is the destruction of 
    the despot—his own iniquities crush him before long. Providence arranges 
    retaliations as remarkable as they are just. High crimes in the end bring on 
    heavy judgments, to sweep away evil men from off the face of the earth. Yes, 
    God himself interposes in a special manner, and cuts short the career of 
    tyrants while they are in the very midst of their crimes. Wicked men are 
    often arrested by the messengers of divine justice red handed, with the 
    evidences of their guilt upon them. </p>
<p align="justify">While the stolen bread is in their mouths, wrath slays 
    them. While the ill gotten wedge of gold is yet in their tent, judgment 
    overtakes them. God himself conspicuously visits them, and reveals his own 
    power in their overthrow. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The LORD our God shall cut them off. </p></b>Here, then, the 
    matter ends; faith reads the <i>present </i>in the light of the <i>future</i>, 
    and ends her song without a trembling note.
