        <p>
          IN a world of mere phenomena, where all events are bound to one
          another by a rigid law of cause and effect, it is possible to imagine
          the course of a long period bringing all things at the end of it into
          exactly the same relations as they occupied at the beginning. We
          should, then, obviously have a succession of cycles rigidly similar to
          one another, both in events and in the sequence of them. The universe
          would eternally repeat the same changes in a fixed order of
          recurrence, though each cycle might be many millions of years in
          length. Moreover, the precise similarity of these cycles would render
          the very existence of each one of them entirely unnecessary. We can
          suppose, without any logical inconsequence, any one of them struck
          out, and the two which had been destined to precede and follow it
          brought into immediate contiguity.
        </p>
        <p>
          This supposition transforms the universe into a dead machine. The
          lives and the souls of men become so indifferent, that the
          annihilation of a whole human race, or of many such races, is
          absolutely nothing. Every event passes away as it happens, filling its
          place in the sequence, but purposeless for the future. The order of
          all things becomes, not merely an iron rule, from which nothing can
          ever swerve, but an iron rule which guides to nothing and ends in
          nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such a supposition is possible to the logical understanding: it is not
          possible to the spirit. The human heart refuses to believe in a
          universe without a purpose. To the spirit, all things that exist must
          have a purpose, and nothing can pass away till that purpose be
          fulfilled. The lapse of time is no exception to this demand. Each
          moment of time, as it passes, is taken up in the shape of permanent
          results into the time that follows, and only perishes by being
          converted into something more substantial than itself. A series of
          recurring cycles, however conceivable to the logical understanding, is
          inconceivable to the spirit; for every later cycle must be made
          different from every earlier by the mere fact of coming after it and
          embodying its results. The material world may possibly be subject to
          such a rule, and may, in successive epochs, be the cradle of
          successive races of spiritual beings. But the world of spirits cannot
          be a mere machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          In accordance with this difference between the material and the
          spiritual worlds, we ought to be prepared to find progress in the
          latter, however much fixity there may be in the former. The earth may
          still be describing precisely the same orbit as that which was
          assigned to her at the creation. The sea. sons may be precisely the
          same. The planets, the moon, and the stars, may be unchanged both in
          appearance and in reality. But man is a spiritual as well as a
          material creature, must be subject to the laws of the spiritual as
          well as to those of the material world, and cannot stand still because
          things around him do. Now, that the individual man is capable of
          perpetual, or almost perpetual, development from the day of his birth
          to that of his death, is obvious of course. But we may well expect to
          find something more than this in a spiritual creature who does not
          stand alone, but forms a part of a whole world of creatures like
          himself Man cannot be considered as an individual. He is, in reality,
          only man by virtue of his being a member of the human race. Any other
          animal that we know would probably not be very different in its nature
          brought up from its very birth apart from all its kind. A child so
          brought up becomes, as instances could be adduced to prove, not a man
          in the full sense at all, but rather a beast in human shape, with
          human faculties, no doubt, hidden underneath, but with no hope in this
          life of ever developing those faculties into true humanity. If, then,
          the whole in this case, as in so many others, is prior to the parts,
          we may conclude, that we arc to look for that progress which is
          essential to a spiritual being subject to the lapse of time, not only
          in the individual, but also quite as much in the race taken as a
          whole. We may expect to find, in the history of man, each successive
          age incorporating into itself the substance of the preceding.
        </p>
        <p>
          This power, whereby the present ever gathers into itself the results
          of the past, transforms the human race into a colossal man, whose life
          reaches from the creation to the day of judgment. The successive
          generations of men are days in this man's life. The discoveries and
          inventions which characterize the different .epochs of the world's
          history are his works. The creeds and doctrines, the opinions and
          principles of the successive ages, are his thoughts. The state of
          society at different times are his manners. He grows in knowledge, in
          self-control, in visible size, just as we do. And his education is in
          the same way and for the same reason precisely similar to ours.
        </p>
        <p>
          All this is no figure but only a compendious statement of a very
          comprehensive fact. The child that is born to-day may possibly have
          the same faculties as if he had been born in the days of Noah; if it
          be otherwise, we possess no means of determining the difference. But
          the equality of the natural faculties at starting will not prevent a
          vast difference in their ultimate development. That development is
          entirely under the control of the influences exerted by the society in
          which the child may chance to live. If such society be altogether
          denied, the faculties perish, and the child (as remarked above) grows
          up a beast and not a man; if the society be uneducated and coarse, the
          growth of the faculties is early so stunted as never afterwards to be
          capable of recovery; if the society be highly cultivated, the child
          will be cultivated also, and will show, more or less, through life the
          fruits of that cultivation. Hence each generation receives the benefit
          of the cultivation of that which preceded it. Not in knowledge only
          but in develop. meat of powers the child of twelve now stands at the
          level where once stood the child of fourteen, where ages ago stood the
          full-grown man. The discipline of manners, of temper, of thought, of
          feeling, is transmitted from generation to generation, and at each
          transmission there is an imperceptible but unfailing increase. The
          perpetual accumulation of the stores of knowledge is so much more
          visible than the change in the other ingredients of human progress,
          that we are apt to fancy that knowledge grows, and knowledge only. I
          shall not stop to examine whether it be true (as is sometimes
          maintained) that all progress in human society is but the effect of
          the progress of knowledge. For the present, it is enough to point out
          that knowledge is not the only possession of the human spirit in which
          progress can be traced.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may, then, rightly speak of a childhood, a youth, and a manhood of
          the world. The men of the earliest ages were, in many respects, still
          children as compared with ourselves, with all the blessings and with
          all the disadvantages that belong to childhood. We reap the fruits of
          their toil, and bear in our characters the impress of their
          cultivation. Our characters have grown out of their history, as the
          character of the man grows out of the history of the child. There are
          matters in which the simplicity of childhood is wiser than the
          maturity of manhood, and in these they were wiser than we. There are
          matters in which the child is nothing, and the man everything, and in
          these we are the gainers. And the process by which we have either lost
          or gained corresponds, stage by stage, with the process by which the
          infant is trained for youth, and the youth for manhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          This training has three stages. In childhood we are subject to
          positive rules which we cannot understand, but are bound implicitly to
          obey. In youth we are subject to the influence of example, and soon
          break loose from all rules unless illustrated and enforced by the
          higher teaching which example imparts. In manhood we are comparatively
          free from external restraints, and if we are to learn, must be our own
          instructors. First come Rules, then Examples, then Principles. First
          comes the Law, then the Son of Man, then the Gift of the Spirit. The
          world was once a child under tutors and governors until the time
          appointed by the Father. Then, when the fit season had arrived, the
          Example to which all ages should turn was sent to teach men what they
          ought to be. Then the human race was left to itself to be guided by
          the teaching of the Spirit within.
        </p>
        <p>
          The education of the world, like that of the child, begins with Law.
          It is impossible to explain the reasons of all the commands that you
          give to a child, and you do not endeavour to do so. When he is to go
          to bed, when he is to get up, how he is to sit, stand, eat, drink,
          what answers he is to make when spoken to, what he may touch and what
          he may not, what prayers he shall say and when, what lessons he is to
          learn, every detail of manners and of conduct the careful mother
          teaches her child, and requires implicit obedience. Mingled together
          in her teaching are commands of the most trivial character and
          commands of the gravest importance; their relative value marked by a
          difference of manner rather than by anything else, since to explain it
          is impossible. Meanwhile to the child obedience is the highest duty,
          affection the highest stimulus, the mother's word the highest
          sanction. The conscience is alive, but it is, like the other faculties
          at that age, irregular, undeveloped, easily deceived. The mother does
          not leave it uncultivated, nor refuse sometimes to explain her motives
          for commanding or forbidding; but she never thinks of putting the
          judgment of the child against her own, nor of considering the child's
          conscience a, having a right to free action.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the child grows older the education changes its character, not so
          much in regard to the sanction of its precepts as in regard to their
          tenor. More stress is laid upon matters of real duty, less upon
          matters of mere manner. Falsehood, quarrelling, bad temper,
          greediness, indolence, are more attended to than times of going to
          bed, or fashions of eating, or postures in sitting. The boy is allowed
          to feel, and to show that he feels, the difference between different
          commands. But he is still not left to himself: and though points of
          manner are not put on a level with points of conduct, they are by no
          means neglected. Moreover, while much stress is laid upon his deeds,
          little is laid upon his opinions; he is rightly supposed not to have
          any, and will not be allowed to plead them as a reason for
          disobedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a time, however, the intellect begins to assert a right to enter
          into all questions of duty, and the . intellect accordingly is
          cultivated. The reason is appealed to in all questions of conduct: the
          consequences of folly or sin are pointed out, and the punishment
          which, without any miracle, God invariably brings upon those who
          disobey His natural laws -- how, for instance, falsehood destroys
          confidence and incurs contempt; how indulgence in appetite tends to
          brutal and degrading habits; how ill-temper may end in crime, and must
          end in mischief. Thus the conscience is reached through the
          understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, precisely analogous to all this is the history of the education
          of the early world. The earliest commands almost entirely refer to
          bodily appetites animal passions. The earliest wide-spread sin was
          brutal violence. That wilfulness of temper, -- those germs of wanton
          cruelty, which the mother corrects so easily in her infant, were
          developed in the earliest form of human society into a prevailing
          plague of wickedness. The few notices which are given of that state of
          mankind do not present a picture of mere lawlessness, such as we find
          among the medieval nations of Europe, but of blind, gross ignorance of
          themselves and all around them. Atheism is possible now, but Lamech's
          presumptuous comparison of himself with God is impossible, and the
          thought of building a tower high enough to escape God's wrath could
          enter no man's dreams. We sometimes see in very little children a
          violence of temper which seems hardly human: add to such a temper the
          strength of a full-grown man, and we shall perhaps understand what is
          meant by the expression, that the earth was filled with violence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Violence was followed by sensuality. Such was the sin of Noah, Ham,
          Sodom, Lot's daughters, and the guilty Canaanites. Animal appetites --
          the appetites which must he subdued in childhood if they are to be
          subdued at all -- were still the temptation of mankind. Such sins are,
          it is true, prevalent in the world even now. But the peculiarity of
          these early forms of licentiousness is their utter disregard of every
          kind of restraint, and this constitutes their childish character.
        </p>
        <p>
          The education of this early race may strictly be said to begin when it
          was formed into the various masses out of which the nations of the
          earth have sprang. The world, as it were, went to school, and was
          broken up into classes. Before that time it can hardly be said that
          any great precepts had been given. The only commands which claim an
          earlier date are the prohibitions of murder and of eating blood. And
          these may be considered as given to all alike. But the whole lesson of
          humanity was too much to be learned by all at once. Different parts of
          it fell to the task of different parts of the human race, and for a
          long time, though the education of the world flowed in parallel
          channels, it did not form a single stream.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Jewish nation, selected among all as the depository of what may be
          termed, in a pre-eminent sense, religious truth, received, after a
          short preparation, the Mosaic system. This system is a mixture of
          moral and positive commands: the latter, precise and particular,
          ruling the customs, the festivals, the worship, the daily food, the
          dress, the very touch; the former large, clear, simple, peremptory.
          There is very little directly spiritual. No freedom of conduct or of
          opinion is allowed. The difference between different precepts is not
          forgotten; nor is all natural judgment in morals excluded. But the
          reason for all the minute commands is never given. Why they may eat
          the sheep and not the pig they are not told. The commands are not
          confined to general principles, but run into such details as to forbid
          tattooing or disfiguring the person, to command the wearing of a blue
          fringe, and the like. That such commands should be sanctioned by
          divine authority is utterly irreconcileable with our present feelings.
          But in the Mosaic system the same peremptory legislation deals with
          all these matters, whether important or trivial. The fact is, that
          however trivial they might be in relation to the authority which they
          invoked, they were not trivial in relation to the people who were to
          be governed and taught.
        </p>
        <p>
          The teaching of the Law was followed by the comments of the Prophets.
          It is impossible to mistake the complete change of tone and spirit.
          The ordinances indeed remain, and the obligation to observe them is
          always assumed. But they have sunk to the second place. The national
          attention is distinctly fixed on the higher precepts. Disregard of the
          ordinances is, in fact, rarely noticed, in comparison with breaches of
          the great human laws of love and brotherly kindness, of truth and
          justice. There are but two sins against the ceremonial law which
          receive marked attention -- idolatry and sabbath-breaking; and these
          do not occupy a third of the space devoted to the denunciation of
          cruelty and oppression, of maladministration of justice, of impurity
          and intemperance. Nor is the change confined to the precepts enforced:
          it extends to the sanction which enforces them. Throughout the
          Prophets there is an evident reference to the decision of individual
          conscience, which can rarely be found in the Books of Moses.
          Sometimes, as in Ezekiel's comment on the Second Commandment, a
          distinct appeal is made from the letter of the law to the voice of
          natural equity. Sometimes, as in the opening of Isaiah, the ceremonial
          sacrifices are condemned for the sins of those who offered them. Or,
          again, fasting is spiritualized into self-denial. And the tone taken
          in this teaching is such as to imply a previous breach, not so much of
          positive commands, as of natural morality. It is assumed that the
          hearer will find within himself a sufficient sanction for the
          precepts. It is no longer, as in the law, I am the Lord:' but, Hath
          not he showed thee, O man, what is good?' And hence the style becomes
          argumentative instead of peremptory, and the teacher pleads instead of
          dogmatizing. In the meanwhile, however, no hint is ever given of a
          permission to dispense with the ordinances even in the least degree.
          The child is old enough to understand, but not old enough to be left
          to himself. He is not yet a man. He must still conform to the rules of
          his father's house, whether or not those rules suit his temper or
          approve themselves to his judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The comments of the Prophets were followed in their turn by the great
          Lesson of the Captivity. Then for the first time the Jews learned,
          what that Law and the Prophets had been for centuries vainly
          endeavouring to teach them, namely, to abandon for ever polytheism and
          idolatry. But though this change in their national habits and
          character is unmistakeable, it might seem at first sight as if it were
          no more than an external and superficial amendment, and that their
          growth in moral and spiritual clearness, though traceable with
          certainty up to this date, at any rate received a check afterwards.
          For it is undeniable that, in the time of our Lord, the Sadducees had
          lost all depth of spiritual feeling, while the Pharisees had succeeded
          in converting the Mosaic system into so mischievous an idolatry of
          forms, that St Paul does not hesitate to call the law the strength of
          sin. But in spite of this it is nevertheless clear that even the
          Pharisaic teaching contained elements of a more spiritual religion
          than the original Mosaic system. Thus, for instance, the importance
          attached by the Pharisees to prayer is not be found in the law. The
          worship under the law consisted almost entirely of sacrifices. With
          the sacrifices we may presume that prayer was always offered, but it
          was not positively commanded; and, as a regular and necessary part of
          worship, it first appears in the later books of the Old Testament, and
          is never even there so earnestly insisted upon as afterwards by the
          Pharisees. It was in fact in the captivity, far from the temple and
          the sacrifices of the temple, that the Jewish people first learned
          that the spiritual part of worship could be separated from the
          ceremonial, and that of the two the spiritual was far the higher. The
          first introduction of preaching and the reading of the Bible in the
          synagogues belong to the same date. The careful study of the law,
          though it degenerated into formality, was yet in itself a more
          intellectual service than the earlier records exhibit. And this study
          also, though commencing earlier, attains its maximum after the
          captivity; the Psalmists who delight in the study of the law are all,
          or nearly all, much later than David; and the enthusiasm with which
          the study is praised increases as we come down. In short, the Jewish
          nation had lost very much when John the Baptist came to prepare the
          way for his Master; but time had not stood still, nor had that course
          of education whereby the Jew was to be fitted to give the last
          revelation to the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The results of this discipline of the Jewish nation may be summed up
          in two points -- a settled national belief in the unity and
          spirituality of God, and an acknowledgment of the paramount importance
          of chastity as a point of morals.
        </p>
        <p>
          The conviction of the unity and spirituality of God was peculiar to
          the Jews among the pioneers of civilization. Greek philosophers had,
          no doubt, come to the same conclusion by dint of reason. Noble minds
          may often have been enabled to raise themselves to the same height in
          moments of generous emotion. But every one knows the difference
          between an opinion and a practical conviction -- between a scientific
          deduction or a momentary insight and that habit which has become
          second nature. Every one, also, knows the difference between a tenet
          maintained by a few intellectual men far in advance of their age, and
          a belief pervading a whole people, penetrating all their daily life,
          leavening all their occupations, incorporated into their very
          language. To the great mass of the Gentiles, at the time of our Lord,
          polytheism was the natural posture of the thoughts into which their
          minds unconsciously settled when undisturbed by doubt or difficulties.
          To every Jew, without exception, monotheism was equally natural. To
          the Gentile, even when converted, it was, for some time, still an
          effort to abstain from idols; to the Jew it was more an effort than it
          is to us. The bent of the Jewish mind was, in fact, so fixed by their
          previous training that it would have required a perpetual and
          difficult strain to enable a Jew to join in such folly. We do not
          readily realize how hard this was to acquire, because we have never
          had to acquire it and in reading the Old Testament we look on the
          repeated idolatries of the chosen people as wilful backsliding, from
          an elementary truth within the reach of children, rather than as
          stumblings in learning a very difficult lesson -- difficult even for
          cultivated men. In reality, elementary truths are the hardest of all
          to learn, unless we pass our childhood in an atmosphere thoroughly
          impregnated with them; and then we imbibe them unconsciously, and find
          it difficult to perceive their difficulty.

          It was the fact that this belief seas not the tenet of the few, but
          the habit of the nation, which made the Jews the proper instruments
          for communicating the doctrine to the world. They supported it, not by
          arguments, which always provoke replies, and rarely, at the best,
          penetrate deeper than the intellect; but by the unconscious evidence
          of their lives. They supplied that spiritual atmosphere in which alone
          the faith of new converts could attain to vigorous life. They supplied
          forms of language and expression fit for immediate and constant use.
          They supplied devotions to fill the void which departed idolatry left
          behind. The rapid spread of the Primitive Church, and the depth to
          which it struck its roots into the decaying society of the Roman
          empire, are unquestionably due, to a great extent, to the body of
          Jewish proselytes already established in every important city, and to
          the existence of the Old Testament as ready-made text-book of devotion
          and instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Side by side with this freedom from idolatry there had grown up in the
          Jewish mind a chaster morality than was to be found elsewhere in the
          world. There were many points, undoubtedly, in which the early
          morality of the Greeks and Romans would well bear a comparison with
          that of the Hebrews. In simplicity of life in gentleness of character,
          in warmth of sympathy, in kindness to the poor, in justice to all men,
          the Hebrews could not have rivalled the best days of Greece. In
          reverence for law, in reality of obedience, in calmness under trouble,
          in dignity of self-respect, they could not have rivalled the best days
          of Rome. But the sins of the flesh corrupted both these races, and the
          flower of their finest virtues had withered before the time of our
          Lord. In chastity the Hebrews stood alone; and this virtue, which had
          grown up with them from their earliest days, was still in the vigour
          of fresh life when they were commissioned to give the Gospel to the
          nations. The Hebrew morality has passed into the Christian church, and
          sins of impurity (which war against the soul) have ever since been
          looked on as the type of all evil; and our Litany selects them as the
          example of deadly sin. What sort of morality the Gentiles would have
          handed down to us, had they been left to themselves, is clear from the
          Epistles. The excesses of the Gentile party at Corinth (1 Cor. v.2),
          the first warning given to the Thessalonians (1 Thes. iv.3), the first
          warning given to the Galatians (Gal. v.19), the description of the
          Gentile world in the Epistle to the Romans, are sufficient indications
          of the prevailing Gentile sin. But St. James, writing to the Hebrew
          Christians, says not a word upon the subject, and St. Peter barely
          alludes to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea of monotheism and the principle of purity might seem hardly
          enough to be the chief results of so systematic a discipline as that
          of the Hebrews. But, in reality, they are the cardinal points in
          education. The idea of monotheism outtops all other ideas in dignity,
          and worth. The spirituality of God involves in it the supremacy of
          conscience, the immortality of the soul, the final judgment of the
          human race. For we know the other world, and can only know it, by
          analogy, drawn from our own experience. With what, then, shall we
          compare God? With the spiritual or the fleshly part of our nature? On
          the answer depends the whole bent of our religion and of our morality.
          For that in ourselves which we choose as the nearest analogy of God,
          will, of course be looked on as the ruling and lasting part of our
          being. If He be one and spiritual, then the spiritual power within us,
          which proclaims its own unity and independence of matter by the
          universality of its decrees, must be the rightful monarch of our
          lives; but if there be Gods many and Lords many, with bodily appetites
          and animal passions, then the voice of conscience is but one of those
          wide-spread delusions which, some for a longer, some for a shorter
          period, have, before now, misled our race. Again, the same importance
          which we assign to monotheism as a creed, we must assign to chastity
          as a virtue. Among all the vices which it is necessary to subdue in
          order to build up the human character, there is none to be compared in
          strength, or in virulence, with that of impurity. It can outlive and
          kill a thousand virtues; it can corrupt the most generous heart; it
          can madden the soberest intellect; it can debase the loftiest
          imagination. But, besides being so poisonous in character, it is above
          all others most difficult to conquer. And the people whose
          extraordinary toughness of nature has enabled it to outlive Egyptian
          Pharaohs, and Assyrian kings, and Roman Caesars, and Mussulman
          caliphs, was well matched against a power of evil which has battled
          with the human spirit ever since the creation, and has inflicted, and
          may yet inflict, more deadly blows than any other power we know of.

          Such was the training of the Hebrews. Other nations meanwhile had a
          training parallel to and contemporaneous with theirs. The natural
          religions, shadows projected by the spiritual light within shining on
          the dark problems without, were all in reality systems of Law, given
          also by God, though not given by revelation but by the working of
          nature, and consequently so distorted and adulterated that in lapse of
          time the divine element in them had almost perished. The poetical gods
          of Greece, the legendary gods of Rome, the animal worship of Egypt,
          the sun worship of the East, all accompanied by systems of law and
          civil government springing from the same sources as themselves,
          namely, the character and temper of the several nations, were the
          means of educating these people to similar purposes in the economy of
          Providence to that for which the Hebrews were destined.

          When the seed of the Gospel was first sown, the field which had been
          prepared to receive it may be divided into four chief divisions, Rome,
          Greece, Asia, and Judea. Each of these contributed something to the
          growth of the future Church. And the growth of the Church is, in this
          case, the development of the human race. It cannot indeed yet be said
          that all humanity has united into one stream; but the Christian
          nations have so unquestionably taken the lead amongst their fellows,
          that although it is likely enough the unconverted peoples may have a
          real part to play, that part must be plainly quite subordinate;
          subordinate in a sense in which neither Rome, nor Greece, nor perhaps
          even Asia, was subordinate to Judea.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not difficult to trace the chief elements of civilization which
          we owe to each of the four. Rome contributed her admirable spirit of
          order and organization. To her had been given the genius of govern.
          runt. She had been trained to it by centuries of difficult and
          tumultuous history. Storms which would have rent asunder the framework
          of any other polity only practised her in the art of controlling
          popular passions; and when she began to aim consciously at the Empire
          of the World, she had already learned her lesson. She had learned it
          as the Hebrews had learned theirs, by an enforced obedience to her own
          system. In no nation of antiquity had civil officers the same
          unquestioned authority during their term of office, or laws and
          judicial rules the same reverence. That which religion was to the Jew,
          including even the formalism which encrusted and fettered it, law was
          to the Roman. And law was the lesson which Rome was intended to teach
          the world. Hence the Bishop of Rome soon became the Head of the
          Church. Rome was, in fact, the centre of the traditions which had once
          governed the world; and their spirit still remained; and the Roman
          Church developed into the papacy simply because a head was wanted, and
          no better one could be found. Hence again in all the doctrinal
          disputes of the fourth and fifth centuries the decisive voice came
          from Rome. Every controversy was finally settled by her opinion,
          because she alone possessed the art of framing formulas which could
          hold together in any reasonable measure the endless variety of
          sentiments and feelings which the Church by that time comprised. It
          was this power of administering law which enabled the Western Church,
          in the time of Charlemagne, to undertake, by means of her bishops, the
          task of training and civilizing the new population of Europe. To Rome
          we owe the forms of local government which in England have saved
          liberty and elsewhere have mitigated despotism. Justinian's laws have
          penetrated into all modern legislation, and almost all improvements
          bring us only nearer to his code. Much of the spirit of modern
          politics came from Greece; much from the woods of Germany. But the
          skeleton and framework is almost entirely Roman. And it is not this
          framework only that comes from Rome. The moral sentiments and the
          moral force which lie at the back of all political life and are
          absolutely indispensable to its vigour are in great measure Roman too.
          It is true that the life and power of all morality whatever will
          always be drawn from the New Testament; yet it is in the history of
          Rome rather than in the Bible that we find our models and precepts of
          political duty, and especially of the duty of patriotism. St. Paul
          bids us follow whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of
          good report. But except through such general appeals to natural
          feeling it would be difficult to prove from the New Testament that
          cowardice was not only disgraceful but sinful, and that love of our
          country was an exalted duty of humanity That lesson our consciences
          have learnt from the teaching of Ancient Rome.

          To Greece was entrusted the cultivation of the reason and the taste.
          Her gift to mankind has been science and art. There was little in her
          temper of the spirit of reverence. Her morality and her religion did
          not spring from the conscience. Her gods were the creatures of
          imagination, not of spiritual need. Her highest idea was, not
          holiness, as with the Hebrews, nor law, as with the Romans, but
          beauty. Even Aristotle, who assuredly gave way to mere sentiment as
          little as any Greek that ever lived, placed the Beautiful (to kalon)
          at the head of his moral system, not the Right, nor the Holy. Greece,
          in fact, was not looking at another world, nor even striving to
          organize the present, but rather aiming at the development of free
          nature. The highest possible cultivation of the individual, the most
          finished perfection of the natural faculties, was her dream. It is
          true that her philosophers are ever talking of subordinating the
          individual to the state. But in reality there never has been a period
          in history nor a country in the world, in which the peculiarities of
          individual temper and character had freer play. This is not the best
          atmosphere for political action; but it is better than any other for
          giving vigour and life to the impulses of genius, and for cultivating
          those faculties, the reason and taste, in which the highest genius can
          be shown. Such a cultivation needs discipline less than any. And of
          all the nations Greece had the least of systematic discipline, least
          of instinctive deference to any one leading idea. But for the same
          reason the cultivation required less time than any other; and the
          national life of Greece is the shortest of all. Greek history hardly
          begins before Solon, and it hardly continues after Alexander, barely
          covering 200 years. But its fruits are eternal. To the Greeks we owe
          the logic which has ruled the minds of all thinkers since. All our
          natural and physical science really begins with the Greeks, and indeed
          would have been impossible had not Greece taught men how to reason. To
          the Greeks we owe the corrective which conscience needs to borrow from
          nature. Conscience, startled at the awful truths which she has to
          reveal, too often threatens to withdraw the soul into gloomy and
          perverse asceticism: then is needed the beauty which Greece taught us
          to admire, to show us another aspect of the Divine Attributes. To the
          Greeks we owe. all modern literature. For though there is other
          literature even older than the Greek, the Asiatic for instance, and
          the Hebrew, yet we did not learn this lesson from them; they had not
          the genial life which was needed to kindle other nations with the
          communication of their own fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          The discipline of Asia was the never-ending succession of conquering
          dynasties, following in each other's track like waves, an ever moving
          yet never advancing ocean. Cycles of change were successively passing
          over her, and yet at the end of every cycle she stood where she had
          stood before, and nearly where she stands now. The growth of Europe
          has dwarfed her in comparison, and she is paralysed in presence of a
          gigantic strength younger but mightier than her own. But in herself
          she is no weaker than she ever was. The monarchs who once led
          Assyrian, or Babylonian, or Persian armies across half the world,
          impose on us by the vast extent and rapidity of their conquests; but
          these conquests had in reality no substance, no inherent strength.
          This perpetual baffling of all earthly progress taught Asia to seek
          her inspiration in rest. She learned to fix her thoughts upon another
          world, and was disciplined to check by her silent protest the
          over-earthly, over-practical tendency of the Western nations. She was
          ever the one to refuse to measure Heaven by the standard of earth. Her
          teeming imagination filled the church with thoughts undreamt of in our
          philosophy.' She had been the instrument selected to teach the Hebrews
          the doctrine of the Immortality of the Soul; for whatever may be said
          of the early notions on this subject, it is unquestionable that in
          Babylon the Jews first attained the clearness and certainty in regard
          to it which we find in the teaching of the Pharisees. So again,
          Athanasius, a thorough Asiatic in sentiment and in mode of arguing,
          was the bulwark of the doctrine of the Trinity. The Western nations
          are always tempted to make reason not only supreme, but despotic, and
          dislike to acknowledge mysteries even in religion. They are inclined
          to confine all doctrines within the limits of spiritual utility, and
          to refuse to listen to dim voices and whispers from within, those
          instincts of doubt, and reverence, and awe, which yet are, in their
          place and degree, messages from the depths of our being. Asia supplies
          the corrective by perpetually leaning to the mysterious. When left to
          herself, she settles down to baseless dreams, and sometimes to
          monstrous and revolting fictions. But her influence has never ceased
          to be felt, and could not be lost without serious damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the Hebrews may be said to have disciplined the human conscience,
          Rome the human will, Greece the reason and taste, Asia the spiritual
          imagination. Other races that have been since admitted into
          Christendom also did. their parts. And others may yet have something
          to contribute; for though the time for discipline is childhood, yet
          there is no precise line beyond which all discipline ceases. Even the
          grey-haired man has yet some small capacity for learning like a child;
          and even in the maturity of the world the early modes of teaching may
          yet find a place. But the childhood of the world was over when our
          Lord appeared on earth. The tutors and governors had done their work.
          It was time that the second teacher of the human race should begin his
          labour. The second teacher is Example.
        </p>
        <p>
          The child is not insensible to the influence of example. Even in the
          earliest years the manners, the language, the principles of the elder
          begin to mould the character of the younger. There are not a few of
          our acquirements which we learn by example without any, or with very
          little, direct instruction -- as, for instance, to speak and to walk.
          But still example at that age is secondary. The child is quite
          conscious that he is not on such an equality with grown-up friends as
          to enable him to do as they do. He imitates, but he knows that it is
          merely play, and he is quite willing to be told that he must not do
          this or that till he is older. As time goes on, and the faculties
          expand, the power of discipline to guide the actions and to mould the
          character decreases, and in the same proportion the power of example
          grows. The moral atmosphere must be brutish indeed which can do deep
          harm to a child of four years. But what is harmless at four is
          pernicious at six, and almost fatal at twelve. The religious tone of a
          household will hardly make much impression on an infant; but it will
          deeply engrave its lessons on the heart of a boy growing towards
          manhood. Different faculties within us begin to feel the power of this
          new guide at different times. The moral sentiments are perhaps the
          first to expand to the influence; but gradually the example of those
          among whom the life is cast lays hold of all the soul, -- of the
          tastes, of the opinions, of the aims, of the temper. As each restraint
          of discipline is successively cast off, the soul does not gain at
          first a real, but only an apparent freedom. The youth, when too old
          for discipline, is not yet strong enough to guide his life by fixed
          principles. He is led by his emotions and impulses. He admires and
          loves, he condemns and dislikes, with enthusiasm. And his love and
          admiration, his disapproval and dislike, are not his own, but borrowed
          from his society. He can appreciate a character, though he cannot yet
          appreciate a principle. He cannot walk by reason and conscience alone;
          he still needs those supplies to the imperfection of our nature' which
          are given by the higher passions. He cannot follow what his heart does
          not love as well as his reason approve; and he cannot love what is
          presented to him as an abstract rule of life, but requires a living
          person. He needs to see virtue in the concrete, before he can
          recognise her aspect as a divine idea. He instinctively copies those
          whom he admires, and in doing so imbibes whatever gives the colour to
          their character. He repeats opinions without really understanding
          them, and in that way admits their infection into his judgment. He
          acquires habits which seem of no consequence, but which are the
          channels of a thousand new impulses to his soul. If he reads, be
          treats the characters that he meets with in his book as friends or
          enemies, and so unconsciously allows them to mould his soul. When he
          seems most independent, most defiant of external guidance, he is in
          reality only so much the less master of himself, only so much the more
          guided and formed, not indeed by the will, but by the example and
          sympathy of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          The power of example probably never ceases during life. Even old age
          is not wholly uninfluenced by society; and a change of companions acts
          upon the character long after the character would appear incapable of
          further development. The influence, in fact, dies out just as it grew;
          and as it is impossible to mark its beginning, so is it to mark its
          end. The child is governed by the will of its parents; the man by
          principles and habits of his own. But neither is insensible to the
          influence of associates, though neither finds in that influence the
          predominant power of his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, then, which is born with our birth and dies with our death,
          attains its maximum at some point in the passage from one to the
          other. And this point is just the meeting point of the child and the
          man, the brief interval which separates restraint from liberty. Young
          men at this period are learning a peculiar lesson. They seem to those
          who talk to them to be imbibing from their associates and their
          studies principles both of faith and conduct. But the rapid
          fluctuations of their minds show that their opinions have not really
          the nature of principles. They are really learning, not principles,
          but the materials out of which principles are made. They drink in the
          lessons of generous impulse, warm unselfishness, courage,
          self-devotion, romantic disregard of worldly calculations, without
          knowing what are the grounds of their own approbation, or caring to
          analyse the laws and ascertain the limits of such guides of conduct.
          They believe, without exact attention to the evidence of their belief;
          and their opinions have accordingly the richness and warmth that
          belongs to sentiment, but not the clearness or firmness that can be
          given by reason. These affections, which are now kindled in their
          hearts by the contact of their fellows, will afterwards be the
          reservoir of life and light, with which their faith and their highest
          conceptions will be animated and coloured. The opinions now picked up,
          apparently not really, at random, must hereafter give reality to the
          clearer and more settled convictions of mature manhood. If it were not
          for these, the ideas and laws afterwards supplied by reason would be
          empty forms of thought, without body or substance; the faith would run
          a risk of being the form of godliness without the power thereof. And
          hence the lessons of this time have such an attractiveness in their
          warmth and life, that they are very reluctantly exchanged for the
          truer and profounder, but at first sight colder wisdom which is
          destined to follow them. To almost all men tins period is a bright
          spot to which the memory ever afterwards loves to recur; and even
          those who can remember nothing but folly -- folly too which they have
          repented and relinquished -- yet find a nameless charm in recalling
          such folly as that. For indeed even folly itself at this age is
          sometimes the cup out of which men quaff the richest blessings of our
          nature -- simplicity, generosity, affection. This is the seed time of
          the soul's harvest, and contains the promise of the year. It is the
          time for love and marriage, the time for forming lifelong friendships.
          The after life may be more contented, but can rarely be so glad and
          joyous. Two things we need to crown its blessings -- one is, that the
          friends whom we then learn to love, and the opinions which we then
          learn to cherish, may stand the test of time, and deserve the esteem
          and approval of calmer thoughts and wider experience; the other, that
          our hearts may have depth enough to drink largely of that which God is
          holding to our lips, and never again to lose the fire and spirit of
          the draught. There is nothing more beautiful than a manhood surrounded
          by the friends, upholding the principles, and filled with the energy
          of the spring. time of life. But even if these highest blessings be
          denied, if we have been compelled to change opinions, and to give up
          friends, and the cold experience of the world has extinguished the
          heat of youth, still the heart will instinctively recur to that happy
          time, to explain to itself what is meant by love and what by
          happiness.

          Of course, this is only one side of the picture. This keen
          susceptibility to pleasure and joy implies a keen susceptibility to
          pain. There is, probably, no time of life at which pains are more
          intensely felt; no time at which the whole man more groaneth and
          travaileth in pain together.' Young men are prone to extreme
          melancholy, even to disgust with life. A young preacher will preach
          upon afflictions much more often than an old one. A young poet will
          write more sadly. A young philosopher will moralize more gloomily. And
          this seems unreal sentiment, and is smiled at in after years. But it
          is real at the time; and, perhaps, is nearer the truth at all times
          than the contentedness of those who ridicule it. Youth, in fact, feels
          everything more keenly; and as far as the keenness of feeling
          contributes to its truth, the feeling, whether it is pain or pleasure,
          is so much the truer. But in after life it is the happiness, not the
          suffering of youth, that most often returns to the memory, and seems
          to gild all the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          The period of youth in the history of the world, when the human race
          was, as it were, put under the teaching of example, corresponds, of
          course, to the meeting point of the Law and the Gospel. The second
          stage, therefore, in the education of man was the presence of our Lord
          upon earth. Those few years of His divine presence seem, as it were,
          to balance all the systems and creeds and worships which preceded, all
          the Church's life which has followed since. Saints had gone before,
          and saints have been given since; great men and good men had lived
          among the heathen; there were never, at any time, examples wanting to
          teach either the chosen people or any other. But the one Example of
          all examples came in the fulness of time,' just when the world was
          fitted to feel the power of His presence. Had His revelation been
          delayed till now, assuredly it would have been hard for us to
          recognise His Divinity; for the faculty of Faith has turned inwards,
          and cannot now accept any outer manifestations of the truth of God.
          Our vision of the Son of God is now aided by the eyes of the Apostles,
          and by that aid we can recognise the Express Image of the Father. But
          in this we are like men who are led through unknown woods by Indian
          guides. We recognise the indications by which the path was known, as
          soon as those indications are pointed out; but we feel that it would
          have been quite vain for us to look for them unaided. We, of course,
          have, in our turn, counterbalancing advantages. If we have lost that
          freshness of faith which would be the first to say to a poor carpenter
          -- Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God -- yet we possess,
          in the greater cultivation of our religious understanding, that which,
          perhaps, we ought not to be willing to give in exchange. The early
          Christians could recognise, more readily than we, the greatness and
          beauty of the Example set before them; but it is not too much to say,
          that we know better than they the precise outlines of the truth. To
          every age is given by God its own proper gift. They had not the same
          clearness of understanding as we; the same recognition that it is God
          and not the devil who rules the world; the same power of
          discrimination between different kinds of truth; they had not the same
          calmness, or fixedness of conduct; their faith was not so quiet, so
          little tempted to restless vehemence. But they had a keenness of
          perception which we have not, and could see the immeasurable
          difference between our Lord and all other men as we could never have
          men it. Had our Lord come later, He would have come to mankind already
          beginning to stiffen into the fixedness of maturity. The power of His
          life would not have sunk so deeply into the world's heart; the truth
          of His Divine Nature would not have been recognised. Seeing the Lord,
          would not have been the title to Apostleship. On the other hand, had
          our Lord come earlier, the world would not have been ready to receive
          Him, and the Gospel, instead of being the religion of the human race,
          would have been the religion of the Hebrews only. The other systems
          would have been too strong to be overthrown by the power of preaching.
          The need of a higher and purer teaching would not have been felt.
          Christ would have seemed to the Gentiles the Jewish Messiah, not the
          Son of Man. But He came in the fulness of time,' for which all history
          had been preparing, to which all history since has been looking back.
          Hence the first and largest place in the New Testament is assigned to
          His Life four times told. This life we emphatically call the Gospel.
          If there is little herein to be technically called doctrine, yet here
          is the fountain of all inspiration. There is no Christian who would
          not rather part with all the rest of the Bible than with these four
          Books. There is no part of God's Word which the religious man more
          instinctively remembers. The Sermon on the Mount, the Parables and the
          Miracles, the Last Supper, the Mount of Olives, the Garden of
          Gethsemane, the Cross on Calvary -- these are the companions alike of
          infancy and of old age, simple enough to be read with awe and wonder
          by the one, profound enough to open new depths of wisdom to the
          fullest experience of the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord was the Example of mankind, and there can be no other example
          in the same sense. But the whole period from the closing of the Old
          Testament to the close of the New was the period of the world's youth
          -- the age of examples; and our Lord's presence was not the only
          influence of that kind which has acted upon the human race. Three
          companions were appointed by Providence to give their society to this
          creature whom God was educating; Greece, Rome, and the Early Church.
          To these three mankind has ever since looked back, and will ever
          hereafter look back, with the same affection, the same lingering
          regret, with which age looks back to early manhood. In these three
          mankind remembers the brilliant social companion whose wit and fancy
          sharpened the intellect and refined the imagination; the bold and
          clever leader with whom to dare was to do, and whose very name was a
          signal of success; and the earnest, heavenly-minded friend, whose
          saintly aspect was a revelation in itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Greece and Rome have not only given to us the fruits of their
          discipline, but the companionship of their bloom. The fruits of their
          discipline would have passed into our possession, even if their memory
          bad utterly perished; and just as we know not the man who first
          discovered arithmetic, nor the man who first invented writing --
          benefactors with whom no other captains of science can ever be
          compared -- so, too, it is probable that we inherit from many a race,
          whose name we shall never hear again, fruits of long training now
          forgotten. But Greece and Rome have given us more than any results of
          discipline in the never-dying memory of their fresh and youthful life.
          It is this, and not only the greatness or the genius of the classical
          writers, which makes their literature preeminent above all others.
          There have been great poets, great historians, great philosophers in
          modern days. Greece can show few poets equal, none superior, to
          Shakspeare. Gibbon, in many respects, stands above all ancient
          historians. Bacon was as great a master of philosophy as Aristotle.
          Nor, again, are there wanting great writers of times older, as well as
          of times later, than the Greek, as, for instance, the Hebrew prophets.
          But the classics possess a charm quite independent of genius. It is
          not their genius only which makes them attractive. It is the classic
          life, the life of the people of that day. It is the image, there only
          to be seen, of our highest natural powers in their freshest vigour. It
          is the unattainable grace of the prime of manhood. It is the pervading
          sense of youthful beauty. Hence, while we have elsewhere great poems
          and great histories, we never find again that universal radiance of
          fresh life which makes even the most commonplace relics of classic
          days models for our highest art. The common workman of those times
          breathed the atmosphere of the gods. What are now the ornaments of our
          museums were then the every-day furniture of sitting and sleeping
          rooms. In the great monuments of their literature we can taste this
          pure inspiration most largely; but even the most commonplace fragments
          of a classic writer are steeped in the waters of the same fountain.
          Those who compare the moderns with the ancients, genius for genius,
          have no difficulty in claiming for the former equality, if not
          victory. But the issue is mistaken. To combine the highest powers of
          intellect with the freshness of youth was possible only once, and that
          is the glory of the classic nations. The inspiration which is drawn by
          the man from the memory of those whom he loved an admired in the
          spring-time of his life, is drawn by the world now from the study of
          Greece and Rome. The world goes back to its youth in hopes to become
          young again, and delights to dwell on the feats achieved by the
          companions of those days. Beneath whatever was wrong and foolish it
          recognises that beauty of a fresh nature which never ceases to
          delight. And the sins and vices of that joyous time are passed over
          with the levity with which men think of their young companions'
          follies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Early Church stands as the example which has most influenced our
          religious as Greece and Rome have most influenced our political and
          intellectual life. We read the New Testament, not to find there forms
          of devotion, for there are few to be found; nor laws of church
          government, for there are hardly any; nor creeds, for there are none;
          nor doctrines logically stated, for there is no attempt at logical
          precision. The New Testament is almost entirely occupied with two
          lives -- the life of our Lord and the' life of the Early Church. Among
          the Epistles there are but two which seem, even at first sight, to be
          treatises for the future instead of letters for the time -- the
          Epistle to the Romans and the Epistle to the Hebrews. But even these,
          when closely examined, appear, like the rest, to be no more than the
          fruit of the current history. That early church does not give us
          precepts, but an example. She says, Be ye followers of me, as I also
          am of Christ. This had never been said by Moses, nor by any of the
          prophets. But the world was now grown old enough to be taught by
          seeing the lives of saints, better than by hearing the words of
          prophets. When afterwards Christians needed creeds, and liturgies, and
          forms of church government and systems of theology, they could not
          find them in the New Testament. They found there only the materials
          out of which such needs could be supplied. But the combination and
          selection of those materials they had to provide for themselves. In
          fact, the work which the early church had to do was peculiar. Her
          circumstances were still more peculiar. Had she legislated
          peremptorily for posterity, her legislation must have been set aside,
          as, indeed, the prohibition to eat things strangled and to eat blood
          has been already set aside. But her example will live and teach for
          ever. In her we learn what is meant by zeal, what by love of God, what
          by joy in the Holy Ghost, what by endurance for the sake of Christ.
          For the very purpose of giving us a pattern, the chief features in her
          character are, as it were, magnified into colossal proportions. Our
          saints must chiefly be the saints of domestic life, the brightness of
          whose light is visible to very few. But their saintliness was forced
          into publicity, and its radiance illumines the earth. So on every page
          of the New Testament is written, Go and do thou likewise. Transplant
          into your modern life the same heavenly-mindedness, the same fervour
          of love, the same unshaken faith, the same devotion to your
          fellow-men. And to these pages accordingly the church of our day turns
          for renewal of inspiration. We even busy ourselves in tracing the
          details of the early Christian life, and we love to find that any
          practice of ours comes down horn apostolic times. This is an
          exaggeration. It is not really following the early church, to be
          servile copyists of her practices. We are not commanded to have all
          things in common, because the church of Jerusalem once had; nor are we
          to make every supper a sacrament, because the early Christians did so.
          To copy the early church is to do as she did, not what she did. Yet
          the very exaggeration is a testimony of the power which that church
          has over us. We would fain imitate even her outward actions as a step
          towards imitating her inner life. Her outward actions were not meant
          for our model. She, too, had her faults: disorders, violent quarrels,
          licentious recklessness of opinion, in regard both to faith and
          practice. But these spots altogether disappear in the blaze of light
          which streams upon us when we look back towards her. Nay, we are
          impatient of being reminded that she had faults at all. So much does
          her youthful holiness surpass all that we can show, that he who can
          see her faults seems necessarily insensible to the brightness of her
          glory. There have been great saints since the days of the apostles.
          Holiness is as possible now as it was then. But the saintliness of
          that time had a peculiar beauty which we cannot copy; a beauty not
          confined to the apostles or great leaders, but pervading the whole
          church. It is not what they endured, nor the virtues which they
          practised, that so dazzle us. It is the perfect simplicity of the
          religious life, the singleness of heart, the openness, the child-like
          earnestness. All else has been repeated since; but this never. And
          this makes the religious man's heart turn back with longing to that
          blessed time when the Lord's service was the highest of all delights,
          and every act of worship came fresh from the soul. If we compare
          degrees of devotion, it may be reckoned something intrinsically
          nobler, to serve God and love Him now when religion is colder than it
          was, and when we have not the aid of those thrilling, heart-stirring
          sympathies which blessed the early church. But even if our devotion be
          sometimes nobler in itself, yet theirs still remains the more
          beautiful, the more attractive. Ours may have its own place in the
          sight of God, but theirs remains the irresistible example which
          kindles all other hearts by its fire.

          It is nothing against the drift of this argument, that the three
          friends whose companionship is most deeply engraven on the memory of
          the world were no friends one to another. This was the lot of mankind,
          as it is the lot of not a few men. Greece, the child of nature, had
          come to full maturity so early as to pass away before the other two
          appeared; and Rome and the Early Church disliked each other. Yet that
          dislike makes little impression on us now. We never identify the Rome
          of our admiration with the Rome which persecuted the Christian,
          partly, indeed, because the Rome that we admire was almost gone before
          the church was founded; but partly, too, because we forget each of
          these while we are studying the other. We almost make two persons of
          Trajan, accordingly as we meet with him in sacred or profane history.
          So natural is it to forget in after life the faulty side of young
          friends' characters.

          The susceptibility of youth to the impression of society wears off at
          last. The age of reflection begins. From the storehouse of his
          youthful experience the man begins to draw the principles of his life.
          The spirit or conscience comes to full strength and assumes the throne
          intended for him in the soul. As an accredited judge, invested with
          full powers, he sits in the tribunal of our inner kingdom, decides
          upon the past, and legislates upon the future without appeal except to
          himself. He decides not by what is beautiful, or noble, or
          soul-inspiring, but by what is right. Gradually he frames his code of
          laws, revising, adding, abrogating, as a wider and deeper experience
          gives him clearer light. He is the third great teacher and the last.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the education by no means ceases when the spirit thus begins to
          lead the soul; the office of the spirit is in fact to guide us into
          truth, not to give truth. The youth who has settled down to his life's
          Work makes a great mistake if he fancies that because he is no more
          under teachers and governs his education is therefore at an end. It is
          only changed in form. He has much, very much, to learn, more perhaps
          than all which he has yet learned; an his new teacher will not give it
          to him all at once. The lesson of life is in this respect like the
          lessons whereby we learn any ordinary business. The barrister, who has
          filled his memory with legal forms and imbued his mind with their
          spirit, knows that the most valuable part of his education is yet to
          obtained in attending the courts of law. The physician is not content
          with the theories of the lecture-room, nor with the experiments of the
          laboratory, nor even with the attendance at the hospitals; he knows
          that independent practice, when he will be thrown upon his own
          resources, will open his eyes to much which at present he sees through
          a glass darkly. In every profession, after the principles are
          apparently mastered, there yet remains much to be learnt from the
          application of those principles to practice, the only means by which
          we ever understand principles to the bottom. So too with the lesson
          which includes all others, the lesson of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this last stage of his progress a man learns various ways. First he
          learns unconsciously by the growth of his inner powers and the secret
          but steady accumulation of experience. The fire of youth is toned down
          and sobered. The realities of life dissipate many dreams, clear up
          many prejudices, soften down many roughnesses. The difference between
          intention and action, between anticipating temptation and bearing it,
          between drawing pictures of holiness or nobleness and realizing them,
          between hopes of success and reality of achievement, is taught by many
          a painful and many an unexpected experience. In short, as the youth
          puts away childish things, so does the man put away youthful things.
          Secondly, the full-grown man learns by reflection. He looks inwards
          and not outwards only. He re-arranges the results of past experience,
          re-examines by the test of reality the principles supplied to him by
          books or conversation, reduces to intelligible and practical formulas
          what he has hitherto known m vague general rules. He not only
          generalizes -- youth will generalize with great rapidity and often
          with great acuteness -- but he learns to correct one generalization by
          another. He gradually learns to disentangle his own thoughts, so as
          not to be led into foolish inconsistency by want of clearness of
          purpose. He learns to distinguish between momentary impulses and
          permanent determinations of character. He learns to know the limits of
          his own powers, moral and intellectual; and by slow degrees and with
          much reluctance he learns to suspend his judgment and to be content
          with ignorance where knowledge is beyond his reach. He learns to know
          himself and other men, and to distinguish in some measure his own
          peculiarities from the leading features of humanity which he shares
          with all men. He learns to know both the worth and the worthlessness
          of the world's judgment and of his own. Thirdly, he learns much by
          mistakes, both by his own and by those of others. He often persists in
          a wrong cause till it is too late to mend what he has done, and he
          learns how to use it and how to bear it. His principles, or what he
          thought his principles, break down under him, and he is forced to
          analyse them in order to discover what amount of truth they really
          contain. He comes upon new and quite unexpected issues of what he has
          done or said, and he has to profit by such warnings as he receives.
          His errors often force him, as it were, to go back to school; not now
          with the happy docility of a child, but with the chastened submission
          of a penitent. Or, more often still, his mistakes inflict a sharp
          chastisement which teaches him a new lesson without much effort on his
          own part to learn. Lastly, he learns much by contradiction. The
          collision of society compels him to state his opinions clearly; to
          defend them; to modify them when indefensible; perhaps to surrender
          them altogether, consciously or unconsciously; still more often to
          absorb them into larger and fuller thoughts, less forcible but more
          comprehensive. The precision which is thus often forced upon him
          always seems to diminish something of the heartiness and power which
          belonged to more youthful instincts. But he gains in directness of
          aim, and therefore in firmness of resolution. But the greatest of his
          gains is what seems a loss: for he learns not to attempt the solution
          of insoluble problems, and to have no opinion at all on many points of
          the deepest interest. Usually this takes the form of an abandonment of
          speculation; but it may rise to the level of a philosophical humility
          which stops where it can advance no further, and confesses its own
          weakness in the presence of the mysteries of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          But throughout all this it must not be supposed that he has no more to
          do either with that law which guided his childhood or with any other
          law of any kind. Since he is still a learner, he must learn on the one
          condition of all learning -- obedience to rules; not indeed, blind
          obedience to rules not understood, but obedience to the rules of his
          own mind -- an obedience which he cannot throw off without descending
          below the childish level. He is free. But freedom is not the opposite
          of obedience, but of restraint. The free-man must obey, and obey as
          precisely as the bond-man; and if he has not acquired the habit of
          obedience he is not fit to be free. The law in fact which God makes
          the standard of our conduct may have one of two forms. It may be an
          external law, a law which is in the hands of others, in the making, in
          the applying, in the enforcing of which we have no share; a law which
          governs from the outside, compelling our will to bow even though our
          understanding be unconvinced and unenlightened; saying you must, and
          making no effort to make you feel that you ought; appealing not to
          your conscience, but to force or fear, and caring little whether you
          willingly agree or reluctantly submit. Or, again, the law may be an
          internal law; a voice which speaks within the conscience, and carries
          the understanding along with it; a law which treats us not as slaves
          but as friends, allowing us to know what our Lord doeth; a law which
          bids us yield not to blind fear or awe, but to the majesty of truth
          and justice; a law which is not imposed on us by another power, but by
          our own enlightened will. Now the first of these is the law which
          governs and educates the child; the second the law which governs and
          educates the man. The second is in reality the spirit of the first. It
          commands in a different way, but with a tone not one whit less
          peremptory; and be only who can control all appetites and passions in
          obedience to it can reap the full harvest of the last and highest
          education.
        </p>
        <p>
          This need of law in the full maturity of life is so imperative that if
          the requisite self-control be lost or impaired, or have never been
          sufficiently acquired, the man instinctively has recourse to a
          self-imposed discipline if he desire to keep himself from falling. The
          Christian who has fallen into sinful habits often finds that he has no
          resource but to abstain from much that is harmless in itself because
          he has associated it with evil. He takes monastic vows because the
          world has proved too much for him. He takes temperance pledges because
          he cannot resist the temptations of appetite. There are devils which
          can be cast out with a word; there are others which go not out but by
          (not prayer only, but) fasting. This is often the case with the late
          converted. They are compelled to abstain from, and sometimes they are
          induced to denounce, many pleasures and many enjoyments which they
          find unsuited to their spiritual health. The world and its enjoyments
          have been to them a source of perpetual temptation, and they cannot
          conceive any religious life within such a circle of evil. Sometimes
          these men are truly spiritual enough and humble enough to recognise
          that this discipline is not essential in itself, but only for them and
          for such as they. The discipline is then truly subordinate. It is an
          instrument in the hands of their conscience. They know what they are
          doing and why they do it. But sometimes, if they are weak, this
          discipline assumes the shape of a regular external law. They look upon
          many harmless things, from which they have suffered mischief as
          absolutely, not relatively, hurtful. They denounce what they cannot
          share without danger, as dangerous, not only for them, but for all
          mankind, and as evil in itself. They set up a conventional code of
          duty founded on their own experience which they extend to all men.
          Even if they are educated enough to see that no conventional code is
          intellectually tenable, yet they still maintain their system, and
          defend it, as not necessary in itself, but necessary for sinful men.
          The fact is, that a merciful Providence, in order to help such men,
          puts them back under the dominion of the law. They are not aware of it
          themselves -- men who are under the dominion of the law rarely are
          aware of it. But even if they could appeal to a revelation from
          heaven, they would still be under the law; for a revelation speaking
          from without and not from within is an external law and not a spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the same reason a strict and even severe discipline is needed for
          the cure of reprobates. Philanthropists complain sometimes that this
          teaching ends only in making the man say, the punishment of crime is
          what I cannot bear;' not, the wickedness of crime is what I will not
          do.' But our nature is not all will: and the fear of punishment is
          very often the foundation on which we build the hatred of evil. No
          convert would look back with any other feeling than deep gratitude on
          a severity which had set free his spirit by chaining down his grosser
          appetites. It is true that the teaching of mere discipline, if there
          be no other teaching, is useless. If you have only killed one selfish
          principle by another you have done nothing. But if while thus killing
          one selfish principle by another you have also succeeded in awaking
          the higher faculty and giving it free power of self-exertion, you have
          done everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          This return to the teaching of discipline in mature life is needed for
          the intellect even more than for the conduct. There are many men who
          though they pass from the teaching of the outer law to that of the
          inner in regard to their practical life, never emerge from the former
          in regard to their speculative. They do not think; they are contented
          to let others think for them and to accept the results. How far the
          average of men are from having attained the power of free independent
          thought is shown by the staggering and stumbling of their intellects
          when a completely new subject of investigation tempts them to form a
          judgment of their own on a matter which they have not studied. In such
          cases a really educated intellect sees at once that no judgment is yet
          within its reach, and acquiesces in suspense. But the uneducated
          intellect hastens to account for the phenomenon; to discover new laws
          of nature, and new relations of truth; to decide, and predict, and
          perhaps to demand a remodelling of all previous knowledge. The
          discussions on table-turning a few years ago, illustrated this want of
          intellects able to govern themselves. The whole analogy of physical
          science was not enough to induce that suspension of judgment which was
          effected in a week by the dictum of a known philosopher.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are, however, some men who really think for themselves. But even
          they are sometimes obliged, especially if their speculations touch
          upon practical life, to put a temporary restraint upon their
          intellects. They refuse to speculate at all in directions where they
          cannot feel sure of preserving their own balance of mind. If the
          conclusions at which they seem likely to arrive are very strange, or
          very unlike the general analogy of truth, or carry important practical
          consequences, they will pause, and turn to some other subject, and try
          whether if they come back with fresh minds they still come to the same
          results. And this may go further, and they may find such speculations
          so bewildering and so unsatisfactory, that they finally take refuge in
          a refusal to think any more on the particular questions. They content
          themselves with so much of truth as they find necessary for their
          spiritual life; and, though perfectly aware that the wheat may be
          mixed with tares, they despair of rooting up the tares with safety to
          the wheat, and therefore let both grow together till the harvest. All
          this is justifiable in the same way that any self-discipline is
          justifiable. That is, it is justifiable if really necessary. But as is
          always the case with those who are under the law, such men are
          sometimes tempted to prescribe for others what they need for
          themselves, and to require that no others should speculate because
          they dare not. They not only refuse to think, and accept other men's
          thoughts, which is often quite right, but they elevate those into
          canons of faith for all men, which is not right. This blindness is of
          course wrong; but in reality it is a blindness of the same kind as
          that with which the Hebrews clung to their law; a blindness, provided
          for them in mercy, to save their intellects from leading them into
          mischief.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some men, on the other hand, show their want of intellectual
          self-control by going back not to the dominion of law, but to the
          still lower level of intellectual anarchy. They speculate without any
          foundation at all. They confound the internal consistency of some
          dream of their brains with the reality of independent truth. They set
          up theories which have no other evidence than compatibility with the
          few facts that happen to be known; and forget that many other theories
          of equal claims might readily be invented. They are as little able to
          be content with having no judgment at all as those who accept
          judgments at second hand. They never practically realize that when
          there is not enough evidence to justify a conclusion, it is wisdom to
          draw no conclusion. They are so eager for light that they will rub
          their eyes in the dark and take the resulting optical delusions for
          real flashes. They need intellectual discipline -- but they have
          little chance of getting it, for they have burst its bands.

          There is yet a further relation between the inner law of mature life
          and the outer law of childhood which must be noticed. And that is,
          that the outer law is often the best vehicle in which the inner law
          can be contained for the various purposes of life. The man remembers
          with affection, and keeps up with delight the customs of the home of
          his childhood; tempted perhaps to over-estimate their value, but even
          when perfectly aware that they are no more than one form out of many
          which a well-ordered household might adopt, preferring them because of
          his long familiarity, and because of the memories with which they are
          associated. So, too, truth often seems to hiss richer and fuller when
          expressed in some favourite phrase of his mother's, or some maxim of
          his father's. He can give no better reason very often for much that he
          does every day of his life than that his father did it before him; and
          provided the custom is not a bad one the reason is valid. And he likes
          to go to the same church. He likes to use the same prayers. He likes
          to keep up the same festivities. There are limits to all this. But no
          man is quite free from the influence; and it is in many cases, perhaps
          in most, an influence of the highest moral value. There is great value
          in the removal of many indifferent matters out of the region of
          discussion into that of precedent. There is greater value still in the
          link of sympathy which binds the present with the past, and fills old
          age with the fresh feelings of childhood. If truth sometimes suffers
          in form, it unquestionably gains much in power; and if its onward
          progress is retarded, it gains immeasurably in solidity and in its
          hold on men's hearts.

          Such is the last stage in the education of a human soul, and similar
          (as far as it has yet gone) has been the last stage in the education
          of the human race. Of course, so full a comparison cannot be made in
          this instance as was possible in the two that preceded it. For we are
          still within the boundaries of this third period, and we cannot yet
          judge it as a whole. But if the Christian Church be taken as the
          representative of mankind it is easy to see that the general law
          observable in the development of the individual may also be found in
          the development of the Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the days of the Apostles no further revelation has been granted,
          nor has any other system of religion sprung up spontaneously within
          the limits which the Church has covered. No prophets have communicated
          messages from Heaven. No infallible inspiration has guided any teacher
          or preacher. The claim of infallibility still maintained by a portion
          of Christendom has been entirely given up by the more advanced
          section. The Church, in the fullest sense, is left to herself to work
          out, by her natural faculties, the principles of her own action. And
          whatever assistance she is to receive in doing so, is to be through
          those natural faculties, and not in spite of them or without them.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the very first, the Church commenced the task by determining her
          leading doctrines and the principles of her conduct. These were
          evolved, as principles usually are, partly by reflection on past
          experience, and by formularizing the thoughts embodied in the record
          of the Church of the Apostles, partly by perpetual collision with
          every variety of opinion. This career of dogmatism in the Church was,
          in many ways, similar to the hasty generalizations of early manhood.
          The principle on which the controversies of those days were conducted
          is that of giving an answer to every imaginable question. It rarely
          seems to occur to the early controversialists that there are questions
          which even the Church cannot solve -- problems which not even
          revelation has brought within the reach of human faculties. That the
          decisions were right, on the whole -- that is, that they always
          embodied, if they did not always rightly define, the truth -- is
          proved by the permanent vitality of the Church as compared with the
          various heretical bodies that broke from her. But the fact that so
          vast a number of the early decisions are practically obsolete, and
          that even many of the doctrinal statements are plainly unfitted for
          permanent use, is a proof that the Church was not capable, any more
          than a man is capable, of extracting, at once, all the truth and
          wisdom contained in the teaching of the earlier periods. In fact, the
          Church of the Fathers claimed to do what not even the Apostles had
          claimed -- namely, not only to teach the truth, but to clothe it in
          logical statements, and that not merely as opposed to then prevailing
          heresies (which was justifiable), but for all succeeding time. Yet
          this was, alter all, only an exaggeration of the proper function of
          the time. Those logical statements were necessary. And it belongs to a
          later epoch to see the law within the law' which absorbs such
          statements into something higher than themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before this process can be said to have worked itself out, it was
          interrupted by a new phenomenon, demanding essentially different
          management. A flood of new and undisciplined races poured into Europe,
          on the one hand supplying the Church with the vigour of fresh life to
          replace the effete materials of the old Roman Empire, and, on the
          other carrying her back to the childish stage, and necessitating a
          return to the dominion of outer law. The Church instinctively had
          recourse to the only means that would suit the case -- namely, a
          revival of Judaism. The Papacy of the Middle Ages, and the Papal
          Hierarchy, with all its numberless ceremonies and appliances of
          external religion, with its attention fixed upon deeds and not on
          thoughts, or feelings, or purposes, with its precise apportionment of
          punishments and purgatory, was, in fact, neither more nor less than
          the old schoolmaster come back to bring some new scholars to Christ.
          Of course, this was not the conscious intention of the then rulers of
          the Church; they believed in their own ceremonies as much as any of
          the people at large. The return to the dominion of law was
          instinctive, not intentional. But its object is now as evident as the
          object of the ancient Mosaic system. Nothing short of a real system of
          discipline, accepted as Divine by all alike, could have tamed the
          German and Celtish nature into the self-control needed for a truly
          spiritual religion. How could Chlovis, at the head of his Franks, have
          made any right use of absolute freedom of conscience? Nor was this a
          case in which the less disciplined race could have learned
          spirituality from the more disciplined. This may happen when the more
          disciplined is much the more vigorous of the two. But the exhausted
          Roman Empire had not such strength of life left within it. There was
          no alternative but that all alike should be put under the law to learn
          the lesson of obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the work was done, men began to discover that the law was no
          longer necessary. And of course there was no reason why they should
          then discuss the question whether it ever had been necessary. The time
          was come when it was fit to trust to the conscience as the supreme
          guide, and the yoke of the medieval discipline was shaken off by a
          controversy which, in many respects, was a repetition of that between
          St. Paul and the Judaizers. But, as is always the case after a
          temporary return to the state of discipline, Christendom did not go
          back to the position or the duty from which she had been drawn by the
          influx of the barbarian races. The human mind had not stood still
          through the ages of bondage, though its motions had been hidden. The
          Church's whole energy was taken up in the first six centuries of her
          existence in the creation of a theology. Since that time it had been
          occupied in renewing by self-discipline the self-control which the
          sudden absorption of the barbarians had destroyed. At the Reformation
          it might have seemed at first as if the study of theology were about
          to return. But in reality an entirely new lesson commenced -- the
          lesson of toleration. Toleration is the very opposite of dogmatism. It
          implies in reality a confession that there are insoluble problems upon
          which even revelation throws but little light. Its tendency is to
          modify the early dogmatism by substituting the spirit for the letter,
          and practical religion for precise definitions of truth. This lesson
          is certainly not yet fully learnt. Our toleration is at present too
          often timid, too often rash, sometimes sacrificing valuable religious
          elements, sometimes fearing its own plainest conclusions. Yet there
          can be no question that it is gaining on the minds of all educated
          men, whether Protestant or Roman Catholic, and is passing from them to
          be the common property of educated and uneducated alike. There are
          occasions when the spiritual anarchy which has necessarily followed
          the Reformation threatens for a moment to bring back some temporary
          bondage, like the Roman Catholic system. But on the whole the steady
          progress of toleration is unmistakeable. The mature mind of our race
          is beginning to modify and soften the hardness and severity of the
          principles which its early manhood had elevated into immutable
          statements of truth. Men are beginning to take a wider view than they
          did. Physical science, researches into history, a more thorough
          knowledge of the world they inhabit, have enlarged our philosophy
          beyond the limits which bounded that of the Church of the Fathers. And
          all these have an influence, whether we will or no, on our
          determinations of religious truth. There are found to be more things
          in heaven and earth than were dreamt of in the patristic theology.
          God's creation is a new book to be read by the side of His revelation,
          and to be interpreted as coming from Him. We can acknowledge the great
          value of the forms in which the first ages of the Church defined the
          truth, and yet refuse to be bound by them; we can use them, and yet
          endeavour to go beyond them, just as they also went beyond the legacy
          which was left us by the Apostles.

          In learning this new lesson, Christendom needed a firm spot on which
          she might stand, and has found it in the Bible. Had the Bible been
          drawn up in precise statements of faith, or detailed precepts of
          conduct, we should have had no alternative but either permanent
          subjection to an outer law, or loss of the highest instrument of
          self-education. But the Bible, from its very form, is exactly adapted
          to our present want. It is a history; even the doctrinal parts of it
          are cast in a historical form, and are best studied by considering
          them as records of the time at which they were written, and as
          conveying to us the highest and greatest religious life of that time.
          Hence we use the Bible -- some consciously, some unconsciously -- not
          to override, but to evoke the voice of conscience. When conscience and
          the Bible appear to differ, the pious Christian immediately concludes
          that he has not really understood the Bible. Hence, too, while the
          interpretation of the Bible varies slightly from age to age, a varies
          always in one direction. The schoolmen found purgatory in it. Later
          students found enough to condemn Galileo. Not long ago it would have
          been held to condemn geology, and there are still many who so
          interpret it. The current is all one way -- it evidently points to the
          identification of the Bible with the voice of conscience. The Bible,
          in fact, is hindered by its form from exercising a despotism over the
          human spirit; if it could do that, it would become an outer law at
          once; but its form is so admirably adapted to our need, that it wins
          from us all the reverence of a supreme authority, and yet imposes on
          us no yoke of subjection. This it does by virtue of the principle of
          private judgment, which puts conscience between us and the Bible,
          making conscience the supreme interpreter, whom it may be a duty to
          enlighten, but whom it can never be a duty to disobey.

          This recurrence to the Bible as the great authority has been
          accompanied by a strong inclination, common to all Protestant
          countries, to go back in every detail of life to the practices of
          early times, chiefly, no doubt, because such a revival of primitive
          practices, wherever possible, is the greatest help to entering into
          the very essence, and imbibing the spirit of the days when the Bible
          was written. So, too, the observance of the Sunday has a stronger hold
          on the minds of all religious men because it penetrates the whole
          texture of the Old Testament. The institution is so admirable, indeed
          so necessary in itself, that without this hold it would deserve its
          present position. But nothing but its prominent position in the Bible
          would have made it, what it now is, the one ordinance which all
          Christendom alike agrees in keeping. In such an observance men feel
          that they are, so far, living a scriptural life, and have come, as it
          were, a step nearer to the inner power of the book from which they
          expect to learn their highest lessons. Some, indeed, treat it as
          enjoined by an absolutely binding decree, and thus at once put
          themselves under a law. But short of that, those who defend it only by
          arguments of Christian expediency, are yet compelled to acknowledge
          that those arguments are so strong that it would be difficult to
          imagine a higher authority for any ceremonial institution. And among
          those arguments one of the foremost is the sympathy which the
          institution fosters between the student of the Bible and the book
          which he studies.

          This tendency to go back to the childhood and youth of the world has,
          of course, retarded the acquisition of that toleration which is the
          chief philosophical and religious lesson of modern days.
          Unquestionably as bigoted a spirit has often been shown in defence of
          some practice for which the sanction of the Bible had been claimed, as
          before the Reformation in defence of the decrees of the Church. But no
          lesson is well learned all at once. To learn toleration well and
          really, to let it become, not a philosophical tenet but a practical
          principle, to join it with real religiousness of life and character,
          it is absolutely necessary that it should break in upon the mind by
          slow and steady degrees, and that at every point its right to go
          further should be disputed, and so forced to logical proof. For it is
          only by virtue of the opposition which it has surmounted that any
          truth can stand in the human mind. The strongest argument in favour of
          tolerating all opinions is that our conviction of the truth of an
          opinion is worthless unless it has established itself in spite of the
          most strenuous resistance, and is still prepared to overcome the same
          resistance, if necessary. Toleration itself is no exception to the
          universal law; and those who must regret the slow progress by which.
          it wins its way, may remember that this slowness makes the final
          victory the more certain and complete. Nor is that all. The toleration
          thus obtained is different in kind from what it would otherwise have
          been. It is not only stronger, it is richer and fuller. For the
          slowness of its progress gives finis to disentangle from dogmatism the
          really valuable principles and sentiments that have been mixed up and
          entwined in it, and to unite toleration, not with indifference and
          worldliness, but with spiritual truth and religiousness of life.

          Even the perverted use of the Bible has therefore not been without
          certain great advantages. And meanwhile how utterly impossible it
          would be in the manhood of the world to imagine any other instructor
          of mankind. And for that reason, every day makes it more and more
          evident that the thorough study of the Bible, the investigation of
          what it teaches and what it does not teach, the determination of the
          limits of what we mean by its inspiration, the determination of the
          degree of authority to be ascribed to the different books, if any
          degrees are to be admitted, must take the lead of all other studies.
          He is guilty of high treason against the faith who fears the result of
          any investigation, whether philosophical, or scientific, or
          historical. And therefore nothing should be more welcome than the
          extension of knowledge of any and every kind -- for every increase in
          our accumulations of knowledge throws fresh light upon these the real
          problems of our day. If geology proves to us that we must not
          interpret the first chapters of Genesis literally; if historical
          investigations shall show us that inspiration, however it may protect
          the doctrine, yet was not empowered to protect the narrative of the
          inspired writers from occasional inaccuracy; if careful criticism
          shall prove that there have been occasionally interpolations and
          forgeries in that Book, as in many others; the results should still be
          welcome. Even the mistakes of careful and reverent students are more
          valuable now than truth held in unthinking acquiescence. The substance
          of the teaching which we derive from the Bible will not really be
          affected by anything of this sort. While its hold upon the minds of
          believers, and its power to stir the depths of the spirit of man,
          however much weakened at first, must be immeasurably strengthened in
          the end, by clearing away any blunders which may have been fastened on
          it by human interpretation.

          The immediate work of our day is the study of the Bible. Other studies
          will act upon the progress of mankind by acting through and upon this.
          For while a few highly educated men here and there who have given
          their minds to special pursuits may think the study of the Bible a
          thing of the past, yet assuredly, if their science is to have its
          effect upon men in the mass, it must be by affecting their moral and
          religious convictions -- in no other way have men been, or can men be,
          deeply and permanently changed. But though this study must be for the
          present and for some time the centre of all studies, there is
          meanwhile no study of whatever kind which will not have its share in
          the general effect. At this time, in the maturity of mankind, as with
          each man in the maturity of his powers, the great lever which moves
          the world is knowledge, the great force is the intellect. St. Paul has
          told us that though in malice we must be children, in understanding we
          ought to be men.' And this saying of his has the widest range. Not
          only in the understanding of religious truth, but in all exercise of
          the intellectual powers, we have no right to stop short of any limit
          but that which nature, that is, the decree of the Creator, has imposed
          on us. In fact, no knowledge can be without its effect on religious
          convictions; for if not capable of throwing direct light on some
          spiritual questions, yet in its acquisition knowledge invariably
          throws light on the process by which it is to be, or has been,
          acquired, and thus affects all other knowledge of every kind.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we have made mistakes, careful study may teach us better. If we
          have quarrelled about words, the enlightenment of the understanding is
          the best means to show us our folly. If we have vainly puzzled our
          intellects with subjects beyond human cognizance, better knowledge of
          ourselves will help us to be humbler. Life, indeed, is higher than all
          else; and no service that man can render to his fellows is to be
          compared with the heavenly power of a life of holiness. But next to
          that must be ranked, whatever tends to make men think clearly and
          judge correctly. So valuable, even above all things (excepting only
          godliness) is clear thought, that the labours of the statesman are far
          below those of the philosopher in duration, in power, and in
          beneficial results. Thought is now higher than action, unless action
          be inspired with the very breath of heaven. For we are now men,
          governed by principles, if governed at all, and cannot rely any longer
          on the impulses of youth or the discipline of childhood.<br />
