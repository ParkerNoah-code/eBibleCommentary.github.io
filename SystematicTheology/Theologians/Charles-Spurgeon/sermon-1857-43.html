        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.150)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, September 6, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>

          "Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that
          I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my
          people." -- Jeremiah 9:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          SOMETIMES tears are base things; the offspring of a cowardly spirit.
          Some men weep when they should knit their brows, and many a woman
          weepeth when she should resign herself to the will of God. Many of
          those briny drops are but an expression of child-like weakness. It
          were well if we could wipe such tears away, and face a frowning world
          with a constant countenance. But oft times tears are the index of
          strength. There are periods when they are the noblest things in the
          world. The tears of penitents are precious: a cup of them were worth a
          king's ransom. It is no sign of weakness when a man weeps for sin, it
          shows that he hath strength of mind; nay more, that he hath strength
          imparted by God, which enables him to forswear his lusts and overcome
          his passions, and to turn unto God with full purpose of heart. And
          there are other tears, too, which are the evidences not of weakness,
          but of might -- the tears of tender sympathy are the children of
          strong affection, and they are strong like their parents. He that
          loveth much, must weep much; much love and much sorrow must go
          together in this vale of tears. The unfeeling heart, the unloving
          spirit, may pass from earth's portal to its utmost bound almost
          without a sigh except for itself; but he that loveth, hath digged as
          many wells of tears as he has chosen objects of affection; for by as
          many as our friends are multiplied, by so many must our griefs be
          multiplied too, if we have love enough to share in their griefs and to
          bear their burden for them. The largest hearted man will miss many
          sorrows that the little man will feel, but he will have to endure many
          sorrows the poor narrow-minded spirit never knoweth. It needs a mighty
          prophet like Jeremiah to weep as mightily as he. Jeremiah was not weak
          in his weeping; the strength of his mind and the strength of his love
          were the parents of his sorrow. "Oh that my head were waters, and mine
          eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the
          slain of the daughter of my people." This is no expression of weak
          sentimentalism; this is no utterance of mere whining presence; it is
          the burst of a strong soul, strong in its affection, strong in its
          devotion, strong in its self-sacrifice. I would to God we knew how to
          weep like this; and if we might not weep so frequently as Jeremy I
          wish that when we did weep, we did weep as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would seem as if some men had been sent into this world for the
          very purpose of being the world's weepers. God's great house is
          thoroughly furnished with everything, everything that can express the
          thoughts and the emotions of the inhabitant, God hath made. I find in
          nature, plants to be everlasting weepers. There by the lonely brook,
          where the maiden cast away her life, the willow weeps for ever; and
          there in the grave yard where men lie slumbering till the trumpet of
          the archangel shall awaken them, stands the dull cypress, mourning in
          its sombre garments. Now as it is with nature, so it is with the race
          of man. Mankind have bravery and boldness; they must have their heroes
          to express their courage. Mankind have some love to their
          fellow-creatures; they must have their fine philanthropists to live
          out mankind's philanthropy. Men have their sorrows, they must have
          their weepers; they must have men of sorrows who have it for their
          avocation and their business, to weep, from the cradle to the grave to
          be ever weeping, not so much for themselves as for the woes of others,
          it may be I have some such here; I shall be happy to enlist their
          sympathies; and truly if I have none of that race, I shall boldly
          appeal to the whole mass of you, and I will bring before you causes of
          great grief; and when I bid you by the love you bear to man, and to
          his God, to begin to weep; if you have tears, these hard times will
          compel you to shed them now. Come, let me show you wherefore I have
          taken this my text, and why I have uttered this mournful language; and
          if your hearts be not as stolid as stone, sure there should be some
          tears shed this morning. For if I be not foolish in my utterances and
          faint in my speech, you will go home to your chambers to weep there.
          "Oh that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I
          might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people."
        </p>
        <p>
          I want your griefs this morning, first, for persons actually slain --
          "the slain of the daughter of our people;" and then I shall need your
          tears for those morally slain, "the slain of the daughter of our
          people."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. To begin, then, with ACTUAL MURDER AND REAL BLOODSHED. My brethren,
          our hearts are sick nigh unto death with the terrible news brought us
          post after post, telegraph after telegraph; we have read many letters
          of the Times, day after day, until we have folded up that paper, and
          professed before God that we could read no more. Our spirits have been
          harrowed by the most fearful and unexpected cruelty. We, perhaps, may
          not have been personally interested in the bloodshed, so far as our
          own husbands, wives, brothers, and sisters have been concerned, but we
          have felt the tie of kindred very strongly when we have found our race
          so cruelly butchered in the land of the East. It is for us to-day
          humbly to confess our crime. The government of India has been a cruel
          government; it has much for which to appear before the bar of God. Its
          tortures -- if the best evidence is to be believed -- have been of the
          most inhuman kind; God forgive the men who have committed such crimes
          in the British name. But those days are past. May God blot out the
          sin. We do not forget our own guilt; but an overwhelming sense of the
          guilt of others, who have with such cold-hearted cruelty tormented men
          and women, may well excuse us if we do not dilate upon the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas! alas, for our brethren there! They have died; alas for them!
          They have been slain by the sword of treachery, and traitorously
          murdered by men who swore allegiance. Alas for them! But, O ye
          soldiers, we weep not for you. Even when ye were tortured, ye had not
          that high dishonor to bear to which the other sex has been obliged to
          submit. O England! weep for thy daughters with a bitter lamentation;
          let thine eyes run down with rivers of blood for them. Had they been
          crushed within the folds of the hideous boa, or had the fangs of the
          tiger been red with their blood, happy would their fate have been
          compared with the indignities they have endured! O Earth! thou hast
          beheld crimes which antiquity could not parallel; thou hast seen
          bestial lust gratified upon the purest and the best of mortals. God's
          fairest creatures stained; those loved ones, who could not brook the
          name of lust, given up to the embraces of incarnate devils! Weep,
          Britain, weep, weep for thy sons and for thy daughters! If thou art
          cold-hearted now, if thou readest the tale of infamy now without a
          tear, thou art no mother to them! Sure thine heart must have failed
          thee, and thou hast become less loving than thine own lions, and less
          tender than beasts of prey, if thou dost not weep for the maiden and
          the wife, Brethren, I am not straining history; I am not endeavoring
          to be pathetic where there is no pathos. No; my subject of itself is
          all pathos; it is my poor way of speaking that doth spoil it. I have
          not to-day to act the orator's part, to garnish up that which was
          nothing before; I have not to magnify little griefs -- rather I feel
          that all my utterances do but diminish the woe which every thoughtful
          man must feel. Oh, how have our hearts been harrowed, cut in pieces,
          molten in the fire! Agony hath seized upon us, and grief unutterable,
          when, day after day, our hopes have been disappointed, and we have
          heard that still the rebel rages in his fury, and still with despotic
          might doth as he pleaseth with the sons and daughters, the husbands
          and the wives of England Weep, Christians, weep! And ye ask me of what
          avail shall be your weeping eye bidden you weep today, because the
          spirit of vengeance is gathering; Britain's wrath is stirred; a black
          cloud is hanging over the head of the mutinous Sepoys! Their fate
          shall be most dreadful, their doom most tremendous, when England shall
          smite the murderers, as justly she must. There must be Judicial
          punishment enacted upon these men, so terrible that the earth shall
          tremble, and both the ears of him that heareth it shall tingle! I am
          inclined, if I can, to sprinkle some few cooling tears upon the fires
          of vengeance. No, no, we will not take vengeance upon ourselves.
          "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord." Let not Britain's
          soldiers push their enemies to destruction, through a spirit of
          vengeance, as men, let them do it as the appointed executioners of the
          sentence of our laws. According to the civil code of every country
          under heaven, these men are condemned to die. Not as soldiers should
          we war with them, but as malefactors we must execute the law upon
          them. They have committed treason against government, and for that
          crime alone the doom is death! But they are murderers, and rightly or
          wrongly, our law is, that the murderer must die the death. God must
          have this enormous sin punished, and though we would feel no vengeance
          as Britons, yet, for the sake of government, God's established
          government on earth, the ruler who beareth the sword must not now bear
          the sword in vain. Long have I held that war is an enormous crime;
          long have I regarded all battles as but murder on a large scale: but
          this time, I, a peaceful man, a follower of the peaceful Saviour, do
          propound war. No, it is not war that I propound, but a just and proper
          punishment. I will not aid and abet soldiers as warriors, but as
          executioners of a lawful sentence, which ought to be executed upon
          men, who, by the double crime of infamous debauchery, and fearful
          bloodshed, have brought upon themselves the ban and curse of God, so
          that they must be punished, or truth and innocence can never walk this
          earth. As a rule I do not believe in the utility of capital
          punishment, but the crime has been attended with all the horrid guilt
          of the cities of the plain, and is too bestial to be endured. But
          still, I say, I would cool down the vengeance of Britons, and
          therefore I would bid you weep. Ye talk of vengeance, but ye know not
          the men with whom ye have to deal; many a post may come, and many a
          month run round, and many a year may pass before ye hear of victory
          over those fierce men. Be not too proud. England talked once of her
          great deeds, and she hath since been humbled. She may yet again learn
          that she is not omnipotent. But ye people of God, weep, weep for this
          sin that hath broken loose, weep for this hell that hath found its way
          to earth; go to your chambers and cry out to God to stop this
          bloodshed. You are to be the saviours of your nation. Not on the
          bayonets of British soldiery, but on the prayers of British
          Christians, do we rest. Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
          lament most bitterly, for this desperate sin; and then cry to God to
          save! Remember, he heareth prayer -- prayer moveth the arm of the
          Omnipotent. Let us proclaim a fast; let us gather a solemn assembly;
          let us cry mightily unto him; let us ask the God of armies to avenge
          himself; let us pray him so to send the light of the gospel into the
          land, that such a crime may be impossible a second time; and this
          time, so to put it down, that it may never have an opportunity of
          breaking loose again. I know not whether our government will proclaim
          a national fast; but certain I am it is time that every Christian
          should celebrate one in his own heart. I bid all of you with whom my
          word has one atom of respect, if my exhortation has one word of force,
          I do exhort you to spend special time in prayer just now. Oh! my
          friends, ye cannot hear the shrieks, ye have not seen the
          terror-stricken faces, ye have not beheld the flying fugitives; but
          you may picture them in your imagination; and he must be accursed who
          does not pray to God, and lift up his soul in earnest prayer, that he
          would be pleased now to put his shield between our fellow-subjects and
          their enemies. And you, especially, the representatives of divers
          congregations in various parts of this land, give unto God no rest
          until he be pleased to bestir himself. Make this your cry: "O Lord our
          God arise, and let thine enemies be scattered, and let all them that
          hate thee become as the fat of rams." So shall God, through your
          prayers, haply, establish peace and vindicate justice, and "God, even
          our own God, shall bless us, and that right early."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But I have now a greater reason for your sorrow -- a more
          disregarded, and yet more dreadful source of woe. If the first time we
          said it with plaintive voice, we must a second time say it yet more
          plaintively -- "Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain
          of tears, that I might weep day and night," FOR THE MORALLY SLAIN of
          the daughter of my people. The old adage is still true, "One-half of
          the world knows nothing about how the other half lives." A large
          proportion of you professing Christians have been respectably brought
          up; you have never in your lives been the visitants of the dens of
          infamy, you have never frequented the haunts of wickedness, and you
          know but very little of the sins of your fellow creatures. Perhaps it
          is well that you should remain as ignorant as you are; for, where to
          be ignorant is to be free from temptation, It would be folly to be
          wise. But there are others who have been obliged to see the wickedness
          of their fellows; and a public teacher, especially, is bound not to
          speak from mere hearsay, but to know from authentic sources what is
          the spirit of the times. It is our business to look with eagle eye
          through every part of this land, and see what crime is rampant -- what
          kind of crime, and what sort of infamy. Ah, my friends, with all the
          advancement of piety in this land, with all the hopeful signs of
          better times, with all the sunlight of glory heralding the coming
          morn, with all the promises and with all our hopes, we are still
          obliged to bid you weep because sin aboundeth and iniquity is still
          mighty. Oh, how many of our sons and daughters, of our friends and
          relatives, are slain by sin! Ye weep over battle-fields, ye shed tears
          on the plains of Balaklava; there are worse battlefields than there,
          and worse deaths than those inflicted by the sword.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah, weep ye for the drunkenness of this land! How many thousands of
          our race reel from our sin-palaces into perdition! Oh, if the souls of
          departed drunkards could be seen at this hour by the Christians of
          Britain, they would tremble, lift up their hands in sorrow, and begin
          to weep. My soul might be an everlasting Niobe, perpetually dropping
          showers of tears, if it might know the doom and the destruction
          brought on them by that one demon, and by that one demon only! I am no
          enthusiast, I am no total abstainer. -- I do not think the cure of
          England's drunkenness will come from that quarter. I respect those who
          thus deny themselves, with a view to the good of others, and should be
          glad to believe that they accomplish their object. But though I am no
          total abstainer, I hate drunkenness as much as any man breathing, and
          have been the means of bringing many poor creatures to relinquish this
          beastial indulgence. We believe drunkenness to be an awful crime and a
          horrid sin; we look on all its dreadful effects, and we stand prepared
          to go to war with it, and to fight side by side with abstainers, even
          though we may differ from them as to the mode of warfare. Oh! England,
          how many thousands of thy sons are murdered every year by that
          accursed devil of drunkenness, that hath such sway over this land!
        </p>
        <p>
          But there are other crimes too. Alas, for that crime of debauchery!
          What scenes hath the moon seen every night! Sweetly did she shine last
          evening; the meadows seemed as if they were silvered with beauty when
          she shone upon them. But ah! what sins were transacted beneath her
          pale sway! Oh, God, thou only knowest: our hearts might be sickened,
          and we might indeed cry for "A lodge in some vast wilderness," had we
          seen what God beheld when he looked down from the moon-lit sky! Ye
          tell me that sins of that kind are common in the lower class of
          society. Alas, I know it; alas, how many a girl hath dashed herself
          into the river to take away her life, because she could not bear the
          infamy that was brought upon her! But lay not this to the poor; the
          infamy and sin of our streets begin not with them. It beginneth with
          the highest ranks -- with what we call the noblest classes of society.
          Men that have defiled themselves and others will stand in our senates,
          and walk among our peers; men whose characters are not reputable -- it
          is a shame to speak even of the things that are done of them in secret
          -- are received into the drawing rooms and into the parlors of the
          highest society, while the poor creature who has been the victim of
          their passions is hooted and cast away! O Lord God, thou alone knowest
          the awful ravages that this sin hath made. Thy servant's lips can
          utter no more than this, he hath gone to the verge of his utterance,
          he feeleth that he hath no further license in his speech, still he may
          well cry -- "Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of
          tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter
          of my people!" If ye have walked the hospital, if ye have seen the
          refuges, if ye have talked with the inmates -- and if ye know the
          gigantic spread of that enormous evil, ye may well sympathize with me
          when I say, that at the thought of it my spirit is utterly cast down.
          I feel that I would rather die than live whilst sin thus reigns and
          iniquity thus spreads.
        </p>
        <p>
          But are these the only evils? Are these the only demons that are
          devouring our people? Ah, would to God it were so. Behold, throughout
          this land, how are men falling by every sin, disguised as it is under
          the shape of pleasure. Have ye never, as from some distant journey ye
          have returned to your houses at midnight, seen the multitudes of
          people who are turning out of casinos, low theatres, and other houses
          of sin? I do not frequent those places, nor from earliest childhood
          have I ever trodden those floors, but, from the company that I have
          seen issuing from these dens, I could only lift up my hands, and pray
          God to close such places; they seem to be the gates of hell, and their
          doors, as they very properly themselves say, "Lead to the pit." Ah,
          may God be pleased to raise up many who shall warn this city, and bid
          Christian people by day and night "for the slain of the daughter of
          our people!" Christians, never leave off weeping for men's sins and
          infamies. There are sins by day; God's own day, this day is defiled,
          is broken in pieces and trodden under foot. There are sins every
          morning committed, and sins each night. If ye could see them ye might
          be never happy, if ye could walk in the midst of them and behold them
          with your eyes, if God would give you grace, ye might perpetually
          weep, for ye would always have cause for sorrow. "Oh that my head were
          waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and
          night for the slain of the daughter of my people."
        </p>
        <p>
          But now I must just throw in something which will more particularly
          apply to you. Perhaps I have very few here who would indulge in open
          and known sin; perhaps most of you belong to the good and amiable
          class who have every kind of virtue, and of whom it must be said, "One
          thing thou lackest;" My heart never feels so grieved as at the sight
          of you. How often have I been entertained most courteously and
          hospitably, as the Lord's servant, in the houses of men and of women
          whose characters are supremely excellent, who have every virtue that
          could adorn a Christian, except faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; who
          might be held up as the very mirrors and patterns to be imitated by
          others. How has my heart grieved when I have thought of these, still
          undecided, still godless, prayerless and Christless. I have many of
          you in this congregation to-day -- I could not put my finger upon one
          solitary fault in your character, you are scrupulously correct in your
          morals -- Alas, alas, alas for you, that you should still be dead in
          trespasses and sins, because you have not been renewed by divine
          grace! So lovely, and yet without faith; so beautiful, so admirable,
          and yet not converted. O God, when drunkards die, when swearers
          perish, when harlots and seducers sink to the fate they have earned,
          we may well weep for such sinners; but when these who have walked in
          our midst and have almost been acknowledged as believers, are cast
          away because they leek the one thing needful, it seems enough to make
          angels weep. O members of churches, ye may well take up the cry of
          Jeremiah when ye remember what multitudes of these you have in your
          midst -- men who have a name to live and are dead: and others, who
          though they profess not to be Christians, are almost persuaded to obey
          their Lord and Master, but are yet not partakers of the divine life of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now I shall want, if I can, to press this pathetic subject a
          little further upon your minds. In the day when Jeremiah wept this
          lamentation with an exceeding loud and bitter cry, Jerusalem was in
          all her mirth and merriment. Jeremiah was a sad man in the midst of a
          multitude of merry makers; he told them that Jerusalem should be
          destroyed, that their temple should become a heap, and Nebuchadnezzar
          should lay it with the ground. They laughed him to scorn; they mocked
          him. Still the viol and the dance were only to be seen. Do you not
          picture that brave old man, for he was bravely plaintive, sitting down
          in the courts of the Temple? And though as yet the pillars were
          unfallen, and the golden roof was yet unstained, he lifted up his
          hands and pictured to himself this scene of Jerusalem's Temple burned
          with fire, her women and her children carried away captive, and her
          sons given to the sword. And when he pictured this, he did, as it
          were, in spirit set himself down upon one of the broken pillars of the
          Temple, and there, in the midst of desolation which was not as yet --
          but which faith, the evidence of things not seen, did picture to him
          -- cry, "Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of
          tears." And now, to-day, here are many of you masquers and merry
          makers in this ball of life, ye are here merry and glad to-day, and ye
          marvel that I should talk of you as persons for whom we ought to weep.
          "Weep ye for me!" you say; "I am in health, I am in riches, I am
          enjoying life; why weep for me? I need none of your sentimental
          weeping!" Ah, but we weep because we foresee the future. If you could
          live here always, we might not, perhaps, weep for you; but we, by the
          eye of faith, look forward to the time when the pillars of heaven must
          totter, when this earth must shake, when death must give up its prey,
          when the great white throne must be set in the clouds of heaven, and
          the thunders and lightnings of Jehovah shall be launched in armies,
          and the angels of God shall be marshalled in their ranks, to swell the
          pomp of the grand assize -- we look forward to that hour, and by faith
          we see you standing before the Judge; we see his eye sternly fixed on
          you, we hear him read the book; we mark your tottering knees, whilst
          sentence after sentence of thundering wrath strikes on your appalled
          ear; we think we see your blanched countenances; we mark your terror
          beyond all description, when he cries, "Depart, ye cursed!" We hear
          your shrieks; we hear you cry, "Rocks hide us; mountains on us fall!"
          We see the angel with fiery brand pursuing you, we hear your last
          unutterable shriek of woe as you descend into the pit of hell -- and
          we ask you if you could see this as we see it, would you wonder that
          at the thought of your destruction we are prepared to weep? "Oh that
          my head were waters, and mine eyes were a fountain of tears that I
          might weep" over you who will not stand in the judgment, but must be
          driven away like chaff into the unquenchable fire! And by the eye of
          faith we look further than that; we look into the grim and awful
          future: our faith looks through the gate of iron bound with adamant;
          we see the place of the condemned, our ear, opened by faith, hears
          "The sullen groans, and hollow moans, and shrieks of tortured ghosts!"
          Our eye anointed with heavenly eye salve sees the worm that never
          dieth, it beholds the fire that never can be quenched, and sees you
          writhing in the flame! O professors, if ye believed not in the wrath
          to come, and in hell eternal, I should not wonder that ye were unmoved
          by such a thought as this. But if ye believe what your Saviour said
          when he declared that he would destroy both body and soul in hell, I
          must wonder that ye could endure the thought without weeping for your
          fellow-creatures who are going there. If I saw mine enemy marching
          into the flames, I would rush between him and the fire and seek to
          preserve him; and will you see men and women marching on in a mad
          career of vice and sin, well aware that "the wages of sin is death,"
          and will you not interpose so much as a tear? What! are you more
          brutal than the beast, more stolid than the stone! It must be so, if
          the thought of the unutterable torment of hell, doth not draw tears
          from your eyes and prayer from your hearts. Oh, if to-day some strong
          archangel could unbolt the gates of hell, and for a solitary second
          permit the voice of wailing and weeping to come up to our ears; Oh,
          how should we grieve! Each man would put his hand upon his loins and
          walk this earth in terror. That shriek might make each hair stand on
          an end upon our heads, and then make us roll ourselves in the dust for
          anguish and woe --
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, doleful state of dark despair,</p>
        <p>When God has far removed,</p>
        <p>And fixed their dreadful station where</p>
        <p>They must not taste his love."</p>
        <p>
          Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I
          might weep for some of you that are going there this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, again, O Christian, that those for whom we ask you to weep
          this day are persons who have had great privileges, and consequently,
          if lost, must expect greater punishment. I do not to-day ask your
          sympathies for men in foreign lands, I shall not bid you weep for
          Hottentots or Mahomedans though ye might weep for them, and ye have
          goodly cause to do so -- but I ask this day your tears for the slain
          of the daughter of your own people. Oh! what multitudes of heathens we
          have in all our places of worship! what multitudes of unconverted
          persons in all the pews of the places where we usually assemble to
          worship God; and I may add, what hundreds we have here who are without
          God, without Christ, without hope in the world. And these are not like
          Hottentots who have not heard the Word: they have heard it, and they
          have rejected it. Many of you, when you die, cannot plead, as an
          excuse, that you did not know your duty; you heard it plainly preached
          to you, you heard it in every corner of the streets, you had the book
          of God in your houses. You cannot say that you did not know what you
          must do to be saved. You read the Bible, you understand salvation --
          many of you are deeply taught in the theory of salvation; when ye
          perish, your blood must be on your own head, and the Master may well
          cry over you to-day, "Woe unto thee, Bethsaida, woe unto thee
          Chorazin! For if the mighty works that were done in thee, had been
          done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth
          and ashes." I wonder at myself this day; I hate my eyes, I feel as if
          I could pluck them from their sockets now, because they will not weep
          as I desire, over poor souls who are perishing! How many have I among
          you whom I love and who love me! We are no strangers to one another,
          we could not live at a distance from each other, our hearts have been
          joined together long and firmly. Ye have stood by me in the hour of
          tribulation, ye have listened to the Word, ye have been pleased with
          it; I bear you witness that if you could pluck out your eyes for me
          you would do it. And yet I know there are many of you true lovers of
          God's Word in appearance, and certainly great lovers of God's servant,
          but alas for you, that you should still be in the gall of bitterness
          and in the bonds of iniquity! Alas, my sister, I can weep for thee!
          Woe, woe, my brother, I can weep for thee! we have met together in
          God's house, we have prayed together, and yet we must be sundered.
          Shepherd, some of thy flock will perish! O sheep of my pasture, people
          of my care, must I have that horrid thought upon me, that I must lose
          you? Must we, at the day of judgment, say farewell for ever? Must I
          bear my witness against you? I shall be honest; I have dealt
          faithfully with your souls. God is my witness, I have often preached
          in weakness; often have I had to groan before him that I have not
          preached as I could desire; but I have never preached insincerely.
          Nobody will ever dare to accuse me of dishonesty in this respect; not
          one of your smiles have I ever courted. I have never dreaded your
          frowns; I have been in weariness oftentimes, when I should have
          rested, preaching God's Word. But what of that? That were nothing;
          only this much, there is some responsibility resting upon you. And
          remember, that to perish under the sound of the Gospel is to perish
          more terribly than anywhere else. But, my hearers, must that be your
          lot? And must I be witness against you in the day of judgment? I pray
          God it may not be so; I beseech the Master, that he may spare us each
          such a fate as that.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, dear friends I have one word to add before I leave this
          point. Some of you need not look round on this congregation to find
          cause for weeping. My pious brethren and sisters, you have cause
          enough to weep in your own families. Ah, mother! I know thy griefs;
          thou hast had cause to cry to God with weeping eyes for many a
          mournful hour, because of thy son; thine offspring hath turned against
          thee; and he that came forth of thee has despised his mother's God.
          Father, thou hast carefully brought up thy daughter; thou has
          nourished her when she was young, and taken her fondly in thine arms;
          she was the delight of thy life, yet she hath sinned against thee and
          against God. Many of you have sons and daughters that you often
          mention in your prayers, but never with hope. You have often thought
          that God has said of your son, "Ephraim is given to idols; let him
          alone;" the child of your affection has become an adder stinging your
          heart! Oh, then weep, I beseech you. Parents, do not leave off weeping
          for your children; do not become hardened towards them, sinners though
          they be; it may be that God may yet bring them to himself. It was but
          last church meeting that we received into our communion a young friend
          who was educated and brought up by a pious minister in Colchester. She
          had been there many years, and when she came away to London the
          minister said to her, "Now, my girl, I have prayed for you hundreds of
          times, and I have done all I can with you; your heart is as hard as a
          stone; I must leave you with God!" That broke her heart; she is now
          converted to Jesus. How many sons and daughters have made their
          parents feel the same! "There," they have said, "I must leave you, I
          cannot do more." But in saying that, they have not meant that they
          would leave them unwept for, but they have thought within themselves,
          that if they were damned, they would follow them weeping to the very
          gates of hell, if by tears they could decoy them into heaven. How can
          a man be a Christian, and not love his offspring? How can a man be a
          believer in Jesus Christ, and yet have a cold and hard heart in the
          things of the kingdom, towards his children? I have heard of ministers
          of a certain sect, and professors of a certain class, who have
          despised family prayer, who have laughed at family godliness and
          thought nothing of it. I cannot understand how the men can know as
          much as they do about the gospel, and yet have so little of the spirit
          of it. I pray God, deliver you and deliver me from anything like that.
          No, it is our business to train up our children in the fear of the
          Lord; and though we cannot give them grace, it is ours to pray to the
          God who can give it; and in answer to our many supplications, he will
          not turn us away, but he will be pleased to take notice of our prayers
          and to regard our sighs.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, Christian mourners, I have given you work enough; may God the
          Holy Spirit enable you to do it. Let me exhort you, yet once again, to
          weep. Do you need a copy? Behold your Master; he has come to the brow
          of the hill; he sees Jerusalem lying on the hill opposite to him, he
          looks down upon it, as he sees it there -- beautiful for situation,
          the joy of the whole earth -- instead of feeling the rapture of some
          artist who surveys the ramparts of a strong city, and marks the
          position of some magnificent tower in the midst of glorious scenery,
          he bursts out and he cries, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem I how often would
          I have gathered thy children together as a hen gathereth her chickens
          under her wings, but ye would not. Behold, your house is left unto you
          desolate." Go ye now your ways, and as ye stand on any of the hills
          around, and beheld this Behemoth city! lying in the valley, say; "O
          London, London! how great thy guilt. Oh! that the Master would gather
          thee under his wing, and make thee his city, the joy of the whole
          earth! O London, London! full of privileges, and full of sin, exalted
          to heaven by the gospel, thou shalt be cast down to hell by thy
          rejection of it!" And then, when ye have wept over London, go and weep
          over the street in which you live, as you see the sabbath broken, and
          God's laws trampled upon, and men's bodies profaned -- go ye and weep!
          Weep, for the court in which you live in your humble poverty, weep for
          the square in which you live in your magnificent wealth; weep for the
          humbler street in which you live in competence, weep for your
          neighbors and your friends, lest any of them, having lived godless,
          may die godless! Then go to your house, weep for your family, for your
          servants, for your husband, for your wife, for your children. Weep,
          weep, cease not weeping, till God hath renewed them by his Spirit. And
          if you have any friends with whom you sinned in your past life, be
          earnest for their salvation. George Whitfield said there were many
          young men with whom he played at cards, in his lifetime, and spent
          hours in wasting his time when he ought to have been about other
          business; and when he was converted, his first thought was," I must by
          God's grace have these converted too." And he never rested, till he
          could say, that he did not know of one of them, a companion of his
          guilt, who was not now a companion with him in the tribulation of the
          gospel. Oh, let it be so with you! Nor let your exertions end in
          tears; mere weeping will do nothing without action. Get you on your
          feet, ye that have voices and might, go forth and preach the gospel,
          preach it in every street and lane of this huge city; ye that have
          wealth, go forth and spend it for the poor, and sick, and needy, and
          dying, the uneducated, the unenlightened; ye that have time, go forth
          and spend it in deeds of goodness; ye that have power in prayer, go
          forth and pray, ye that can handle the pen, go forth and write down
          iniquity -- every one to his post, every one of you to your gun in
          this day of battle, now for God and for his truth; for God and for the
          right; let every one of us why knows the Lord seek to fight under his
          banner! O God, without whom all our exertions are vain, come now and
          stir up thy church to greater diligence and more affectionate
          earnestness, that we may not have in future such cause to weep as we
          have this day! Sinners, believe on the Lord Jesus; he hath died, look
          to him and live, and God the Almighty bless you! To God the Father,
          Son, and Holy Ghost, be glory for ever and ever.
