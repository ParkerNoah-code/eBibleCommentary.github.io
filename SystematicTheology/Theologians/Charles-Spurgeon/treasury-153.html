<p align="center">PSALM 147 <br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify"></p></b></font>SUBJECT. This is a specially remarkable song. 
    In it the greatness and the condescending goodness of the Lord are 
    celebrated. The God of Israel is set forth in his peculiarity of glory as 
    caring for the sorrowing, the insignificant, and forgotten. The poet finds a 
    singular joy in extolling one who is so singularly gracious. It is a Psalm 
    of the city and of the field, of the first and the second creations, of the 
    commonwealth and of the church. It is good and pleasant throughout.
<p align="justify">DIVISION. The, song appears to divide itself into three 
    portions. </p>
<p align="justify">From verses 1-6, Jehovah is extolled for building up 
    Zion, and blessing his mourners.</p>
<p align="justify">From verses 7-11, the like praise is given because of his 
    provision for the lowly, and his pleasure in them.</p>
<p align="justify">From verses 12-20, he is magnified for his work on behalf 
    of his people, and the power of his word in nature and in grace. </p>
<p align="justify">Let it be studied with joyful gratitude.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. Praise the Lord</p></b>, or <i>Hallelujah</i>. The 
    flow of the broad river of the Book of Psalms ends in a cataract of praise. 
    The present Psalm begins and ends with Hallelujah. Jehovah and happy praise 
    should ever be associated in the mind of a believer. Jove was dreaded, but 
    Jehovah is beloved. To one and all of the true seed of Israel the Psalmist 
    acts as choirmaster, and cries, "Praise the Lord." Such an exhortation may 
    fitly be addressed to all those who owe anything to the favor of God; and 
    which of us does not? Pay him we cannot, but praise him we will, not only 
    now, but forever.
<b>
<p align="justify">For it is good to sing praises unto our God.</p></b> It is 
    good because it is right; good because it is acceptable with God, beneficial 
    to ourselves, and stimulating to our fellows. The goodness of an exercise is 
    good argument with godly men for its continual practice. <i>Singing the 
    divine praises is the best possible use of speech: </i>it speaks of God, for 
    God, and to God, and it does this in a joyful and reverent manner. Singing 
    in the heart is good, but singing with heart and voice is better, for it 
    allows others to join with us. Jehovah is our God, our covenant God, 
    therefore let him have the homage of our praise; and he is so gracious and 
    happy a God that our praise may best be expressed in joyful song.
<b>
<p align="justify">For it is pleasant; and praise is lovely. </p></b>It is 
    pleasant and proper, sweet and suitable to laud the Lord Most High. It is 
    refreshing to the taste of the truly refined mind, and it is agreeable to 
    the eye of the pure in heart. It is delightful both to hear and to see a 
    whole assembly praising the Lord. 
<p align="justify">These are arguments for song service which men who love 
    true piety, real pleasure, and strict propriety will not despise. Please to 
    praise, for praise is pleasant. Praise the Lord in the beauty of holiness, 
    for praise is lovely. Where duty and delight, benefit and beauty unite—we 
    ought not to be backward. Let each reader feel that he and his family ought 
    to constitute a choir for the daily celebration of the praises of the Lord.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. The Lord builds up Jerusalem. </p></b>God appears 
    both in the material and spiritual world as a Builder and Maker, and therein 
    he is to be praised. His grace, wisdom, and power are all seen in the 
    formation and establishment of the chosen seat of his worship; once a city 
    with material walls, but now a church composed of spiritual stones. The Jews 
    rejoiced in the uprising of their capital from its ruins, and we triumph in 
    the growth of the church from among a godless world. 
<b>
<p align="justify">He gathers together the outcasts of Israel</p></b>; and thus 
    he repairs the waste places, and causes the former desolations to be 
    inhabited. This sentence may relate to Nehemiah and those who returned with 
    him; but there is no reason why it should not with equal fitness be referred 
    to David, who, with his friends, was once an outcast, but before long became 
    the means of building up Jerusalem. 
<p align="justify">In any case, the Psalmist ascribes to Jehovah all the 
    blessings enjoyed; the restoration of the city and the restoration of the 
    banished he equally traces to the divine hand. <i>How clearly these ancient 
    believers saw the Lord present, working among them and for them!</i> </p>
<p align="justify">Spiritually we see the hand of God in the edification of 
    the church, and in the ingathering of sinners. What are men under conviction 
    of sin but outcasts from God, from holiness, from Heaven, and even from 
    hope? Who could gather them from their dispersions, and make citizens of 
    them in Christ Jesus, save the Lord our God? This deed of love and power he 
    is constantly performing. Therefore let the song begin at Jerusalem our 
    home, and let every living stone in the spiritual city echo the strain; for 
    it is the Lord who has brought again his banished ones, and built them 
    together in Zion.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their 
    wounds. </p></b>This the Holy Spirit mentions as a part of the glory of God, and 
    a reason for our declaring his praise: the Lord is not only a Builder, but a 
    Healer; he restores broken hearts as well as broken walls. 
<p align="justify">The kings of the earth think to be great through their 
    loftiness; but Jehovah becomes really so by his condescension. Behold, the 
    Most High has to do with the sick and the sorry, with the wretched and the 
    wounded! He walks the hospitals as the good Physician! His deep sympathy 
    with mourners is a special mark of his goodness. Few will associate with the 
    despondent, but Jehovah chooses their company, and abides with them until he 
    has healed them by his comforts. </p>
<p align="justify">He deigns to handle and heal broken hearts—he himself 
    lays on the ointment of grace, and the soft bandages of love, and thus binds 
    up the bleeding wounds of those convinced of sin. This is compassion like a 
    God. Well may those praise him to whom he has acted so gracious a part. </p>
<p align="justify">The Lord is always healing and binding: this is no new 
    work to him, he has done it of old; and it is not a thing of the past of 
    which he is now weary, for he is still healing and still binding, as the 
    original has it.</p>
<p align="justify">Come, broken hearts, come to the Physician who never 
    fails to heal—uncover your wounds to him who so tenderly binds them up!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. He counts the number of the stars. </p></b>None but 
    he can count the mighty host, but as he <i>made </i>them and <i>sustains </i>
    them, he can <i>number </i>them. To Jehovah stars are as mere coins, which 
    the merchant counts as he puts them into his bag. 
<b>
<p align="justify">He calls them all by their names. </p></b>He has an intimate 
    acquaintance with each separate orb, so as to know its name or character. 
    Indeed, he gives to each its appropriate title, because he knows its 
    constitution and nature. <i>Vast as these stars are, they are perfectly 
    obedient to his bidding</i>; even as soldiers to a captain who calls their 
    names, and allots them their stations. <i>Do they not rise, and set, and 
    move, or stand, precisely according to his order? 
</i>
<p align="justify">What a change is here from the preceding verse! Read the 
    two without a break, and feel the full force of the contrast. From <i>stars
    </i>to <i>sighs </i>is a deep descent! From <i>worlds </i>to <i>wounds </i>
    is a distance which only infinite compassion can bridge. Yet he who acts a 
    surgeon's part with wounded hearts, also marshals the heavenly host, and 
    reads the muster roll of suns and their majestic systems. <i>O Lord, it is 
    good to praise you as ruling the stars, but it is pleasant to adore you as 
    healing the broken in heart!</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. Great is our Lord. </p></b>Our Lord and King is 
    great—magnanimous, infinite, inconceivably glorious. None can describe his 
    majesty, or reckon up the number of his excellencies.
<b>
<p align="justify">And of great power.</p></b> Doing as he wills, and willing to 
    do mighty deeds. His acts reveal something of his might, but the mass of his 
    power is hidden, for all things are possible with God, even the things 
    impossible with men. 
<b>
<p align="justify">His understanding is infinite.</p></b> There is no fathoming 
    his wisdom, or measuring his knowledge. He is infinite in existence, in 
    power, and in knowledge; as these three phrases plainly teach us. The gods 
    of the heathen are nothing, but our God fills all things. 
<p align="justify">And yet how condescending! For this is he who so tenderly 
    nurses sick souls, and waits to be gracious to sinful men. He brings his 
    boundless power and infinite understanding to bear upon human distress for 
    its assuagement and sanctification. For all these reasons let his praise be 
    great: even could it be infinite, it would not exceed his due. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">In the building of his church and the salvation of souls, 
    his greatness, power, and wisdom are all displayed</p></i>, let him be extolled 
    because of each of these attributes.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. The LORD lifts up the meek: he casts the wicked 
    down to the ground.</p></b> He reverses the evil order of things. The meek are 
    down, and he lifts them up; the wicked are exalted, and he hurls them down 
    to the dust.<i> The Lord loves those who are reverent to himself, humble in 
    their own eyes, and gentle to their fellow men</i>; these he lifts up to 
    hope, to peace, to power, to eternal honor. When God lifts a man, it is a 
    lift indeed. 
<p align="justify">Proud men are in their own esteem, high enough already; 
    only those who are lowly will care to be lifted up, and only such will 
    Jehovah upraise. </p>
<p align="justify">As for the <i>wicked</i>, they must come down from their 
    seats of vain glory. God is accustomed to overthrow such; it is his way and 
    habit. None of the wicked shall in the end escape. To the earth they must 
    go; for from the earth they <i>came</i>, and for the earth they <i>live</i>. 
    It is one of the glories of our God for which his saints praise him, that he 
    has put down the mighty from their seats, and has exalted them of low 
    degree. Well may the righteous be lifted up in spirit and the wicked be 
    downcast, as they think of the judgments of the Lord God. </p>
<p align="justify">In this verse we see the practical outcome of that 
    character of Jehovah which leads him to count and call the stars as if they 
    were little things, while he deals tenderly with sorrowful men, as if they 
    were precious in his esteem. <i>He is so great that nothing is great to him, 
    and he is so condescending that nothing is little to him! </i>His infinite 
    majesty thus naturally brings low the lofty and exalts the lowly.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7.</p></b> In this paragraph the contrast announced in 
    the former section is enlarged upon from another point of view, namely, as 
    it is seen in <i>nature </i>and in <i>providence</i>. <b>Sing unto the LORD 
    with thanksgiving</b>; or rather, "respond to Jehovah." <i>He speaks to us 
    in his works, let us answer him with our thanks. </i>All that he does is 
    gracious, every movement of his hand is goodness; therefore let our hearts 
    reply with gratitude, and our lips with song.<i> Our lives should be 
    responses to divine love. Jehovah is ever engaged in giving, let us respond 
    with thanksgiving.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Sing praise upon the harp unto our God.</p></b> Blend music 
    with song. Under a dispensation of ritual the use of music was most 
    commendable, and suitable in the great congregation: those of us who judge 
    it to be less desirable for public worship, under a spiritual economy, 
    because it has led to so many abuses, nevertheless rejoice in it in our 
    privacy, and are by no means insensible to its charms.
<p align="justify">It seems profanation that choice music should so often be 
    devoted to unworthy themes: the sweetest harmonies should be consecrated to 
    the honor of the Lord. He is our God, and this fact is one choice joy of the 
    sing. <i>We have chosen him, because he has chosen us; </i>and we see in him 
    peculiarities which distinguish him from all the pretended deities of those 
    among whom we dwell. He is our God in covenant relationship forever and 
    ever, and to him be praise in every possible form!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. Who covers the heavens with clouds.</p></b> He works 
    in all things, above as well as below. Clouds are not caused by accident, 
    but produced by God himself, and made to assume degrees of density by which 
    the blue firmament is hidden. A sky-scape might seem to be a mere fortuitous 
    concourse of vapors, but it is not so: the Great Artist's hand thus covers 
    the canvas of the heavens. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Who prepares rain for the earth.</p></b> The Lord prepares 
    clouds with a view to rain, and rain with an eye to the fields below. By 
    many concurrent circumstances all things are made ready for the production 
    of a shower; there is more of art in the formation of a rain cloud and in 
    the fashioning of a rain drop, than appears to superficial observers. God is 
    in the vapor, and in the pearly drop which is born of it. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Who makes grass to grow upon the mountains.</p></b> By the 
    far reaching shower he produces vegetation where the hand of man is all 
    unknown. He cares not only for Goshen's fertile plains, but for Carmel's 
    steep ascents. God makes the heavens the servants of the earth, and the 
    clouds the irrigators of the mountain meadows. This is a kind of evolution 
    about which there can be no dispute. 
<p align="justify">Nor does the Lord forget the waste and desolate places, 
    but causes the lone hills to be the first partakers of his refreshing 
    visitations. </p>
<p align="justify">This is after the manner of our God. He not only causes 
    rain to descend from the heavens to water the grass, and thus unites the 
    skies and the herbs by a ministry of mercy; but he also thinks of the rocky 
    ledges among the hills, and forgets not the pastures of the wilderness.<i> 
    What a God is this!</i></p>

<p align="justify">"Passing by the rich and great,<br/>
 For the poor and desolate."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. He gives to the beast his food. </p></b>By causing 
    the grass to grow on the hills, the Lord feeds the cattle. God cares for the 
    brute creation. <i>Men tread grass under foot as though it were nothing, but 
    God causes it to grow. </i>Too often men treat their cattle with cruelty, 
    but the Lord himself feeds them. The great God is too good, and, indeed, too 
    great to overlook things that are despised by men. 
<p align="justify">Say not, "Does God care for oxen?" Indeed he does, and he 
    permits himself to be here described as giving them their food as gardeners 
    are accustomed to do. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And to the young ravens which cry. </p></b>These wild 
    creatures, which seem to be of no use to man; are they therefore worthless? 
    By no means; they fill their place in the economy of nature. When they are 
    mere fledglings, and can only clamor to the parent birds for food, the Lord 
    does not allow them to starve, but supplies their needs. 
<p align="justify">Is it not wonderful how such numbers of little birds are 
    fed! A bird in a cage under human care is in more danger of lacking seed and 
    water than any one of the myriads that fly in the open heavens, with no <i>
    owner </i>but their Creator, and no <i>provider </i>but the Lord. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Greatness occupied with little things makes up a chief 
    feature of this Psalm. </p></i>Ought we not all to feel special joy in praising 
    One who is so specially remarkable for his care of the needy and the 
    forgotten? Ought we not also to trust in the Lord? For he who feeds the the 
    ravens will surely nourish his own redeemed people! Hallelujah to Him who 
    both feeds the ravens and rules the stars! What a God are you, O Jehovah!
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. He delights not in the strength of the horse.</p></b> 
    Not to great and strong animals does the Creator in any measure direct his 
    special thought; but in lesser living things he has equal pleasure. If man 
    could act the Creator's part, he would take peculiar delight in producing 
    noble quadrupeds like horses, whose strength and speed would reflect honor 
    upon their maker. But Jehovah has no such feeling; he cares as much for 
    helpless birds in the nest, as for the war-horse in the pride of its power.
    
<b>
<p align="justify">He takes not pleasure in the legs of a man.</p></b> These are 
    the athlete's glory, but God has no pleasure in them. Not the strengths of 
    the creature, but rather its weakness and necessity, win the regard of our 
    God. Monarchs trust in their cavalry and infantry; but the King of kings 
    exults not in the hosts of his creatures as though they could lend power to 
    him. Physical or material greatness and power are of no account with 
    Jehovah; he has respect to other and more precious qualities. Men who boast 
    in the valor of gigantic might, will not find themselves the favorites of 
    God: though earthly princes may feast their eyes upon their Joabs and their 
    Abners, their Abishais and Asahels—the Lord Almighty has no pleasure in mere 
    bone and muscle. Sinews and muscles are of small account, either in horses 
    or in men, with Him who is a spirit, and delights most in spiritual things.
    
<p align="justify">The expression of the text may be viewed as including all 
    creature power, even of a mental or moral kind. God does not take pleasure 
    in us because of our attainments, or potentialities. He respects <i>
    character </i>rather than <i>capacity</i>.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. The LORD takes pleasure in those who fear him; 
    in those who hope in his mercy. </p></b>While the bodily powers give no delight 
    to God, spiritual qualities are his delight. He cares most for those 
    emotions which center in himself: the fear which he approves is <i>fear of 
    him</i>, and the hope which he accepts is <i>hope in his mercy</i>. 
<p align="justify">It is a striking thought that God should not only be at 
    peace with some kinds of men, but even find a solace and a joy in their 
    company.<i> Oh! the matchless condescension of the Lord, that his greatness 
    should take pleasure in the insignificant creatures of his hand</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">Who are these favored men in whom Jehovah takes pleasure? 
    Some of them are the least in his family, who have never risen beyond hoping 
    and fearing. Others of them are more fully developed, but still they exhibit 
    a blended character composed of fear and hope: <i>they fear God with holy 
    awe and filial reverence, and they also hope for forgiveness and blessedness 
    because of the divine mercy</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">As a father takes pleasure in his own children, so does 
    the Lord solace himself in his own beloved ones, whose marks of new birth 
    are fear and hope. </p>
<p align="justify">They fear, for they are sinners. </p>
<p align="justify">They hope, for God is merciful. </p>
<p align="justify">They fear him, for he is great. </p>
<p align="justify">They hope in him, for he is good. </p>
<p align="justify">Their fear sobers their hope. </p>
<p align="justify">Their hope brightens their fear.</p>
<p align="justify">God takes pleasure in both their <i>trembling </i>and in 
    their <i>rejoicing</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">Is there not rich cause for praise in this special 
    feature of the divine character? After all, it is a poor nature which is 
    delighted with brute force. It is a diviner thing to take pleasure in the 
    holy character of those around us. </p>
<p align="justify">As men may be known by the nature of the things which 
    give them pleasure, so is the Lord known by the blessed fact that he takes 
    pleasure in the righteous, even though that righteousness is as yet in its 
    initial stage of fear and hope.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise your God, 
    O Zion. </p></b>How the poet insists upon praise: he cries <i>praise, praise</i>, 
    as if it were the most important of all duties. A peculiar people should 
    render peculiar praise. 
<p align="justify">The city of peace should be the city of praise; and the 
    temple of the covenant God should resound with his glories. If nowhere 
    else—yet certainly in Zion there should be joyful adoration of Zion's God.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Note, that we are to praise the Lord in our own houses in 
    Jerusalem, as well as in his own house in Zion. The holy city surrounds the 
    holy hill, and both are dedicated to the holy God, therefore both should 
    ring with hallelujahs.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. For he has strengthened the bars of your gates.</p></b> 
    Her fortifications were finished, even to the fastenings of the gates, and 
    God had made all sound and strong, even to her bolts and bars: thus her 
    security against invading foes was guaranteed. This is no small mercy. 
<i>
<p align="justify">Oh, that our churches were thus preserved from all false 
    doctrine and unholy living! </p></i>This must be the Lord's doing; and where he 
    has wrought it his name is greatly to be praised. 
<p align="justify">Modern libertines would tear down all gates and abolish 
    all bars. But not so with the godly, because of the fear of the Lord. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">He has blessed your children within you.</p></b> <i>Internal 
    happiness is as truly the Lord's gift as external security</i>. When the 
    Lord blesses "your sons in the midst of you", you are, O Zion, filled with a 
    happy, united, zealous, prosperous, holy people, who dwell in communion with 
    God, and enter into the joy of their Lord. When God makes your walls 
    salvation, your gates must be praise. It would little avail to fortify a 
    wretched, starving city; but when the walls are strengthened, it is a still 
    greater joy to see that the inhabitants are blessed with all good gifts. How 
    much our churches need a present and abiding blessing.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14. He makes peace in your borders.</p></b> Even to the 
    boundaries quiet extends; no enemies are wrangling with the borderers. If 
    there is peace there, we may be sure that peace is everywhere. "When a man's 
    ways please the Lord, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him."<i> 
    Peace is from the God of peace</i>. 
<p align="justify">Considering the differing constitutions, conditions, 
    tastes, and opinions of men—it is a work of God when in large churches 
    unbroken peace is found year after year. And it is an equal wonder if 
    worldlings, instead of persecuting the godly, treat them with marked 
    respect. He who <i>builds </i>Zion is also her Peacemaker, the Lord and 
    Giver of peace.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And fills you with the finest of the wheat.</p></b> Peace is 
    attended with plenty—plenty of the best food, and of the best sort of that 
    food. It is a great reason for thanksgiving when men's wants are so supplied 
    that they are filled. It takes much to fill some men. Perhaps none ever are 
    filled but the inhabitants of Zion; and they are only to be filled by the 
    Lord himself. 
<p align="justify">Gospel truth is the finest of the wheat, and those are 
    indeed blessed who are content to be filled therewith, and are not hungering 
    after the husks of the world. Let those who are filled with heavenly food, 
    fill their mouths with heavenly praise.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 15. He sends forth his commandment upon earth.</p></b> 
    His messages fly throughout his dominions: upon earth his warrants are 
    executed as well as in Heaven. From his church his word goes forth; from 
    Zion he missions the nations with the word of life. His word runs very 
    swiftly.<i> His purposes of love are speedily accomplished. 
</i>
<p align="justify">Oriental monarchs labored hard to establish rapid postal 
    communication. But the desire, will, and command of the Lord flash in an 
    instant from pole to pole, yes, from Heaven to earth. We who dwell in the 
    center of the Lord's dominions may exceedingly rejoice that to the utmost 
    extremity of the realm, the divine commandment speeds with sure result, and 
    is not hindered by distance or time. </p>
<p align="justify">The Lord can deliver his people right speedily, or send 
    them supplies immediately from his courts above. </p>
<p align="justify">God's commands in nature and providence are fiats against 
    which no opposition is ever raised—to effect which all things rush onward 
    with alacrity. The expressions in the text are so distinctly in the present 
    that they are meant to teach us the present mission and efficiency of the 
    word of the Lord, and thus to prompt us to present praise.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 16.</p></b> Here follow instances of the power of God 
    upon the natural elements. 
<b>
<p align="justify">He gives snow like wool. </p></b>As a gift he scatters the 
    snow, which falls in flakes like fleecy wool. Snow falls softly, covers 
    universally, and clothes warmly—even as wool covers the sheep. 
<p align="justify">The most evident resemblance lies in the whiteness of the 
    two substances; but many other likenesses are to be seen by the observant 
    eye. It is wise to see God in winter and in distress, as well as in summer 
    and prosperity. He who one day feeds us with the finest of the wheat, at 
    another time robes us in snow. He is the same God in each case, and each 
    form of his operation bestows a gift on men.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">He scatters the hoarfrost like ashes.</p></b> Here again the 
    Psalmist sees God directly and personally at work. As ashes powder the earth 
    when men are burning up the noxious herbage; and as when men cast ashes into 
    the air they cause a singular sort of whiteness in the places where they 
    fall, so also does the frost. 
<p align="justify">The country people talk of a black frost and a white 
    frost, and the same thing may be said of ashes, for they are both black and 
    white. Moreover, excessive cold burns as effectually as great heat, and 
    hence there is an inner as well as an outer likeness between hoarfrost and 
    ashes. </p>
<p align="justify">Let us praise the Lord who condescends to wing each flake 
    of snow and scatter each particle of frost. Ours is no absent or inactive 
    deity: he works all things, and is everywhere at home.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 17. He casts forth his ice like morsels.</p></b> Such 
    are the crumbs of hail which he casts forth, or the crusts of ice which he 
    creates upon the waters. These morsels are his ice, and he casts them 
    abroad. 
<p align="justify">The two expressions indicate a very real presence of God 
    in the phenomena of nature. Who can stand before his cold? None can resist 
    the utmost rigors of cold any more than they can bear the vehemence of heat. 
    God's withdrawals of light are a darkness that may be felt, and <i>his 
    withdrawals of heat are a cold which is absolutely omnipotent</i>. If the 
    Lord, instead of revealing himself as a fire, should adopt the opposite 
    manifestation of cold—he would, in either case, consume us should he put 
    forth all his power. </p>
<p align="justify">It is ours to submit to deprivations with patience, 
    seeing the cold is <i>his cold</i>. That which God sends, whether it be heat 
    or cold, no man can defy with impunity, but he is happy who bows before it 
    with childlike submission. When we cannot stand before God we will gladly 
    lie at his feet, or nestle under his wings.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 18. He sends out his word, and melts them.</p></b> When 
    the frost is sharpest, and the ice is hardest, the Lord intervenes; and 
    though he does no more than send his word—yet the rocks of ice are dissolved 
    at once, and the huge icebergs begin to float into the southern seas. The 
    phenomena of winter are not so abundant in Palestine as with us—yet they are 
    witnessed sufficiently to cause the devout to bless God for the return of 
    spring. 
<p align="justify">At the will of God snow, hoarfrost, and ice disappear, 
    and the time of the opening bud and the singing of birds has come. For this 
    let us praise the Lord as we sun ourselves amid the spring flowers. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">He causes his wind to blow, and the waters flow. </p></b>The 
    Lord is the great first cause of everything; even the fickle, wandering 
    winds are caused by him. 
<p align="justify">Natural laws are in themselves mere inoperative rules, 
    but the power emanates directly from the Ever-present and Ever-potent One. 
    The soft gales from the south, which bring a general thaw, are from the 
    Lord—as are those wintry blasts which bound the streams in icy bonds. Simple 
    but effectual are the methods of Jehovah in the natural world; equally so 
    are those which he employs in the spiritual kingdom; for <i>the breath of 
    his Holy Spirit breathes upon frozen hearts, and streams of penitence and 
    love gush forth at once. </i></p>

<p align="justify">Observe how in these two sentences the <i>word </i>and 
    the <i>wind </i>go together in nature. They attend each other in grace; the 
    gospel and the Holy Spirit cooperate in salvation. The truth which the 
    Spirit breathed into prophets and apostles, he breathes into dead souls, and 
    they are quickened into spiritual life.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 19. He shows his word unto Jacob, his statutes and 
    his judgments unto Israel. </p></b>He who is the <i>Creator </i>is also the <i>
    Revealer</i>. We are to praise the Lord above all things for his manifesting 
    himself to us as he does not unto the world. Whatever part of his mind he 
    discloses to us, whether it be a word of instruction, a statute of 
    direction, or a judgment of government, we are bound to bless the Lord for 
    it. 
<p align="justify">He who causes summer to come in the place of winter, has 
    also removed the coldness and death from our hearts by the power of his 
    word, and this is abundant cause for singing unto his name. As Jacob's seed 
    of old were made to know the Lord, even so are we in these latter days; why, 
    let his name be magnified among us. By that knowledge Jacob is ennobled into 
    Israel, and therefore let him who is made a prevailing prince in prayer be 
    also a chief musician in praise. </p>
<p align="justify">The elect people were bound to sing hallelujahs to their 
    own God. Why were they so specially favored if they did not, above all 
    others, tell forth the glory of their God?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 20. He has not dealt so with any nation.</p></b> Israel 
    had clear and exclusive knowledge of God, while others were left in 
    ignorance. Election is the loudest call for grateful adoration. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And as for his judgments, they have not known them. </p></b>
    The nations were covered with darkness, and only Israel sat in the light. 
    This was <i>sovereign grace </i>in its fullest noontide of power. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Praise the Lord.</p></b> When we have mentioned electing, 
    distinguishing love, our praise can rise no higher, and therefore we close 
    with one more <i>hallelujah</i>.
