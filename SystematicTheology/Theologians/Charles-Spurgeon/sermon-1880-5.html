          MAY GOD THE HOLY GHOST guide our meditations to the best practical
          result this evening, that sinners may be saved and saints stirred up
          to diligence. I do not intend to treat my text controversially. It is
          like the stone which makes the corner of a building, and it looks
          towards a different side of the gospel from that which is mostly
          before us. Two sides of the building of truth meet here. In many a
          village there is a corner where the idle and the quarrelsome gather
          together; and theology has such corners. It would be very easy indeed
          to set ourselves in battle array, and during the next half-hour to
          carry on a very fierce attack against those who differ from us in
          opinion upon points which could be raised from this text. I do not see
          that any good would come of it, and, as we have very little time to
          spare, and life is short, we had better spend it upon something that
          may better tend to our edification. May the good Spirit preserve us
          from a contentious spirit, and help us really to profit by his word.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is quite certain that when we read that God will have all men to be
          saved it does not mean that he wills it with the force of a decree or
          a divine purpose, for, if he did, then all men would be saved. He
          willed to make the world, and the world was made: he does not so will
          the salvation of all men, for we know that all men will not be saved.
          Terrible as the truth is, yet is it certain from holy writ that there
          are men who, in consequence of their sin and their rejection of the
          Savior, will go away into everlasting punishment, where shall be
          weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth. There will at the last be
          goats upon the left hand as well as sheep on the right, tares to be
          burned as well as wheat to be garnered, chaff to be blown away as well
          as corn to be preserved. There will be a dreadful hell as well as a
          glorious heaven, and there is no decree to the contrary.
        </p>
        <p>
          What then? Shall we try to put another meaning into the text than that
          which it fairly bears? I trow not. You must, most of you, be
          acquainted with the general method in which our older Calvinistic
          friends deal with this text. "All men," say they, -- "that is, some
          men": as if the Holy Ghost could not have said "some men" if he had
          meant some men. "All men," say they; "that is, some of all sorts of
          men": as if the Lord could not have said "all sorts of men" if he had
          meant that. The Holy Ghost by the apostle has written "all men," and
          unquestionably he means all men. I know how to get rid of the force of
          the "alls" according to that critical method which some time ago was
          very current, but I do not see how it can be applied here with due
          regard to truth. I was reading just now the exposition of a very able
          doctor who explains the text so as to explain it away; he applies
          grammatical gunpowder to it, and explodes it by way of expounding it.
          I thought when I read his exposition that it would have been a very
          capital comment upon the text if it had read, "Who will not have all
          men to be saved, nor come to a knowledge of the truth." Had such been
          the inspired language every remark of the learned doctor would have
          been exactly in keeping, but as it happens to say, "Who will have all
          men to be saved," his observations are more than a little out of
          place. My love of consistency with my own doctrinal views is not great
          enough to allow me knowingly to alter a single text of Scripture. I
          have great respect for orthodoxy, but my reverence for inspiration is
          far greater. I would sooner a hundred times over appear to be
          inconsistent with myself than be inconsistent with the word of God. I
          never thought it to be any very great crime to seem to be inconsistent
          with myself; for who am I that I should everlastingly be consistent?
          But I do think it a great crime to be so inconsistent with the word of
          God that I should want to lop away a bough or even a twig from so much
          as a single tree of the forest of Scripture. God forbid that I should
          cut or shape, even in the least degree, any divine expression. So runs
          the text, and so we must read it, "God our Savior; who will have all
          men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth."
        </p>
        <p>
          Does not the text mean that it is the wish of God that men should be
          saved? The word "wish" gives as much force to the original as it
          really requires, and the passage should run thus -- "whose wish it is
          that all men should be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth." As
          it is my wish that it should be so, as it is your wish that it might
          be so, so it is God's wish that all men should be saved; for,
          assuredly, he is not less benevolent than we are. Then comes the
          question, "But if he wishes it to be so, why does he not make it so? "
          Beloved friend, have you never heard that a fool may ask a question
          which a wise man cannot answer, and, if that be so, I am sure a wise
          person, like yourself, can ask me a great many questions which, fool
          as I am, I am yet not foolish enough to try to answer. Your question
          is only one form of the great debate of all the ages, -- "If God be
          infinitely good and powerful, why does not his power carry out to the
          full all his beneficence?" It is God's wish that the oppressed should
          go free, yet there are many oppressed who are not free. It is God's
          wish that the sick should not suffer. Do you doubt it? Is it not your
          own wish? And yet the Lord does not work a miracle to heal every sick
          person. It is God's wish that his creatures should be happy. Do you
          deny that? He does not interpose by any miraculous agency to make us
          all happy, and yet it would be wicked to suppose that he does not wish
          the happiness of all the creatures that he has made. He has an
          infinite benevolence which, nevertheless, is not in all points worked
          out by his infinite omnipotence; and if anybody asked me why it is
          not, I cannot tell. I have never set up to be an explainer of all
          difficulties, and I have no desire to do so. It is the same old
          question as that of the negro who said, "Sare, you say the devil makes
          sin in the world." "Yes, the devil makes a deal of sin." "And you say
          that God hates sin." "Yes." "Then why does not he kill the devil and
          put an end to it?" Just so. Why does he not? Ah, my black friend, you
          will grow white before that question is answered. I cannot tell you
          why God permits moral evil, neither can the ablest philosopher on
          earth, nor the highest angel in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is one of those things which we do not need to know. Have you
          never noticed that some people who are ill and are ordered to take
          pills are foolish enough to chew them? That is a very nauseous thing
          to do, though I have done it myself. The right way to take medicine of
          such a kind is to swallow it at once. In the same way there are some
          things in the Word of God which are undoubtedly true which must be
          swallowed at once by an effort of faith, and must not be chewed by
          perpetual questioning. You will soon have I know not what of doubt and
          difficulty and bitterness upon your soul if you must needs know the
          unknowable, and have reasons and explanations for the sublime and the
          mysterious. Let the difficult doctrines go down whole into your very
          soul, by a grand exercise of confidence in God.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thank God for a thousand things I cannot understand. When I cannot
          get to know the reason why, I say to myself, "Why should I know the
          reason why? Who am I, and what am I, that I should demand explanations
          of my God?" I am a most unreasonable being when I am most reasonable,
          and when my judgment is most accurate I dare not trust it. I had
          rather trust my God. I am a poor silly child at my very best: my
          Father must know better than I. An old parable-maker tells us that he
          shut himself up in his study because he had to work out a difficult
          problem. His little child came knocking at the door, and he said "Go
          away, John: you cannot understand what father is doing; let father
          alone." Master Johnny for that very reason felt that he must get in
          and see what father was doing -- a true symbol of our proud
          intellects; we must pry into forbidden things, and uncover that which
          is concealed. In a little time upon the sill, outside the window,
          stood Master Johnny, looking in through the window at his father; and
          if his father had not with the very tenderest care just taken him away
          from that very dangerous position, there would have been no Master
          Johnny left on the face of the earth to exercise his curiosity in
          dangerous elevations. Now, God sometimes shuts the door, and says, "My
          child, it is so: be content to believe." "But," we foolishly cry.
          "Lord, why is it so?" "It is so, my child," he says. "But why, Father,
          is it so?" "It is so, my child, believe me." Then we go speculating,
          climbing the ladders of reasoning, guessing, speculating, to reach the
          lofty windows of eternal truth. Once up there we do not know where we
          are, our heads reel, and we are in all kinds of uncertainty and
          spiritual peril. If we mind things too high for us we shall run great
          risks. I do not intend meddling with such lofty matters. There stands
          the text, and I believe that it is my Father's wish that "all men
          should be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth." But I know,
          also, that he does not will it, so that he will save any one of them,
          unless they believe in his dear Son; for he has told us over and over
          that he will not. He will not save any man except he forsakes his
          sins, and turns to him with full purpose of heart: that I also know.
          And I know, also, that he has a people whom he will save, whom by his
          eternal love he has chosen, and whom by his eternal power he will
          deliver. I do not know how that squares with this; that is another of
          the things I do not know. If I go on telling you of all that I do not
          know, and of all that I do know, I will warrant you that the things
          that I do not know will be a hundred to one of the things that I do
          know. And so we will say no more about the matter, but just go on to
          the more practical part of the text. God's wish about man's salvation
          is this, -- that men should be saved and come to the knowledge of the
          truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men are saved, and the same men that are saved come to a knowledge of
          the truth. The two things happen together, and the two facts very much
          depend upon each other. God's way of saving men is not by leaving them
          in ignorance. It is by a knowledge of the truth that men are saved;
          this will make the main body of our discourse, and in closing we shall
          see how this truth gives instruction to those who wish to be saved,
          and also to those who desire to save others. May the Holy Spirit make
          these closing inferences to be practically useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is our proposition: IT IS BY A KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH THAT MEN
          ARE SAVED.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe that stress is laid upon the article: it is the truth, and not
          every truth. Though it is a good thing to know the truth about
          anything, and we ought not to be satisfied to take up with a falsehood
          upon any point, yet it is not every truth that will save us. We are
          not saved by knowing any one theological truth we may choose to think
          of, for there are some theological truths which are comparatively of
          inferior value. They are not vital or essential, and a man may know
          them, and yet may not be saved. It is the truth which saves. Jesus
          Christ is the truth: the whole testimony of God about Christ is the
          truth. The work of the Holy Ghost in the heart is to work in us the
          truth. The knowledge of the truth is a large knowledge. It is not
          always so at the first: it may begin with but a little knowledge, but
          it is a large knowledge when it is further developed, and the soul is
          fully instructed in the whole range of the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          This knowledge of the grand facts which are here called the truth
          saves men, and we will notice its mode of operation. Very often it
          begins its work in a man by arousing him, and thus it saves him from
          carelessness. He did not know anything about the truth which God has
          revealed, and so he lived like a brute beast. If he had enough to eat
          and to drink he was satisfied. If he laid by a little money he was
          delighted. So long as the days passed pretty merrily, and he was free
          from aches and pains, he was satisfied. He heard about religion, but
          he thought it did not concern him. He supposed that there were some
          people who might be the better for thinking about it, but as far as he
          was concerned, he thought no more about God or godliness than the ox
          of the stall or the ostrich of the desert. Well, the truth came to
          him, and he received a knowledge of it. He knew only a part, and that
          a very dark and gloomy part of it, but it stirred him out of his
          carelessness, for he suddenly discovered that he was under the wrath
          of God. Perhaps he heard a sermon, or read a tract, or had a practical
          word addressed to him by some Christian friend, and he found out
          enough to know that "he that believeth not is condemned already,
          because he hath not believed on the Son of God." That startled him.
          "God is angry with the wicked every day:" -- that amazed him. He had
          not thought of it, perhaps had not known it, but when he did know it,
          he could rest no longer. Then he came to a knowledge of this farther
          truth, that after death there would be a judgment, that he would rise
          again, and that, being risen, he would have to stand before the
          judgment-seat of God to give an account of the things which he had
          done in the body. This came home very strikingly to him. Perhaps,
          also, such a text as this flamed forth before him, -- "For every idle
          word that man shall speak he must give an account in the day of
          judgment." His mind began to foresee that last tremendous day, when on
          the clouds of heaven Christ will conic and summon quick and dead, to
          answer at his judgment-seat for the whole of their lives. He did not
          know that before, but, knowing it, it startled and aroused him. I have
          known men, when first they have come to a knowledge of this truth,
          become unable to sleep. They have started up in the night. They have
          asked those who were with them to help them to pray. The next day they
          have been scarcely able to mind their business, for a dreadful sound
          has been in their ears. They feared lest they should stumble into the
          grave and into hell. Thus they were saved from carelessness. They
          could not go back to be the mere brute beasts they were before. Their
          eyes had been opened to futurity and eternity. Their spirits had been
          quickened -- at least so much that they could not rest in that
          doltish, dull, dead carelessness in which they had formerly been
          found. They were shaken out of their deadly lethargy by a knowledge of
          the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The truth is useful to a man in another way: it saves him from
          prejudice. Often when men are awakened to know something about the
          wrath of God they begin to plunge about to discover divers methods by
          which they may escape from that wrath. Consulting, first of all, with
          themselves, they think that, if they can reform -- give up their
          grosser sins, and if they can join with religious people, they will
          make it all right. And there are some who go and listen to a kind of
          religious teacher, who says, "You must do good works. You must earn a
          good character. You must add to all this the ceremonies of our church.
          You must be particular and precise in receiving blessing only through
          the appointed channel of the apostolical succession." Of the aforesaid
          mystical succession this teacher has the effrontery to assure his dupe
          that he is a legitimate instrument; and that sacraments received at
          his hands are means of grace. Under such untruthful notions we have
          known people who were somewhat aroused sit down again in a false
          peace. They have done all that they judged right and attended to all
          that they were told. Suddenly, by God's grace, they come to a
          knowledge of another truth, and that is that by the deeds of the law
          there shall no flesh be justified in the sight of God. They discover
          that salvation is not by works of the law or by ceremonies, and that
          if any man he under the law he is also under the curse. Such a text as
          the following conies home, "Not of blood, nor of the will of the
          flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God"; and such another text as
          this, "Ye must be born again," and then this at the back of it --
          "that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of
          the Spirit is spirit." When they also find out that there is necessary
          a righteousness better than their own -- a perfect righteousness to
          justify them before God, and when they discover that they must be made
          new creatures in Christ Jesus, or else they must utterly perish, then
          they are saved from false confidences, saved from crying, "Peace,
          peace," when there is no peace. It is a grand thing when a knowledge
          of the truth stops us from trusting in a lie. I am addressing some who
          remember when they were saved in that way. What an opening of the eyes
          it was to you! You had a great prejudice against the gospel of grace
          and the plan of salvation by faith; but when the Lord took you in hand
          and made you see your beautiful righteousness to be a moth-eaten mass
          of rags, and when the gold that you had accumulated suddenly turned
          into so much brass, cankered, and good for nothing, -- when you stood
          stripped naked before God, and the poor cobwebs of ceremonies suddenly
          dropped from off you, oh, then the Lord was working his salvation in
          your soul, and you were being saved from false confidences by a
          knowledge of the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, it often happens that a knowledge of the truth stands a man
          in good stead for another purpose; it saves him from despair. Unable
          to be careless, and unable to find comfort in false confidences, some
          poor agitated minds are driven into a wide and stormy sea without
          rudder or compass, with nothing but wreck before them. "There is no
          hope for me," says the man. "I perceive I cannot save myself. I see
          that I am lost. I am dead in trespasses and sins, and cannot stir hand
          or foot. Surely now I may as well go on in sin, and even multiply my
          transgressions. The gate of mercy is shut against me; what is the use
          of fear where there is no room for hope?" At such a time, if the Lord
          leads the man to a knowledge of the truth, he perceives that though
          his sins be as scarlet they shalt be as wool, and though they be red
          like crimson they shall be as white as snow. That precious doctrine of
          substitution comes in -- that Christ stood in the stead of the sinner,
          that the transgression of his people was laid upon him, and that God,
          by thus avenging sin in the person of his dear Son, and honoring his
          law by the suffering of the Savior, is now able to declare pardon to
          the penitent and grace to the believing. Now, when the soul comes to
          know that sin is put away by the atoning blood; when the heart
          discovers that it is not our life that saves us, but the life of God
          that comes to dwell in us; that we are not to be regenerated by our
          own actions, but are regenerated by the Holy Ghost who comes to us
          through the precious death of Jesus, then despair flies away, and the
          soul cries exultingly, "There is hope. There is hope. Christ died for
          sinners: why should I not have a part in that precious death? He came
          like a physician to heal the sick: why should he not heal me? Now I
          perceive that he does not want my goodness, but my badness; he does
          not need my righteousness, but my unrighteousness: for he came to save
          the ungodly and to redeem his people from their sins. I say, when the
          heart comes to a knowledge of this truth, then it is saved from
          despair; and this is no small part of the salvation of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          A saving knowledge of the truth, to take another line of things, works
          in this way. A knowledge of the truth shows a man his personal need of
          being saved. O you that are not saved, and who dream you do not need
          to be, you only require to know the truth, and you will perceive that
          you must he saved or lost for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          A knowledge of the truth reveals the atonement by which we are saved:
          a knowledge of the truth shows us what that faith is by which the
          atonement becomes available for us: a knowledge of the truth teaches
          us that faith is the simple act of trusting, that it is not an action
          of which man may boast; it is not an action of the nature of a work,
          so as to he a fruit of the law; but faith is a self-denying grace
          which finds all its strength in him upon whom it lives, and lays all
          its honor upon him. Faith is not self in action but self forsaken,
          self abhorred, self put away that the soul may trust in Christ, and
          trust in Christ alone. There are persons now present who are puzzled
          about what faith is. We have tried to explain it a great many times to
          you, hut we have explained it so that you did not understand it any
          the better; and yet the same explanation has savingly instructed
          others. May God the Holy Ghost open your understandings that you may
          practically know what faith is, and at once exercise it. I suppose
          that it is a very hard thing to understand because it is so plain.
          When a man wishes the way of salvation to be difficult he naturally
          kicks at it because it is easy; and, when his pride wants it to be
          hard to be understood, he is pretty sure to say that he does not
          understand it because it is so plain. Do not you know that the
          unlettered often receive Christ when philosophers refuse him, and that
          he who has not called ninny of the great, and many of the mighty, has
          chosen poor, foolish, and despised things? That is because poor
          foolish men, you know, are willing to believe a plain thing, but men
          wise in their own conceits desire to be, if they can, a little
          confounded and puzzled that they may please themselves with the idea
          that their own superior intellect has made a discovery; and, because
          the way of salvation is just so easy that almost an idiot boy may lay
          hold of it, therefore they pretend that they do not understand it.
          Some people cannot see a thing because it is too high up; but there
          are others who cannot see it because it is too low down. Now, it so
          happens that the way of salvation by faith is so simple that it seems
          beneath the dignity of exceedingly clever men. May God bring them to a
          knowledge of this truth: may they see that they cannot be saved except
          by giving up all idea of saving themselves; that they cannot be saved
          except they step right into Christ, for, until they get to the end of
          the creature, they will never get to the beginning of the Creator.
          Till they empty out their pockets of every mouldy crust, and have not
          a crumb left; they cannot come and take the rich mercy which is stored
          up in Christ Jesus for every empty, needy sinner. May the Lord be
          pleased to give you that knowledge of the truth!
        </p>
        <p>
          When a man comes in very deed to a knowledge of the truth about faith
          in Christ, he trusts Christ, and he is there and then saved from the
          guilt of sin; and he begins to be saved altogether from sin. God cuts
          the root of the power of sin that very day; hut yet it has such life
          within itself that at the scent of water it will bud again. Sin in our
          members struggles to live. It has as many lives as a cat: there is no
          killing it. Now, when we conic to a knowledge of the truth, we begin
          to learn how sin is to be killed in us -- how the same Christ that
          justifies, sanctifies, and works in us according to his working who
          worketh in us mightily, that we may he conformed to the image of
          Christ, and made meet to dwell with perfect saints above. Beloved,
          many of you that are saved from the guilt of sin, have a very hard
          struggle with the power of sin, and have much more conflict, perhaps,
          than yon need to have, because you have not come to a knowledge of all
          the truth about indwelling sin. I therefore beg you to study much the
          word of God upon that point, and especially to see the adaptation of
          Christ to rule over your nature, and to conquer all your corrupt
          desires, and learn how by faith to bring each sin before him that,
          like Agag, it may be hewed in pieces before his eyes. You will never
          overcome sin except by the blood of the Lamb. There is no
          sanctification except by faith. The same instrument which destroys sin
          as to its guilt must slay sin as to its power. "They overcame by the
          blood of the Lamb," and so must you. Learn this truth well, so shall
          you find salvation wrought in you from day to day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I think I hear somebody say, "I think I know all about this."
          Yes, you may think you know it, and may not know anything at all about
          it. " Oh, but," says one, "I do know it. I learned the Assembly's
          Catechism' when I was a child. I have read the Bible ever since, and I
          am well acquainted with all the commonplaces of orthodoxy." That may
          be, dear friend, and yet you may not know the truth. I have heard of a
          man who knew how to swim, but, as he had never been in the water, I do
          not think much of his knowledge of swimming: in fact, he did not
          really know the art. I have heard of a botanist who understood all
          about flowers, but as he lived in London, and scarcely ever saw above
          one poor withered thing in a flowerpot, I do not think much of his
          botany. I have heard of a man who was a very great astronomer, but he
          had not a telescope, and I never thought much of his astronomy. So
          there are many persons who think they know and yet do not know because
          they have never had any personal acquaintance with the thing. A mere
          notional knowledge or a dry doctrinal knowledge is of no avail. We
          must know the truth in a very different way from that.
        </p>
        <p>
          How are we to know it, then? Well, we are to know it, first, by a
          believing knowledge. You do not know a thing unless you believe it to
          be really so. If you doubt it, you do not know it. If you say, "I
          really am not sure it is true," then you cannot say that you know it.
          That which the Lord has revealed in holy Scripture you must devoutly
          believe to be true. In addition to this, your knowledge, if it becomes
          believing knowledge, must be personal knowledge -- a persuasion that
          it is true in reference to yourself. It is true about your neighbor,
          about your brother, but you must believe it about yourself, or your
          knowledge is vain -- for instance, you must know that you are lost --
          that you are in danger of eternal destruction from the presence of God
          -- that for you there is no hope but in Christ -- that for you there
          is hope if you rest in Christ -- that resting in Christ you are saved.
          Yes, you. You must know that because you have trusted in Christ you
          are saved, and that now you are free from condemnation, and that now
          in you the new life has begun, which will fight against the old life
          of sin, until it overcome, and you, even you, are safely landed on the
          golden shore. There must be a personal appropriation of what you
          believe to be true. That is the kind of knowledge which saves the
          soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this must be a powerful knowledge, by which I mean that it must
          operate in and upon your mind. A man is told that his house is on
          fire. I will suppose that standing here I held up a telegram, and
          said, "My friend, is your name so-and-so?" "Yes." "Well, your house is
          on fire." He knows the fact, does he not? Yes, but he sits quite
          still. Now, my impression is about that good brother, that he does not
          know, for he does not believe it. He cannot believe it, surely he may
          believe that somebody's house is on fire, but not his own. If it is
          his house which is burning, and he knows it, what does he do? Why he
          gets up and goes off to see what he can do towards saving his goods.
          That is the kind of knowledge which saves the soul -- when a man knows
          the truth about himself, and therefore his whole nature is moved and
          affected by the knowledge. Do I know that I am in danger of hell fire?
          And am I in my senses? Then I shall never rest till I have escaped
          from that danger. Do I know that there is salvation for me in Christ?
          Then I never shall be content until I have obtained that salvation by
          the faith to which that salvation is promised: that is to say, if I
          really am in my senses, and if my sin has not made me beside myself as
          sin does, for sin works a moral madness upon the mind of man, so that
          he puts bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter, and dances on the jaws
          of hell, and sits down and scoffs at Almighty mercy, despises the
          precious blood of Christ and will have none of it, although there and
          there only is his salvation to be found.
        </p>
        <p>
          This knowledge when it comes really to save the soul is what we call
          experimental knowledge -- knowledge acquired according to the
          exhortation of the psalmist, "Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good"
          -- acquired by tasting. Now, at this present moment, I, speaking for
          myself, know that I am origin ally lost by nature. Do I believe it?
          Believe it? I am as sure of it as I am of my own existence. I know
          that I am lost by nature. It would not be possible for anybody to make
          me doubt that: I have felt it. How many weary days I spent under the
          pressure of that knowledge! Does a soldier know that there is such a
          thing as a cat when he has had a hundred lashes? It would take a deal
          of argument to make him believe there is not such a thing, or that
          backs do not smart when they feel the lash. Oh, how my soul smarted
          under the lash of conscience when I suffered under a sense of sin! Do
          I know that I could not save myself? Know it? Why, my poor, struggling
          heart labored this way and that, even as in the very fire with bitter
          disappointment, for I labored to climb to the stars on a treadwheel,
          and I was trying and trying and trying with all my might, but never
          rose an inch higher. I tried to fill a bottomless tub with leaking
          buckets, and worked on and toiled and slaved, but never accomplished
          even the beginning of my unhappy task. I know, for I have tried it,
          that salvation is not in man, or in all the feelings, and weepings,
          and prayings, and Bible readings, and church goings, and chapel goings
          which zeal could crowd together. Nothing whatsoever that man does can
          avail him towards his own salvation. This I know by sad trial of it,
          and failure in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I do know that there is real salvation by believing in Christ.
          Know it? I have never preached to you concerning that subject what I
          do not know by experience. In a moment, when I believed in Christ I
          leaped from despair to fullness of delight. Since I have believed in
          Jesus I have found myself totally new -- changed altogether from what
          I was; and I find now that, in proportion as I trust in Jesus, I love
          God and try to serve him; but if at any time I begin to trust in
          myself, I forget my God, and I become selfish and sinful. Just as I
          keep on being nothing and taking Christ to be everything, so am I led
          in the paths of righteousness. I am merely talking of myself, because
          a man cannot bear witness about other people so thoroughly us he can
          about himself. I am sure that all of you who have tried my Master can
          bear the same witness. You have been saved, and you have come to a
          knowledge of the truth experimentally; and every soul here that would
          be saved must in the same way believe the truth, appropriate the
          truth, act upon the truth, and experimentally know the truth, which is
          summed up in few words: -- "Man lost: Christ his Savior. Man nothing:
          God all in all. The heart depraved: the Spirit working the new life by
          faith." The Lord grant that these truths may come home to your hearts
          with power.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am now going to draw two inferences which are to be practical. The
          first one is this: in regard TO YOU THAT ARE SEEKING SALVATION. Does
          not the text show you that it is very possible that the reason why you
          have not found salvation is because you do not know the truth? Hence,
          I do most earnestly entreat the many of you young people who cannot
          get rest to be very diligent searchers of your Bibles. The first thing
          and the main thing is to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, but if you
          say," I do not understand it," or "I cannot believe," or if there be
          any such doubt rising in your mind, then it may be because you have
          not gained complete knowledge of the truth. It is very possible that
          somebody will say to you, "Believe, believe, believe." I would say the
          same to you, but I should like you to act upon the common-sense
          principle of knowing what is to be believed and in whom you are to
          believe. I explained this to one who came to me a few evenings ago.
          She said that she could not believe. "Well," I said, "now suppose as
          you sit in that chair I say to you, Young friend, I cannot believe in
          you': you would say to me, I think you should.' Suppose I then
          replied, I wish I could.' What would you bid me do? Should I sit still
          and look at you till I said, I think I can believe in you'? That would
          be ridiculous. No, I should go and enquire, Who is this young person?
          What kind of character does she bear? What are her connections?' and
          when I knew all about you, then I have no doubt that I should say, I
          have made examination into this young woman's character, and I cannot
          help believing in her.'" Now, it is just so with Jesus Christ. If you
          say, "I cannot believe in him," read those four blessed testimonies of
          Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and especially linger much over those
          parts where they tell you of his death. Do you know that many, while
          they have been sitting, as it were, at the foot of the cross, viewing
          the Son of God dying for men, have cried out, "I cannot help
          believing. I cannot help believing. When I see my sin, it seems too
          great; hut when I see my Savior my iniquity vanishes away." I think I
          have put it to you sometimes like this: if you take a ride through
          London, from end to end, it will take you many days to get an idea of
          its vastness; for probably none of us know the size of London. After
          your long ride of inspection you will say," I wonder how those people
          can all be fed. I cannot make it out. Where does all the bread come
          from, and all the butter, and all the cheese, and all the meat, and
          everything else? Why, these people will be starved. It is not possible
          that Lebanon with all its beasts, and the vast plains of Europe and
          America should ever supply food sufficient for all this multitude."
          That is your feeling. And then, to-morrow morning you get up, and you
          go to Covent Garden, you go to the great meat-markets, and to other
          sources of supply, and when you come home you say, "I feel quite
          different now, for now 1 cannot make out where all the people come
          from to eat all this provision: I never saw such store of food in all
          my life. Why, if there were two Londons, surely there is enough here
          to feed them." Just so -- when you think about your sins and your
          wants you get saying, "How can I be saved?" Now, turn your thoughts
          the other way; think that Christ is the Son of God: think of what the
          merit must be of the incarnate God's hearing human guilt; and instead
          of saying, "My sin is too great," you will almost think the atoning
          sacrifice too great. Therefore I do urge you to try and know more of
          Christ; and I am only giving you the advice of Isaiah, "Incline your
          ear, and come unto me; hear, and your soul shall live." Know, hear,
          read, and believe more about these precious things, always with this
          wish -- "I am not hearing for hearing's sake, and I am not wishing to
          know for knowing's sake, but I am wanting to hear and to know that I
          may be saved." I want you to be like the woman that lost her piece of
          silver. She did not light a candle and then say, "Bravo, I have lit a
          candle, this is enough." She did not take her broom and then sit down
          content, crying, "What a splendid broom." When she raised a dust she
          did not exclaim, "What a dust I am making! I am surely making progress
          now." Some poor sinners, when they have been seeking, get into a dust
          of soul-trouble, and think it to be a comfortable sign. No, I'll
          warrant you, the woman wanted her groat: she did not mind the broom,
          or the dust, or the candle; she looked for the silver. So it must be
          with you. Never content yourself with the reading, the hearing, or the
          feeling. It is Christ you want. It is the precious piece of money that
          you must find; and you must sweep until you find it. Why, there it is!
          There is Jesus! Take him! Take him! Believe him now, even now, and you
          are saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last inference is for YOU WHO DESIRE TO SAVE SINNERS. You must,
          dear friends, bring the truth before them when you want to bring them
          to Jesus Christ. I believe that exciting meetings do good to some. Men
          are so dead and careless that almost anything is to be tolerated that
          wakes them up; but for real solid soul-work before God' telling men
          the truth is the main thing. What truth? It is gospel truth, truth
          about Christ that they want. Tell it in a loving, earnest,
          affectionate manner, for God wills that they should be saved, not in
          any other way, but in this way -- by a knowledge of the truth. He
          wills that all men should be saved in this way -- not by keeping them
          in ignorance, but by bringing the truth before them. That is God's way
          of saving them. Have your Bible handy when you are reasoning with a
          soul. Just say, "Let me call your attention to this passage." It has a
          wonderful power over a poor staggering soul to point to the Book
          itself. Say, "Did you notice this promise, my dear friend? And have
          you seen that passage?" Have the Scriptures handy. There is a dear
          brother of mine here whom God blesses to many souls, and I have seen
          him talking to some, and turning to the texts very handily. I wondered
          how he did it so quickly, till I looked in his Bible, and found that
          he hind the choice texts printed on two leaves and inserted into the
          book, so that he could always open upon them. That is a capital plan,
          to get the cheering words ready to hand, the very ones that you know
          have comforted you and have comforted others. It sometimes happens
          that one single verse of God's word will make the light to break into
          a soul, when fifty days of reasoning would not do it. I notice that
          when souls are saved it is by our texts rather than by our sermons.
          God the Holy Ghost loves to use his own sword. It is God's word, not
          man's comment on God's word, that God usually blesses. Therefore,
          stick to the quotation of the Scripture itself, and rely upon the
          truth. If a man could be saved by a lie it would be a lying salvation.
          Truth alone can work results that are true. Therefore, keep on
          teaching the truth. God help you to proclaim the precious truth about
          the bleeding, dying, risen, exalted, coming Savior; and God will bless
          it.

        <p>
          DEAR FRIENDS, -- Accept again my heartiest salutations. I hope soon to
          issue sermons preached at home on the previous Sabbaths, for I
          purpose, if the Lord will, to leave this shelter on February 2, or
          thereabouts. Six weeks of continuous fine weather have by God's
          blessing delivered me from my pains, and enabled me to regain a large
          measure of strength; and the daily good tidings from home has also
          helped to quiet my mind and revive my spirit. O that I may be the
          better for this affliction. As after heavy showers the fountains and
          brooks run with new force and fullness, so may it be with these
          sermons now that with me "the rain is over and gone." If you, dear
          readers, are the more refreshed I shall count pain and weakness to be
          a small cost for so blessed a result.
        </p>
        <p>Yours most heartily</p>
        <p>C.H. Spurgeon</p>
