          IT will readily be understood that the Authors of the ensuing Essays
          are responsible for their respective articles only. They have written
          in entire independence of each other, and without concert or
          comparison.

          The Volume, it is hoped, will be received as an attempt to illustrate
          the advantage derivable to the cause of religious and moral truth,
          from a free handling, in a becoming spirit, of subjects peculiarly
          liable to suffer by the repetition of conventional language, and from
          traditional methods of treatment.<br />
