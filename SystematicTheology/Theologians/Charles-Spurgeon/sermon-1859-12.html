        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.236)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, January 30th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          |Who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising
          the shame, and is now set down at the right hand of the throne of
          God.| -- Hebrews 12:2.
        </p>
        <p>
          OH what shall I do, my Saviour to praise?| Where shall language be
          found which shall describe his matchless, his unparalleled love
          towards the children of men. Upon any ordinary subject one may find
          liberty of speech and fullness of utterance, but this subject lies out
          of the line of all oratory, and eloquence cannot attain unto it. This
          is one of the unutterable things -- unutterable, because it surpasses
          thought, and defies the power of words. How, then, can we deal with
          that which is unutterable? I am conscious that all I can say
          concerning the sufferings of Jesus, this morning, will be but as a
          drop of the bucket. None of us know the half of the agony which he
          endured; none of us have ever fully comprehended the love of Christ
          which passeth knowledge. Philosophers have probed the earth to its
          very center, threaded the spheres, measured the skies, weighed the
          hills -- nay, weighed the world itself; but this is one of those vast,
          boundless things, which to measure doth surpass all but the Infinite
          itself. As the swallow but skimmeth the water, and diveth not into its
          depths, so all the descriptions of the preacher but skim the surface,
          while depths immeasurable must lie far beneath our observation. Well
          might a poet say
        </p>
        <p>|O love, thou fathomless abyss!|</p>
        <p>
          for this love of Christ is indeed measureless and fathomless. None of
          us can attain unto it. In speaking thereof we feel our own weakness,
          we cast ourselves upon the strength of the Spirit, but, even then, we
          feel that we can never attain unto the majesty of this subject. Before
          we can ever get a right idea of the love of Jesus, we must understand
          his previous glory in its height of majesty, and his incarnation upon
          the earth in all its depths of shame. Now, who can tell us the majesty
          of Christ? When he was enthroned in the highest heavens he was very
          God of very God; by him were the heavens made, and all the hosts
          thereof, by his power he hanged the earth upon nothing; his own
          almighty arm upheld the spheres; the pillars of the heavens rested
          upon him; the praises of angels, arch-angels, cherubim and seraphim,
          perpetually surrounded him; the full chorus of the Hallelujahs of the
          universe unceasingly flowed to the foot of his throne: he reigned
          supreme above all his creatures, God over all, blessed for ever. Who
          can tell his height, then? And yet this must be attained before we can
          measure the length of that mighty stoop which he took when he came to
          earth to redeem our souls. And who, on the other hand, can tell how
          low he descended? To be a man was something, but to be a man of
          sorrows was far more; to bleed, and die, and suffer, these were much
          for him who was the Son of God; but to suffer as be did -- such
          unparalleled agony -- to endure, as lie did, a death of shame and a
          death of desertion of his God, this is a lower depth of condescending
          love which the most inspired mind must utterly fail to fathom. And yet
          must we first understand infinite height, and then, infinite depth; we
          must measure, in fact, the whole infinite that is between heaven and
          hell, before we can understand the love of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet because we cannot understand shall we therefore neglect, and
          because we cannot measure shall we therefore despise? Ah! no; let us
          go to Calvary this morning, and see this great sight. Jesus Christ,
          for the joy that was set before him, enduring the cross, despising the
          shame.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall endeavor to show you, first, the shameful sufferer; secondly,
          we shall endeavor to dwell upon his glorious motive; and then in the
          third place, we shall offer him to you as an admirable example.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Beloved, I wish to show you the SHAMEFUL SUFFERER. The text speaks
          of shame, and therefore before entering upon suffering, I shall
          endeavor to say a word or two upon the shame.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps there is nothing which men so much abhor as shame. We find
          that death itself has often been preferable in the minds of men to
          shame; and even the most wicked and callous-hearted have dreaded the
          shame and contempt of their fellow-creatures far more than any
          tortures to which they could have been exposed. We find Abimelech, a
          man who murdered his own brethren without compunction; we find even
          him overcome by shame, when |a certain woman cast a piece of a
          millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to break his skull. Then he
          called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him,
          Draw thy sword and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him.
          And his young man thrust him through, and he died.| Shame was too much
          for him. He would far rather meet the suicide's death -- for such it
          was -- than he should be convicted of the shame of being slain by a
          woman. So was it with Saul also -- a man who was not ashamed of
          breaking his oath, and of hunting his own son in-law like a partridge
          upon the mountains -- even he fell upon his own sword rather than it
          should be said of him that he fell by the Philistines. And we read of
          an ancient king, Zedekiah, that albeit he seemed reckless enough, he
          was afraid to fall into the hands of the Chaldeans, lest the Jews who
          had fallen away to Nebuchadnezzar should make a mock of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          These instances are but a few of many. It is well known that criminals
          and malefactors have often had a greater fear of public contempt than
          of ought else. Nothing can so break down the human spirit as to be
          subject continually to contempt, the visible and manifest contempt of
          one's fellows; in fact to go further, shame is so frightful to man
          that it is one of the ingredients of hell itself; it is one of the
          bitterest drops in that awful cup of misery. The shame of everlasting
          contempt to which wicked men awake in the day of their resurrection;
          to be despised of men, despised of angels, despised of God, is one of
          the depths of hell. Shame, then, is a terrible thing to endure; and
          many of the proudest natures have been subdued when once they have
          been subjected to it. In the Saviour's case, shame would be peculiarly
          shameful; the nobler a man's nature, the more readily does he perceive
          the slighest contempt, and the more acutely does he feel it. That
          contempt which an ordinary man might bear without a suffering, he who
          has been bred to be obeyed, and who has all his life-long been
          honored, would feel most bitterly. Beggared princes and despised
          monarchs are among the most miserable of men; but here was our
          glorious Redeemer, in whose face was the nobility of Godhead itself,
          despised and spit upon, and mocked. Ye may, therefore, think how such
          a noble nature as his had to endure. The mere kite can bear to be
          mewed, but the eagle cannot bear to be hoodwinked and blindfolded; he
          hath a nobler spirit than that. The eye that hath faced the sun,
          cannot endure darkness without a tear. But Christ who was more than
          noble, matchlessly noble, something more than of a royal race, for him
          to be shamed, and mocked, must have been dreadful indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides some minds are of such a delicate and sensitive disposition
          that they feel things far more than others. There are some of us who
          do not so readily perceive an affront, or when we do perceive it, are
          totally indifferent to it. But there are others of a loving and tender
          heart; they have so long wept for others' woes, that their hearts have
          become tender, and they therefore feel the slightest brush of
          ingratitude from those they love, and if those for whom they are
          willing to suffer should utter words of blasphemy and rebuke against
          them, their souls would be pierced to the very quick. A man in armor
          would walk through thorns and briars without feeling, but a man who is
          naked feels the smallest of the thorns; now Christ was so to speak a
          naked spirit, he had stripped himself of all for manhood; he said,
          |The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the
          son of man hath not where to lay his head.| He stripped himself of
          everything that could make him callous, for he loved with all his
          soul; his strong passionate heart was fixed upon the welfare of the
          human race; he loved them even unto death, and to be mocked by those
          for whom he died, to be spit upon by the creatures whom he came to
          save, to come unto his own, and to find that his own received him not,
          but actually cast him out, this was pain indeed. Ye tender hearts can
          weep for others' woes, and ye that love with a love as strong as
          death, and with a jealousy as cruel as the grave, ye can guess, but
          only you, what the Saviour must have endured, when all did mock him,
          all did scorn him, and he found none to pit,y none to take his part.
        </p>
        <p>
          To go back to the point with which we started -- shame is peculiarly
          abhorrent to manhood, and far more to such a manhood as that which
          Christ carried about with him -- a noble, sensitive, loving nature,
          such as no other manhood had ever possessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now come and let us behold the pitiful spectacle of Jesus put to
          shame. He was put to shame in three ways -- by shameful accusation,
          shameful mockery, and shameful crucifixion.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. And, first, behold the Saviour's shame in his shameful accusation.
          He in whom was no sin, and who had done no ill, was charged with sin
          of the blackest kind. He was first arraigned before the Sanhedrim on
          no less a charge than that of blasphemy. And could he blaspheme? -- he
          who said |It is my meat and my drink to do the will of him that sent
          me.| Could he blaspheme? He who in the depths of his agony, when he
          sweat as it were great drops of blood at last cried, |My Father, not
          my will, but thine be done,| -- could he blaspheme? No. And it is just
          because it was so contrary to his character, that he felt the
          accusation. To charge some of you here present with having blasphemed
          God, would not startle you, for ye have done it, and have done it so
          often as almost to forget that God abhors blasphemers, and that he
          |will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.| But for
          one who loved as Jesus loved, and obeyed as he obeyed, for him to be
          charged with blasphemy, the accusation must have caused him peculiar
          suffering. We wonder that he did not fall to the ground, even as his
          betrayers did when they came to lay hold upon him. Such an accusation
          as that might blight an angel's spirit. Such a calumny might wither
          the courage of a cherub. Marvel not, then, that Jesus felt the shame
          of being accused of such a crime as this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor did this content them. Having charged him with breaking the first
          table, they then charged him with violating the second: they said he
          was guilty of sedition; they declared that he was a traitor to the
          government of Caesar, that he stirred up the people, declaring that he
          himself was a king. And could he commit treason? he who said |my
          kingdom is not of this world, else would my servants fight;| he who
          when they would have taken him by force, to make him a king withdrew
          himself into the wilderness and prayed -- could he commit treason? It
          were impossible. Did he not pay tribute, and sent to the fish, when
          his poverty had not wherewith to pay the tax. Could he commit treason?
          He could not sin against Caesar, for he was Caesar's lord; he was King
          of kings, and Lord of lords. If he had chosen he could have taken the
          purple from the shoulders of Caesar and at a word have given Caesar to
          be a prey to the worms. He commit treason? Twas far enough from Jesus,
          the gentle and the mild to stir up sedition or set man against man. Ah
          no, he was a lover of his country, and a lover of his race; he would
          never provoke a civil war, and yet this charge was brought against
          him. What would you think good citizens and good Christians, if you
          were charged with such a crime as this, with the clamours of your own
          people behind you crying out against you as so execrable an offender
          that you must die the death. Would not that abash you? Ah! but your
          Master had to endure this as well as the other. He despised the
          shameful indictments, and was numbered with the transgressors.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But next, Christ not only endured shameful accusation but he
          endured shameful mocking. When Christ was taken away to Herod, Herod
          set him at nought. The original word signifies made nothing of him. It
          is an amazing thing to find that man should make nothing of the Sun of
          God, who is all in all. He had made himself nothing, he had declared
          that he was a worm, and no man; but what a sin was that, and what a
          shame was that when Herod made him nothing! He had but to look Herod
          in the face, and he could have withered him with one glance of his
          fire-darting eyes. But yet Herod may meek him, and Jesus will not
          speak, and men of arms may come about him, and break their cruel jests
          upon his tender heart, but not a word has he to say, but |is led as a
          lamb to the slaughter, and like a sheep before her shearers is dumb.|
        </p>
        <p>
          You will observe that in Christ's mocking, from Herod's own hall, on
          to the time when he was taken from Pilate's hall of judgment to his
          crucifixion, and then onward to his death, the mockers were of many
          kinds. In the first place they mocked the Saviour's person. One of
          those things about which we may say but little, but of which we ought
          often to think, is the fact that our Saviour was stripped in the midst
          of a ribald soldiery, of all the garments that he had. It is a shame
          even for us to speak of this which was done by our own flesh and blood
          toward him who was our Redeemer. Those holy limbs which were the
          casket of the precious jewel of his soul were exposed to the shame and
          open contempt of men-coarse-minded men who were utterly destitute of
          every particle of delicacy. The person of Christ was stripped twice;
          and although our painters, for obvious reasons, cover Christ upon the
          cross, there he hung -- the naked Saviour of a naked race. He who
          clothed the lilies had not wherewith to clothe himself; he who had
          clothed the earth with jewels and made for it robes of emeralds, had
          not so much as a rag to conceal his nakedness from a staring, gazing,
          mocking, hard-hearted crowd. He had made coats of skins for Adam and
          Eve when they were naked in the garden; he had taken from them those
          poor fig leaves with which they sought to hide their nakedness, given
          them something wherewith they might wrap themselves from the cold; but
          now they part his garments among them, and for his vesture do they
          cast lots, while he himself, exposed to the pitiless storm of
          contempt, hath no cloak with which to cover his shame. They mocked his
          person, -- Jesus Christ declared himself to be the Son of God; -- they
          mocked his divine person as well as his human -- when he hung upon the
          cross, they said. |If thou be the Son of God, come down from the
          cross, and we will believe on thee.| Frequently they challenge him to
          prove his divinity by turning aside from the work which he had
          undertaken. They asked him to do the very thing which would have
          disproved his divinity, in order that they might then, as they
          declared, acknowledge and confess that he was the Son of God. And now
          can you think of it? Christ was mocked as man, we can conceive him as
          yielding to this. But to be mocked as God! A challenge thrown to
          manhood, manhood would easily take up and fight the duel. Christian
          manhood would allow the gauntlet to lie there, or tread it beneath its
          foot in contempt, bearing all things, and enduring all things for
          Christ's sake. But can you think of God being challenged by his
          creature -- the eternal Jehovah provoked by the creature which his own
          hated hath made; the Infinite despised by the finite; he who fills all
          things, by whom all things exist, laughed at, mocked, despised by the
          creature of an hour, who is crushed before the moth! This was contempt
          indeed, a contempt of his complex person, of his manhood, and of his
          divinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          But note next, they mocked all his offices, as well as his person.
          Christ was a king, and never such a king as he. He is Israel's David;
          all the hearts of his people are knit unto him. He is Israel's
          Solomon; he shall reign from sea to sea, and from the river even to
          the ends of the earth. He was one of royal race. We have some called
          kings on earth, children of Nimrod, these are called kings, but kings
          they are not. They borrow their dignity of him who is King of kings
          and Lord of lords. But here was one of the true blood, one of the
          right royal race, who had lost his way, and was mingled with the
          common herd of men. What did they do? Did they bring crowns with which
          to honor him, and did the nobility of earth cast their robes beneath
          his feet to carpet his footsteps. See, what they do? He is delivered
          up to rough and brutal soldiery. They find for him a mimic throne, and
          having put him on it, they strip him of his own robes, and find some
          old soldier's cloak of scarlet or of purple, and put it about his
          loins. They plait a crown of thorns, and put it about his brow -- a
          brow that was of old bedight with stars, and then they fix in his hand
          -- a hand that will not resent an insult, a secptre of reed, and then
          bowing the knee, they pay their mimic homage before him, making him a
          May-day king. Now, perhaps there is nothing so heartrending as royalty
          despised. You have read the story of an English king, who was taken
          out by his cruel enemies to a ditch. They seated him on an ant-hill,
          telling him that was his throne, and then they washed his face in the
          filthiest puddle they could find; and the tears running down his
          cheeks, he said, |he should yet be washed in clean water;| though he
          was bitterly mistaken. But think of the King of kings and Lord of
          lords, having for his adoration the spittle of guilty mouths, for
          homage the smitings of filthy hands, for tribute the jests of brutal
          tongues! Was ever shame like thine, thou King of kings, thou emperor
          of all worlds, flouted by the soldiery, and smitten by their menial
          hands? O earth! how couldst thou endure this iniquity. O ye heavens!
          why did ye not fall in very indignation to crush the men who thus
          blasphemed your Maker? Here was a shame indeed, -- the king mocked by
          his own subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was a prophet, too, as we all know, and what did they that they
          might mock him as a prophet? Why they blindfolded him; shut out the
          light of heaven from his eyes, and then they smote him, and did buffet
          him with their hands, and they said, |Prophecy unto us who it is that
          smote thee.| The prophet must make a prophecy to those who taunted him
          to tell them who it was that smote him. We love prophets; it is but
          the nature of mankind, that if we believe in a prophet we should love
          him. We believe that Jesus was the first and the last of prophets; by
          him all others are sent; we bow before him with reverential adoration.
          We count it to be our highest honor to sit at his feet like Mary; we
          only wish that we might have the comfort to wash his feet with our
          tears, and wipe them with the hairs of our head we feel that like John
          the Baptist, his shoe latchet we are not worthy to unloose and can we
          therefore bear the spectacle of Jesus the prophet, blindfolded and
          buffeted with insult and blows?
        </p>
        <p>
          But they also mocked his priesthood, Jesus Christ had come into the
          world to be a priest to offer sacrifice, and his priesthood must be
          mocked too. All salvation lay in the hands of the priests, and now
          they say unto him, |It thou be the Christ save thyself and us,| Ah! he
          saved others, himself he could not save. But oh, what mystery of scorn
          is here, what unutterable depths of shame that the great High Priest
          of our profession, he who is himself the Paschal Lamb, the altar, the
          priest, the sacrifice, that he, the Son of God incarnate, the Lamb of
          God that taketh away the sins of the world, should thus be despised,
          and thus be mocked.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was mocked, still further, in his sufferings. I cannot venture to
          describe the sufferings of our Saviour under the lash of the scourge.
          St. Bernard, and many of the early fathers of the Church, give such a
          picture of Christ's scourging, that I could not endure to tell it over
          again. Whether they had sufficient data for what they say, I do not
          know; but this much I know, -- |he was wounded for our transgressions,
          he was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was
          upon him, and with his stripes we are healed.| I know it must have
          been a terrible scourging, to be called wounding, bruising,
          chastisement, and stripes; and, remember, that every time the lash
          fell on his shoulders, the laugh of him who used the lash was mingled
          with the stripe, and every time the blood poured out afresh, and the
          flesh was torn off his bones, there was a jest and a jeer, to make his
          pain yet more poignant and terrible. And when he came at last to his
          cross, and they nailed him upon it, how they continued the mockery of
          his sufferings! We are told that the high priests and the scribes
          stood, and at length sat and watched him there. When they saw his head
          fall upon his breast, they would, no doubt, make some bitter remark
          about it, and say, |Ah! he will never lift his head again among the
          multitude;| and when they saw his hands bleeding they would say, |Ha,
          ha, these were the hands that touched the lepers, and that raised the
          dead, they will never do this again;| and when they saw his feet, they
          would say, |Ah, those feet will never tread this land again, and
          journey on his pilgrimages of mercy;| and then some coarse, some
          villainous, some brutal, perhaps some beastly jest would be made
          concerning every part of his thrice-adorable person. They mocked him,
          and, at last, he called for drink, and they gave him vinegar --
          mocking his thirst, while they pretended to allay it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But worst of all, I have one more thing to notice, they mocked his
          prayers. Did you ever read in all the annals of executions, or of
          murders, that ever men mocked their fellow-creatures prayers? I have
          read stories of some dastardly villains who hare sought to slay their
          enemies, and seeing their death approaching the victims have said,
          |give me a moment or two for prayer| -- and rare has been the cases
          when this has been disallowed. But I never read of a case in which
          when the prayer was uttered it has been laughed at, and made the
          object of a jest. But here hangs the Saviour, and every word he speaks
          becomes the subject of a pun, the motto of a jest. And when at the
          last he utters the most thrilling death-shriek that ever startled
          earth and hell, |Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani,| even then they must
          pun upon it, and say, |he calleth for Elias, let us see whether Elias
          will come and take him down.| He was mocked even in his prayer. O
          Jesus! never was love like thine; never patience that could be
          compared with thy endurance when thou didst endure the cross,
          despising the shame.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel that in thus describing the Saviour's mockeries, I have not
          been able to set before you the fullness of the shame through which he
          passed, and shall have to attempt it yet, again, in another moment,
          when I come to describe his shameful death, taking the words which
          preceded the ones I have already enlarged upon. He endured the cross
          just as he did despise the shame.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cross! the cross! When you hear that word it wakens in your hearts
          no thoughts of shame. There are other forms of capital punishment in
          the present day far more disgraceful than the cross. Connected with
          the guillotine there is much with the block as much, with the gallows,
          most of all. But, remember, that although to speak of the gallows is
          to utter a word of ignominy, yet there is nothing of shame in the term
          |gallows,| compared with the shame of the cross, as it was understood
          in the days of Christ. We are told that crucifixion was a punishment
          to which none could be put but a slave, and, even then, the crime must
          have been of the most frightful character -- such as the betrayal of a
          master, the plotting his death, or murdering him -- only such offenses
          would have brought crucifixion, even, upon a slave. It was looked upon
          as the most terrible and frightful of all punishments. All the deaths
          in the world are preferable to this; they have all some slight
          alleviating circumstance, either their rapidity or their glory. But
          this is the death of a villain, of a murderer, of an assassin, -- a
          death painfully protracted, one which cannot be equalled in all
          inventions of human cruelty, for suffering and ignominy. Christ
          himself endured this. The cross, I say, is in this day no theme of
          shame. It has been the crest of many a monarch, the banner of many a
          conqueror. To some it is an object of adoration. The finest
          engravings, the most wonderful paintings, have been dedicated to this
          subject. And now, the cross engraven on many a gem has become a right,
          royal, and noble thing. And we are unable at this day, I believe,
          fully to understand the shame of the cross; but the Jew knew it, the
          Roman knew it, and Christ knew what a frightful thing, what a shameful
          thing its was to be put to the death of crucifixion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, too, that in the Saviour's case, there were special
          aggravations of this shame. He had to carry his own cross; he was
          crucified, too, at the common place of execution, Calvary, analogous
          to our ancient Tyburn, or our present Old Bailey. He was put to death,
          too, at a time when Jerusalem was full of people. It was at the feast
          of the Passover, when the crowd had greatly increased, and when the
          representatives of all nations would be present to behold the
          spectacle. Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in
          Mesopotamia, in Greece, ay, and perhaps far-off Tarshish, and the
          islands of the sea. All were there to unite in this scoffing, and to
          increase the shame. And he was crucified between two thieves, as if to
          teach that he was viler than they. Was ever shame like this?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me conduct you to the cross. The cross, the cross! Tears begin to
          flow at the very thoughts of it. The rough wood is laid upon the
          ground, Christ is flung upon his back, four soldiers seize his hands
          and feet, his blessed flesh his rent with the accursed iron; he begins
          to bleed, he is lifted into mid-air, the cross is dashed into the
          place prepared for it, every limb is dislocated, every bone put out of
          joint by that terrific jerk; he hangs there naked to his shame, gazed
          upon by all beholders, the sun shines hot upon him, fever begins to
          burn, the tongue is dried up like a potsherd, it cleaveth to the roof
          of his mouth, he hath not wherewith to nourish nature with moisture.
          His body has been long emaciated by fasting, he has been brought near
          the brink of death by flagellation in the hall of Pilate. There he
          hangs, the tenderest part of his body, his hands and feet are pierced,
          and where the nerves are most numerous and tender, there is the iron
          rending and tearing its fearful way. The weight of his body drags the
          iron up his foot, and when his knees are so weary that they cannot
          hold him, then the iron begins to drag through his hands. Terrible
          spectacle indeed! But you have seen only the outward, there was an
          inward, you cannot see that: if you could see, it though your eyes
          were like the angels, you would be smitten with eternal blindness.
          Then there was the soul. The soul dying. Can you guess what must be
          the pangs of a soul dying? A soul never died on earth yet. Hell is the
          place of dying souls, where they die everlastingly the second death.
          And there was within the ribs of Christ's body, hell itself poured
          out. Christ's soul was enduring the conflict with all the powers of
          hell, whose malice was aggravated by the fact, that it was the last
          battle they should ever be able to fight with him. Nay, worse than
          that. He had lost that which is the martyr's strength and shield, he
          had lost the presence of his God, God himself was putting his hand
          upon him; it pleased the Father to bruise him; he hath put him to
          grief, he hath made his soul a sacrifice for sin. God, in whose
          countenance Christ had everlastingly seemed himself, basking in
          delight, concealed his face. And there was Jesus forsaken of God and
          man, left alone to tread the winepress, nay, to be trodden in the
          wine-press, and dip his vesture in his own blood. Oh, was there ever
          grief like this! No love can picture it. If I had a thought in my
          heart concerning the suffering of Christ, it should excoriate my lips
          ere I uttered it. The agonies of Jesus were like the furnace of
          Nebuchadnezzar, heated seven times hotter than ever human suffering
          was heated before. Every vein was a road for the hot feet of pain to
          travel in; every nerve a string in a harp of agony that thrilled with
          the discordant wail of hell. All the agonies that the damned
          themselves can endure were thrust into the soul of Christ. He was a
          target for the arrows of the Almighty, arrows dipped in the poison of
          our sin; all the billows of the Eternal dashed upon this rock of our
          salvation. He must be bruised, trodden, crushed, destroyed, his soul
          must be exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I must pause, I cannot describe it. I can creep over it, and you
          can too. The rocks rent when Jesus died, our hearts must be made of
          harder marble than the rocks themselves if they do not feel. The
          temple rent its gorgeous veil of tapestry, and will not ye be mourners
          too? The sun itself had one big tear in its own burning eye, which
          quenched its light; and shall not we weep; we for whom the Saviour
          died? Shall not we feel an agony of heart that he should thus have
          endured for us?
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark, my friends, that all the shame that came on Christ he despised.
          He counted it so light compared with the joy which was set before him,
          that he is said to have despised it. As for his sufferings, he could
          not despise them, that word could not be used in connection with the
          cross for the cross was too awful for even Christ himself to despise.
          That he endured; the shame he could cast off, but the cross he must
          carry, and to it he must be nailed. |He endured the cross, despising
          the shame.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now HIS GLORIOUS MOTIVE. What was that which made Jesus speak
          like this? -- |For the joy that was set before him.| Beloved, what was
          the joy? Oh, tis a thought must melt a rock, and make a heart of iron
          move; that the joy which was set before Jesus, was principally joy of
          saving you and me. I know it was the joy of fulfilling his Father's
          will -- of sitting down on his Father's throne -- of being made
          perfect through suffering; but still I know that this is the grand,
          great motive of the Saviour's suffering, the joy of saving us. Do you
          know what the joy is of doing good to others? If you do not I pity
          you, for of all joys which God has left in this poor wilderness, this
          is one of the sweetest. Have you seen the hungry when they have wanted
          bread for many an hour, -- have you seen them come to your house
          almost naked, their clothes having been thrust away that they might
          get money upon them to find them bread? Have you heard the woman's
          story of the griefs of her husband? Have you listened when you have
          heard the tale of imprisonment, of sickness, of cold, or hunger, of
          thirst, and have you never said, |I will clothe you, I will feed you.|
          Have you never felt that joy divine, when your gold has been given to
          the poor, and your silver has been dedicated to the Lord, when you
          bestowed it upon the hungry, and you have gone aside and said, |God
          forbid that I should be self-righteous;| but I do feel it is worth
          living for to feed the hungry and clothe the naked, and to do good to
          my poor suffering fellow creatures. Now, this is the joy which Christ
          felt, it was the joy of feeding us with the bread of heaven -- the joy
          of clothing poor, naked sinners in his own righteousness -- the joy of
          finding mansions in heaven for homeless souls, -- of delivering us
          from the prison of hell, and giving us the eternal enjoyments of
          heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why should Christ look on us? Why should he choose to do this to
          us? Oh my friends, we never deserved anything at his hands. As a good
          old writer says |When I look at the crucifixion of Christ, I recollect
          that my sins put him to death. I see not Pilate, but I see myself in
          Pilate's place, bartering Christ for honor. I hear not the cry of the
          Jews, but l hear my sins yelling out, Crucify, him, crucify him.' I
          see not iron nails, but I see my own iniquities fastening him to the
          cross. I see no spear, but I behold my unbelief piercing his poor
          wounded side,
        </p>
        <p>'For you, my sins, my cruel sins, his chief tormentors were;</p>
        <p>Each of my sins became a nail, and unbelief the spear.'|</p>
        <p>
          It is the opinion of the Romanist, that the very man who pierced
          Christ's side was afterwards converted, and became a follower of
          Jesus. I do not know whether that is the fact, but l know it is the
          case spiritually. I know that we have pierced the Saviour, I know that
          we have crucified him; and yet, strange to say, the blood which we
          fetched from those holy veins has washed us from our sins, and hath
          made us accepted in the beloved. Can you understand this. Here is
          manhood mocking the Saviour, parading him through the streets, nailing
          him to a cross, and then sitting down to mock at his agonies. And yet
          what is there in the heart of Jesus but love to them? He is weeping
          all this while that they should crucify him, not so much because he
          felt the suffering, though that was much, but because he could bear
          the thought that men whom he loved could nail him to the tree. |That
          was the unkindest stab of all.| You remember that remarkable story of
          Julius Caesar, when he was struck by his friend Brutus. |When the
          noble Caesar saw him stab, ingratitude, more strong than traitor's
          arms, quite vanquished him! Then burst his mighty heart.| Now Jesus
          had to endure the stab in his inmost bowels, and to know that his
          elect did it -- that his redeemed did it, that his own church was his
          murderer -- that his own people nailed him to the tree? Can you think,
          beloved, how strong must hare been the love that made him submit even
          to this. Picture yourself to-day going home from this hall. You have
          an enemy who all his life long has been your enemy. His father was
          your enemy, and he is your enemy too. There is never a day passes but
          you try to win his friendship; but he spits upon your kindness, and
          curses your name. He does injury to your friends, and there is not a
          stone he leaves unturned to do you plumage. As you are going home
          to-day, you see a house on fire; the flames are raging, and the smoke
          is ascending up in one black column to heaven. Crowds gather in the
          street, and you are told there is a man in the upper chamber who must
          be burnt to death. No one can save him. You say, |Why that is my
          enemy's house;| and you see him at the window. It is your own enemy --
          the very man; he is about to be burnt. Full of lovingkindness, you
          say, |I will save that man if I can.| He sees you approach the house;
          he puts his head from the window and curses you. |An everlasting blast
          upon you!| he says; |I would rather perish than that you should save
          me.| Do you imagine yourself then, dashing through the smoke, and
          climbing the blazing staircase to save him; and can you conceive that
          when you get near him he struggles with you, and tries to roll you in
          the flames? Can you conceive your love to be so potent, that you can
          perish in the flames rather than leave him to be burned? You say, |I
          could not do it; it is above flesh and blood to do it.| But Jesus did
          it. We hated him, we despised him, and, when he came to save us, we
          rejected him. When his Holy Spirit comes into our hearts to strive
          with us, we resist him; but he will save us; nay, he himself braved
          the fire that he might snatch us as brands from eternal burning. The
          joy of Jesus was the joy of saving sinners. The great motive, then,
          with Christ, in enduring all this, was, that he might save us.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, give me just a moment, and I will try and hold the
          Saviour up for OUR IMITATION. I speak now to Christians -- to those
          who have tasted and handled of the good word of life. Christian men!
          if Christ endured all this, merely for the joy of saving you, will you
          be ashamed of bearing anything for Christ? The words are on my lips
          again this morning, --
        </p>
        <p>|If on my face for thy dear name, shame and reproach shall be,</p>
        <p>
          I'll hail reproach, and welcome shame, my Lord, I'll die for thee.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! I do not wonder that the martyrs died for such a Christ as this!
          When the love of Christ is shed abroad in our hearts, then we feel
          that if the stake were present we would stand firmly in the fire to
          suffer for him who died for us. I know our poor unbelieving hearts
          would soon begin to quail at the crackling faggot and the furious
          heat. But surely this love would prevail over all our unbelief: Are
          there any of you who feel that if you follow Christ you must lose by
          it, lose your station, or lose your reputation? Will you be laughed
          at, if you leave the world and follow Jesus? Oh! and will you turn
          aside because of these little things when he would not turn aside,
          though all the world mocked him, till he could say |It is finished.|
          No, by the grace of God, let every Christian lift his hands to the
          Most High God, to the maker of heaven and earth, and let him say
          within himself,
        </p>
        <p>
          |Now for the love I bear his name, what was my gain I count my loss,
        </p>
        <p>I pour contempt on all my shame, and nail my glory to his cross.|</p>
        <p>
          |For me to live is Christ; to die is gain,| Living I will be his,
          dying I will be his; I will live to his honor, serve him wholly, if he
          will help me, and if he needs, I will die for his name's sake.
        </p>
        <p>
          [Mr. Spurgeon was so led out under the first head, that he was unable
          from want of time to touch upon the other points. May what was blessed
          to the hearer be sweet to the reader.]<br />
