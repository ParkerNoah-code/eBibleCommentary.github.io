        <p>
          In the year four hundred and sixteen of the kingdom of the Greeks,
          that is the fifteenth year of the reign of the sovereign ruler, our
          lord, Trajan Cæsar, in the consulship of Commodus and Cyrillus, in the
          month Ilul, on the fifth day of the month, the day after Lysinus, the
          judge of the country, had heard the case of Sharbil the priest; as the
          judge was sitting in his judgment-hall, the Sharirs of the city came
          before him and said to him: We give information before thine
          Excellency concerning Barsamya, the leader of the Christians, that he
          went up to Sharbil, the priest, as he was standing and ministering
          before the venerable gods, and sent and called him to him secretly,
          and spoke to him, quoting from the books in which he reads in the
          church where their congregation meets, and recited to him the belief
          of the Christians, and said to him, |It is not right for thee to
          worship many gods, but only one God, and His Son Jesus Christ| --
          until he made him a disciple, and induced him to renounce the gods
          whom he had formerly worshipped; and by means of Sharbil himself also
          many have become disciples, and are gone down to the church, and lo!
          this day they confess Christ; and even Avida, and Nebo, and Barcalba,
          and Hafsai, honourable and chief persons of the city, have yielded to
          Sharbil in this. We, accordingly, as Sharirs of the city, make this
          known before thine Excellency, in order that we may not receive
          punishment as offenders for not having declared before thine
          Excellency the things which were spoken in secret to Sharbil by
          Barsamya the guide of the church. Thine Excellency now knoweth what it
          is right to command in respect of this said matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, immediately that the judge heard these things, he sent the
          Sharirs of the city, and some of his attendants with them, to go down
          to the church and bring up Barsamya from the church. And they led him
          and brought him up to the judgment-hall of the judge; and there went
          up many Christians with him, saying: We also will die with Barsamya,
          because we too are of one mind with him in respect to the doctrine of
          which he made Sharbil a disciple, and in all that he spoke to him, and
          in all the instruction that Sharbil received from him, so that he was
          persuaded by him, and died for the sake of that which he heard from
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the Sharirs of the city came, and said to the judge: Barsamya, as
          thine Excellency commanded, lo! is standing at the door of the
          judgment-hall of thy Lordship; and honourable chief-persons of the
          city, who became disciples along with Sharbil, lo! are standing by
          Barsamya, and crying out, |We will all die with Barsamya, who is our
          teacher and guide.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And, when the judge heard those things which the Sharirs of the city
          had told him, he commanded them to go out and write down the names of
          the persons who were crying out, |We will die with Barsamya.| And,
          when they went out to write down the names of these persons, those who
          so cried out were too many for them, and they were not able to write
          down their names, because they were so many: for the cry kept coming
          to them from all sides, that they |would die for Christ's sake along
          with Barsamya.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And, when the tumult of the crowd became great, the Sharirs of the
          city turned back, and came in to the judge, and said to him: We are
          not able to write down the names of the persons who are crying aloud
          outside, because they are too many to be numbered. And the judge
          commanded that Barsamya should be taken up to the prison, so that the
          crowd might be dispersed which was collected together about him, lest
          through the tumult of the multitude there should be some mischief in
          the city. And, when he went up the gaol, those who had become
          disciples along with Sharbil continued with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And after many days were passed the judge rose up in the morning and
          went down to his judgment-hall, in order that he might hear the case
          of Barsamya. And the judge commanded, and they brought him from the
          prison; and he came in and stood before him. The officers said: Lo, he
          standeth before thine Excellency.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Art thou Barsamya, who hast been made ruler and guide
          of the people of the Christians, and didst make a disciple of Sharbil,
          who was chief-priest of the gods, and used to worship them?
        </p>
        <p>
          Barsamya said: It is I who have done this, and I do not deny it; and I
          am prepared to die for the truth of this.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: How is it that thou wast not afraid of the command of
          the emperors, so that, when the emperors commanded that every one
          should sacrifice, thou didst induce Sharbil, when he was standing and
          sacrificing to the gods and offering incense to them, to deny that
          which he had confessed, and confess Christ whom he had denied?
        </p>
        <p>
          Barsamya said: I was assuredly made a shepherd of men, not for the
          sake of those only who are found, but also for the sake of those who
          have strayed from the fold of truth, and become food for the wolves of
          paganism; and, had I not sought to make Sharbil a disciple, at my
          hands would his blood have been required; and, if he had not listened
          to me, I should have been innocent of his blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Now, therefore, since thou hast confessed that it was
          thou that madest Sharbil a disciple, at thy hands will I require his
          death; and on this account it is right that thou rather than he
          shouldest be condemned before me, because by thy hands he has died the
          horrible deaths of grievous tortures for having abandoned the command
          of the emperors and obeyed thy words.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barsamya said: Not to my words did Sharbil become a disciple, but to
          the word of God which He spoke: |Thou shalt not worship images and the
          likenesses of men.| And it is not I alone that am content to die the
          death of Sharbil for his confession of Christ, but also all the
          Christians, members of the Church, are likewise eager for this,
          because they know that they will secure their salvation before God
          thereby.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Answer me not in this manner, like Sharbil thy
          disciple, lest thine own torments be worse than his; but promise that
          thou wilt sacrifice before the gods on his behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barsamya said: Sharbil, who knew not God, I taught to know Him: and
          dost thou bid me, who have known God from my youth, to renounce God?
          God forbid that I should do this thing!
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Ye have made the whole creation disciples of the
          teaching of Christ; and lo! they renounce the many gods whom the many
          worshipped. Give up this way of thinking, lest I make those who are
          near tremble at thee as they behold thee to-day, and those also that
          are afar off as they hear of the torments to which thou art condemned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barsamya said: If God is the help of those who pray to Him, who is he
          that can resist them? Or what is the power that can prevail against
          them? Or thine own threats -- what can they do to them: to men who,
          before thou give commandment concerning them that they shall die, have
          their death already set before their eyes, and are expecting it every
          day?
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Bring not the subject of Christ before my
          judgment-seat; but, instead of this, obey the command of the emperors,
          who command to sacrifice to the gods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barsamya said: Even though we should not lay the subject of Christ
          before thee, yet the sufferings of Christ are portrayed indelibly in
          the worshippers of Christ; and, even more than thou hearkenest to the
          commands of the emperors, do we Christians hearken to the commands of
          Christ the King of kings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Lo! thou hast obeyed Christ and worshipped him up to
          his day: henceforth obey the emperors, and worship the gods whom the
          emperors worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barsamya said: How canst thou bid me renounce that in which I was
          born? when lo! thou didst exact punishment for this at the hand of
          Sharbil, and saidst to him: Why hast thou renounced the paganism in
          which thou wast born, and confessed Christianity to which thou wast a
          stranger? Lo! even before I came into thy presence thou didst thyself
          give testimony on the matter beforehand, and saidst to Sharbil: The
          Christians, to whom thou art gone over, do not renounce that in which
          they were born, but continue in it. Abide, therefore, by the word,
          which thou hast spoken.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Let Barsamya be scourged, because he has rebelled
          against the command of the emperors, and has caused those also who
          were obedient to the emperors to rebel with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, when he had been scourged by five men, he said to him: Reject not
          the command of the emperors, nor insult the emperors' gods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barsamya said: Thy mind is greatly blinded, O judge, and so also is
          that of the emperors who gave thee authority; nor are the things that
          are manifest seen by you; nor do ye perceive that lo! the whole
          creation worships Christ; and thou sayest to me, Do not worship Him,
          as if I alone worshipped Him -- Him whom the watchers above worship on
          high.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: But if ye have taught men to worship Christ, who is it
          that has persuaded those above to worship Christ?
        </p>
        <p>
          Barsamya said: Those above have themselves preached, and have taught
          those below concerning the living worship of the King Christ, seeing
          that they worship Him, and His Father, together with His divine
          Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Give up these things which your writings teach you,
          and which ye teach also to others, and obey those things which the
          emperors have commanded, and spurn not their laws -- lest ye be
          spurned by means of the sword from the light of this venerable sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barsamya said: The light which passeth away and abideth not is not the
          true light, but is only the similitude of that true light, to whose
          beams darkness cometh not near, which is reserved and standeth fast
          for the true worshippers of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Speak not before me of anything else instead of that
          about which I have asked thee, lest I dismiss thee from life to death,
          for denying this light which is seen and confessing that which is not
          seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barsamya said: I cannot leave alone that about which thou askest me,
          and speak of that about which thou dost not ask me. It was thou that
          spakest to me about the light of the sun, and I said before thee that
          there is a light on high which surpasses in its brightness that of the
          sun which thou dost worship and honour. For an account will be
          required of thee for worshipping thy fellow-creature instead of God
          thy Creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Do not insult the very sun, the light of creatures,
          nor set thou at nought the command of the emperors, nor contentiously
          resist the lords of the country, who have authority in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barsamya said: Of what avail is the light of the sun to a blind man
          that cannot see it? For without the eyes of the body, it is not
          possible for its beams to be seen. So that by this thou mayest know
          that it is the work of God, forasmuch as it has no power of its own to
          show its light to the sightless.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: When I have tortured thee as thou deservest, then will
          I write word about thee to the Imperial government, reporting what
          insult thou hast offered to the gods, in that thou madest a disciple
          of Sharbil the priest, one who honoured the gods, and that ye despise
          the laws of the emperors, and that ye make no account of the judges of
          the countries, and live like barbarians, though under the authority of
          the Romans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barsamya said: Thou dost not terrify me by these things which thou
          sayest. It is true, I am not in the presence of the emperors to-day;
          yet lo! before the authority which the emperors have given thee I am
          now standing, and I am brought to trial, because I said, I will not
          renounce God, to whom the heavens and the earth belong, nor His Son
          Jesus Christ, the King of all the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: If thou art indeed assured of this, that thou art
          standing and being tried before the authority of the emperors, obey
          their commands, and rebel not against their laws, lest like a rebel
          thou receive the punishment of death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barsamya said: But if those who rebel against the emperors, even when
          they justly rebel, are deserving of death, as thou sayest; for those
          who rebel against God, the King of kings, even the punishment of death
          by the sword is too little.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: It was not that thou shouldest expound in my
          judgment-hall that thou wast brought in before me, because the trial
          on which thou standest has but little concern with expounding, but
          much concern with the punishment of death, for those who insult the
          emperors and comply not with their laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barsamya said: Because God is not before your eyes, and ye refuse to
          hear the word of God; and graven images that are of no use, |which
          have a mouth and speak not,| are accounted by you as though they
          spake, because your understanding is blinded by the darkness of
          paganism in which ye stand --
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge interrupting said: Leave off those things thou art saying,
          for they will not help thee at all, and worship the gods, before the
          bitter tearings of combs and harsh tortures come upon thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barsamya said: Do thou too leave off the many questions which lo! thou
          askest me, and give command for the stripes and the combs with which
          thou dost menace me: for thy words will not help thee so much as thy
          inflictions will help me.
        </p>
        <p>The judge said: Let Barsamya be hanged up and torn with combs.</p>
        <p>
          And at that very moment there came to him letters from Alusis the
          chief proconsul, father of emperors. And he commanded, and they took
          down Barsamya, and he was not torn with combs; and they took him
          outside of the hall of judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the judge commanded that the nobles, and the chief persons, and
          the princes, and the honourable persons of the city, should come
          before him, that they might hear what was the order that was issued by
          the emperors, by the hand of the proconsuls, the rulers of the
          countries under the authority of the Romans. And it was found that the
          emperors had written by the hand of the proconsuls to the judges of
          the countries: |Since our Majesty commanded that there should be a
          persecution against the people of the Christians, we have heard and
          learned, from the Sharirs whom we have in the countries under the
          dominion of our Majesty, that the people of the Christians are persons
          who eschew murder, and sorcery, and adultery, and theft, and bribery
          and fraud, and those things for which the laws of our Majesty also
          exact punishment from those who commit them. We, therefore, in our
          impartial justice, have commanded that on account of these things the
          persecution of the sword shall cease from them, and that there shall
          be rest and quietness in all our dominions, they continuing to
          minister according to their custom and no man hindering them. It is
          not, however, towards them that we show clemency, but towards their
          laws, agreeing as they do with the laws of our Majesty. And, if any
          man hinder them after this our command, that sword which is ordered by
          us to descend upon those who despise our command, the same do we
          command to descend upon those who despise this decree of our
          clemency.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And, when this command of the emperor's clemency was read, the whole
          city rejoiced that there was quietness and rest for every man. And the
          judge commanded, and they released Barsamya, that he might go down to
          his church. And the Christians went up in great numbers to the
          judgment-hall, together with a great multitude of the population of
          the city, and they received Barsamya with great and exceeding honour,
          repeating psalms before him, according to their custom; there went
          also the wives of the chief of the wise men. And they thronged about
          him, and saluted him, and called him |the persecuted confessor,| |the
          companion of Sharbil the martyr.| And he said to them: Persecuted I
          am, like yourselves; but from the tortures and combs of Sharbil and
          his companions I am clean escaped. And they said to him: We have heard
          from thee that a teacher of the Church has said, |The will, according
          to what it is, so is it accepted.| And, when he was entered into the
          church, he and all the people that were with him, he stood up and
          prayed, and blessed them and sent them away to their homes rejoicing
          and praising God for the deliverance which He had wrought for them and
          for the Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the day after Lysinas the judge of the country had set his hand to
          these Acts, he was dismissed from his authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          I Zenophilus and Patrophilus are the notaries who wrote these Acts,
          Diodorus and Euterpes, Sharirs of the city, bearing witness with us by
          setting-to their hand, as the ancient laws of the ancient kings
          command.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          This Barsamya, bishop of Edessa, who made a disciple of Sharbil, the
          priest of the same city, lived in the days of Fabianus, bishop of the
          city of Rome. And ordination to the priesthood was received by
          Barsamya from Abshelama, who was bishop in Edessa; and by Abshelama
          ordination was received from Palut the First; and by Palut ordination
          was received from Serapion, bishop of Antioch; and by Serapion
          ordination was received from Zephyrinus, bishop of Rome; and
          Zephyrinus of Rome received ordination from Victor of the same place,
          viz., Rome; and Victor received ordination from Eleutherius; and
          Eleutherius received it from Soter; and Soter received it from
          Anicetus; and Anicetus received it from Dapius; and Dapius received it
          from Telesphorus; and Telesphorus received it from Xystus; and Xystus
          received it from Alexander; and Alexander received it from Evartis;
          and Evartis received it from Cletus; and Cletus received it from Anus;
          and Anus received it from Simon Cephas; and Simon Cephas received it
          from our Lord, together with his fellow-apostles, on the first day of
          the week, the day of the ascension of our Lord to His glorious Father,
          which was the fourth day of Heziran, which was is the nineteenth year
          of the reign of Tiberius Cæsar, in the consulship of Rufus and
          Rubelinus, which year was the year 341; for in the year 309 occurred
          the advent of our Saviour in the world, according to the testimony
          which we ourselves have found in a correct register among the
          archives, which errs not at all in whatever it sets forth.
