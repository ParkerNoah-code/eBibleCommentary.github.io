          "Unto you therefore which believe he is precious." -- 1 Peter 2:7.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS TEXT CALLS to my recollection the opening of my ministry. It is
          about eight years since as a lad of sixteen, I stood up for the first
          time in my life to preach the gospel in a cottage to a handful of poor
          people, who had come together for worship. I felt my own inability to
          preach, but I ventured to take this text, "Unto you therefore which
          believe he is precious." I do not think I could have said anything
          upon any other text, but Christ was precious to my soul and I was in
          the flush of my youthful love, and I could not be silent when a
          precious Jesus was the subject. I had but just escaped from the
          bondage of Egypt, I had not forgotten the broken fetter; still did I
          recollect those flames which seemed to burn about my path, and that
          devouring gulf which opened its mouth as if ready to devour me. With
          all these things fresh in my youthful heart, I could speak of his
          preciousness who had been my Saviour, and had plucked me as a brand
          from the burning, and set me upon a rock, and put a new song in my
          mouth, and established my goings. And now, at this time what shall I
          say? "What hath God wrought?" How hath the little one become a
          thousand, and the small one a great people? And what shall I say
          concerning this text, but that if the Lord Jesus was precious then, he
          is as precious now? And if I could declare then , that Jesus was the
          object of my soul's desire, that for him I hoped to live, and for him
          I would be prepared to die, can I not say, God being my witness, that
          he is more precious to me this day than ever he was? In the
          recollection of his unparalleled mercy towards the chief of sinners, I
          must anew devote myself to him, and afresh surrender my heart to him
          who is Lord and King.
        </p>
        <p>
          This remark is uttered by way of introduction, it may seem
          egotistical, but that I cannot help. I must give glory to God in the
          midst of the great congregation, and pay my vows to the Lord now in
          the midst of all his saints, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          My text states a positive fact, namely, that Christ is precious to
          believers. This shall be the first part of our discourse; then in the
          second we will try to answer the question, why is Jesus Christ so
          precious to his believing people? And conclude by declaring the test
          whereby you may try yourselves whether you are believers or not; for
          if you be believers in Christ, then Christ is precious to you, and if
          you think little of him, then rest assured you have not a true and
          saving faith in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, this is a positive fact, that UNTO BELIEVERS JESUS CHRIST IS
          PRECIOUS. In himself he is of inestimable preciousness, for he is the
          very God of very God. He is moreover, perfect man without sin. The
          precious gopher wood of his humanity is overlaid with the pure gold of
          his divinity. He is a mine of jewels, and a mountain of gems. He is
          altogether lovely, but, alas! this blind world seeth not his beauty.
          The painted harlotries of that which, Madam Bubble, the world can see,
          and all men wonder after her. This life, its joy, its lust, its gains,
          its honours, -- these have beauty in the eye of the unregenerate man,
          but in Christ he sees nothing which he can admire. He hears his name
          as a common word, and looks upon his cross as a thing in which he has
          no interest, neglects his gospel, despises his Word, and, perhaps,
          vents fierce spite upon his people. But not so the believer. The man
          who has been brought to know that Christ is the only foundation upon
          which the soul can build its eternal home, he who has been taught that
          Jesus Christ is the first and the last, the Alpha and the Omega, the
          author and the finisher of faith, thinks not lightly of Christ. He
          calls him all his salvation and all his desire; the only glorious and
          lovely one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, this is a fact which has been proved in all ages of the world.
          Look at the beginning of Christ's appearance upon earth. Nay, we might
          go farther back and mark how Christ was precious in prospect to those
          who lived before his incarnation; but, I say, since he has come into
          the world, what abundant proofs have we that he is precious to his
          people! There were men found who were not unwilling to part with
          houses, and lands, and wife, and children, and country, and
          reputation, and honour, and wealth, nay, with life itself, for
          Christ's sake. Such was the charm that Christ had for ancient
          Christians, that if they must renounce their patrimony and their
          earthly wealth for his sake, they did it cheerfully and without a
          murmur. Nay, they could say, that what things were gain they counted
          but loss for Christ's sake, and did esteem them but as dross and dung
          if they could win Christ and be found in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          We talk lightly of these things, but these were no mean sacrifices.
          For a man to leave the partner of his bosom, to be despised by her who
          ought to honour him, to be spit upon by his own children, to be driven
          out by his countrymen, and have his name mentioned as a hissing, and a
          reproach, and a bye-word; this is no easy matter to bear; and yet the
          Christians in the first ages took up this cross, and not only carried
          it patiently, but carried it joyfully; rejoicing in tribulations, if
          those tribulations fell upon them for Christ's sake and the gospel.
          Nay, more than this, Satan has been permitted to put forth his hand
          and touch Christ's people, not only in their goods and in their
          families, but in their bone and in their flesh. And mark how Christ's
          disciples have reckoned nothing to be a loss, so that they might win
          Christ. Stretched upon the rack, their strained nerves have only made
          them sing the louder, as though they were harp strings, only put in
          tune when they were drawn out to their extreme length. They have been
          tortured with hot irons and with the pincers; their backs have been
          ploughed with scourges, but when have you found any of the true
          followers of Christ flinch in the hour of pain? They have borne all
          this, and challenged their persecutors to do more, and invent fresh
          arts and devices, fresh cruelties, and try them. Christ was so
          precious, that all the pain of the body could not make them deny him,
          and when at last they have been taken forth to a shameful death -- let
          the axe and the block, let the cross of crucifixion, let the spear,
          let the fire and the stake, let the wild horse and the desert testify
          that the believer has always been a man, who would suffer all this,
          and vastly more, but who would never renounce his confidence in
          Christ. Look at Polycarp before the lions, when he is brought into the
          midst of the assembly, and it is demanded of him that he will deny his
          God. Thousands of savage eyes look down upon him, and there he stands,
          a feeble man, alone in the arena, but he tells them that "he has known
          his Lord these many years and he never did him a displeasure, and he
          will not deny him at the last." "To the lions!" they cry, "To the
          lions!" and the lions rush upon him, and he is speedily devoured; but
          all this he would have borne at the mouths of a thousand lions, if he
          had a thousand lives, rather than he would have thought anything amiss
          against the Majesty of Jesus of Nazareth. The whole history of the
          ancient church of Christ, proves that Jesus has been an object of his
          peoples' highest veneration; that they set nothing in rivalry with
          him, but cheerfully and readily, without a murmur, or a thought, gave
          up all for Jesus Christ, and rejoiced to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this is just as true to-day as it was then. If to-morrow the stake
          could be set in Smithfield, Christian people are prepared to be fuel
          for the flame. If once more the block fixed on Tower hill, and the axe
          were brought forth from its hiding place, the heads of Christ's people
          would be cheerfully given, if they might but crown the head of Jesus
          and vindicate his cause. Those who declare that the ancient valour of
          the church is departed, know not what they say. The professing church
          may have lost its masculine vigour; the professors of this day may be
          but effeminate dwarfs, the offspring of glorious fathers; but the true
          church, the elect out of the professing church, the remnant whom God
          hath chosen, are as much in love with Jesus as his saints of yore, and
          are as ready to suffer and to die. We challenge hell and its incarnate
          representative, old Rome herself; let her build her dungeons, let her
          revive her inquisitions, let her once more get power in the state to
          cut, and mangle, and burn; we are still able to possess our souls in
          patience. We sometimes feel it were a good thing if persecuting days
          should come again, to try the church once more, and drive away the
          chaff, and make her like a goodly heap of wheat, all pure and clean.
          The rotten branches of the forest may tremble at the hurricane, for
          they shall be swept away, but those that have sap within them tremble
          not. Our roots are intertwisted with the Rock of Ages, and the sap of
          Christ flows within us and we are branches of the living vine, and
          nothing shall sever us from him. We know that not persecution, nor
          famine, nor nakedness, nor peril, nor sword, shall divide us from the
          love of Christ, for in all these things we shall be as the church has
          been, more than conquerors through him that loved us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Does any one think that I exaggerate? Mark, then, if what I have said
          be not true, then Christ has no church at all; for the church that is
          not prepared to suffer, and bleed and die for Christ, is not Christ's
          church. For what does he say? "He that loveth father and mother more
          than me is not worthy of me; and he that taketh not his cross, and
          followeth after me, is not worthy of me." -- Matthew, 10:37-38. Albeit
          that Christ may not put us fully to the test, yet, if we be true, we
          must be ready for the ordeal; and if we be sincere, though we may
          tremble at the thought of it, we shall not tremble in the endurance of
          it. Many a man who says in his heart, "I have not a martyr's faith,"
          has really that noble virtue; and let him but once come to the push,
          and the world shall see the grace that has been hidden, rising a giant
          from his slumbers. The faith which endures the relaxing of the world's
          sunshine, would endure the cutting frost of the world's persecution.
          We need not fear; if we be true to-day, we shall be true always.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not mere fiction, many are the proofs that Christ is still
          precious. Shall I tell you of the silent sufferers for Christ, who at
          this day suffer a martyrdom of which we hear not, but which is true
          and real? How many a young girl there is who follows Christ in the
          midst of an ungodly family; her father upbraids her, laughs at her,
          makes a scoff of her holiness, and pierces her through the heart with
          his sarcasm! Her brothers and her sisters call her "Puritan,"
          "Methodist," and the like, and she is annoyed day by day with what the
          apostle calls, "Trial of cruel mockings." But she bears all this, and
          though the tear is sometimes forced by it from her eye, yet though she
          should weep blood she would "resist unto blood, striving against sin."
          These sufferers are unrecorded, they are not put into a Book of
          Martyrs. We have no Fox to write their martyrology, they have not the
          flesh-contenting knowledge that they shall be publicly honoured; but
          they suffer alone and unheard of, still praying for those who laugh at
          them: bowing themselves before God on their knees in agony, not on
          account of the persecution, but in agony of soul for the persecutors
          themselves, that they may be saved. How many there are of such young
          men in workshops, employed in large establishments, who bend their
          knee at night by the bed-side, in a large room where there are many
          scoffers. Some of us have known this in our youthful days, and have
          had to endure it; but Christ is precious to the silent sufferings of
          his people; these unhonoured martyrdoms prove that his church has not
          ceased to love him, not to esteem him precious.
        </p>
        <p>
          How many there are, too -- how many thousands of unseen and unknown
          labourers for Christ, whose names cannot be here declared. They toil
          from morning till night all through the week, and the Sabbath day
          should be a day of rest to them; but they work more on the Sabbath day
          than on any other day. They are visiting the beds of the sick; their
          feet are weary, and nature says rest, but they go into the lowest dens
          and haunts of the city to speak to the ignorant, and endeavour to
          spread the name and honour of Jesus where it has not been known. There
          are many such who are working hard for Christ, though the church
          scarce knows of it. And how many, too, there are who prove that they
          love Christ by the continual liberality of their offerings. Many are
          the poor people I have discovered, who have denied themselves of this
          and that, because they would serve Christ's cause. And many there are,
          too -- every now and then we find them out -- in the middle ranks of
          society, who give a hundred times as much to the cause of Christ as
          many of the rich and wealthy; and if you knew to what little trials
          they are put, to what shifts they are driven in order to serve Christ,
          you would say, "The man that can do this proves clearly that Christ is
          precious to him." And mark this, the reason why the church is not more
          laborious, not more generous in its gifts to the offertory of the
          Saviour, is just this, because the church of the day is not the church
          of Christ in its mass and bulk. There is a church of Christ within it,
          but the visible church, as it stands before you, is not to be
          considered the church of Christ; we must pass it through the fire, and
          bring the third part through the flame; for this is the day when the
          dross is mingled with gold. How hath the much fine gold become dim;
          how hath the glory departed. Zion is under a cloud. But mark, though
          you see it not, there is a church, a hidden church; an unmoving centre
          amidst the growing of profession, there is a life within this outward
          fungus of a growing Christianity; there is a life that is within, and
          to that hidden host, that chosen company, Christ is precious -- they
          are proving it every day by their patient sufferings, by their
          laborious efforts, by their constant offerings to the church of
          Christ. "Unto you therefore which believe he is precious."
        </p>
        <p>
          I will tell you one thing that proves -- proves to a demonstration,
          that Christ is still precious to his people, and it is this: -- send
          one of Christ's people to hear the most noted preacher of the age,
          whoever that may be; he preaches a very learned sermon, very fine and
          magnificent, but there is not a word about Christ in that sermon.
          Suppose that to be the case, and the Christian man will go out and
          say, "I did not care a farthing for that man's discourse." Why?
          "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have
          laid him. I heard nothing about Christ." Send that man on the Sabbath
          morning to hear some hedge and ditch preacher, some one who cuts the
          king's English about never so badly, but who preaches Jesus Christ --
          you will see the tears rolling down that man's face, and when he comes
          out he will say, "I do not like that man's bad grammar; I do not like
          the many mistakes he has made, but oh! it has done my heart good, for
          he spoke about Christ." That, after all, is the main thing for the
          Christian; he wants to hear about his Lord, and if he hears him
          magnified he will overlook a hundred faults. In fact, you will find
          that Christians are all agreed, that the best sermon is that which is
          fullest of Christ. They never like to hear a sermon unless there is
          something of Christ in it. A Welsh minister who was preaching last
          Sabbath at the chapel of my dear brother, Jonathan George, was saying,
          that Christ was the sum and substance of the gospel, and he broke out
          into this story: -- A young man had been preaching in the presence of
          a venerable divine, and after he had done he went to the old minister,
          and said, "What do you think of my sermon?" "A very poor sermon
          indeed," said he. "A poor sermon?" said the young man, "it took me a
          long time to study it." "Ay, no doubt of it." "Why, did you not think
          my explanation of the text a very good one?" "Oh, yes," said the old
          preacher, "very good indeed." "Well, then, why do you say it is a poor
          sermon? Didn't you think the metaphors were appropriate and the
          arguments conclusive?" "Yes, they were very good as far as that goes,
          but still it was a very poor sermon." "Will you tell me why you think
          it a poor sermon?" "Because," said he, "there was no Christ in it."
          "Well," said the young man, "Christ was not in the text; we are not to
          be preaching Christ always, we must preach what is in the text." So
          the old man said, "Don't you know young man that from every town, and
          every village, and every little hamlet in England, wherever it may be,
          there is a road to London?" "Yes," said the young man. "Ah!" said the
          old divine "and so form every text in Scripture, there is a road to
          the metropolis of the Scriptures, that is Christ. And my dear brother,
          your business in when you get to a text, to say, Now what is the road
          to Christ?' and then preach a sermon, running along the road towards
          the great metropolis -- Christ. And," said he, "I have never yet found
          a text that had not got a road to Christ in it, and if I ever do find
          one that has not a road to Christ in it, I will make one; I will go
          over hedge and ditch but I would get at my Master, for the sermon
          cannot do any good unless there is a savour of Christ in it." Now
          since you say amen to that, and declare that what you want to hear is
          Jesus Christ, the text is proved -- "Unto you therefore which believe
          he is precious."
        </p>
        <p>
          But if you want to try this again and prove it, go and see some of our
          sick and dying friends; go and talk to them about the Reform Bill, and
          they will look you in the face and say, "Oh, I am going from this
          time-state: it is a very small matter to me whether the Reform Bill
          will be carried or not." You will not find them much interested in
          that matter. Well, then, sit down and talk to them about the weather,
          and how the crops are getting on -- "Well, it is a good prospect for
          wheat this year." They will say, "Ah, my harvest is ripening in
          glory." Introduce the most interesting topic you can, and a believer,
          who is lying on the verge of eternity, will find nothing precious in
          it; but sit down by the bedside of this man, and he may be very near
          gone, almost unconscious, and begin to talk about Jesus -- mention
          that precious soul-reviving, soul-strengthening name Jesus, and you
          will see his eye glisten, and the blanched cheek will be flushed once
          more -- "Ah," he will say, "Precious Jesus, that is the name which
          calms my fears, and bids my sorrows cease." You will see that you have
          given the man a strong tonic, and that his whole frame is braced up
          for the moment. Even when he dies, the thought of Jesus Christ and the
          prospect of seeing him shall make him living in the midst of death,
          strong in the midst of weakness, and fearless in the midst of
          trembling. And this proves, by the experience of God's people, that
          with those who believe in him, Christ is and ever must be a precious
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second thing is, WHY IS CHRIST PRECIOUS TO THE BELIEVER? I
          observe -- and I shall run over those particulars very briefly, though
          they would be worthy of a long, long sermon -- Jesus Christ is
          precious to the believer, because he is intrinsically precious. But
          here let me take you through an exercise in grammar; here is an
          adjective, let us go through it. He is precious positively; he is more
          precious than anything comparatively; he is most precious of all
          things, and most precious even if all things were rolled into one and
          put into competition with him; he is thus precious superlatively. Now,
          there are few things you can thus deal with. You say, a man is a good
          man, he is good positively, and you say he is a great deal better than
          many other people; he is good comparatively: but you can never truly
          say to any man that he is good superlatively, because there he would
          still be found short of perfection. But Christ is good positively,
          comparatively, and superlatively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is he good positively? Election is a good thing; to be chosen of God,
          and precious; but we are elect in Christ Jesus. Adoption is a good
          thing; to be adopted into the family of God is a good thing -- ah, but
          we are adopted in Christ Jesus and made joint-heirs with him. Pardon
          is a good thing -- who will not say so? -- ay, but we are pardoned
          through the precious blood of Jesus. Justification -- is not that a
          noble thing, to be robed about with a perfect righteousness? -- ay,
          but we are justified in Jesus. To be preserved -- is not that a
          precious thing? -- ay; but we are preserved in Christ Jesus, and kept
          by his power even to the end. Perfection -- who shall say that this is
          not precious? Well, but we are perfect in Christ Jesus. Resurrection,
          is not that glorious? We are risen with him. To ascend up on high, is
          not that precious? But he hath raised us up and made us sit together
          with him in heavenly places in Jesus Christ -- so that Christ must be
          good positively, for he is all the best things in one. And if all
          these be good, surely he must be good in whom, and by whom, and to
          whom, and through are all these precious things.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Christ is good comparatively. Bring anything here and compare with
          him. One of the brightest jewels we can have is liberty. If I be not
          free, let me die. Put the halter to my neck but put not the fetter to
          my wrist -- a free man I must be while I live. Will not the patriot
          say that he would give his blood to buy liberty, and think it a cheap
          price? Ay, but put liberty side by side with Christ, and I would wear
          the fetter for Christ and rejoice in the chain. The apostle Paul
          himself could say, "I would that ye were altogether such I am," -- and
          he might add, "except these bonds," but though he excepted bonds for
          others, he did not except them for himself, for he rejoiced in the
          chain and counted it as a mark of honor. Besides liberty, what a
          precious thing is life! "Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath, will
          he give for his life." But let a Christian -- a true Christian, once
          have the choice between life and Christ, -- "No," says he, "I can die,
          but I cannot deny; I can burn, but I cannot turn. I confess Christ and
          perish in the flame; but I cannot deny Christ, even though you exalt
          me to a throne." There would be no choice between the two. And then
          whatever earthly good there may be in comparison with Christ, the
          believer's testimony goes to prove that Christ is precious
          comparatively, for there is nothing that can match with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then to go higher still -- Christ is good superlatively. The
          superlative of all things is heaven, and if it could be possible to
          put Christ in competition with heaven, the Christian would not stop a
          moment in his choice; he would sooner be on earth with Christ than be
          in heaven without him. Nay, I do not know whether he would not go
          almost as far as Rutherford, who said, "Lord, I would sooner be in
          hell with thee than in heaven without thee; for if I were in heaven
          without thee it would be a hell to me, and if I were in hell with thee
          it would be a heaven to me." We may put it so, and every Christian
          will subscribe to it. Now, come ye messengers of the world and take on
          your shoulders all its treasures. Cæsar, pour out thy gold in one
          glittering pile; Cæsar, lay down thine honours here in one gaudy heap;
          here, Tiberius, bring all the joys of Capri's lust and vice; Solomon,
          bring here all the treasures of wisdom; Alexander, bring all thy
          triumphs; Napoleon, bring thy wide-spread empire and thy fame, put
          them all here, all that earth calls good; and now come, thou bleeding
          Lamb of God, thou marred and matchless Saviour, come here and tread
          these beneath thy feet, for what are all these compared with thee? I
          pour contempt on them all. Now am I dead to all the world, and all the
          world is dead to me. The whole realm of nature is small in comparison
          with thee, as a drop in the bucket when compared with a boundless
          ocean. Jesus Christ, then, is precious superlatively.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. What more can we say? Still to answer this question again: Why is
          Christ precious to the believer more than to any other man? Why it is
          the believer's want that makes Christ precious to him. That is one
          answer. We have been having a small shower of rain lately, and I dare
          say there are very few of you who felt grateful for it; since it gave
          you a little wetting coming here. But suppose that shower of rain
          could have fallen on the desert of Arabia, what a precious thing it
          would have been. Yea, every rain drop would have been worth a pearl;
          and as for the shower, though it had rained gold dust, the rich
          deposit would not have been comparable to the flood when it descended
          from on high. But what is the reason that water is so precious there?
          Simply because it is so rare. Suppose I am in England; there is
          abundance of water and I cannot sell it; water is so common, and
          therefore so cheap. But put a man in the desert and let the water-skin
          be dried up, let him come to the well wherein he expected to find
          water, and it has failed him; can you not conceive that that small
          drop of water might be worth a king's ransom? Nay, that a man might
          hoard it up, and conceal it from all his comrades, because on that
          small drop of water depended his life? The way to prize water is to
          value it with a tongue like a firebrand, and with a mouth like an
          oven. Then can I estimate its value when I know its want. So with
          Christ. The worldling does not care for Christ, because he has never
          hungered and thirsted after him; but the Christian is athirst for
          Christ; he is in a dry and thirsty land, where not water is, and his
          heart and his flesh pant after God, yea for the living God; and as the
          thirsty soul dying, cries out water, water, water, so the Christian
          cries out Christ, Christ, Christ! This is the one thing needful for
          me, and if I have it not, this thirst must destroy me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark, too, that the believer may be found in many aspects, and you
          will always find that his needs will endear Christ to him. Here is a
          man about to be tried for his life. Before he had committed the wrong,
          he used to say, "Lawyers, attornies, pleaders, away with them, what is
          the good of them?" Now he has got into prison he thinks very
          differently. He says, "I wish I could get a good special pleader to
          plead my cause;" and he runs over the roll to see the best man to
          plead for him. At last he says, "Here is a man, if he could plead my
          cause I might hope to escape, but I have no money with which to engage
          him;" and he says to his wife -- "Wife, we must sell our house;" or,
          "We must get money somehow, for I am on trial for my life, and I must
          have an advocate." And what will not a woman do to get an advocate for
          her husband? Why, she will pledge the last rag she has to get one.
          Now, does not the believer feel himself to be in just such a position?
          He is a poor sinner on trial for his life, and he wants an advocate;
          and every time he looks on Christ pleading his cause before the
          Father's throne, he says, "O what a precious Christ he is to a poor
          sin-destroyed sinner, for he pleads his cause before the throne."
        </p>
        <p>
          But suppose another case; that of a man drawn for a soldier. In such
          times men always look out for substitutes. I remember when the ballot
          was coming for the militia, how every man joined a substitute club in
          order that if he were drawn he might not go himself. Now suppose a man
          had been drawn, how valuable would a substitute have been -- for no
          man in his senses likes to be food for powder -- he would rather a man
          without brains go and do such work as that, but as for him he
          estimates himself at too high a price. But suppose he is not only
          drawn for a soldier, but condemned to die. See yon poor wretch coming
          up the gallows stairs; some one whispers to him, "What would you give
          for a substitute now? What would you give for some one to come and
          bear this punishment?" See his eye rolls madness at the thought. "A
          substitute," says he, "I could not buy one for the whole world. Who
          would be a substitute for me, to swing into eternity amidst the
          yellings of a crowd?" But suppose -- and we are only supposing what
          has actually occurred -- suppose this man saw not only the gallows and
          the drop, but hell fire before him, and it were said to him, "You must
          burn in that for ever unless you find a substitute," would not that be
          a precious one? Now, mark, that is just our position. The Christian
          feels that hell is before him, if it were not that he has a glorious
          substitute. Jesus came forward, and said, "I will bear that
          punishment; pour hell on me, my Father let me drink damnation dry;"
          and he did it; he endured all those pains, or an equivalent for them;
          he suffered in the rebel's stead; and now, through him the substitute,
          we are absolved and free. Oh, must not he be a precious Christ?
        </p>
        <p>
          But think of Christ again, and then think of the believer's wants. I
          will try and run over a number of them. The believer is a silly sheep.
          What a precious thing is a shepherd, and how precious are green
          pastures and still waters. The believer is like a desolate woman. What
          a precious thing is a husband who shall provide for her, and shall
          console and cherish her. The believer is a pilgrim, and the hot sun
          beats on him. What a precious thing is the shadow of a great rock in a
          weary land. The believer is a bond-slave by nature. What a precious
          thing is the trump of jubilee, and the ransom-price that sets him
          free. The believer, by nature, is a sinking, drowning man. How
          precious to him is that plank of free-grace, the cross of Christ, on
          which he puts his poor trembling hand and secures glory. But what more
          shall I say? Time would fail me to tell of all the wants of the
          believer, and of the all-abounding and ever-flowing streams of love
          that flow from Christ, the fountain that fills the believer to the
          brim. O say, ye children of God, is he not while ye are in these
          lowlands of want and suffering, inconceivably, unutterably,
          superlatively precious to you?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But once more. Look at the believer not only in his wants, but in
          his highest earthly state. The believer is a man that was once blind
          and now sees. And what a precious thing is light to a man that sees.
          If I, as a believer, have an eye, how much I need the sun to shine. If
          I have no light my eye becomes a torture, and I might as well have
          been blind. And when Christ gives sight to the blind he makes his
          people a seeing people. It is then that they find what a precious
          thing is the sight, and how pleasant a thing it is for a man to behold
          the sun. The believer is a man that is quickened. A dead corpse wants
          no clothing, for it feels no cold. Let a man once be quickened and he
          finds himself naked, and wants clothing. From the very fact that the
          Christian is a quickened man, he values the robe of righteousness that
          is put about him. Christ touches his people's ears and opens them; but
          it were better for man to be deaf than to hear for ever doleful groans
          and hissings. But such must he have been, ever hearing it if it were
          not for Christ playing sweet music to him every day, and pouring
          streams of melody into his ears through his promises. Yes, I say, the
          very new-born powers of the Christian would be very channels for
          misery if it were not for Christ. Even in his highest estate the
          Christian must feel that Christ is necessary unto him, and then he
          must conclude that Christ is precious to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But believer, how precious is Christ to thee in the hour of conviction
          of sin, when he says, "Thy sins which are many, are all forgiven
          thee." How precious to thee in the hour of sickness, when he comes to
          thee and says, "I will make all thy bed in thy sickness." How precious
          to thee in the day of trial, when he says, "All things work together
          for thy good." How precious when friends are buried, for he says, "I
          am the resurrection and the life." How precious in thy grey old age,
          "even in old age I am with thee, and to hoary hairs will I carry you."
          How precious in the lone chamber of death, for "I will fear no evil,
          thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff comfort me." But, last of all,
          how precious will Christ be when we see him as he is. All we know of
          Christ here is as nothing compared with what we shall know hereafter.
          Believer, when thou seest Christ's face now, thou only seest if
          through a veil -- Christ is so glorious, that like Moses he is
          compelled to put a veil upon his face, for his poor people while they
          are here are so feeble that they could not behold him face to face.
          And if he be lovely here, when he is marred and spit upon, how lovely
          must he be when he is adored and worshipped. If he is precious on his
          cross, how much more precious when he sits on his throne. If I can
          weep before him, and love him, and live to him, when I see him as the
          despised man of Nazareth; Oh, how shall my spirit be knit to him, how
          shall my heart be absorbed with love to him, when I see his face and
          behold his crown of glory, when I mark the harpings of the
          never-ceasing harpers who harp his praise. Wait awhile, Christian. If
          he is precious to the believer now, when faith is turned to sight he
          will be more precious still. Go out of this hall, and cry, "O Lord
          Jesus, I must love thee, I must serve thee better, I must live for
          thee; I must be ready to die for thee -- for
        </p>
        <p>'Thou art precious to my soul,</p>
        <p>My transport and my trust.'"</p>
        <p>
          This brings me to conclude -- and here I want your solemn and earnest
          attention while each one for himself shall answer this question -- my
          hearer, is Christ precious to you? My young brother, you of the same
          age as myself, is Jesus precious to you in your youth? Wherewithal
          shall a young man cleanse his way? only by taking heed thereto
          according to Christ's word, and by walking in his footsteps. Ye men
          and women of middle age, is Christ precious to you? Remember that this
          world is but a dream, and if you have not something more satisfactory
          than that, you will be disappointed, even though you succeed beyond
          your highest wishes. And ye grey headed men, who are going tottering
          to your graves, whose life is like a candle-snuff, almost expiring,
          like a lamp whose oil is spent. Is Christ precious to you, ye with the
          bald head, and with the hoary lock, is Jesus precious to your soul?
          Remember, on your answer to this question depends your condition. You
          believe, if he is precious to you, but if he is not precious, then you
          are not believers, and you are condemned already because you believe
          not on the Son of God. Now, which is it? Oh, methinks some of you feel
          as if you could spring from your seats, and say, "Yes, he is precious
          to me, I cannot deny it." Once there was a good minister who was
          catechising his class, and he said to the young people, "The question
          which I am about to ask is such that I want none of you to answer but
          those who can answer from your heart." The congregation was gathered
          together, and he put this question to them concerning Christ --
          "Suppose Christ was here, and should say, Lovest thou me?' what would
          be your reply?" He looked around, and glanced upon all the young men
          and the young women, and said, "Jesus speaks to you the first time,
          and says, Lovest thou me?' He speaks a second time, and he says,
          Lovest thou me?'" There was a solemn pause and no one answered; and
          the congregation looked at the class, and at last the minister said
          once more, "Jesus speaks by me a third time, and says, Lovest thou
          me?'" Up rose a young woman, who could keep her seat no longer, and,
          bursting into tears, said, "Yea, Lord, thou knowest all things, thou
          knowest that I love thee." Now, how many are there here who could say
          that? Could not you now, if this were the time -- although you might
          be bashful in the midst of so many -- could you not, if Christ asked
          you the question, boldly say, though in the midst of enemies -- "Yea,
          Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee." Well,
          if you can give such an answer as that, go home and pray that others
          may be brought to love him, for you yourselves are saved; but if you
          are compelled to be silent to such a question as that, O may God lead
          you to seek Christ, may you too be driven to the cross, may you there
          see his dear bleeding wounds, may you behold his open side, and
          falling at his feet, may you say, "I trust thee, I rely upon thee, I
          depend upon thee," and he will say, "I have saved thee;" and then will
          you spring to your feet, and say, "Lord I love thee, because thou hast
          first loved me." May such be the end of this sermon, and to God be all
          the glory.
