          1. There being thus three kinds of substances, they declare of all
          that is material (which they also describe as being "on the left
          hand") that it must of necessity perish, inasmuch as it is incapable
          of receiving any afflatus of incorruption. As to every animal
          existence (which they also denominate "on the right hand"), they hold
          that, inasmuch as it is a mean between the spiritual and the material,
          it passes to the side to which inclination draws it. Spiritual
          substance, again, they describe as having been sent forth for this
          end, that, being here united with that which is animal, it might
          assume shape, the two elements being simultaneously subjected to the
          same discipline. And this they declare to be "the salt" and "the light
          of the world." For the animal substance had need of training by means
          of the outward senses; and on this account they affirm that the world
          was created, as well as that the Saviour came to the animal substance
          (which was possessed of free-will), that He might secure for it
          salvation. For they affirm that He received the first-fruits of those
          whom He was to save [as follows], from Achamoth that which was
          spiritual, while He was invested by the Demiurge with the animal
          Christ, but was begirt by a [special] dispensation with a body endowed
          with an animal nature, yet constructed with unspeakable skill, so that
          it might be visible and tangible, and capable of enduring suffering.
          At the same time, they deny that He assumed anything material [into
          His nature], since indeed matter is incapable of salvation. They
          further hold that the consummation of all things will take place when
          all that is spiritual has been formed and perfected by Gnosis
          (knowledge); and by this they mean spiritual men who have attained to
          the perfect knowledge of God, and been initiated into these mysteries
          by Achamoth. And they represent themselves to be these persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Animal men, again, are instructed in animal things; such men,
          namely, as are established by their works, and by a mere faith, while
          they have not perfect knowledge. We of the Church, they say, are these
          persons. Wherefore also they maintain that good works are necessary to
          us, for that otherwise it is impossible we should be saved. But as to
          themselves, they hold that they shall be entirely and undoubtedly
          saved, not by means of conduct, but because they are spiritual by
          nature. For, just as it is impossible that material substance should
          partake of salvation (since, indeed, they maintain that it is
          incapable of receiving it), so again it is impossible that spiritual
          substance (by which they mean themselves) should ever come under the
          power of corruption, whatever the sort of actions in which they
          indulged. For even as gold, when submersed in filth, loses not on that
          account its beauty, but retains its own native qualities, the filth
          having no power to injure the gold, so they affirm that they cannot in
          any measure suffer hurt, or lose their spiritual substance, whatever
          the material actions in which they may be involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Wherefore also it comes to pass, that the "most perfect" among them
          addict themselves without fear to all those kinds of forbidden deeds
          of which the Scriptures assure us that "they who do such things shall
          not inherit the kingdom of God." For instance, they make no scruple
          about eating meats offered in sacrifice to idols, imagining that they
          can in this way contract no defilement. Then, again, at every heathen
          festival celebrated in honour of the idols, these men are the first to
          assemble; and to such a pitch do they go, that some of them do not
          even keep away from that bloody spectacle hateful both to God and men,
          in which gladiators either fight with wild beasts, or singly encounter
          one another. Others of them yield themselves up to the lusts of the
          flesh with the utmost greediness, maintaining that carnal things
          should be allowed to the carnal nature, while spiritual things are
          provided for the spiritual. Some of them, moreover, are in the habit
          of defiling those women to whom they have taught the above doctrine,
          as has frequently been confessed by those women who have been led
          astray by certain of them, on their returning to the Church of God,
          and acknowledging this along with the rest of their errors. Others of
          them, too, openly and without a blush, having become passionately
          attached to certain women, seduce them away from their husbands, and
          contract marriages of their own with them. Others of them, again, who
          pretend at first to live in all modesty with them as with sisters,
          have in course of time been revealed in their true colours, when the
          sister has been found with child by her [pretended] brother.

          4. And committing many other abominations and impieties, they run us
          down (who from the fear of God guard against sinning even in thought
          or word) as utterly contemptible and ignorant persons, while they
          highly exalt themselves, and claim to be perfect, and the elect seed.
          For they declare that we simply receive grace for use, wherefore also
          it will again be taken away from us; but that they themselves have
          grace as their own special possession, which has descended from above
          by means of an unspeakable and indescribable conjunction; and on this
          account more will be given them. They maintain, therefore, that in
          every way it is always necessary for them to practise the mystery of
          conjunction. And that they may persuade the thoughtless to believe
          this, they are in the habit of using these very words, "Whosoever
          being in this world does not so love a woman as to obtain possession
          of her, is not of the truth, nor shall attain to the truth. But
          whosoever being of this world has intercourse with woman, shall not
          attain to the truth, because he has so acted under the power of
          concupiscence." On this account, they tell us that it is necessary for
          us whom they call animal men, and describe as being of the world, to
          practise continence and good works, that by this means we may attain
          at length to the intermediate habitation, but that to them who are
          called "the spiritual and perfect" such a course of conduct is not at
          all necessary. For it is not conduct of any kind which leads into the
          Pleroma, but the seed sent forth thence in a feeble, immature state,
          and here brought to perfection.<br />
