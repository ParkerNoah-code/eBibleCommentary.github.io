        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1037)</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him
          that hath no helper." -- Psalm 72:12.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS IS A ROYAL PSALM. In it you see predictions of Christ, not upon
          the cross, but upon the throne. In reference to his manhood as well as
          to his godhead, he is exalted and extolled and very high. He is the
          king -- the king's son, truly with absolute sway, stretching his
          scepter from sea to sea, and "from the river even unto the ends of the
          earth." It is remarkable that in this psalm which so fully celebrates
          the extent of his realm and the sovereignty of his government, there
          is so much attention drawn to the minuteness of his care for the
          lowly, his personal sympathy with the poor, and the large benefits
          they are to enjoy from his kingdom. Where Christ is highest and we are
          lowest, and the two meet, there is "glory to God in the highest, and
          on earth peace, goodwill towards men." I might almost raise the
          question whether this psalm is more a tribute of homage to the
          Messiah, or a treasury of comfort for his poor subjects. We will
          compound the controversy by saying that as Christ here is highly
          exalted, so his poor needy ones are highly blessed, and while it is a
          blessing to them that he is exalted, it is an exaltation to him that
          they are blessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turning to our text without further preface, we shall note in it the
          special objects of great grace. "He shall deliver the needy when he
          crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper;" then, the special
          blessings which are allotted to them. Here it is said that he shall
          deliver them, but all through the psalms there are scattered promises
          full of instruction and consolation all meant for them. And, lastly,
          the special season which God has appointed for the dispensing of these
          favors. "He shall deliver the needy when he crieth." That shall be
          God's time. When it is our time to cry, it shall be God's time to
          deliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, notice THE SPECIAL OBJECTS OF GREAT GRACE. There is a
          three-fold description -- they are needy, they are poor, they have no
          helper.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are needy. In this they are like all the sons of men. We begin
          life in a needy state. We are full of needs in our infancy, and cannot
          help ourselves. We continue throughout life in a needy state. The very
          breath in our nostrils hath to be the gift of God's goodness. In him
          we live, and move, and have our being. And, as we grow old our needs
          become even more apparent. The staff on which we lean reveals to us
          our needs, and our infirmities all tell us what needy creatures we
          are. We need temporal things and we need spiritual things. Our body
          needs, our soul needs, our spirit needs. We need to be kept from evil;
          we need to be led into the paths of righteousness; we need on the
          outset that grace should be implanted; when implanted, we need that it
          be nurtured; when nurtured, we need that it be perfected and made to
          bring forth fruit. We are never a moment without need. We wake up, and
          our first glance might reveal our needs to us, and when we fall asleep
          it is upon a poor man's pillow, for we need that God should preserve
          us through the night. We have needs when we are on our knees, else
          where would be the energy of our prayers? We have needs when we try to
          sing, else how should our uncircumcised lips praise him aright? We
          have needs when we are relieving the needs of others, lest we become
          proud of our almsgiving. We have need in preaching, need in hearing;
          we have need in working, need in suffering, need in resting. What is
          our life but one long need? All men are full of needs. But God's
          peculiar people feel this need -- they not only confess it is so, but
          they know it experimentally. They are full of needs. Once they thought
          that they were rich and increased in goods, and had need of nothing,
          but now, through the enlightenment of God's Spirit, they feel
          themselves to be naked, and poor, and miserable. Their needs were
          great before, but they appear now to be incalculable, more in number
          than the hairs of their heads. They have need of a covering for the
          sin of the past; they have need of help against the temptation of the
          present; they have need of perseverance as to the entire future. If
          there are any people under heaven who could claim the title of
          "needy," above all others, it is not the pauper in the workhouse, nor
          the mendicant who asks alms in the streets, but it is the child of
          God, for he feels himself to be so dependent that the more he gets
          from his great Benefactor the more he requires, and the more he must
          have to satisfy the enlarged desires of a heart that begins to know
          the will of God concerning us. Our needs are great and constant.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second description given is that he is poor -- "the poor also." A
          man might be needy, and be able to supply his own need. As fast as his
          needs arose, he might have sufficient wealth to be able to procure
          what he wanted. I speak merely of his temporal wants. But, with regard
          to us in spiritual things, we are not only needy, but we are poor to
          utter destitution -- there is nothing within our reach that we can
          help ourselves with. We have need of water for our thirst, but
          nature's buckets are empty, and her cisterns are broken. We have need
          of bread, but nature's granary is bare. Like the prodigal son in a far
          off country, there is a famine, a mighty famine, in that land, and we
          are in want. We have need of clothing; we have found that we are
          naked, and we are ashamed, but our fig leaves will not serve us, and
          we are too poor to buy a garment for ourselves. We are so poor that
          when a want comes it only shows us how empty the treasury is; and
          every want while it draws upon us meets with no fitting response;
          there is nothing, nothing, nothing, in human nature at its very best,
          that can keep pace with its own needs. Speak of self-reliance! -- tis
          well enough in matters of the world, but self-reliance is absolutely
          madness in the things of God. We have heard of self-made men, but if
          any man would enter heaven, he must be a God-made man from first to
          last, for all that can come out of human nature will still be defiled.
          The stream shall never mount higher than the fountain-head, and the
          fountain-head of human nature is pollution, total depravity. It cannot
          rise higher than that, let it do its best. We are very needy, and very
          poor. If there be any poor in all the world, who have tasted the
          bitter ingredients of this cup of sorrow, it is God's people. We are
          very needy and very poor, though we did not always think so. When the
          discovery was first made to us, we felt the smart as those do "who
          have seen better days." Once we fancied ourselves able to do our work
          and sure to get our wages; we did hope to merit a reward for our good
          conduct; and we thought it was only for us to add a little piety to
          our decent morals in order to be well pleasing to God and our own
          conscience. Ah, sirs! when we woke from these foolish dreams, and
          faced our own abject poverty, how ashamed we were; how we shunned the
          light; how we sat alone and avoided company; how fear preyed on our
          heart; with what anguish we chattered to ourselves, saying, "What
          shall I do? What shall I do?" Poor indeed we are and we know it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, it is said they have no helper. Now, until God enlightens
          us, we seem to have a great many helpers. We fancy -- perhaps we once
          fancied -- that a priest could save us. If we have a grain of grace we
          have given up that idea. Perhaps we imagined that our parents would
          help us, that our godly ancestry might stand us in some stead: -- but
          we have long ago been brought to the conviction that we must each
          stand personally before God, for only personal religion is of any
          value. At one time we placed some dependence upon the ministry we
          attended, and hoped that in some favored hour that ministry might be
          of use to us; but, if God has awakened us, we look higher than pulpits
          and preachers now. Our eyes are up towards the hills whence cometh our
          help, and as to all earthly things, we see no help in them. "Cursed is
          he that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm." "He shall be like
          the heath in the desert -- he shall not see when good cometh." The
          Lord grant us all to be reduced to this -- that we have no helper,
          because when we have no helper here, he will become our helper and our
          salvation. Put the three words together and you have a very correct
          description of the awakened people of God -- needy, poor, and having
          no helper.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have felt this, beloved, very keenly some of us just before we
          looked to Christ. Oh! we can remember now when we wanted to have our
          sins forgiven us, we would have given all we had if we could but have
          found mercy; -- we were full of needs. We turned all our good works
          over, but they had all become mouldy and worm-eaten, and they stank in
          our nostrils. We tried our prayers. We used to fancy if we began to
          pray earnestly it would all be well with us, but alas! alas! we found
          our prayers to be poor comforts -- broken reeds. We looked all around
          us, and we could get no consolation. Even Scripture did not seem to
          cheer us; the very promises seemed to shut their doors against us. We
          had no helper. Oh, do you remember then when you cried to God in your
          trouble, and he delivered you? I know you verified the truth of the
          promise in our text, "He shall deliver the needy when he crieth."
        </p>
        <p>
          Since that time, we have been equally needy; we have been making fresh
          proof of our indigence; and getting into straits from which we could
          by no means extricate ourselves. Indeed, when a Christian is richest
          in grace he is poorest in himself. The way to grow rich in grace is to
          feel your poverty. Whenever you think you have stored up a little
          strength, a little comfort, a little provision against a rainy day,
          you are pretty sure to have the trouble you bargained for, and to miss
          the resources you counted on. Estimate your true wealth before God by
          your entire dependence on him. The more you have, the less you have,
          and the less you have, the more you have. When you have nothing at all
          in yourself, then Christ is all in all to you. The perpetual condition
          of every child of God in himself is that of a needy and a poor and a
          helpless one -- on the high mountains with his Lord, rejoicing in his
          love, yet is he even there in himself less than nothing and vanity --
          still poor and needy.
        </p>
        <p>
          There have been times when we felt this very powerfully, perhaps, very
          painfully. Has Satan ever beset you, my brethren, with his fierce
          temptations? No doubt many of you have had to feel the ferocity of his
          attacks. Perhaps, blasphemous thoughts have been injected into your
          mind -- dark forebodings, such as these, "God has forsaken me."
          Perhaps, he has said, "He has sinned himself out of the covenant -- he
          is a castaway," and your poor little faith has tried to hold on to
          Christ, but it seemed as if she must be driven from her hold. While
          others found it as you thought easy to get to heaven, you realised the
          truth of the text -- "The righteous scarcely are saved." You have had
          to fight for every inch of ground, and it seemed to you often as
          though you had not a spark of grace in you, not a ray of hope, and not
          so much as a single grain of the grace of God within your heart. Ah!
          and at such times you have been poor and needy, and you have had no
          helper. And, perhaps, at such seasons, too, temporal trouble may have
          come in. Whoever may go through the world without trouble, God's
          people never do.
        </p>
        <p>"The path of sorrow, and that path alone,</p>
        <p>Leads to the place where sorrow is unknown."</p>
        <p>
          "In the world ye shall have tribulation" is as sure a promise as that
          other, "In me ye shall have peace." The trials of God's servants are
          sometimes extremely severe. Not a few are literally as well as
          spiritually poor. Hunger, privation, and embarrassment haunt their
          steps. And when you once come to be poor, how often does it happen
          that you have no helper. In the summer of prosperity your friends and
          acquaintances are numerous as the leaves of the forest, but in the
          winter of your losses and distresses, your friends are few indeed;
          your neighbors stand aloof, your old mates desert you, for like the
          wind your trials have borne them all away as sere leaves, and you
          cannot find them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, do not think that the Lord has cast you off, because he is thus
          chastening you with the rod of men; take it as an exercise of your
          faith, and go to him and plead this promise, "He shall deliver the
          needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper."
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have set before you the character of God's especial objects of
          sovereign grace; they are poor and needy spiritually. Do you ask why
          is it that God selects these? Our first answer is, he giveth no
          account of his matters; he doeth as he will. He is a sovereign; who
          shall say unto him, "What doest thou?" And, in order that he may make
          that sovereignty clear to the sons of men, he is pleased to select
          those whom naturally we might expect him to pass by. Did not Jesus
          lift his eyes to heaven full of gratitude and say, "I thank thee, O
          Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from
          the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so,
          Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight." Not many great men after
          the flesh, not many mighty are chosen, but God hath chosen the poor of
          this world, he hath chosen the things that are despised, (and as the
          Apostle puts it) "Things that are not hath God chosen to bring to
          nought the things that are, that no flesh should glory in his
          presence." When the chariot of the Eternal comes from above, he bids
          it roll far downward from the skies; he passes by the towers of
          haughty kings; he leaves the palaces of princes and the halls of
          senates, and down to the hovels of cottagers the chariot of his grace
          descends, for there he sees with joy and delight the objects of his
          everlasting love. "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I
          will have compassion on whom I will have compassion," is the word of
          divine sovereignty, and God makes it true by taking the poor and the
          needy, and them that have no helper.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, if we may enquire into the reason, we see in the poor, and the
          needy, and the helpless, a reason for God's grace. They are the
          persons who are most willing to accept it, for they are the persons
          who most require it. Your generosity will not stand to be dictated to,
          but, at the same time, you usually prefer to give to those who want
          most. Wise mercy seeks out chief misery, and God therefore delights to
          give his blessings to those who need them most, not to those who fancy
          they deserve them -- they shall have none of them, but those who need
          them, they shall have all of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a soul is made to feel its own poverty, it does not set itself up
          in rivalry with Christ; it does not pretend to be able to help itself;
          it has no disputing about the terms of the gospel. A sinner, when he
          is thoroughly famished, has such an appetite that he eats such things
          as God's mercy sets before him, and he raises no question. A proud
          Pharisee will say, "I will not submit to this, to be saved by faith
          alone -- I will not have it. To accept mercy as the absolute gift of
          heaven, irrespective of my character, I cannot endure it." The high
          soul of a Pharisee, I say, kicks at it. But when God has brought a man
          low, till like the publican he cries, "God be merciful to me a
          sinner," he is glad to be saved in God's way, and no matter however
          humbling the plan of grace, nor how the sinner is debased and Christ
          exalted, the poor sinner loves to have it so. It is a way suitable to
          his own wants, a way which he accepts for the very reason that God has
          adapted it to his position. Hence, if there be reasons they lie here,
          not in man's merit but on the Lord's mercy. The fact that bare misery,
          when touched and guided by the Spirit of God, makes the soul to open
          its mouth like the hard chapped soil to drink in the rain, as soon as
          the rain descends from above, is an argument why grace so commonly
          flows in this course.
        </p>
        <p>
          In choosing to bless the poor and needy by his grace, the Lord finds
          for himself warm friends, those who will give him much praise, contend
          earnestly for his reign and for his sovereignty, and endure much
          obloquy for very love to his dear name. Why if the Lord were to save
          the Pharisees, they would hardly say, "thank you," they are so good
          themselves. They reckon themselves to be so excellent, that if they
          had salvation they would take it as a matter of course, and, like the
          lepers, they would never return to thank him that healed them. But
          when the Lord saves a great sinner, a man that feels there is nothing
          good in him; oh, how that man talks of it and tells it to others. He
          cannot take any praise to himself, he knows that he had nothing to do
          with it, that it is all of the grace of God. And, oh, see that man how
          he will stand up for the doctrines of grace! He is as the valiant men
          in Solomon's song, "each man with a sword on his thigh because of fear
          in the night;" for the doctrines of grace are not to him matters of
          opinion, but matters of experience. They are dear to him as his own
          life. "What," says he, "is not God the giver of salvation? Is not
          salvation all of God, from first to last? I know it is," saith he.
          "Don't tell me. Whatever your arguments, however smooth may be the
          form and fashion of your theology, it does not tally with what I have
          tasted and handled and felt; for unless it is grace from first to
          last, I am a lost man; and, if I be indeed a child of God, then can I
          contend for the doctrines of grace, and will do till I die." I know I
          felt myself last Sunday night, after I had talked to you about the
          difficulties of salvation, that if ever I got to heaven, I would
          praise and bless God with all my soul. I felt like that good old woman
          who said, that if the Lord ever saved her he should never hear the
          last of it, for she would tell it everywhere, and publish it abroad
          throughout all eternity, that the Lord had done it, that he was a good
          and gracious God to have mercy on such a soul as she was. Now, since
          one object of God in bestowing his mercy is to glorify himself, he
          does wisely in bestowing his mercy upon the poor and the needy, and
          such as have no helper. The Lord give to you, my dear hearer, to be
          brought down to this tonight. I know many of you have been brought
          there and are there now. Let my text encourage and cheer you. Dear
          objects of Almighty love, he finds you on the dunghill, but he lifts
          you from it. He finds you in the dust, but is not this the song of
          Hannah and the song of Mary too -- "He hath put down the mighty from
          their seat, and he hath exalted them of low degree: he hath filled the
          hungry with good things, but the rich he hath sent empty away?" It is
          God's way of dealing with the poor and lost; rejoice at it, it is full
          of encouragement to you. But I say to any of you that have never been
          humbled, good people, who have always been good people, you that have
          always kept the law from your youth up, and gone to church regularly,
          or to chapel regularly, very people -- The Lord have mercy upon you,
          and let you see that your goodness is filthiness, that your
          righteousness is unrighteousness, and that the best that is in you is
          bad, and that the bad that is in you that you have never seen as yet
          will be your ruin, your eternal destruction, unless God set it before
          your eyes, and bring you down to loathe yourself, and feel yourself to
          be abominable in his sight, and abominable also in your own sight,
          when his law comes with power home to your souls. Thus I have spoken
          upon the special objects of divine grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, a few words upon THE SPECIAL BLESSING WHICH THE GREAT KING
          HAS STORED UP FOR THESE PEOPLE. Kindly look at the second verse. "He
          shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with
          judgment;" so that one of the special blessings for God's poor is that
          they shall be judged with judgment. Alas! they are often judged with
          harshness; or they are judged in ignorance; or they are judged by
          malice -- not judged by righteousness, nor by judgment. When their
          enemies see them, they say, "These are a broken-spirited people; they
          are moping and melancholy, wretched and sad." Thus hard things are
          spoken against them, and unkind stories are told of them. Sometimes
          they say they are out of their minds, and then they will insinuate
          that they are only hypocrites and pretenders. Slander is very busy
          with the children of God. God had a Son that had no fault; but he
          never had a son that was not found fault with. Ay, God himself was
          slandered in paradise by Satan: let us not expect, therefore, to
          escape from the venomous tongue.
        </p>
        <p>
          One blessing, however, that will always come to God's needy ones is
          this -- Christ will right them, he will judge them with judgment. Are
          you harshly spoken of at home? Don't be angry, don't provoke in
          return, don't answer railing with railing. "He shall judge his poor
          with righteousness." Leave it to him. Wait, wait, till the judgment
          sits, for who are these that they should judge you? Their opinion,
          though it is bitter as gall to your spirit, does not really affect
          your character or your destiny. If you are right before the Lord,
          through faith in Christ, they cannot make you wrong by anything they
          say. God judges and God knows. "He searcheth the heart and tries the
          reins." You remember how David, among his brethren, was much despised.
          He had not the appearance and the carriage that his elder brethren
          had, and even Samuel, the Lord's prophet, thought the others to be
          better than David, and said of them, "Surely the Lord hath chosen
          these." David was therefore despised of his brethren, but what
          mattered it? The Lord looked not as man looks, for man looked upon the
          outward appearance, but God looketh at the heart. Bide your time you
          that are one of a family and alone. Or, if for Christ's sake you have
          been despised, have courage to-night and let not your spirit be bowed
          down. "Rejoice ye in this day and leap for joy, for so persecuted they
          the prophets that were before you." The King will speedily come, and
          when he cometh then will this word be verified. "He shall judge his
          people with righteousness and his poor with judgment." There is one
          mercy for you -- to have your wrongs righted and your character
          cleared.
        </p>
        <p>
          God's poor and needy ones, you will perceive, if you turn a little
          further down, shall be saved from oppression. Fourth verse: "He shall
          judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy,
          and shall break in pieces the oppressor." The Lord's people are like
          sheep among wolves, the wolves treat them injuriously. Christ himself
          was oppressed and afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth. His people
          may expect to be oppressed too; but they have this for their comfort,
          that Christ will surely deliver them, and he will break their
          oppressors in pieces. Are you to-night oppressed by Satan? Have you
          things laid to your charge by him that you know not of, and doth
          conscience oppress you with the remembrance of sins which have been
          forgiven? Have you ever believed concerning them in the atonement of
          Christ? Well, bow your head meekly, and go to the mercy-seat once
          again, pleading the precious blood, and he shall break in pieces the
          oppressor. There is no answer for Satan like the blood! and there is
          no answer for conscience but the blood. Plead it before God, plead it
          in your own soul, and you shall find that the great and glorious King
          in Zion shall, in your hearts, break in pieces the oppressor. There is
          another special mercy, then -- help against the oppressor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third blessing is that of our text: "He shall deliver the needy."
          Deliver them! You are brought into great troubles; you shall be
          delivered out of them. You are just now the subject of many fears: you
          shall be delivered from your fears. It seems as though the enemy would
          soon exult over you, and put his foot upon your neck, and make an end
          of you; you shall be delivered. You are like a bird taken in the
          fowler's net, and he is ready to wring your neck and take the breath
          out of you; but you shall be delivered out of the hand of the fowler,
          and brought safely through the perils that threaten you. Oh, that we
          all had faith! Oh, that we all could exercise faith when in deep
          waters. It is a fine thing to talk about faith on land, but we want
          faith to swim with when we are thrown into the flood. May you,
          tonight, get such a grip of this precious word that you may take it
          before the Lord and say, "I am poor and needy, and have no helper. O
          God, deliver my soul now."
        </p>
        <p>
          But, we have not exhausted the string of blessings. A little further
          down in the psalm, at the thirteenth verse, you will notice it is said
          of the King: "He shall spare the poor and needy." If he lays heavily
          upon them apparently, yet will he by-and-by stay his hand; if he bids
          one of his rough winds blow, he will save the other. As he is said to
          temper the wind to the shorn lamb, so will he certainly temper it to
          his people; they shall be afflicted, but it shall be in measure; he
          shall spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him: the
          rod shall make them smart, but shall not make them bleed; they shall
          be made to suffer, but they shall not be called to die. Perplexed, but
          not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; there shall always be a
          gracious limit put to the blows that come from Jehovah's hand for his
          own people. Oh, what a mercy to be amongst his poor ones, and to feel
          that he will spare us; he spared not his own Son, but he will spare
          us, the poor and needy; he smote him with the blows of avenging
          justice, but concerning us it is written, "The mountains shall depart,
          and the hills be removed, but the covenant of my love shall not
          depart. As I have sworn that the waters shall no more go over the
          earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke
          thee." He wilt spare his people; he will bring them safely through,
          and, meanwhile, he will not let the waters be deep enough to overwhelm
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one other blessing which sums up all the rest; you find it in
          the fourteenth verse: "He shall redeem their souls from deceit and
          violence." Redemption belongs to the Lord's poor people. He bought
          with a price his poor ones, and as the ransom has all been paid, they
          belong to Christ, and none shall take them out of his hand. He that
          redeemed them by price will redeem them by power. He will, if it be
          needful, divide the Red Sea again to redeem his people; and, if by no
          usual means his servants can be preserved, he will bring unusual means
          into the field. There are no miracles now, we say, but if they are
          ever wanted for the safety of God's people, there shall be miracles as
          timely and as plentiful as of yore. "Heaven and earth may pass away,
          but his word shall never pass away." He would sooner shake the heavens
          themselves than suffer one of his children to famish, or utterly to
          perish, rest assured of that. Oh, what glorious comfort there is in
          all this! We shall be spared, we shall be redeemed, we shall be
          delivered, we shall be saved, we shall be revenged and cleared before
          the judgment-bar of God; and, all because the great King has made the
          poor and needy the special objects of his love. Oh! my soul revels in
          this. I cannot speak out the thoughts I feel, much less the joy that
          arises out of them; but what a mercy it really is, that the great
          King, the King who rules from the river to the ends of the earth, is
          the poor man's friend. I am very poor and needy and helpless to-night,
          but the king has made me his favourite, counts me one of his
          courtiers: it is the same with you, dear brother, if you too are poor
          and needy, he rules, and he rules on the throne for us; he is great
          and hath dominion, but he uses all his greatness and his dominion for
          us. As Joseph in Egypt was invested with power for the good of his
          brethren, or at least such sovereignty as he held of Pharaoh he laid
          out for the welfare of his father's house, so Jesus has all power and
          authority in heaven and earth; all might, majesty, and dominion for
          the good of his people. He has the king's signet ring upon his finger,
          but he uses it for his own beloved ones that he may enrich, and honor,
          and cheer, and perfect them. His glory is concerned in every one of
          us. If one of the least of his people should perish, his crown would
          suffer damage. He is the shepherd and surety of the flock, and at his
          hand will the Father require all those who are committed to him. He
          cannot, therefore, let us perish, for then he would not be able to say
          at the last, "Of all that thou hast given me I have lost none." He
          must and will preserve us. We are wrapped up in his honor. His power,
          I say, his crown, his glory, his very name, as the Christ of God
          anointed to save sinners, all are wrapped up and intertwisted in the
          salvation of every poor and needy soul that is brought to rest in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And, now, our closing word is, THE SPECIAL SEASON WHEN ALL THIS
          SHALL BE TRUE. He shall deliver the needy when he crieth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah! while I have been preaching there may have been some poor child of
          God here who has said, "I am poor and needy, and I am in great
          distress, but I have not been delivered." And there may be some sinner
          here who has said, "God has taught me my poverty and need, and I know
          I have no helper, but I cannot find I have been delivered." Perhaps,
          dear friends, you have been praying for months, praying very bitterly
          too, after a sort, and you have been desirous that you might find
          mercy. God's time, when will it come? Well, it will come when you cry.
          That is something more, I take it, than a mere ordinary prayer. A
          child asks you for something, and you may perhaps deny it; but you
          know there is a difference between asking for a thing and crying for a
          thing. Oh, when you get so that you must have it, and your heart
          breaks for it, when your needs are so extreme that you cannot stand up
          under them -- well, now, it comes to this, that you must have Christ
          or perish. "Give me Christ or else I die," when it seems as if you
          could not put your prayer into words any more, that you could only
          fall at the foot of the cross, and say, "O God, I cannot pray, but my
          very soul groans after thee, to have mercy upon me," then is the time,
          then is the time, but not till then, when God will deliver you. The
          Lord loves to hear the prayers of his people, and he sometimes keeps
          them waiting at the posts of his door, that they may pray more. It is
          always a blessing for us to pray as well as to get the answer to
          prayer. Prayer is in itself a blessing. When the Lord hears us knock
          faintly at the door, he does not open; we may knock and knock again --
          he likes us to knock; it does us good to knock. But when it comes to
          this, that it is all knocking with us, and our very soul and body seem
          to knock, and our heart and flesh cry after God, the living God: when
          we shall thus come to appear before God, and open our mouth and pant
          vehemently for the mercy he has promised, then it will come. When thou
          canst not take a denial, thou shalt not have a denial. The kingdom of
          heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. There is
          none so violent as the man who is in desperate need. There is a person
          who has been without bread many hours, and he asks you for charity in
          the street. You would pass him by, but he is famished, and he says,
          "Oh give me bread! I die." He compels you to it. And such is the
          prayer that prevails with God. When the soul cannot wait, dare not
          wait, fears lest it should shut its eyes and open them in hell. Oh!
          God will not keep such a soul long waiting. I am always glad when I
          hear of convinced souls saying, "I went up into my chamber with the
          resolution that I would never come down again till I had found the
          Savior." I always delight to hear of men and women who say, "I went
          upon my knees and cried to him, saying, I will not let thee go except
          thou bless me." He will bless thee. If thou wilt let him go, he will
          go, but if thou wilt not let him go, thou shalt have thy request of
          him. "But who am I," saith one, "that I should plead thus? I have no
          right to hold him thus." Tis true, but when a man is hungry, when a
          man is dying, he does not think of rights. He holds you right or
          wrong. His need is his right. Poor soul, go and plead your need before
          God. Plead your sin, tell him you are wretched and undone without his
          sovereign grace. Use the strange argument which David used, the
          strangest in all the world, "For thy name's sake, O Lord! pardon mine
          iniquity, for it is great." Plead the very greatness of your sin as a
          reason for mercy; the damnable character of your sin; the certainty
          that you will soon be cast into hell, the fact that he might justly
          drive you from his presence for ever; plead all that before him; and
          say, "Lord, if ever the heights and depths of thy grace might be seen
          in saving an undeserving soul, I am just that one. If thy mercy wants
          to honor itself by saving the most undeserving, ill deserving, hell
          deserving sinner that ever lived, Lord, I am the man. If thou wantest
          a platform on which to erect a monument of infinite grace, that men
          shall stand and wonder, and angels shall gaze on it with astonishment,
          Lord, here am I. If thou wantest emptiness, here is one who is all
          emptiness. If thou as the good physician wantest a bad case, a glaring
          case, a desperate case, to operate on, thou wilt never have a worse
          case than mine. O God, turn aside and have pity upon me, and show thy
          mighty power." This is the way to plead. Not your merits -- they will
          never get a hearing, but your misery, your sin, your guiltiness before
          God -- these are the arguments. And then if faith can come in and
          plead the blood, and say, "Didst thou not send thy Son to save
          sinners?" has he not said he came not to call the righteous, but
          sinners to repentance? Is it not written that the Son of Man is come
          to seek and to save not the good, but that which was lost? Oh! if you
          can plead the blood in that fashion, you will not fail. His name is
          the Savior -- he came to save his people from their sins. He died for
          the ungodly, he justifieth the ungodly -- the unrighteous he makes
          righteous through his own merits. If you can plead this, oh, then, you
          shall not long wait, for though God does not deliver till we cry, yet
          he does deliver when we cry. "He will deliver the needy when he
          crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper." Oh, what a mercy
          it is when the tide is ebbed right out, and there is nothing left. It
          will turn now, it will turn now. The streams of grace will turn now.
          When you are empty, when you are overwhelmed, when you are like a dish
          wiped out, and there is not anything good left in you -- now will God
          come to you. The darkest part of the night is that which precedes the
          dawn of the day. When God has killed you, he will make you live. When
          he has wounded you through and through, he will come to your healing.
