          At the time when this psalm was penned, whenever that was, David
          having attained to the possession of royal power, and aware that he
          reigned for the common safety of the Church, calls upon all the
          children of Abraham to ponder attentively this grace. He also recounts
          his dangers, the magnitude and variety of which would have slain him a
          hundred times, had not God wonderfully succored him. From this it is
          obvious that he came to the throne of the kingdom, neither by his own
          policy, nor by the favor of men, nor by any human means. At the same
          time, he informs us that he did not rashly or by wicked intrigues rush
          forward and take forcible possession of the kingdom of Saul, but that
          he was appointed and established king by God himself. Let us remember
          that it was the design of the Spirit, under the figure of this
          temporal kingdom, to describe the eternal and spiritual kingdom of
          God's Son, even as David represented his person. <br />
