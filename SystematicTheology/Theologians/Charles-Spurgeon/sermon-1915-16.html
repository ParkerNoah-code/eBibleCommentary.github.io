        <p>"If thou seek him, he will be found of thee." -- 1 Chron.28:9.</p>
        <p>
          ALTHOUGH THIS WAS addressed to Solomon, it may, without any violence
          to truth, be addressed tonight to every unconverted person here
          present, for there are a great many texts of Scripture of a similar
          import which apply to all ungodly ones, such, for instance, as that,
          "Seek ye the Lord while he may be found; call ye upon him while he is
          near." And that other, "He that seeketh findeth; to him that knocketh,
          it shall be opened." I should like to go round, if it were possible,
          and say to every hearer here, as I put my hand upon his shoulder, "If
          thou seek thy God, he will be found of thee" -- even of thee. May I
          ask you to take it as spoken to each individual -- not to your
          neighbours, not to one who is better or worse than yourselves, but to
          you? You, young man, and you of riper years, you of all ages, classes
          and sexes, "If thou seek him, he will be found of thee." I know that
          those who think at all about religion, and do not understand it, are
          very apt to conceive that there is something wonderfully mysterious
          about it. That a man should follow it, and may perhaps attain the
          blessing of it towards the end of life, or on a dying bed, though some
          conceive that then nobody is quite sure that he is saved, unless it is
          some extraordinarily good man. Oh! is not this strange, that with a
          book so plain as this, and with a gospel preached by so many in these
          days, yet the mass of mankind are in a cloud and a fog about the
          blessed revelation of God? Jesus Christ is salvation. He is to be had
          -- he is to be had now. You may know you have him. You may be now
          saved -- completely saved, and live in the full enjoyment of that
          knowledge. "If thou seek him, he will be found of thee." The notion is
          that there are a great many very mysterious preliminaries, a great
          deal to do, and a great deal to be, and all quite beyond our power. It
          is not so, but seek him. We will tell you what that means, and he that
          seeks him finds him. "If thou seek him, he will be found of thee." It
          has been supposed that we should want a good deal of help in seeking
          after salvation. Certain persons who step in to be absolutely
          necessary priests between us and God. A great delusion, but there be
          thousands who believe it and who fancy that God won't hear them if
          they pray, except they have some respect for these human mediators.
          Away with the whole, away with any pretence for anyone to stand
          between the soul and God, save Jesus Christ. "If thou seek him, he
          will be found of thee." Though thou bring no other man with thee, but
          come empty-handed as thou art to God here, without paraphernalia, or
          altar, or sacrifice of the Mass, he will be found of thee. Take the
          text in its simplicity and sublimity. It is just this: that if any
          heart really seeks God in his way, it shall find him; if any man
          really wants mercy from God and seeks it as God tells him to seek it,
          he shall have it. Any man of woman born, be he who he may, if he comes
          to God in the way laid down, and sincerely asks for salvation, that
          salvation he shall surely have. The matter is simple enough; our pride
          alone obscures it. The way to heaven is so plain that "a wayfaring
          man, though a fool, may not err therein." We do but muddle it because
          we dislike it; we do but add this and that and the other to it
          because, like Naaman, the Syrian, we want to do some great thing, and
          we are not content to take the prophetic word, "Wash and be clean." I
          aim at nothing tonight, therefore, but that some here present may be
          brought to see the way of salvation, and may be led to run in it. Oh!
          may God grant that, out of this company, there may be some at least
          who will be willing to seek and to find. While we shall cast the net,
          may the Master grant that some may be taken in it to their own eternal
          welfare. We shall try to do three things, four mayhap; first, to
          notice that there is a promise here explained; we will then give
          directions; thirdly, we will answer objections; and, if time serves
          us, we will offer a stimulant to the pursuit of this. First, then,
          there is: --
        </p>
        <p>I. A PROMISE TO BE EXPLAINED.</p>
        <p>
          "If thou seek him, he will be found of thee." I have almost completed
          my explanation already. We have lost our God by the Fall -- by our own
          sin. We have alienated ourselves from him, but our case is not
          hopeless. Since Jesus Christ has come into the world, and given the
          gospel, and provided an atonement. It is a certainty that, if we
          desire the Lord and seek him, he will be found of us. Now he has told
          us the way in which to seek. It is by coming to him as he is revealed
          in Christ Jesus, and trusting our souls with Jesus. If we do this, we
          have found God, and we are saved. The sum and substance of the promise
          is this: any soul that, by prayer, seeks God, desires salvation
          through Jesus, through faith in Jesus -- such a soul shall be heard,
          shall get the blessing it desires, shall find its God. You shall not
          pray in vain. Your tears, and cries, and longings shall be heard.
          Christ shall be revealed to you, and, through your believing in
          Christ, you shall certainly be saved. There is not, and never will be,
          in hell, a single person who dare say that he sought the Lord through
          Christ and could not find him. There is not living a man who dares say
          that, or if he did, his own conscience would belie him. They that seek
          him may not find at once, but they shall ultimately. Delays from God
          are no denials. I will repeat what I said. There is not, and there
          never shall be, in the pit of hell a soul that shall dare to say, "I
          earnestly sought mercy of God through Jesus Christ, and did not find
          it." They who never found mercy in Christ never sought it, or never
          sought it aright, and earnestly; but the seeker will become a finder.
          Seeking in God's way, heartily and earnestly, God will not reject him.
          "How know you who I may be?" saith one; "you speak at large of all." I
          do not know who you may be, but I do know this, that if "the wicked
          forsakes his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and turns unto
          the Lord, he will have mercy upon him, and our God will abundantly
          pardon" him. I know this also, concerning you, my friend, that
          "whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved," and be
          you who you may, I am bidden to preach this gospel to every creature
          under heaven, and surely you are a creature. And what is this gospel?
          Why, 'He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved." Therefore,
          however peculiar your case or circumstances, there stands the one
          grand, glorious promise. "If thou seek him, he will be found of thee."
          The only "if" there is, is with thee; if thou seek him -- no "if"
          about his being found of thee. Oh! shall it be an "if"? Shall it be an
          "if"? The Lord convert that "if" into a certainty, and may you be
          constrained to say tonight, "I will seek him, and I will never cease
          my seeking, until in my case the promise is true, and I have found him
          of whom it was written, 'If thou seek him, he will be found of thee.'"
          I have thus explained the text, though it scarcely needed it. Now let
          me give: --
        </p>
        <p>II. SOME DIRECTIONS.</p>
        <p>
          What is it to seek the Lord? To seek the Lord is, in one word, simply
          this: the readiest way to seek him is to believe that Jesus is the
          Christ, and to trust him; that Jesus, the Saviour, is God's anointed,
          and to trust him as God's anointed to save your soul. You shall find
          peace the moment you do that. "But," saith one, "I want to get this
          faith you speak of -- this trust which you explain." Well then, let me
          help you somewhat. How do we get faith in anything? Why, surely by
          trying to know what it is. It would be very idle for me to stand here
          and say to you, "Believe, believe, believe"; but not tell you what to
          believe -- what is to be believed. A man cannot command his faith
          about a something that he knows nothing of; therefore, let me say to
          every soul that is seeking mercy, "Acquaint thyself with God, and be
          at peace." "Study the Scriptures." Try to understand what was the
          result of what he did. Get a clear view of his person and his work,
          and this will materially help you to believe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next to that, remember faith cometh by hearing. Frequent, therefore,
          the hearing of the Word, and be careful that thou seek not after the
          gaudy words of man's eloquence, which may feed thy pride and vanity,
          and tickle thine ear, but can never save thy soul. Seek a
          Christ-exalting ministry. Desire to be where thy soul will be handled
          with fidelity, and where Christ will be held up before thee with
          simplicity and earnestness, for the hearing that God blesses is not
          the hearing of every man that speaketh, but the hearing of the Word of
          God that "the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was
          lost"; "that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, even
          the very chief." Listen with all thine ears when Christ is being
          talked of, and pray whilst thou art hearing, and say, "Lord, bless
          that message to me." Open thy soul to the message; pray the Lord to
          open it, that thou mayest be like Lydia, whose heart the Lord opened
          to attend to the things which were spoken to her by Paul. Then when
          you think you understand the gospel, and have heard it so as to pretty
          plainly see it, if there should remain some difficulties which do not
          seem to be opened up to you by the ministry, seek some earnest
          Christian, to whom you may unbosom your soul on such points. You shall
          find that what is very difficult to you will be very easy to some
          believers; and they will be able, in God's hands, to be the means of
          removing the scales from your eyes. It was so with Paul when he was
          converted -- he must go to Ananias, and when Ananias should come in,
          then should the scales fall from Paul's eyes. Meanwhile, take care to
          be constantly in prayer. Cry unto God to show thee the way; ask him to
          do it, for, remember, he can do for thee what you canst never do for
          thyself. Understand that thou canst not save thyself -- that thou hast
          no right to be saved -- that if saved, it will be his sovereign grace;
          therefore, cry humbly, but oh! note the value of the blessing thou
          needest, and, therefore, pray earnestly. Do not let him go, except he
          bless thee. Rob thyself of sleep, sinner, rather than rob thy soul of
          Christ. Search the Word again and again, and turn each promise into a
          prayer, and if thou canst only get a hold on the edge of a promise, go
          with it to the mercy-seat and plead it. Be thankful for the smallest
          degree of hope; trust that the first beams of day will soon expand and
          deepen into dawn, and into noonday. Grieve not the Holy Spirit by
          going on with thy old sin. Part with thy old companions; seek the
          house of God; seek the people of God; addict thyself to holy company
          and holy pursuits; and although I would not put all this together in
          the place of my first word, which was, "Believe now -- believe now in
          Christ," yet if there be difficulties in the way, they will yield
          under such an earnest mode of seeking as I have tried to point out to
          you. Oh! if a soul be resolved, "I will not perish if mercy is to be
          had; I will stoop to anything; I will have Christ for nothing; I will
          be nothing; I will let him do what he wills with me, if I may but be
          saved; I will make no terms and no conditions, only let my sins be
          blotted out: -- my friend, thou art already not far from the kingdom
          of God. Already grace is at work in thy soul, and "if thou seek him,
          he will be found of thee." Continue in that blessed search. Let
          nothing take thee off from it; it is thy life; thy soul hangs on it;
          heaven and hell tremble in the balance for thee; give thy heart to
          God, thy faith to Christ, thy whole soul to the purpose of seeking thy
          salvation, and say, "It is my only business, with holy faith and holy
          fear, to make my calling and election sure while here I stand upon
          this narrow neck of land, betwixt the two unbounded seas." I have thus
          given you some directions, but I am not going to linger over them, but
          pass on to: --
        </p>
        <p>III. ANSWER A FEW OBJECTIONS.</p>
        <p>
          I cannot anticipate them all, and objection-hunting from sinners is an
          endless work, for when you have destroyed fifty objections, they will
          be ready with fifty more. But still there are a few common ones; and
          one is, "I am too guilty. Why should I seek, when it is impossible I
          should ever be pardoned?" Oh! if thy soul rested with a man like
          thyself, or even with an angel, great sinner, I would not encourage
          thee; but who is the Saviour? Bethink thee for a little. He is the
          mighty God. He that made the heavens and stretched them out like a
          tent to dwell in -- he who speaks, and it is done -- the everlasting
          Father -- is anything too hard for him? Look to him. He becomes a man,
          and yields himself up to death. With sufferings that can never be
          understood or fully described: --
        </p>
        <p>"He bears that we might never bear</p>
        <p>His Father's righteous ire."</p>
        <p>
          Is anything impossible for the Saviour? Oh! conceive not so. The idea
          that any guilt is too great for Christ to pardon scarcely deserves to
          be replied to. It is so absurd when you are dealing with the infinite
          mercy of a Saviour who is God himself. It was said some years ago that
          the city of Peking in China suffered greatly from a severe climate at
          one part of the year, and paid much for fuel, and yet underneath it,
          or close to it, there were large coal mines. And when the Chinese were
          asked why they did not work them, they said that they were afraid of
          disturbing the equilibrium of the globe, and perhaps the world might
          turn over, and the celestial empire, which had always been at the top,
          might be at the bottom. Nobody thought it worthwhile to answer so
          absurd a theory; and when any say, "My sins are too great for Christ
          to pardon," I could almost smile in the same way at a conception so
          ignorant. What can be too great for the infinite mercy of the eternal
          God, who took our sins upon Himself upon the cross? Sinner, think not
          so.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is another objection far more common, however, which is not put
          into words, but it means this: "I am too good to seek Christ. Why,
          have I not always been brought up religiously? I am not as those poor
          sinners are that have been drunkards and the like. I have not any need
          of seeking him." Oh! soul, if there is one that is least likely to be
          saved, it is you, for they that go about to establish their own
          righteousness are the last to submit to the righteousness in Christ
          Jesus, and verily the publicans and the harlots enter into the kingdom
          of heaven before some of you, for be ye sure of this, no man shall
          ever enter heaven by his own works. There is one gate to glory, and
          but one for queen or beggar, for the best or for the worst, and that
          is through the blood and righteousness of the one only Redeemer, and
          if thou hast not this, be thou never so good, thou art utterly undone.
          Oh! lay aside that thought; thou art neither too good nor too bad, but
          "If thou seek him, he will be found of thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          But I hear somebody in the corner saying, "It is no use my thinking of
          seeking Christ, I am too poor." Oh, my dear friend, your mistake,
          indeed, is a strange one, for did not Jesus say, "To the poor the
          gospel is preached"? I'll be bound to say you are not poorer than the
          Saviour himself, for he said, "Foxes have holes, and the birds of the
          air have nests, but I, the Son of man, have not where to lay my head."
          Dream not this. Gold and silver have no value in his kingdom. The
          poorest is as wealthy as the wealthiest if he come to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ay, ay," saith another, "but I am too ignorant. I scarce can read.
          Unhappily for me, I was brought up where I got no learning. I can
          never understand these things." Friend, if thou be not able to read a
          word in the Book, yet mayest thou read thy title clear to mansions in
          the skies. Thou needest not have all this learning; it were a good
          thing for thee if thou had it -- serviceable for a thouand purposes,
          but not needful to the entering of that kingdom. If thou knowest
          thyself as a sinner, and if thou wilt trust Christ as a Saviour, thou
          shalt be as welcome into the kingdom as doctors who have taken their
          degree at the Universities, or the wisest men that have ever sat at
          the feet of Gamaliel. Come and welcome; come and welcome; come and
          welcome. Let not this keep thee back.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I have heard one say, "I would fain seek the Lord, but I have no
          place to seek him." "What mean you?" "I have no chamber into which I
          can go and pray alone." That is a sad deprivation, I grant you, but do
          not think for a moment that you need any special place in which to
          seek the Lord. I remember a sailor who used to be much in prayer, and
          he was asked where he went to pray. "Oh!" said he, "I have been many a
          time alone with Christ up on the mast." Why not? It is as good an
          oratory under conviction of sin, to make use of an old coach that was
          in his master's yard. Why not? Why not? I know one whose prayer-place
          used to be a saw-pit, and another a hay-loft. What matter?
        </p>
        <p>"Where'er we seek him, he is found,</p>
        <p>And every place is hallowed ground."</p>
        <p>
          Every place is consecrated where there is a true heart. In that seat
          you may seek and find him. Standing there, up in that corner of the
          gallery, your soul may find her God. In Cheapside, walking in the
          busiest street, or at the plough-tail amidst the field, let thy soul
          but cry, "Jesus, pity a sinner" -- let thy heart trust in that Jesus
          -- no place is wanted -- any place sufficeth. Raise not that excuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have not the time," says another. Not the time! What time, pray,
          does it require? But if it did require it, oh! man, art thou mad to
          say, "I have no time"? Ye have time enough to dress your body; you
          stay for that other pin, and that other ribbon, and that adornment of
          your person. Not time to put on the robe of righteousness! You have
          time to feed your bodies, to sit down to your meals. Not time to eat
          the bread of heaven! Time to cast up your accounts to see how your
          business stands, and not time to see to your soul's affairs! Oh! sirs,
          be ashamed to make such an excuse. I charge you, give not sleep to
          your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids till you are saved. A man wakes
          up in the night, and finds his house is on fire. There is a noise in
          the street. The fireman is calling to him. The ladder is at the
          window. "I have not time," says he, "to go down the ladder and escape.
          I have little enough time for rest, and I must have my sleep while I
          can." The man is mad, sir, and so is every man who says, "I have not
          time to seek my God." Perhaps, however, you speak the truth, for ere
          the next word leaves my lips you may fall down a corpse. God sometimes
          makes our base excuses turn into solemn truth. Oh! while you have
          time, use it. "Escape for your life; look not behind thee"; stay not,
          but hasten till you find the Saviour, and never think of resting till
          Christ is yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another reason that some bring is one which occurs to them as if it
          were very satisfactory, and that is, "I cannot. No man can come,
          except he be drawn, and I cannot." Yes, but you may put a truth into
          such a shape that it is a lie. Will you let me put that into the right
          shape? Every time when a sinner cannot, the real reason is that he
          will not. All the cannots in the Bible about spiritual inability are
          tantamount to will nots. But when you say, "I cannot repent," you
          mean, "I will not -- I will not seek, I will not believe." Now put it
          honestly to your own soul, for that is what you mean, for if you would
          you could. If the will were conquered, the power would be sure to come
          with it, but the first difficulty is, "You will not"; and this is it,
          you will not seek eternal life; you will not escape from hell; you
          will not have heaven; you will not be reconciled to God; you will not
          come into Christ that you might have Christ. You make it as an
          objection, but I charge it upon you as a crime, a crime which
          aggravates all the rest, and is in itself a greater crime, perhaps,
          than all the rest put together. Ye will not come. "Do you want to
          come?" "Yes, but there is much I cannot do." "Aye! but there is means
          provided to help you." God the Holy Spirit helps you, yea, works
          mightily in you. Have you never heard of that negro servant who was
          sent by his master on an errand? He did not particularly like to go
          there. He was sent with a letter. He was back in a short time; and his
          master said, "Sam, you have not gone with that letter." "No, massa."
          "Why not?" "Massa couldn't expect Sam to do impossibilities." "What
          impossibilities, sir?" "I went on as far as I could massa -- came to
          river -- couldn't swim across river -- very wide river -- couldn't
          swim across it." "But there is a ferry-boat." "Ferry-boat t'other
          side, massa -- ferry-boat t'other side." "Did you call to the
          ferry-boat, sir?" "No, massa; didn't." "Oh! you rascal," said he;
          "That is no excuse at all. Why didn't you call for the ferry-boat? Why
          didn't you call for it?" Now if that negro had only just said, "Boat,
          ahoy there!" the ferry-boat would have come to him, and all would have
          been well. It was an idle thing to say, "I cannot." It was true, but
          it was false. So when I come to a point where there is something in
          the matter of my being saved which I cannot do, yet if I pray the Holy
          Spirit to work in me that I cannot work in myself, he will do it.
          Jesus Christ will give me "true belief and true repentance -- every
          grace that brings me nigh." I have only to ask for all that I want,
          and I shall have it. It is idle for me to say, "I cannot do it."
          Nobody asked you to. Christ will give it to you; only do stand and
          call -- call mightily, and cry with all your soul until the blessing
          be come. But now I must close. I want to offer just a few sentences
          only.

          IV. A STIMULANT, to lead you to seek him who will be found of you. And
          the first is, "Is it not our duty to God that we should seek him?"
          With some persons this reflection may be important. You remember the
          Countess of Huntingdon, one of the most remarkably gracious women that
          every lived -- a mother in Israel. Her conversion was to a great
          degree caused by this: she was a blithe and worldly lady of noble
          rank, excellent and amiable, and all that, but she had no thought of
          the things of God. She was at a ball, and the amusements of the
          evening were engrossing all attention, and suddenly the answer to the
          first question of the assembly's catechism, which she appears to have
          learnt when she was a child, came forcibly into her mind, "The chief
          end of man is to glorify God, and enjoy him for ever." She thought to
          herself, "Why, here am I, a butterfly among a lot of butterflies. All
          our chief end is to enjoy ourselves, to spend the evening merrily and
          make ourselves agreeable, and so on." She went away smitten in her
          soul with that thought, "The end that God made me for I am not
          answering." Now there are some minds that have sufficient in them to
          think of such a thing as that, and I shall leave that to fall into
          some honest, and good ground. Perhaps some young man will say, "Well,
          after all, I am not serving my Creator as I should." You remember the
          conversion of Colonel Gardiner. He had lived a wild soldier's life,
          and he had appointed that very night of his conversion to perpetuate a
          gross sin. He was waiting an hour before he went to his appointment,
          and he thought he saw, I think upon the wall, the Saviour on the
          cross, and underneath the representation of the Crucified he read
          these words: --
        </p>
        <p>"I have done this for thee; what hast thou done for me?"</p>
        <p>
          He never kept that sinful appointment. He became a soldier of the
          cross. Oh! I wish that some here might feel something of nobility
          within them that would make them feel, "It is mean to act so unjustly
          to God, as to prefer the trivial things of time to the weighty matters
          of eternity."
        </p>
        <p>
          The next stimulus I would offer is one of hope. "If thou seek him, he
          will be found of thee." "Oh!" says one, "if I could find him, I would
          seek him." When persons go to South Africa, they search for diamonds;
          but if any man could be assured that he would find a Koh-i-noor, I
          warrant you he would be one of the hardest workers there. Oh! there
          are some here tonight that lttle dream it, that will yet before long
          be telling to others what eternal love has done for them. They are
          very ready to sneer at it, perhaps, at this moment. They think it is
          impossible. The Lord doth great marvels; he bringeth down the mighty
          from their seat, and exalteth them of low degree. Oh! soul, the gate
          may not open at the first knock to thee, it may be, but it will open.
          Let me encourage thee. Thou shalt yet rejoice. Thine eyes shall see
          the King in his beauty, for there is a harp in heaven that no finger
          shall every play on but yours, and there is a crown there that will
          fit no head but yours, and a throne on which no one must sit but you;
          the Lord hath chosen thee, and, therefore, this night he calls thee.
          "I have loved thee with an everlasting love, and with lovingkindness
          have I drawn thee." Go thou, poor soul, to Christ, and thou shalt find
          it so.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if that doth not move thee, let me give thee another stimulant,
          and that is the opposite one, of fear. Suppose thou shouldest never
          seek thy Lord; suppose thou shouldest die without a Saviour; what
          then? "I shall die," sayest thou; "my soul will go before God." What
          then? Why, it must be condemned, and by-and-bye thy body shall rise up
          -- from the grave shall thy body spring, and thou in body and soul
          shalt stand before the bar of that great Saviour whom thou dost
          tonight despise. Beware, for the books will be opened, and thy
          rejection of Christ written there shall be read before the assembled
          world; and then when the earth doth rock and reel and the ungodly in
          their terrors ask for the mountains to cover them -- when the stars
          fall like withered figs from the trees, and all Creation gathers up
          her skirts to flee away from the face of him that comes in terror, oh!
          what will you do? What will you do? Expire, you cannot; be
          extinguished, you must not; live on, you must; and in anguish that
          shall never abate, in despair that never shall be enlightened with a
          hope. "Turn ye, turn ye! Why will ye die?" Why will ye reject him? "If
          ye seek him, he will be found of you." Oh! do seek him; reject him
          not. "How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?" Oh! who
          shall give me tears? Who shall teach me to speak with pathos? How
          shall I reach your consciences and stir your hearts? Eternal Spirit,
          do thou this mighty work, and win this night to thyself. O Jesu, save
          many a heart by this testimony of thy grace, which again and again we
          reiterate, "If we seek him -- if thou seek him -- he will be found of
          thee." God bless you, for Christ's sake. Amen.<br />
