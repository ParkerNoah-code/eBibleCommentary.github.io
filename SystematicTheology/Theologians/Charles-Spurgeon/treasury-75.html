          TITLE.<b> A Psalm of Asaph.</b> This is the second Psalm ascribed to
          Asaph, and the first of eleven consecutive Psalms bearing the name of
          this eminent singer. Some writers are not sure that Asaph wrote them,
          but incline to the belief that David was the author, and Asaph the
          person to whom they were dedicated, that he might sing them when in
          his turn he became the chief musician. But though our own heart turns
          in the same direction, facts must be heard; and we find in 2
          Chronicles 29:30, that Hezekiah commanded the Levites to sing "the
          words of David and of Asaph the seer; "and, moreover, in Nehemiah
          12:46, David and Asaph are mentioned together, as distinct from "the
          chief of the singers," and as it would seem, as joint authors of
          psalmody. We may, therefore, admit Asaph to be the author of some, if
          not all, of the twelve Psalms ascribed to him.

        <p align="justify">
          Often a great star which seems to be but one to the eyes of ordinary
          observers, turns out upon closer inspection to be of a dual character;
          so here the Psalms of David are those of Asaph too. The great sun of
          David has a satellite in the moon of Asaph. By reading our notes on
          Psalm Fifty, the reader will glean a little more concerning this man
          of God.

        <p align="justify">
          SUBJECT. Curiously enough this Seventy-third Psalm corresponds in
          subject with the Thirty-seventh—it will help the memory of the young
          to notice the reversed figures. The theme is that ancient stumbling
          block of godly men, which Job's friends could not get over; namely,
          the present prosperity of wicked men and the sorrows of the godly.
          Heathen philosophers have puzzled themselves about this, while to
          believers it has too often been a temptation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DIVISION. In verse 1 the psalmist declares his confidence in God, and,
          as it were, plants his foot on a rock while he recounts his inward
          conflict.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">From verses 2-14 he states his temptation;</p>
        <p align="justify">
          then, from verses 15-17 he is embarrassed as how to act, but
          ultimately finds deliverance from his dilemma.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He describes with awe the fate of the ungodly in verses 18-20,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          condemns his own folly and adores the grace of God, verses 21-24,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          and concludes by renewing his allegiance to his God, whom he takes
          afresh to be his portion and delight.<br />
           
        </p>
        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. Truly</p></b>, or, more correctly,
        <i>only</i>, <b> God is good to Israel</b>. He is only good, nothing
        else but good to his own covenanted ones. He cannot act unjustly, or
        unkindly to them; his goodness to them is beyond dispute, and without
        mixture.
        <b> <p align="justify">Even to such as are of a clean heart.</p></b
        >These are the <i>true Israel</i>, not the ceremonially clean but the
        really so; those who are clean in the inward parts, pure in the vital
        mainspring of action. To such GOD is, and must be, goodness itself.
        <p align="justify">
          The writer does not doubt this, but lays it down as his firm
          conviction. It is well to make sure of what we do know, for this will
          be good anchor hold for us when we are molested by those mysterious
          storms which arise from things which we do not understand. Whatever
          may or may not be the truth about mysterious and inscrutable things,
          there are certainties somewhere; experience has placed some tangible
          facts within our grasp; let us, then, cling to these, and they will
          prevent our being carried away by those hurricanes of infidelity which
          still come from the wilderness, and, like whirlwinds, smite the four
          corners of our house and threaten to overthrow it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          O my God, however perplexed I may be, let me never think ill of you.
          If I cannot <i>understand </i>you, let me never cease to
          <i> believe </i>in you. It must be so, it cannot be otherwise, you are
          good to those whom you have made good; and where you have renewed the
          heart you will not leave it to its enemies.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 2.</p></b> Here begins the narrative of a
        great soul battle, a spiritual Marathon, a hard and well fought field,
        in which the half-defeated became in the end wholly victorious.
        <b> <p align="justify">But as for me.</p></b> He contrasts himself with
        his God who is ever good; he owns his personal want of good, and then
        also compares himself with the clean in heart, and goes on to confess
        his defilement.
        <p align="justify">
          The Lord is good to his saints, but as for me, am I one of them? Can I
          expect to share his grace? Yes, I do share it; but I have acted an
          unworthy part, very unlike one who is truly pure in heart.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">My feet were almost gone.</p></b
        ><i
          >Errors of heart and head soon affect the conduct. There is an
          intimate connection between the heart and the feet. </i
        >Asaph could barely stand, his uprightness was going, his knees were
        bowing like a falling wall. When men doubt the righteousness of God,
        their own integrity begins to waver.
        <b> <p align="justify">My steps had well near slipped.</p></b> Asaph
        could make no progress in the good road, his feet ran away from under
        him like those of a man on a sheet of ice. He was weakened for all
        practical action, and in great danger of actual sin, and so of a
        disgraceful fall.
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            How ought we to watch the inner man, since it has so forcible an
            effect upon the outward character.
          </p></i
        >The confession in this case is, as it should be, very plain and
        explicit.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 3. For I was envious at the foolish.</p></b
        >"The foolish" is the generic title of all the wicked. They are beyond
        all others fools—and <i>he must be a fool, who envies fools. </i>
        <p align="justify">
          Some read it, the proud, or arrogant. Indeed, these, by their
          ostentation, invite envy, and many a mind which is out of gear
          spiritually, becomes infected with that wasting disease.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a pitiful thing that an heir of Heaven should have to confess "I
          was envious," but worse still that he should have to put it, "I was
          envious at the foolish." Yet this acknowledgment is, we fear, due from
          most of us.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</p></b
        >His eye was fixed too much on one thing. He saw their present, and
        forgot their future. He saw their outward display, and overlooked their
        soul's discomfort. Who envies the bullock his fat, when he recollects
        the shambles? Yet some poor afflicted saint has been sorely tempted to
        grudge the ungodly sinner his temporary plenty. All things considered,
        Dives had more cause to envy Lazarus—than Lazarus to be envious of
        Dives.
        <b>

            Verse 4. For there are no bands in their death.
          </p></b
        >
        This is mentioned as the chief wonder, for we usually expect that in the
        solemn article of death, a difference will appear, and the wicked will
        become evidently in trouble.
        <p align="justify">
          The notion is still prevalent that a quiet death means a happy
          hereafter. The psalmist had observed that the very reverse is true.
          Careless people become case hardened, and continue presumptuously
          secure, even to the last. Some are startled at the approach of
          judgment, but many more have received a strong delusion to believe a
          lie. With the physician's drugs and their own false peace—they glide
          into eternity without a struggle.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We have seen godly men bound with doubts, and fettered with anxieties,
          which have arisen from their holy jealousy. But the godless know
          nothing of such bands: they care neither for God nor devil.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Their strength is firm.</p></b> What care they
        for death? Frequently they are brazen and insolent, and can vent defiant
        blasphemies even on their last couch. This may occasion sorrow and
        surprise among saints, but certainly should not suggest envy, for, in
        this case, the most terrible inward conflict is infinitely to be
        preferred to the profoundest calm which insolent presumption can create.
        Let the righteous die as they may, let my last end be like theirs.

            Verse 5. They are not in trouble as other men.
          </p></b
        >
        The prosperous wicked escape the killing toils which afflict the mass of
        mankind; their bread comes to them without care, and their wine without
        stint. They have no need to inquire, "Whence shall we get bread for our
        children, or clothing for our little ones?" Ordinary domestic and
        personal troubles do not appear to molest them.
        <b> <p align="justify">Neither are they plagued like other men.</p></b
        >Fierce trials do not arise to assail them: they smart not under the
        divine rod. While many saints are both poor and afflicted, the
        prosperous sinner is neither. He is worse than other men, and yet he is
        better off. He ploughs least, and yet has the most fodder. He deserves
        the hottest Hell, and yet has the warmest nest.
        <p align="justify">
          All this is clear to the <i>eyes of faith</i>, which unriddles the
          riddle; but to the <i>bleared eye of sense </i>it seems an enigma
          indeed. They are to have nothing hereafter, let them have what they
          can here. They, after all, only possess what is of secondary value,
          and their possessing it is meant to teach us to set little store by
          transient things.
          <i
            >If earthly good were of much value, the Lord would not give so

        New Jerusalem; they want no other ornament than their own pomposity. No

        better ornament than a gold chain.
        <b> <p align="justify">Violence covers them as a garment.</p></b> In
        their boastful arrogance they array themselves; they wear the livery of
        the devil, and are fond of it. As soon as you see them, you perceive
        that room must be made for them, for, regardless of the feelings and
        rights of others, they intend to have their way, and achieve their own
        ends. They brag and bully, bluster and browbeat, as if they had taken

        In cases of obesity the eyes usually appear to be enclosed in fat, but
        sometimes they protrude; in either case the countenance is changed,
        loses its human form, and is assimilated to that of <i>fatted swine</i>.
        The face is here the index of the man. The man has more than suffices
        him; he is glutted and surfeited with wealth, and yet is one of the
        wicked whom God abhors.

        beyond measure gluttonous, and yet in the case of certain ungodly
        millionaires, who have rivaled Sardanapalus both in lust and luxury, it

        >Access into the most holy place is a great privilege, and a cure for a
        multitude of ills. It is good for all saints, it is good for me in
        particular; it is always good, and always will be good for me to
        approach the greatest good, the source of all good, even God himself.
        <b> <p align="justify">I have put my trust in the Lord God.</p></b> He
        dwells upon the glorious name of the Lord Jehovah, and avows it as the
        basis of his faith. Faith is wisdom; it is the key of enigmas, the clue
        of mazes, and the pole star of pathless seas. Trust and you will know.
        <b> <p align="justify">That I may declare all your works.</p></b> He who
        believes shall understand, and so be able to teach. Asaph hesitated to
        utter his evil surmisings, but he has no diffidence in publishing abroad
        a good matter. God's ways are the more admired the more they are known.
        He who is ready to believe the goodness of God shall always see fresh
        goodness to believe in, and he who is willing to declare the works of
        God shall never be silent for lack of wonders to declare.
