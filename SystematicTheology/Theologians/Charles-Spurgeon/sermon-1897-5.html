          The Divine gloom is the unapproachable light in which God is said to
          dwell . And in this gloom, invisible indeed, on account of the
          surpassing brightness, and unapproachable on account of the excess of
          the superessential stream of light, enters every one deemed worthy to
          know and to see God, by the very fact of neither seeing nor knowing,
          really entering in Him, Who is above vision and knowledge, knowing
          this very thing, that He is after all the object of sensible and
          intelligent perception, and saying in the words of the Prophet, "Thy
          knowledge was regarded as wonderful by me; It was confirmed; I can by
          no means attain unto it ;" even as the Divine Paul is said to have
          known Almighty God, by having known Him as being above all conception
          and knowledge. Wherefore also, he says, "His ways are past finding out
          and His Judgements inscrutable," and His gifts "indescribable ," and
          that His peace surpasses every mind , as having found Him Who is above
          all, and having known this which is above conception, that, by being
          Cause of all, He is beyond all.<br />
