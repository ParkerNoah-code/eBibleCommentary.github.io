        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1844)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's Day Morning, June 7th, 1885, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they
          believed not on him: that the saying of Esaias the prophet might be
          fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to
          whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? Therefore they could not
          believe, because that Esaias said again, He hath blinded their eyes,
          and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes,
          nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal
          them. These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of
          him." -- John 12:37-41.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE BLINDNESS of Israel concerning our Lord was sadly remarkable. It
          was a blindness of the eyes, for they saw his many miracles, and yet
          believed not: their ears also seemed to be stopped, for they heard his
          words and did not understand them; and their hearts also were heavy,
          for they did not relent under the plaintive admonitions of a Saviour's
          love. Their hearts were cruel towards the Messiah; they hated him
          without a cause. No door was open to the heart of Israel; they had
          hardened their heart, they had shut their eyes, they had stopped their
          ears, and even he that spake as never man spake gained no access to
          their souls. They went so far as to crucify him, and cried as they did
          so, "His blood be on us, and our children," -- words so sadly verified
          when Jerusalem was destroyed, and her children slaughtered, sold as
          slaves, or scattered to the four corners of the earth. It was indeed,
          a terrible blindness which happened unto Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her rejection of the Lord Jesus is the more amazing because Isaiah
          gave so clear an account of the Messiah, and so clearly pictured Jesus
          of Nazareth. Descriptions of him could not have been more explicit
          than were the prophecies of Isaiah. It would be very easy to construct
          an entire life of Christ out of the book of Isaiah, beginning with "a
          virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name
          Immanuel," and ending with "he made his grave with the wicked and with
          the rich in his death." Isaiah spake of John the Baptist as the "voice
          crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make
          straight in the desert a highway for our God," and he foretold our
          Lord's ministry by the way of the sea beyond Jordan in Galilee of the
          Gentiles, where the people who sat in darkness saw great light. The
          prophecy portrayed his Lord as "despised and rejected of men, a man of
          sorrows and acquainted with grief." Clearest of all is he upon his
          vicarious sufferings, concerning which he uses a variety of most
          definite expressions, such as, -- "The chastisement of our peace was
          upon him; and with his stripes we are healed." Isaiah saw so clearly
          the day of our Lord Jesus that he spake rather as an evangelist than
          as a prophet; as an eyewitness, rather than as one foretelling a
          far-off event. Yet all this clearness was lost upon the men of his
          generation, and upon those who followed after. The nation had so long
          been fickle towards God, and had trifled so long with God's truth,
          that it was at length given up to a judicial hardness of heart, so
          that it could not understand or perceive. They refused the plainest
          messages of grace, and were so confirmed in unbelief that all their
          prophets cried with one plaintive voice, "Who hath believed our
          report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor was it alone grievous that Israel sinned against the light which
          shone in Isaiah's testimony; but, alas, she closed her eyes against
          the meridian splendour of our Lord's own life. Jesus bore his own
          witness in his person, teachings, works, and gifts. A sad wonder lies
          in the fact, that they did not know the Lord of glory although they
          saw his miracles, which were sure witnesses to his claims. He wrought
          among them works which none other man did. There is about our Lord a
          likeness to God: in all that he does the Godhead shines forth. He is
          so pure that he can say, "Which of you convinceth me of sin?" How like
          to him who is saluted as "Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts!" His
          teaching is so full of tenderness and gentleness that since God is
          love, we conclude that Christ is God. His many miracles touch upon
          every point in the great circle of omnipotence. What is there that God
          can do which the Christ did not do? Was he not multiform and
          multitudinous in his works of power and grace? Herein lay the wonder,
          that though he did so many miracles before them, not in secret but
          actually before their eyes; though he fed them with bread which they
          could see, and handle, and eat; though he healed the sick and raised
          the dead, they yet believed not on him. How sadly far can men go in
          unbelief, prejudice, and hardness of heart! How dim can human eyes
          become when men refuse to see! How darkened the understanding when men
          are unwilling to comprehend! Let us tremble at this, lest ourselves by
          imitating the chosen people in their unbelief should fall into like
          bondage to prejudice and ignorance, lest we by tampering with truth
          should come at last to be incapable of perceiving it, lest we also by
          rejecting the testimony of God should be given up to our own
          willfulness, to believe a lie and refuse the truth. Such, then, as
          Isaiah had foreseen, was the state of Israel in our Lord's day: never
          clearer evidence, and never more obstinate refusal to see it; never
          truth more plain, and never rejection so determined. Woe to those who
          close their ears; for the day cometh when they shall no longer hear!
          Woe to those who shut their eyes to the light, for they shall ere long
          be made blind! Isaiah was informed that such would be the outcome of
          his ministry: the Lord bade him say to the people, "Hear ye indeed,
          but underststand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not." This must
          have been a very sad business for so generous and tender-hearted a man
          of God. It was painful to him to be so clear and yet to be so little
          understood. He was the Paul of the Old Testament; to him belonged
          fulness of knowledge, clearness of vision, plainness of speech, and
          faithfulness of spirit, and yet none of these things could make the
          people understand his message and receive it into their hearts. He was
          sublime in thought, attractive in word, and affectionate in spirit,
          and yet they did not believe his testimony; so that he must often have
          been astonished and heart-broken as he spake in vain to a people who
          were determined that they would not hear.
        </p>
        <p>
          This morning I shall draw certain lessons for ourselves from the great
          evangelical prophet, his ministry, and the people to whom he
          ministered so vainly. Our first meditation shall be concerning Isaiah
          and his ministry: and our second shall be concerning the people to
          whom he spake. Alas! I fear that we who speak in the name of the Lord
          in these last days have also to deal with hearts that are gross, ears
          that are heavy, and eyes that are dimmed. Upon this generation also
          there is falling a measure of judicial withdrawal of light and
          discernment; and we also have to cry, "Who hath believed our report?
          and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, let me speak with you CONCERNING ISAIAH AND HIS
          MINISTRY. Oh, that the Spirit of God may speak with power through me.
          Our text says two things of Isaiah: first, that "he saw his glory,"
          and secondly, that "he spake of him."
        </p>
        <p>
          The first statement is that Isaiah saw. Isaiah was a great seer: his
          prophesy begins thus, -- "The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which
          he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem." All prophets were more or less
          seers, and saw what they foretold; but Isaiah above others was endowed
          with the seeing and foreseeing faculty. He had the clearest sight, and
          for that reason he had the clearest speech. When a man speaks so that
          you cannot understand him, the usual reason is that he does not
          understand himself; and when a man speaks so as to be readily
          comprehended, it is because the thought in his own mind is well
          defined. He that would speak well must see well. Mark the two things
          in the text -- "When Isaiah saw his glory, and spake of him."
        </p>
        <p>
          In what sense is Isaiah said to have seen that which he spake? Does it
          not mean that he realized his thoughts? that they stood out vividly,
          so as to make a deep impression upon his own mind? Things to come were
          already come in his apprehension: he beheld what he believed, he felt
          what he foretold. He was not a dreamy person, maundering about
          half-fashioned, undeveloped thoughts; but he was a person who knew,
          and perceived, and felt what he preached. He saw with his soul what he
          set forth with his lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what did he see? It is a most important thing that in these days
          you and I should see the same, for the same work lies before us among
          a people who are a repetition of that disobedient and gainsaying
          nation. Read, then, with care the sixth chapter of Isaiah. Open your
          Bibles and refer to the passage verse by verse.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, what Isaiah saw was the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and
          lifted up. When the prophet went abroad among the people he heard them
          speaking against the Lord God; some contending for our deity and some
          for another; some leaning upon an arm of flesh, and others despising
          the promise of Jehovah the God of Israel. All this, I say, he saw out
          of doors, and he was troubled. But when he went into the sanctuary of
          God he saw the Lord sitting upon a throne : still reigning, still
          glorious, undisturbed by opposition. He must then have felt like David
          when he said, "Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain
          thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take
          counsel together against the Lord, and against his anointed. He that
          sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in
          derision. Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion." As David
          saw Christ upon the throne amid the strirvings of the people, so did
          Isaiah see the Lord Jesus, not only upon the lowly mercy-seat, but
          upon a throne high and lifted up. I pray you, brethren, settle this in
          your hearts: our Lord is highly exalted as Lord of all. When you see
          evil occurrent, do not imagine that it defeats the eternal purposes of
          Jehovah: when you hear blasphemy and your blood runs cold, do not
          think that Christ has lost his glory: when men riot in sin, do not
          dream that the reins of affairs are out of Jesus' hands; for still he
          is "God over all, blessed for ever." My heart exalts this day, as, by
          undoubting faith, I am assured that he who died on Calvary is now
          exalted on high, far above all principalities and powers. "Thou art
          the King of glory, O Christ!" To thee our spirits ascribe infinite
          honour, world without end. Though the earth be removed, and the
          mountains be carried into the midst of the sea, yet the Lord reigneth.
          He that died upon the tree is crowned with majesty, and all the angels
          of God worship him. "He must reign till he hath put all enemies under
          his feet." Let us have no question about this; for if we have, we
          shall not be prepared to speak in the Lord's name with this evil
          generation. Amid the anarchy of the ages we see the glorious high
          throne of our redeeming Lord unmoved, unmovable: this is the rock of
          our refuge when the unsettled times rage about us like the waters of
          the troubled sea. We cannot be afraid, for Christ is on the throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe that in Isaiah's vision he not only saw the Lord "upon a
          throne high and lifted up," but he saw that "his train filled the
          temple." so that in that temple there was room for no one else. The
          robes of this great King filled all the holy place; and neither
          priests nor offerers could there find standing room. It is a great
          thing to see how Jesus fills the heavenly places; in him dwelleth all
          the fullness of the Godhead. Let it be acknowledged to be so in
          heaven, for the glory of our Redeemer fills every street of the upper
          city, every mansion of the Father's house. In the church below, which
          is also his temple, among his spiritual people, the glory of the Lord
          Jesus engages and occupies every heart. They feel that there is none
          other in whom they can trust, none other whose words they will
          receive, none other in whom they glory; the Lord Christ is all in all
          to us, and we know no other Master or Saviour. His train fills the
          temple. I trust it is so among us. From Sabbath to Sabbath the one
          glory of this Tabernacle is the person and work of Jesus. What a glory
          hath God put upon the Only Begotten Son, whom he hath raised from the
          dead that he should be head over all things to his church, which he
          fills with his life, light, and love. Nor may we forget that all the
          things that exist are in a sense his temple, and the whole universe is
          filled with his train; for "he hath ascended up far above all heavens
          that he might fill all things." Glory be unto our ascended and
          reigning Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this vision Isaiah saw the flaming spirits that wait upon Christ of
          God. He calls them "seraphims." The best interpretation we can give is
          "burning ones:" they burn in the sense of consuming. They burn up that
          which ought to be consumed, namely, all kinds of evil. There are
          powers around our Lord which will destroy evil. You ask me to tell you
          something about these seraphim; how can I? They have covered their
          faces, and covered their feet. Since nothing is to be seen, what can I
          tell you? Neither would it be right for us to speak concerning them,
          for manifestly it is their desire to be hidden. Who will violate their
          wish to be concealed? They covered their faces, they covered their
          feet, and therein they did as good as they say, "Look not on us, but
          look on him who sits upon the throne, whose attendants we are." This
          much is all we know, -- exalted intelligences are in waiting upon our
          Lord, and are able to fly swiftly at his bidding. Tremble not
          concerning this error, or that, it shall be burnt up by those agencies
          which are at the command of our exalted Lord. Spirits from God shall
          run to and fro, and smite, as with the fire of God, those powers of
          darkness which now oppress our race. God himself is a consuming fire:
          who can dwell with him but those that are like him? He maketh his
          ministers a flame of fire. Around our Lord are the chariots of God,
          which are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels. His power knows
          no limit. His word runneth very swiftly; he speaks, and it is done; he
          commands, and it stands fast. Glory be unto thee, O Christ! We will
          not fear nor be discouraged, since these thy servants are ready to
          flame forth at thy bidding. Truly thou art Jehovah of hosts.
        </p>
        <p>
          This vision of the body-guard of the Prince of peace was enough to
          strengthen Isaiah: thus comforted, he would calmly confront that
          rebellious generation. If the prophet, when he opened the young man's
          eyes strengthened his heart by making him see horses and chariots of
          fire round about Elisha, shall not we be comforted as we behold
          legions of burning ones surrounding our King, and standing ready to
          fulfil his decrees?
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, we find that Isaiah saw in that vision the perpetual
          adoration which is rendered unto Christ concerning his holiness. Those
          bright spirits had never tasted of his mercy, for they had never
          sinned: they understood nothing of his grace, for they had not been
          guilty; but being pure in heart they gazed on the Lord with opened eye
          and adored his holiness. Their whole souls were filled with the
          contemplation of that one all-embracing attribute; and in responsive
          song they said each one to his fellow, "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord
          of hosts." They emphasized their words by repeating them three times;
          and perhaps they alluded also to the Trinity in Unity as they cried,
          "Holy, holy, holy." This is the supreme glory of Christ, that in him
          is seen the holiness of God. Oh my friends, let us be like these
          seraphim, ravished with the holiness of the atonement, awe-struck with
          the justice of God in the great sacrifice. Reflect with reverence that
          God when he willed to save his elect would not commit a breach upon
          his laws; though he would redeem them from going down into the pit,
          yet he would not violate his word, nor change that most righteous
          penalty of death, which is the due desert of sin. Rather than stain
          his holiness he spared not his own Son, but freely delivered him up
          for us all. Consider the great love of holiness which must have been
          in the heart of the Father, that he would give up his Son to bleed
          sooner than his law should be dishonoured; and think of the great
          holiness of Christ, that he would rather give his back to the smiters
          and his cheeks to them that pluck off the hair, yea, rather stretch
          out his hands to the nails and expire forsaken of his God, than suffer
          sin to go unpunished. God would not even for mercy's sake issue an
          unjust pardon to the souls he loved.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I stand here this morning I also have visions of God, and the cross
          seems to me transformed into a burning throne, whereon justice is high
          and lifted up to the uttermost, as I see God himself in Christ Jesus
          bowing his head to death, that he might be just, and yet the Justifier
          of him that believeth. Around that cross I see troops of angels
          gathering, and I hear one crying unto another and saying, "Holy, holy,
          holy, is Jehovah Jesus, the great sacrifice for sin." Do you not unite
          in their reverent homage? If you do you will go forth and tell of
          pardon bought with blood, and of the atonement finished once for all.
          With hallowed confidence you will tell it out among the people that
          the holy Lord reigneth from the tree, until all creatures fall down
          and worship him that was slain, because his holiness was thereby
          revealed in noonday splendour.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was not all that was revealed to the prophet; for he heard the
          seraphim say, "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hosts; the whole earth
          is full of his glory." Even when men rejected Christ, even when hearts
          were fat, and eyes were dim, and ears were heavy, even then the whole
          earth was full of the glory of Christ. When scientists tell us that
          they cannot see God, I am amazed. To me it is impossible not to see
          him. Though I cannot pry with the scalpel into the anatomy of the
          human frame, yet when I look upon the mere skin of the human
          countenance I see the handiwork of God. Though I cannot dig into the
          lower strata of the earth and disentomb the fossil and decipher its
          stone preserved memorial, yet to me rock, and clay, and sand, and
          relic of the past, bear the sure hieroglyph of God. Though I cannot
          inform you of all the interesting details of insect life, or descant
          upon the secrets of botany, yet to me bees bring honeyed thoughts of
          God, and flowers breathe the perfume of his love. Where is God? Say
          rather, Where is he not? Not with these grosser senses, but by higher
          faculties I see and hear my God; yea, he doth surround me, and my
          faith embraceth him. I am no fool for this; the best authority
          declares that he is the fool who saith in his heart "There is no God."
          Yes, the whole earth is full of the glory of Christ, and above the
          earth in every cloud it is seen, and above the cloud every star shines
          out concerning him. Alas, for the blind-eyes that cannot see that
          which is evidently set forth in every place. Alas for the ears which
          cannot hear when earth, and sea, and heaven, and hell, are all echoing
          to the tread of the Omnipotent Christ of God. Oh brethren, have you
          ever seen this vision, have you ever seen God's glory filling the
          whole earth? If so, you are prepared for the times that are and are to
          be times of gloom, and darkness, and sin, and blasphemy -- and yet
          your heart does not tremble for the ark of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          When all this was seen of the prophet, he noted that the posts of the
          doors moved. If I am rightly informed, there were two huge columns
          before the temple called Jachin and Boaz. These were made with
          singular skill, and were the wonder of the age. They were of brass,
          cast by Solomon; but in the course of ages they had no doubt mellowed
          into bronze, and there they stood, two tremendous erections, upbearing
          massive doors. We are told, I know not whether it be correct, that the
          gates that swung upon these columns required at least twenty men
          either to open or to shut them; but as the prophet saw that vision he
          noticed that these massive columns trembled, and thus did obeisance to
          the God who was within their gates. Our Revised Version reads it, "The
          foundations of the thresholds were moved." Even to its foundations the
          house trembled with solemn awe of the divine presence. Brethren,
          heaven, and earth, and hell, and all created things reflect the glory
          of the Lord, and thus adore him. Oh Lord Jesus, thou art worthy of all
          honour. "All the earth doth worship thee." If it was so with posts and
          doors, shall not our hearts rejoice with trembling? shall not our
          souls be moved in the presence of the Most High? and will we not fall
          down before the glorified Christ, as John did, who wrote, "When I saw
          him I fell at his feet as dead?" Everything is filled with awe in his
          majestic presence, save only man, the impious rebel who dares defy his
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then came the best part of the vision for Isaiah. At the glorious
          sight, he felt, "Woe is me, for I am undone, I am stricken dumb. I can
          never speak again, for my lips are unclean, and I dwell among an
          unclean people." Then, swift as lightning flew a seraph, bringing a
          coal more burning than himself from off the altar of sacrifice,
          wherewith he touched the prophet's lip. Beloved, this is what we need.
          We need to feel the atonement laid home to us, to feel the power of
          the great sacrifice of Christ, to hear a voice saying within our
          spirit, "Thine iniquity is put away, and thy sin is purged." Though
          that live coal must have blistered the lip which it covered, yet it
          made it eloquent. Common fire would destroy the organs of speech, but
          the fire of sacrifice does not so, but it unlooses a grateful tongue,
          and helps a grateful heart to tell the love immense, unsearchable,
          which offered itself upon the altar of sacrifice, that holiness and
          love might save the sinner. Our peace comes from the Holy, Holy, Holy
          One, who is just, and yet forgives his people's sin. Brother, if you
          are to proclaim the glory of your Lord, you must feel the sacrificial
          coal applied to the place where your impurity is most seen, even to
          your lips; you must know that you are forgiven; for your conviction
          that you are clean before God will give you confidence in telling out
          to others the story of the cross. This is what Isaiah saw.
        </p>
        <p>
          Listen for a minute to that further word that follows: -- Isaiah when
          he saw his glory "spake of him." He that hath seen this sight must
          speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          He spake in deep humility. Never braver man than Isaiah, but never one
          who walked in lowlier reverence before his God. He never forgot to his
          dying day that "woe is me! for I have seen the King, the Lord of
          hosts."
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, observe that he spake with very willing obedience. "Here am I,"
          he said, "send me." He offers himself to be God's mouth to the people,
          whatever the message may be. He seems to say, "Here am I in the
          entirety of my being, purchased to thee by thy great pardoning love;
          use me as thou wilt, and send me where thou wilt." He continued to
          report his Lord's message under constant rebuffs, and despite the
          ceaseless obduracy of Israel. Though he cried, "Who hath believed our
          report?" yet he continued that report. That chapter which begins with
          his complaint, has in it not only a continuation of the report, but a
          fuller version of it than he had ever given before. He was sad but
          resolute, grieved yet persevering, broken in heart, but not broken
          down in constancy. Brethren, it needs great grace to go upon a
          fruitless errand. One had need see the glory of the Lord to be enabled
          to fight a losing battle. I am sometimes afraid that I have to do this
          myself; but if it be so, it is not ours to bargain for success, but to
          yield implicit obedience. It is ours to abide faithful to our
          commission, whether men will hear or whether they will forbear.
          Brethren, be it ours to serve the Lord gladly, and testify to what we
          have seen, even though no man should receive our witness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then it is said of Isaiah that he "spake of him," that is, of our
          Lord Jesus Christ. In all that Isaiah said he had an eye to Christ. It
          was all his business among men to speak of the glories of the coming
          Son of God. May the Lord give us such a sight of Christ in his glory
          that from this day forth we shall be absorbed in glorifying him. May
          our life be a perpetual ministry concerning Christ. Remember that word
          concerning John the Baptist, "John did no miracle, but all things that
          John spake of this man were true." If we can do no miracle and achieve
          no success, let us at least cry without ceasing. "Behold the Lamb of
          God." Though we decrease, it matters not so long as he doth increase;
          we are glad to disappear, as the morning star is lost at the rising of
          the sun. It is our delight to imitate the seraphim, and with veiled
          face and covered feet to attend about the throne of Jehovah Jesus our
          Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I now ask your kind attention to the second part of my subject,
          which is a very painful one, CONCERNING THE NATION TO WHICH ISAIAH
          SPAKE. Their terrible sin lay in this, that they were willingly
          blinded by the light which ought to have been to them a help to see
          Christ, and they were hardened by those very truths which ought to
          have melted them. They became more and more adverse to Christ through
          beholding in him such a character as ought to have won their hearts.
          To the prophet's teaching they were entirely dead. A specimen of this
          we find in the succeeding chapters of Isaiah. Israel and Syria
          attacked Ahaz, whose reign followed those of Uzziah and Jotham. The
          prophet came and said to Ahaz, "Take heed, and be quiet; fear not,
          neither fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands."
          Ahaz was assured that God would help him if he would but trust in him;
          but instead of doing so, the king determined to petition for the help
          of the great king of Assyria, with the result in the long run that
          "the king of Assyria came unto him and distressed him, but helped him
          not." Isaiah, to confirm his message, bade the king choose any sign
          either in the depth or in the height above; but the infidel king
          replied, "I will not ask, neither will I test Jehovah." He had so
          defiantly cast off allegiance to the true God that he would not even
          accept a sign, though it was left to his own choice. Thus Isaiah's
          message was rejected though put in the most winning form, for the
          hearts of the people were blinded and hardened so as to choose the way
          of destruction. Ultimately, as you know, the Assyrians carried the
          whole people away; for they had rejected God's message willfully, and
          wrath came upon them. What a grievous task to be called to preach to
          such a people!
        </p>
        <p>
          They went on from bad to worse as a nation; they turned aside
          grievously, but not in heart, so that when Christ came they were
          unable to discern him, for had they known him they would not have
          crucified the Lord of glory. This blindness was in part a punishment
          for their long rebellion. If men willfully shut their eyes, do you
          wonder that they become blind? If men will not hear, do you wonder
          that they grow deaf? He that perverts truth shall soon be incapable of
          knowing the true from the false. If you persist in wearing glasses
          that distort, everything will be distorted to you.
        </p>
        <p>"Hear the just law, the judgment of the skies!</p>
        <p>He that hates truth shall be the dupe of lies."</p>
        <p>
          But although this blindness was a punishment for former sin, it was
          itself a sin. They willfully rejected the testimony of God against
          themselves; they refused the self-evident Christ who would so greatly
          have blessed them. This wilful rejection was carried out so
          effectually that it became impossible to convert and heal them; they
          could not be instructed, or reformed, and therefore they were given
          over to destruction. Nothing remained but to allow the Romans to burn
          the temple and plough the site of the city. It was a dreadful thing
          that they should deliberately choose destruction, and obstinately
          involve themselves in the most tremendous of woes. Poor Israel, we
          pity thee! It was sad indeed to fall from so great a height! Yet we
          are bound to admit that God dealt with thee justly, for thou didst
          choose thine own delusions. The Lord cries, "Oh that my people had
          harkened unto me." Our Saviour weeps and cries, "O Jerusalem,
          Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even
          as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye would not!
          Behold, your house is left unto you desolate."
        </p>
        <p>
          What I have to say this morning is this -- that I am growingly fearful
          lest our own country should furnish a parallel to all this. Read the
          story of England, beginning where you will, and see how gracious God
          has been to us. Note well our great deliverances, from the destruction
          of the Spanish Armada to the overthrow of Napoleon. Do not forget how
          often this little country has been made victorious in wars against
          great peoples, who thought to swallow her up. Then reflect how God
          sent the light to us; how the gospel spread all over England, and how
          it has in many ways been rejected. How often since the days of
          Cromwell Rome has been allowed to dim the light of our Protestantism,
          and how it labours to do so still! See how this people have received
          the truth of heaven, but again and again have proved false to it,
          turning at one time to superstition and at another time to infidelity.
          At this moment we are rich, and despite depression in business, we are
          less tried by it than any other nation. And what comes of all this
          mercy but increased sin? Why, at this moment we have sin rampant among
          us almost beyond precedent. Think how the poor are oppressed and
          ground down with awful poverty in many parts of this great city. Shall
          not God avenge the cry of starving women? Worse still, if worse can
          be: those who dare walk our streets after sundown tell us that Sodom,
          in its most putrid days, could scarce exceed this metropolis for open
          vice. To our infinite disgust and horror, the names of certain of the
          greatest in the land are at this hour openly mentioned in connection
          with the filthiest debauchery. This is not the place for details, nor
          can I mention the matter, or even think of it without feeling my very
          soul on fire. Faithfulness requires plain speech; but it is a hideous
          evil that the dregs of vice should be the chosen luxury of certain of
          our hereditary legislators and rulers. Woe unto thee, Oh land, when
          thy great ones love the harlot's house! Deep is our shame when we know
          that our judges are not clear in this matter, but social purity has
          been put to the blush by magistrates of no mean degree; yea, it is
          said that the courts of justice have lent themselves to the covering
          and hushing up of the iniquities of the great. Shall not God be
          grieved by such a nation as this? He who has read a certain story,
          which is but too-well known, must have felt his ears tingle and his
          heart tremble. What is coming over us? What horrible clouds are
          darkening our skies? There were judges once who would not have
          suffered the laws to be trampled on by the great, but would have dealt
          out equal justice to rich and poor: I cannot persuade myself that it
          will be otherwise now, and yet I fear the worst. O God, have mercy
          upon the land whose judgment-seats and palaces are defiled with vice.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not all: a general indifference to all religion is creeping
          over the country; at least over this vast metropolis. Ask those who
          visit from door to door among our crowded populations, and they will
          tell you that never before in their life-time were there so few
          persons attendant upon the means of grace. Street after street of this
          city scarcely possesses more than one regular attendant upon the
          preaching of the word. The Sabbath is no longer a day of worship with
          millions. What continual efforts are made to rob us of the
          Sabbath-day; to degrade it into a common work-day, and to make a slave
          of the working-man. To-day the revelation of God is treated with
          indifference, or talked of as if it deserved no reverence or credit.
          Unbelief has sapped the foundations of the social fabric. Worst of
          all, -- I must not hold back the charge, many of the avowed ministers
          of Christ are no ministers of faith at all, but promoters of unbelief.
          The modern pulpit has taught men to be infidels. What truth is there
          which has not been doubted by divines, questioned by doctors of
          divinity, and at length been denounced by the priests of "modern
          thought?" Nothing remains upon which a certain school of preachers
          have not spit their scepticism. The experience of the unbelief of
          Germany is being repeated here. Among those who are ordained to be the
          preachers of the gospel of Christ, there are many who preach not faith
          but doubt, and hence they are servants of the devil rather than of the
          Lord. Think not that I am aiming at the Church of England. With all my
          objection to a state-church, I am not so unjust as to conceal my
          belief, that I see in the Episcopal Church at this time less of
          unbelief than among certain Dissenters: in fact, Nonconformity in
          certain quarters is eaten through and through with a covert
          Unitarianism, less tolerable than Unitarianism itself. So frequently
          are the fundamental doctrines of the gospel assailed, that it becomes
          needful, before you cross the threshold of many a chapel, to ask the
          question, "Shall I hear the gospel here to-day, or shall I come out
          hardly knowing whether the Bible is inspired or not? Shall I not be
          made to doubt the atonement, the work of the Holy Ghost, the
          immortality of the soul, the punishment of the wicked, or the deity of
          Christ?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I know I shall stir a hornet's nest by these honest rebukes but I
          cannot help it. I am burdened and distressed with the state of
          religion; a pest is in the air; no truth is safe from its withering
          infection. No signs can be more alarming than the growing infidelity
          and worldliness which I see among those who call themselves
          Christians. Does this nation really intend to cast off the fear of God
          and the doctrines of Holy Scripture to follow the vain imaginings of
          the sophists and the fashionable follies of the great? Are we to see
          again unbelief and luxurious sin walking hand in hand? If so, there be
          some of us who mean to take up our sorrowful parable, and speak as
          plainly as we can for truth and holiness, whether we offend or please.
          Be it ours still to thunder out the law of God, and proclaim with
          trumpet clearness the gospel of Jesus, not bating one jot of firm
          belief in the revelation of God, nor winking at sin, nor toning down
          truth, even though we fear that the only result will be to make this
          people's hearts gross, and their ears heavy, and their eyes blind. If
          it must be so, my soul shall weep in secret; but still, Oh Lord, here
          am I, send me. Be of good courage, Oh my heart, for the faithful have
          not ceased from among men; other voices will cry aloud and spare not,
          if haply our land may be purged of its present defilement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hearken yet again while I press this subject personally home to you.
          Has not this word a personal bearing upon some of you? Certain of you
          have heard the gospel preached plainly and honestly, and yet you have
          never received it: is there not creeping over you a fatal
          indifference? Are not your hearts turning to stone? Possibly you are
          professors of religion, and yet you do not feel the power of it; what
          does this mean? If you are not a praying people, nor a holy people,
          and yet you are a professing people, what an awful doom awaits you!
          Shall my ministry be a savour of death unto you? It may be that my
          voice grows stale to you, and what I say seems common-place: but is
          this to be the reason for your refusing Christ and his salvation,
          refusing the power of his word, refusing holiness which we would work
          in you? Oh, shall it be so? Will you die? Dear hearers, I should not
          like to meet one of you at that day of judgment and have to feel that
          I preached you into a greater blindness than you might have known. Oh,
          be converted! Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die? May God in infinite
          mercy speak to you that you may believe in Jesus now, lest that should
          come upon you which is spoken of by the prophet, "Behold, ye
          despisers, and wonder, and perish!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Ere I have done, hear the sweet whisper which closes the sixth of
          Isaiah. Notwithstanding all the terrible work that Isaiah had to do he
          was not left without comfort; the Lord said to him, "In it there shall
          be a tenth." You know how the prophet cried, "Except the Lord of hosts
          had left us a seed we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto
          Gomorrah." The Lord has his sacred tithe and these he will not lose.
          The tree has lost its leaves, for it is winter time; but still it is
          alive, and the sap will flow again, for its substance is in it! The
          tree is leveled by the axe; but weep not despairing tears, for it
          shall sprout again, for life is still in it. Even so the Church must
          live; truth must be victorious; purity must conquer, the Christ must
          reign. Behold, he cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him.
          Reject Christ if you will to-day, Oh ye who think yourselves so
          exceeding wise, but there is a people who love him, a secret people
          who cling to him; and when he comes, as come he must ere long, they
          will welcome him and partake in his glory. As for you that refuse him
          this day, how will you stand when he appeareth? Whither will you flee?
          You shall ask the hills to cover you, but they will refuse. You shall
          bid the mountains hide you, but they will not yield a cavern for your
          shelter. Be wise now, therefore, and no more resist your Lord. "Kiss
          the Son lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way while his wrath
          is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in
          him!" May you and I and all of us be of that blessed number. Amen and
          Amen.
