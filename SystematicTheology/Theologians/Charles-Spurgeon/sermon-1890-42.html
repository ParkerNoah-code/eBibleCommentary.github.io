        <p>I.</p>
        <p>That the oblation of the altar should be made each Lord's day.</p>
        <p>
          We decree that on each Lord's day the oblation of the altar should be
          made by men and women in bread and wine, in order that by means of
          these sacrifices they may be released from the burden of their sins.
        </p>
        <p>II.</p>
        <p>That an illiterate presbyter may not venture to celebrate mass.</p>
        <p>
          The sacrifice is not to be accepted from the hand of a priest who is
          not competent to discharge the prayers or actions (actiones) and other
          observances in the mass according to religious usage.
