          1. Then, too, Isaiah himself has plainly declared that there shall be
          joy of this nature at the resurrection of the just, when he says: "The
          dead shall rise again; those, too, who are in the tombs shall arise,
          and those who are in the earth shall rejoice. For the dew from Thee is
          health to them." And this again Ezekiel also says: "Behold, I will
          open your tombs, and will bring you forth out of your graves; when I
          will draw my people from the sepulchres, and I will put breath in you,
          and ye shall live; and I will place you on your own land, and ye shall
          know that I am the Lord." And again the same speaks thus: "These
          things saith the Lord, I will gather Israel from all nations whither
          they have been driven, and I shall be sanctified in them in the sight
          of the sons of the nations: and they shall dwell in their own land,
          which I gave to my servant Jacob. And they shall dwell in it in peace;
          and they shall build houses, and plant vineyards, and dwell in hope,
          when I shall cause judgment to fall among all who have dishonoured
          them, among those who encircle them round about; and they shall know
          that I am the Lord their God, and the God of their fathers." Now I
          have shown a short time ago that the church is the seed of Abraham;
          and for this reason, that we may know that He who in the New Testament
          "raises up from the stones children unto Abraham," is He who will
          gather, according to the Old Testament, those that shall be saved from
          all the nations, Jeremiah says: "Behold, the days come, saith the
          Lord, that they shall no more say, The Lord liveth, who led the
          children of Israel from the north, and from every region whither they
          had been driven; He will restore them to their own land which He gave
          to their fathers."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That the whole creation shall, according to God's will, obtain a
          vast increase, that it may bring forth and sustain fruits such [as we
          have mentioned], Isaiah declares: "And there shall be upon every high
          mountain, and upon every prominent hill, water running everywhere in
          that day, when many shall perish, when walls shall fall. And the light
          of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, seven times that of the
          day, when He shall heal the anguish of His people, and do away with
          the pain of His stroke." Now "the pain of the stroke" means that
          inflicted at the beginning upon disobedient man in Adam, that is,
          death; which [stroke] the Lord will heal when He raises us from the
          dead, and restores the inheritance of the fathers, as Isaiah again
          says: "And thou shall be confident in the Lord, and He will cause thee
          to pass over the whole earth, and feed thee with the inheritance of
          Jacob thy father." This is what the Lord declared: "Happy are those
          servants whom the Lord when He cometh shall find watching. Verily I
          say unto you, that He shall gird Himself, and make them to sit down
          [to meat], and will come forth and serve them. And if He shall come in
          the evening watch, and find them so, blessed are they, because He
          shall make them sit down, and minister to them; or if this be in the
          second, or it be in the third, blessed are they." Again John also says
          the very same in the Apocalypse: "Blessed and holy is he who has part
          in the first resurrection." Then, too, Isaiah has declared the time
          when these events shall occur; he says: "And I said, Lord, how long?
          Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses be
          without men, and the earth be left a desert. And after these things
          the Lord shall remove us men far away (longe nos faciet Deus homines),
          and those who shall remain shall multiply upon the earth." Then Daniel
          also says this very thing: "And the kingdom and dominion, and the
          greatness of those under the heaven, is given to the saints of the
          Most High God, whose kingdom is everlasting, and all dominions shall
          serve and obey Him." And lest the promise named should be understood
          as referring to this time, it was declared to the prophet: "And come
          thou, and stand in thy lot at the consummation of the days."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Now, that the promises were not announced to the prophets and the
          fathers alone, but to the Churches united to these from the nations,
          whom also the Spirit terms "the islands" (both because they are
          established in the midst of turbulence, suffer the storm of
          blasphemies, exist as a harbour of safety to those in peril, and are
          the refuge of those who love the height [of heaven], and strive to
          avoid Bythus, that is, the depth of error), Jeremiah thus declares:
          "Hear the word of the Lord, ye nations, and declare it to the isles
          afar off; say ye, that the Lord will scatter Israel, He will gather
          him, and keep him, as one feeding his flock of sheep. For the Lord
          hath redeemed Jacob, and rescued him from the hand of one stronger
          than he. And they shall come and rejoice in Mount Zion, and shall come
          to what is good, and into a land of wheat, and wine, and fruits, of
          animals and of sheep; and their soul shall be as a tree bearing fruit,
          and they shall hunger no more. At that time also shall the virgins
          rejoice in the company of the young men: the old men, too, shall be
          glad, and I will turn their sorrow into joy; and I will make them
          exult, and will magnify them, and satiate the souls of the priests the
          sons of Levi; and my people shall be satiated with my goodness." Now,
          in the preceding book I have shown that all the disciples of the Lord
          are Levites and priests, they who used in the temple to profane the
          Sabbath, but are blameless. Promises of such a nature, therefore, do
          indicate in the clearest manner the feasting of that creation in the
          kingdom of the righteous, which God promises that He will Himself
          serve.
        </p>

          4. Then again, speaking of Jerusalem, and of Him reigning there,
          Isaiah declares, "Thus saith the Lord, Happy is he who hath seed in
          Zion, and servants in Jerusalem. Behold, a righteous king shall reign,
          and princes shall rule with judgment." And with regard to the
          foundation on which it shall be rebuilt, he says: "Behold, I will lay
          in order for thee a carbuncle stone, and sapphire for thy foundations;
          and I will lay thy ramparts with jasper, and thy gates with crystal,
          and thy wall with choice stones: and all thy children shall be taught
          of God, and great shall be the peace of thy children; and in
          righteousness shalt thou be built up." And yet again does he say the
          same thing: "Behold, I make Jerusalem a rejoicing, and my people [a
          joy]; for the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the
          voice of crying. Also there shall not be there any immature [one], nor
          an old man who does not fulfil his time: for the youth shall be of a
          hundred years; and the sinner shall die a hundred years old, yet shall
          be accursed. And they shall build houses, and inhabit them themselves;
          and shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them themselves, and
          shall drink wine. And they shall not build, and others inhabit;
          neither shall they prepare the vineyard, and others eat. For as the
          days of the tree of life shall be the days of the people in thee; for
          the works of their hands shall endure." <br />
