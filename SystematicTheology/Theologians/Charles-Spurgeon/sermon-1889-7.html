        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.2102)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, September 1st, 1889, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath
          made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.
          Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said
          unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what
          shall we do?" -- Acts 2:36-37.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS WAS THE FIRST public preaching of the gospel after our Lord was
          taken up into glory. It was thus a very memorable sermon, a kind of
          first-fruits of the great harvest of gospel testimony. It is very
          encouraging to those who are engaged in preaching that the first
          sermon should have been so successful. Three thousand made up a grand
          take of fish at that first cast of the net. We are serving a great and
          growing cause in the way chosen of God, and we hope in the future to
          see still larger results produced by that same undying and unchanging
          power which helped Peter to preach such a heart-piercing sermon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peter's discourse was not distinguished by any special rhetorical
          display: he used not the words of man's wisdom or eloquence. It was
          not an oration, but it was a heart-moving argument, entreaty, and
          exhortation. He gave his hearers a simple, well-reasoned, Scriptural
          discourse, sustained by the facts of experience; and every passage of
          it pointed to the Lord Jesus. It was in these respects a model of what
          a sermon ought to be as to its contents. His plea was personally
          addressed to the people who stood before him, and it had a practical
          and pressing relation to them and to their conduct. It was aimed, not
          at the head, but at the heart. Every word of it was directed to the
          conscience and the affections, It was plain, practical, personal, and
          persuasive; and in this it was a model of what a sermon ought to be as
          to its aim and style. Yet Peter could not have spoken otherwise under
          the impression of the divine Spirit: his speech was as the oracles of
          God, a true product of a divine inspiration. Under the circumstances,
          any other kind of address would have been sadly out of place. A
          flashy, dazzling oration would have been a piece of horrible
          irreverence to the Holy Ghost; and Peter would have been guilty of the
          blood of souls if he had attempted it. In sober earnestness he kept to
          the plain facts of the case, setting them in the light of God's Word;
          and then with all his might he pressed home the truth upon those for
          whose salvation he was labouring. May it ever be the preacher's one
          desire to win men to repentance towards God and faith in our Lord
          Jesus Christ! May no minister wish to be admired, but may he long that
          his Lord and Master may be sought after! May none bewilder their
          people with the clouds of theoretic philosophy, but refresh them with
          the rain of revealed truth? Oh, that we could so preach that our
          hearers should be at once pricked in their hearts, and so be led at
          once to believe in our Lord Jesus, and immediately to come forward and
          confess their faith in his name!
        </p>
        <p>
          We must not forget, however, to trace the special success of the
          sermon on the day of Pentecost to the outpouring of the Holy Ghost, in
          which Peter had shared. This it is which is the making of the
          preacher. Immersed into the Holy Spirit, the preacher will think
          rightly, and speak wisely; his word will be with power to those who
          hear. We must not forget, also, that there had been a long season of
          earnest, united, believing prayer on the part of the whole church.
          Peter was not alone: he was the voice of a praying company, and the
          believers had been with one accord in one place crying for a blessing;
          and thus not only was the Spirit resting upon the preacher, but on all
          who were with him. What a difference this makes to a preacher of the
          gospel, when all his comrades are as much anointed of the Spirit as
          himself! His power is enhanced a hundredfold. We shall seldom see the
          very greatest wonders wrought when the preacher stands by himself; but
          when Peter is described as standing up "with the eleven," then is
          there a twelve-man ministry concentrated in one; and when the inner
          circle is further sustained by a company of men end women who have
          entered into the same truth, and are of one heart and one soul, then
          is the power increased beyond measure. A lonely ministry may sometimes
          effect great things, as Jonah did in Nineveh; but if we look for the
          greatest and most desirable result of all, it must come from one who
          is not alone, but is the mouthpiece of many. Peter had the one hundred
          and twenty registered brethren for a loving body-guard, and this
          tended to make him strong for his Lord. How greatly I value the loving
          co-operation of the friends around me! I have no word, to express my
          gratitude to God for the army of true men and women who surround me
          with their love, and support me with their faith. I pray you, never
          cease to sustain me by your prayers, your sympathy, and your
          co-operation, until some other preacher shall take my place when
          increasing years shall warn me to stand aside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet much responsibility must rest with the preacher himself; and there
          was much about Peter's own self that is well worthy of imitation. The
          sermon was born of the occasion, and it used the event of the hour as
          God intended it to be used. It was earnest without a trace of passion,
          and prudent without a suspicion of fear. The preacher himself was
          self-collected, calm, courteous, and gentle. He aired no theories, but
          went on firm ground, stepping from fact to fact, from Scripture to
          Scripture, from plain truth to plain truth. He was patient at the
          beginning, argumentative all along, and conclusive at the end. He
          fought his way through the doubts and prejudices of his hearers; and
          when he came to the end, he stated the inevitable conclusion with
          clearness and certainty. All along he spake very boldly, without
          mincing the truth -- Ye with wicked hands have crucified and slain him
          whom God has highly exalted. He boldly accused them of the murder of
          the Lord of glory, doing his duty in the sight of God, and for the
          good of their souls, with great firmness and fearlessness. Yet there
          is great tenderness in his discourse. Impulsive and hot-headed Peter,
          who, a little while before, had drawn his sword to fight for his Lord,
          does not, in this instance, use a harsh word; but speaks with great
          gentleness and meekness of spirit, using words and terms all through
          the address which indicate a desire to conciliate, and then to
          convince. Though he was as faithful us an Elijah, yet he used terms so
          courteous and kindly that, if men took offence, it would not be
          because of any offensiveness of tone on the speaker's part. Peter was
          gentle in his manner, but forceful in his matter. This art he had
          learned from his Lord; and we shall never have master-preachers among
          us till we see men who have been with Jesus, and have learned of him.
          Oh, that we could become partakers of our Lord's Spirit, and echoes of
          his tone! Then may we hope to attain to Pentecostal results, when we
          have preachers like Peter, surrounded by a band of earnest witnesses,
          and all baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we follow the run of Peter's argument, we do not wonder that his
          hearers were pricked in their hearts. We ascribe that deep compunction
          to the Spirit of God; and yet it was a very reasonable thing that it
          should be so. When it was clearly shown to them that they had really
          crucified the Messiah, the great hope of their nation, it was not
          wonderful that they should be smitten with horror. Looking as they
          were for Israel's King, and finding that he had been among them, and
          they had despitefully used him, and crucified him, they might well be
          smitten at the heart. Though for the result of our ministry we depend
          wholly upon the Spirit of God, yet we must adapt our discourse to the
          end we aim at; or, say rather, we must leave ourselves in the Spirit's
          hand as to the sermon itself as well as in reference to the result of
          the sermon. The Holy Ghost uses means which are adapted to the end
          designed. Because, beloved, I do desire beyond all things that many in
          this congregation may be pricked in the heart, I have taken this
          concluding part of Peter's discourse to be the text of my sermon this
          morning. Yet my trust is not in the Word itself, but in the quickening
          Spirit who works by it. May the Spirit of God use the rapier of his
          Word to pierce the hearts of my hearers!
        </p>
        <p>
          First, note that Peter speaks to his hearers upon their evil conduct
          to the Lord Jesus; and, secondly, he declares to them the exaltation
          that God has bestowed upon him. When we have dwelt on these two
          things, we will notice, in the third place, the result of knowing this
          grand fact -- "Let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God
          hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and
          Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, Peter dwelt tenderly, but very plainly, upon THEIR
          EVIL CONDUCT TOWARDS THE LORD JESUS. "He came unto his own, and his
          own received him not." As a nation, Israel had rejected him whom God
          had sent. The inhabitants of Jerusalem had gone further, and had
          consented unto his death; nay, had even clamoured for it, crying,
          "Crucify him, crucify him." Solemnly had the Jews exclaimed, "His
          blood be on us, and on our children." None of them had protested
          against the murder of the innocent One; but many of them had been
          eager to make an end of him. This Peter, in plain words, charged upon
          them, and they could not deny it; nor did they pretend to do so. It is
          well when a sense of guilt compels a man to stand silent under the
          rebuke of God. We then have hope of him that he will seek for pardon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men and brethren, we are not in Jerusalem, and the death of our Lord
          happened more than eighteen hundred years ago; therefore we need not
          dwell upon the sin of those long since dead. It will be more
          profitable for us practically to consider how far we have been guilty
          of similar sins against the Lord Jesus Christ. Let us look at home.
          Let each one consider his own case. I may be addressing some to-day
          who have blasphemed the name of the Lord Jesus. I do not suppose that
          you have been guilty of the vulgar language of blasphemy, which is
          coarse and revolting, as well as profane; but there are politer
          methods of committing the self-same crime. Some, with their elaborate
          criticisms of Christianity, wound it far more seriously than atheists
          with their profanities. In these days, wiseacres, with their
          philosophy, derogate from the glory of our Lord's nature, and, with
          their novel doctrines, undermine his gospel. Denying the atonement, or
          teaching it as something other than a substitutionary sacrifice, they
          try to make away with that which is the very heart and soul of the
          Redeemer's work. Men nowadays drink in opinions which lessen the guilt
          of sin, and, of course, lower the value of the atoning blood. The
          cross is still a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence. Men do not
          now accept the words of the Bible as authoritative, nor the teaching
          of the apostles as final; they set themselves up to be teachers of the
          great Teacher, reformers of the divine gospel. They do not accept the
          teaching of the Lord Jesus one half so much as they criticize it. If
          any here present have been thus guilty, may the Holy Spirit convince
          them of their sin! Since the Lord God hath made this atoning Jesus
          both Lord and Christ, and set him on his right hand, any teaching
          which does despite to him, however learned, however advanced, however
          cultured it may seem to be, is a grievous sin against the Lord God
          himself. By such conduct we are, as far as in us lies, again putting
          the Lord Jesus to death; we are attempting to make away with that
          which is the very life and glory of Christ. O my hearer, if you have
          denied his Deity, rejected his atoning blood, ridiculed his imputed
          righteousness, or scoffed at salvation by faith in him, may you be
          pricked in the heart as you see that God hath made that same Jesus to
          be Lord of all!
        </p>
        <p>
          Much more common, however, is another sin against our Lord Jesus --
          namely, neglecting him, ignoring his claims, and postponing the day of
          faith in him. I trust that none here are willing to die unconverted,
          or would even dare to think of passing away without being washed in
          the precious blood; yet, my hearers, you have lived to manhood; to
          ripe years; perhaps even to old age, without yielding your hearts to
          the Lord Jesus, and accepting him as your Saviour. To say the least of
          it, this is a very sad piece of neglect. To ignore a man altogether
          is, in a certain sense, as far as you are concerned, to kill that man.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you put him out of your reckoning, if you treat him as if he were
          nothing, if your estimate of life is made as if he were a cipher, you
          have put your Lord out of existence in reference to yourself. You
          treat him with empty compliment by observing his day, and hearing his
          Word; but you have no real regard for him. Is not this a cruel fault?
          From morning till night your Lord is not in all your thoughts; he
          never affects your dealings with your fellow-men; you never endeavour
          to catch his spirit of love, and considerateness, and meekness; and
          thus, as a Leader and Exemplar, he is dead to you. You have never
          confessed your sin before him, nor sought for pardon at his hands, nor
          have you looked to see whether he hath borne your sins in his own body
          on the tree. O soul, this is base neglect -- ungrateful contempt! God
          thinks so much of his Son that he cannot set him too high; he has
          placed him at his own right hand, and yet you will not spare him a
          thought! The great God thinks heaven and earth too little for him, and
          magnifies him exceedingly above all, as King of kings, and Lord of
          lords; and yet you treat him as if he were of no account, and might be
          safely made to wait your time and leisure. Is this right? Will you
          treat your Saviour thus? May this prick you in the heart, and may you
          cease from this base ingratitude!
        </p>
        <p>
          There are others who have done more than this, for they have rejected
          Christ. I now allude to those of you who have not been able to resist
          the appeals made to you by the Lord's ministers. You have felt a good
          deal -- felt more than you would like to confess. You have been so
          inclined to seek the Saviour that you have almost done so; sin has
          flashed in your face like the flames of Tophet, and in alarm you have
          resolved to seek salvation; you have gone home to bend the knee in
          prayer, you have read the Scriptures to learn the way of eternal life;
          but, alas! an evil companion crossed your path, and the question came,
          "Shall it be this man or Christ?" You chose the man: I had almost
          said, you chose Barabbas, and rejected Jesus. A sinful pleasure came
          before you when you had begun to be serious, and the question arose,
          "Shall I give up this pleasure, or shall I renounce all hope of
          Christ?" You snatched at the pleasure, and you let your Saviour go. Do
          you not remember when you did violence to your conscience? There was
          an effort about it, as you stifled conviction. You had to put forth a
          decided act of the will to quench the Spirit of God, and to escape
          from the strivings of your awakened conscience. I know not to whom
          this may apply; but I am certain, as certain as Peter was when he
          spoke to the crucifiers of Christ, that I am speaking to some who have
          been rejecters of the Lord Jesus Christ, not once nor twice. Some of
          you have distinctly rejected him almost every Sabbath-day; but
          especially when the Word of the Lord has been with extraordinary
          power, and you have felt it shake you, as a lion shakes his prey.
          Thank God, you are not past feeling yet! I pray you, do not presume
          upon the continuance of your tenderness. You will not always feel as
          you have felt: the day may come when even the thunders of God may not
          be heard by your deafened ear, and the love of Christ will not affect
          the heart which you have made callous by wilful obstinacy. Woe to the
          man when his heart is turned to stone! When flesh turns to stone, it
          is a conversion unto eternal death; just as the turning of stone to
          flesh is conversion to eternal life. God have mercy upon you, and
          prick you in the heart this morning, while you yet have tenderness
          enough to feel that you have rejected him whom you ought to embrace
          with all your heart!
        </p>
        <p>
          I must come a little closer to certain of you, who have forsaken the
          Lord Jesus Christ. There are a few unhappy persons here this morning,
          over whom I greatly grieve, because of their wanderings; and yet I am
          glad that they have not quite forsaken the courts of the Lord's house.
          These once professed to be disciples of Christ; but they have gone
          back, and walk no more with him. They were once numbered with us, and
          went in and out of our solemn assemblies for prayer and breaking of
          bread; but now we know them not. They were not backward to confess
          themselves Christians, But now they deny their Lord. In former days
          they were zealous, and apparently devout; they were quick in the
          service of God, and sound in their creed. But there came a day -- I
          need not describe the circumstances, for they differ in different
          cases -- when two roads were before them, and they must go either to
          the right or to the left; and they took the road by which they turned
          their back upon Christ, and upon the vitality of godliness. They went
          off into sin, and apostatized from the faith. We fear "they went out
          from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they
          would no doubt have continued with us." They have gone aside unto
          crooked ways, and we fear that the Lord will lead them forth with the
          workers of iniquity. O my backsliding hearer, I hope you are not a
          Judas; my trust is that you may be a Peter! You have denied your
          Master, but I hope you will yet weep bitterly, and be restored to your
          Lord's service. For your good I must bring home your wanderings to
          you; may the Lord prick you in the heart about them! Why have you left
          your Lord? Wherein has he wearied you? There may be present persons
          from the country, or friends from America, who were once glad to be
          numbered with the children of God, but now they care nothing for God,
          or his people. Alas! they take part with the adversaries of Christ,
          and the despisers of his precious blood! Friend, you are here this
          morning that I may bring your sin to remembrance, and ask you why you
          have done this thing! Were you a hypocrite? If not, why have you
          turned aside ? God has exalted to his throne the Saviour, on whom you
          have turned your back; have you not acted madly in what you have done?
          The Most High God is on the side of Jesus, and you are avowedly on the
          other side; is this right, or wise? It is painful to me to speak of
          these things. I hope it is far more painful for you to hear of them. I
          want you to feel as David did, when his heart smote him. What have you
          been doing? Has the Lord Jesus deserved this at your hands? Turn, I
          pray you, from your evil way, and turn unto the Lord with full purpose
          of heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. After Peter had dwelt upon the sin of his hearers in treating the
          Lord so ill, he declared to them THE EXALTATION BESTOWED ON HIM BY
          GOD. The great God loved, and honoured, and exalted that same Jesus
          whom they had crucified. O my hearers, whatever you may think of the
          Lord Jesus, God thinks everything of him! To you he may be dead and
          buried, but God hath raised him from the dead. To God he is the
          ever-living, the ever well-beloved Christ. You cannot destroy the Lord
          Jesus, or his cause. If you could do all that the most malicious heart
          could suggest, you could not really defeat him. Men wreaked their
          vengeance on him: once they put him to a felon's death, they laid him
          in the grave, and sealed the stone; but he rose again, for God was on
          his side. My hearer, whatever you do, you cannot shake the truth of
          the gospel, nor rob the Lord Jesus of a single beam of his glory. He
          lives and reigns, and he will live and reign, whatever becomes of you.
          You may refuse his salvation but he is still a Saviour, and a great
          one. His gospel chariot rolls on, and every stone which is placed to
          hinder it is crushed into the earth, and compelled to make a road for
          him. If you resist the Lord, you do it at your peril; but you do it in
          vain. You might as well hope to reverse the laws of nature, quench the
          sun, and snatch the moon from her orbit, as hope to overthrow the
          cause and kingdom of the Lord Jesus; for God is on his side, and his
          throne is established for ever. God hath raised his Son from the dead,
          and taken him up to sit at his right hand, and there he will remain
          while his enemies shall be made his footstool. By this you may see
          what evil you have done through rejecting Christ, and may know who he
          is whom you have neglected refused, and forsaken.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me remind you that, when we read of our Lord as being at the right
          hand of God, we perceive that he enjoys infinite felicity. At the
          right hand of God there are pleasures for evermore; and David said, as
          the representative of our Lord, "Thou hast made known to me the ways
          of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance." He who
          was the Man of sorrows now overflows with gladness. All his work and
          warfare done, he rests in boundless blessedness. His priestly work
          being finished, he sits down. No more does be feel the cross and
          nails, no more does he endure the mockery of cruel eyes and ribald
          lips. He is full of joy, that joy which be bids his people share when
          he says, "Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." His portion is
          measureless, infinite, inconceivable delight. Can it be that you are
          opposed to him, and neglect him, while God lavishes upon him more than
          all the bliss of heaven, and makes him to be the fountain of
          unspeakable delight to all his redeemed ones? Grieve that you should
          grieve him whom God thus loads with blessedness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, remember that at the right hand of God our Lord sits in
          infinite majesty. Jesus, whom you think little of, Jesus, from whom
          you turn aside, is to-day adored of angels, obeyed by seraphs,
          worshipped by just men made perfect. He is the highest in the highest
          heavens. Do you not hear the blast of heaven's trumpets, which
          proclaims him head over principalities and powers? Do you not hear the
          song which ascribes to him honour, and glory, and power, and dominion,
          and might? My faith anticipates the happy day when I shall stand a
          courtier in his unrivalled. courts, and behold him, the Lamb upon the
          throne, reigning high over all, with every knee in heaven and in earth
          gladly bowing before him. Can it be that you have neglected him whom
          God hath exalted? Can it be that you have refused him, that you have
          done despite to him, that you have, as far as you could, put him to
          death whom Jehovah has made Lord of all?
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is this all: for the place at the right hand of God, to which he
          is now exalted, is the place of power. There sits the Mediator, the
          Son of God, the man Christ Jesus, while his enemies are being subdued
          under him. Do not believe it, O proudest of doubters, that thou canst
          take away from Christ any measure of his power! He overrules all
          mortal things; he directs the movements of the stars; he rules the
          armies of heaven. He restrains the rage of his adversaries, and what
          he suffers to be let loose he turns to his glory. All power is given
          to him in heaven and earth; he reigns in the three realms of nature,
          providence, and grace. His kingdom ruleth over all, and of his
          dominion there shall be no end. O sirs, what do our hearts suggest but
          that we bow at his feet? that we worship him with loving reverence?
          that we yield to that supreme power which is used for purposes of
          love? Yet it is this Christ, this mighty Christ, who is set at nought
          by some of you, so that you run the risk of perishing because you have
          no heart for him and his great salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learn, next, that he is at the right hand of the Majesty in the
          heavens, seated as our Judge. If we refuse him as a Saviour, we shall
          not be able to escape from him as Judge in the last great day. All the
          acts of men are being recorded, and in that day, when the great white
          throne shall be set in the heavens, all things shall be made manifest,
          and we must stand unveiled in his presence. You have often heard and
          sung of him whose face was more marred than that of any man, when he
          was here as a sacrifice for guilty men. If you refuse him, you will
          have to stand before his bar to answer for it. The most awful sight
          for the impenitent in the day of judgment will be the face of the Lord
          Jesus Christ. I do not find that they cry, "Hide us from the tempest,"
          nor "Hide us from the angel-guards," nor "Hide us from their swords of
          fire," but, "Hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne,
          and from the wrath of the Lamb." Love, when once it turns to wrath, is
          terrible beyond compare. As oil when set on fire blazes with great
          force, so the meek and loving Jesus, when finally rejected, will
          exhibit a wrath more terrible than death.
        </p>
        <p>"Ye sinners, seek his grace,</p>
        <p>Whose wrath ye cannot bear;</p>
        <p>Fly to the shelter of his cross,</p>
        <p>And find salvation there."</p>
        <p>
          Perhaps through ignorance you have rebelled; repent, and take another
          course. You supposed that when you kicked against a sermon, you had
          only put down the minister's words; but in reality you resisted the
          Saviour's love. You thought that when you turned away from Christ and
          his people, it was only leaving a church, and having your name crossed
          out of a book. Ah, sirs! take heed, for I fear you have left the Lamb
          of God, and renounced your part in his Book of Life! At the last it
          may turn out to have been an awful thing to have been put forth from
          the Church of Christ on earth; for when we, as a church, do our Lord's
          bidding, that which we bind on earth is bound in heaven. In refusing
          the Lord's Word, you refuse him who speaks from heaven: you refuse not
          only his words, but himself, and he shall be your Judge -- your Judge
          most just, most holy. Oh, how will you bear it? How will you bear to
          stand at the bar of the despised Saviour?
        </p>
        <p>
          Peter also showed his hearers that the Lord was greatly exalted in
          heaven as the Head over all things to his church, for he had that day
          shed abroad the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit comes, he comes from
          Christ, and as the witness of his power. He proceedeth from the Father
          and the Son, and he bears witness with both. Christ's power was
          marvellously proved when, after he had been but a little while in
          heaven, he was able to bestow such gifts upon men, and specially to
          send the tongues of fire, and the rushing mighty wind, which betoken
          the energy of the Holy Ghost. He is such a Lord that he can save or
          destroy. The Christ that died upon the cross hath all things committed
          into his hands. He can this morning send forth salvation to the ends
          of the earth, so that multitudes shall believe and live; for him hath
          God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give
          repentance and forgiveness of sins. Or, he can turn the key the other
          way, and shut the door against this untoward generation; for he
          openeth, and no man shutteth; and he shutteth, and no man openeth. In
          any case, be ye sure of this, ye Gentiles, even as Peter would have
          the house of Israel be sure of it, that "God hath made that same
          Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          I notice that, at this time, few writers or preachers use the
          expression, "Our Lord Jesus Christ." We have lives of Christ, and
          lives of Jesus; but, brethren, he is THE LORD. Jesus is both Lord and
          Christ: we need to acknowledge his Deity, his dominion, and his divine
          anointing. He is "God over all, blessed for ever," and we can never
          praise him too much. A great and grievous error of the times is a want
          of reverence for our Lord and his sacrifice. To sit in judgment on his
          sacred teaching, is to spit in his face; to deny his miracles, is to
          strip him of his own clothes; to make him out to be a mere teacher of
          ethics, is to mock him with a purple robe; and to deny his atonement,
          in philosophical phraseology, is to crown him with thorns, and crucify
          him afresh, and put him to an open shame. Be not guilty of this, my
          hearers, for God hath made this same Jesus "both Lord and Christ"; let
          us worship him as Lord, and trust him as Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now I come to my closing point, which is, THE RESULT OF KNOWING
          THIS ASSUREDLY. May I here pause to ask -- do you know this assuredly?
          I hope all of you believe that God hath made Jesus Christ, the
          Mediator, in his complex person, as God-and-man, to be " both Lord and
          Christ." He was Lord, as God, always; but as God-and-man, he is now
          Lord and Christ. Manhood and Godhead are in him united in one wondrous
          Parson, and this Person is "both Lord and Christ." You believe it. But
          do you so believe it that it is a fact of the utmost importance to
          you? Will you assuredly believe it, that the man of Nazareth, who died
          on Calvary, is to-day both Lord and Christ? If you do now believe
          this, what are your feelings as you review your past misconduct
          towards him? Does not your past neglect prick you in the heart? If you
          do not so believe, it is of little use for me to describe what the
          result of such belief would be, for that result will not take place in
          you; but if you have so believed, and Jesus is to you Lord and Christ,
          you will look on him whom you have pierced, and mourn for him. As you
          recollect your negligence of him, your rejection of him, your
          backsliding from him, and all your ungrateful acts which show contempt
          of him, your heart will be ready to break, and you will be seized with
          a great sorrow, and a hearty repentance. The Lord work it in you, for
          his Son's sake!
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, that as the result of Peter's sermon, his hearers felt a
          mortal sting. "They were pricked in their heart." The truth had
          pierced their souls. When a man rinds out that he has done a fearful
          wrong to one who loved him, he grows sick at heart, and views his own
          conduct with abhorrence. We all remember the story of Llewellyn and
          his faithful dog. The prince came back from the hunt, and missed his
          infant child, but saw marks of blood everywhere. Suspecting his dog
          Gelert of having killed the child he drove his vengeful sword into the
          faithful hound, which had been bravely defending his child against a
          huge wolf, which lay there, all torn and dead, "tremendous still in
          death." Yes, he had slain the faithful creature which had preserved
          his child. Poor Gelert's dying yell pierced the prince to the heart;
          and well it might. If such emotions fitly arise when we discover that
          we have, in error, been ungenerous and cruel to a dog, how ought we to
          feel towards the Lord Jesus, who laid down his life that we, who were
          his enemies, might live?
        </p>
        <p>
          I recall an awfully tragic story of an evil couple, who kept an inn of
          base repute. A young man called one night to lodge. They noticed that
          he had gold in his purse, and they murdered him in the night. It was
          their own son, who had come back to gladden their old age, and wished
          to see whether his parents would remember him. Oh, the bitterness of
          their lamentation when they found that through the lust of gold they
          had murdered their own son!
        </p>
        <p>
          Take out of such amazing grief its better portion, and then add to it
          a spiritual conviction of the sin of evil -- entreating the Son of
          God, the perfect One, the Lover of our souls, and you come near the
          meaning of being "pricked in the heart." Oh, to think that we should
          despise him who loved us, and gave himself for us, and should rebel
          against him that bought us with his own blood while we were his
          enemies! I would to God everyone here, that has not come to Christ,
          would feel a sting in his conscience now; and would mourn that he has
          done this exceeding evil thing against the ever-blessed Son of God,
          who became man, and died for love of guilty men.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we read "they were pricked in their heart," we may see in it the
          meaning, that they felt a movement of love to him -- a relenting of
          heart, a stirring of emotion towards him. They said to themselves,
          "Have we treated him thus? What can we do to show our horror of our
          own conduct?" They were not merely convinced of their fault so as to
          be grieved, but their desires and affections went out towards the
          offended One, and they cried, "What shall we do? In what way can we
          acknowledge our wrong? Is there any way of undoing this ill towards
          him whom we now love?" To this point I would have you all come. I
          would have you know the meaning of Newton's hymn: --
        </p>
        <p>"I saw One hanging on a tree,</p>
        <p>in agonies and blood,</p>
        <p>Who fix'd his languid eyes on me,</p>
        <p>As near his cross I stood.</p>
        <p>Sure never till my latest breath</p>
        <p>Can I forget that look;</p>
        <p>It seem'd to charge me with his death,</p>
        <p>Though not a word he spoke.</p>
        <p>My conscience felt and own'd the guilt,</p>
        <p>And plunged me in despair;</p>
        <p>I saw my sins his blood had spilt,</p>
        <p>And help'd to nail him there.</p>
        <p>Alas! I knew not what I did;</p>
        <p>But now my tears are vain;</p>
        <p>Where shall my trembling soul be hid?</p>
        <p>For I the Lord have slain."</p>
        <p>
          Let us tearfully enquire how we can end our opposition, and prove
          ourselves to be his friends and humble servants.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a consequence of Peter's sermon, preached in the power of the Holy
          Spirit, these people exhibited obedient faith. They were roused to
          action, and they said, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" They
          believed that the same Jesus whom they had crucified was now Lord of
          all, and they hastened to be obedient unto him. When Peter said,
          "Repent!" they did indeed repent. If repentance be grief, they grieved
          at their hearts. If repentance be a change of mind and life, they were
          indeed altered men. Then Peter said, "Be baptized every one of you in
          the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins." Take the open and
          decisive step: stand forth as believers in Jesus, and confess him by
          that outward and visible sign which he has ordained. Be buried with
          him in whom your sin is buried. You slew him in error; be buried with
          him in truth. They did it gladly, they repented of the sin; they were
          baptized into the sacred name. And then Peter could tell them -- "You
          have remission of sins: the wrong you have done to your Lord is
          cancelled: the Lord hath put away your sin for ever. Remission of sins
          comes to you through Jesus, whom you slew, whom the Father has raised
          up. You shall not be summoned before the bar of God to account even
          for the hideous crime of murdering the Lord, for by his death you are
          forgiven. In proof of forgiveness you shall now be made partakers of
          the great gift which marks his ascending power. The Holy Spirit shall
          come upon you, even upon you his murderers, and you shall go forth,
          and be witnesses for him."
        </p>
        <p>
          O my hearers, to what a place have I brought you now! If indeed the
          Holy Spirit has helped you to follow me in my discourse, see where we
          have climbed! However black your crime, however vile your character,
          if you have seen the wrong that you have done, if you have repented of
          having done it because you see that you have sinned against your
          loving Lord, and if you will now come to him repenting and believing,
          and will confess him as he bids you confess him in baptism; then you
          have full remission, and you shall be partakers of the gifts and
          graces of his Holy Spirit, and henceforth you shall be chosen
          witnesses for the Christ whom God hath raised from the dead. Beloved,
          you need no choice speech from me: pure gold needs no gilding, and as
          I have told you the most wonderful of all facts in heaven or in earth,
          I let it remain in all its simple grandeur.
        </p>
        <p>
          May God write out this old, old story on your hearts! Oh, that he
          would issue a new edition of his gospel of love, printed on your
          hearts! Every man's conversion is a freshly-printed copy of the poem
          of salvation. May the Lord issue you hot from the press this morning,
          a living epistle to be known and read of all men; and specially to be
          read by your children at home, and your neighbours in the same street!
          The Lord grant that hearts may be pricked by this sermon, for his
          name's sake! Amen.
