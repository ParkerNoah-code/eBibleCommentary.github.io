          "But the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God,
          neither can he know then because they are spiritually discerned." -- 1
          Corinthians 2:14.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE APOSTLE PAUL knows of only two classes of men -- natural and
          spiritual. Before his eye all other distinctions are extinguished.
          Barbarian or Scythian, bond or friar, male or female, circumcision or
          uncircumcision -- all these varieties among men are mere accidents in
          his esteem. He does not stay to divide men, according to the symptoms
          of their nature. They may be devout men, such as make a profession of
          godliness, men of morality, men who have commenced sin, or men who
          have become adepts in it. He knows better than merely to judge of men
          by their symptoms; he takes either their diseased state or their
          healthy state, and so divides them. He lays the axe at the root of the
          trees, and doing so, he perceives only two classes of men -- the
          natural and the spiritual. Under the term "natural," the apostle
          includes all those persons who are not partakers of the Spirit of God;
          it matters not how excellent, how estimable, how intelligent, how
          instructed they may be. If the Spirit of God hath not given to them a
          new and higher nature than they ever possessed by their creature
          birth, he puts them all down at once in the list of natural men. They
          are what they are by nature. They never professed to have received the
          Spirit of God. He puts them down, therefore, as natural men. On the
          other hand, all into whom the Spirit of God has come, breathing into
          them a new and diviner life, he puts down under the other head of
          spiritual men. They may be as yet but babes in grace; their faith may
          be weak; their love may be but in its early bud; as yet their
          spiritual senses may be little exercised, perhaps their faults may be
          in excess of their virtues, but inasmuch as the root of the matter is
          in them, and they have passed from death unto life, out of the region
          of nature into that which is beyond nature -- the kingdom of grace --
          he puts them down also, all of them in one list, as spiritual men. And
          then he goes on to affirm concerning natural men, -- those who are not
          partakers of the Spirit, -- that the truths of God, which are
          spiritual, they do not and cannot receive. He teaches that it is
          utterly impossible that they ever should receive then, unless lifted
          out of that class of natural men and transformed by the Spirit's work
          into spiritual men. This change, however, being effected, they will
          not only receive the things of the Spirit, but embrace them with
          delight, feed upon them with intense satisfaction, and rise eventually
          into that state of glory which is next beyond the state of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          This morning I propose -- and O that God the Holy Spirit may bear
          witness in our hearts! -- I propose, first of all, to dwell a little
          while upon the great truth that natural men do not receive the things
          of the Spirit of God, but count them foolishness; in the second place,
          I shall show, for a moment only, that the reason of the rejection of
          the things of God cannot be because they are really foolish, for they
          are not so; thirdly, we shall come to the inference that the reason
          why the natural man rejects the things of God, is to be found in
          himself alone; and then, fourthly, we shall consider the practical
          lessons which the whole subject teaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, it is a well-known fact, and one which can be proved
          by the observation of every day, that THE NATURAL MAN RECEIVES NOT THE
          THINGS OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark, we lay this down as a rule. We do not say that the drunken or
          debauched natural man receives not the things of God. That is true;
          but we also insist upon it that the delicate and the refined natural
          man receives not the things of the Spirit of God. I do not pick out
          some one case, and say the uneducated, illiterate, coarse, low-minded
          natural man cannot comprehend spiritual things; but all alike, the
          most intelligent, enlightened, and trained natural men, equally, do
          not, and cannot, and will not comprehend the things of the Spirit of
          God. Like our apostle, we take a wide range, and do not leave out one.
          However amiable in natural temperament, however well trained by the
          best parental associations, however kept in check by the most
          excellent position in providence, however patriotic, however
          self-denying, however benevolent, however estimable in an other
          respects, the natural man does not and cannot receive the things of
          the Spirit of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now look around and search for the facts which prove the truth of
          this. How many natural men there are, and such as you would call good
          men too in some ways, who oppose violently the things of the Spirit of
          God. They do not believe them; nay, they say they are a lie. They
          cannot understand how men should be simpletons enough to believe such
          ridiculous things. Honestly do they imagine that they shall be
          snapping the chains of priestcraft and unrivetting the fetters of
          superstition, if they should come forward and attempt to prove that
          these spiritual things are a mere delusion. There, gentlemen, we have
          lived to see you, under a profession of religion, actually oppose
          those spiritual things which this religion teaches. We have lived to
          see what we scarcely ever dreamed to be possible -- clergymen of the
          Church of England themselves denying the truths which they swore they
          would defend, and in their "Essays and Reviews" seeking to cast down
          those spiritual things which once they professed to have understood
          when they claimed to have received the Holy Spirit by the laying on of
          the hands of their bishop. We have not only in these times opened and
          avowed infidel lecturers who, like honest men deny everything openly,
          but we have the hypocritical Christian infidel who, like a dishonest
          thief and wolf in sheep's clothing, willing always to take the gain of
          godliness, denies godliness itself. Perhaps it was left for this age
          to permit wickedness to culminate to the highest, and to see the
          growth of the vilest hypocrisy that ever appeared among the sons of
          men. We have had abundant proof that men of the most scientific minds,
          persons who have been exceedingly inquiring, men who have trod the
          realms of knowledge, and gone even to the seventh heaven of wisdom,
          that these have nevertheless proved that they could not receive the
          things of the kingdom of God, by their determined opposition and
          enmity against anything like the truth as it is in Jesus. When you
          hear them blaspheming the holy name of Christ, when you hear them
          bringing what they call "scientific facts" against the truth of
          revelation, be not amazed as though it were some new thing, but write
          this down in your memorandum book -- the Holy Ghost said of old, "The
          natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God," and these
          men live to prove that what the Spirit of God said was very truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          A greater proportion of persons there are who do not so much oppose
          violently as more secretly despise and condemn. Well, they tell us,
          they dare say that the Christian religion is a very good thing for
          some people, and especially for old women and for persons that are on
          the borders of the grave, but still no rational being would endorse
          full all the doctrines of the gospel, and especially that particular
          form of them which John Calvin taught; for if there be any doctrines
          that excite more the spleen of there wise men than any other, it is
          the doctrines of grace, the doctrine of discriminating, distinguishing
          love, the doctrine of divine sovereignty, the doctrine of God, being
          really God, and not man. Against these they have no words too bitter.
          "Oh," they say, "it is an exploded theory; it has had its day, and it
          has become effete," and so, without actually persecuting those who
          hold the truth, or without even setting themselves up by active
          efforts to put it down they do secretly with a sneer and with a jest,
          pass it by as a thing utterly unworthy of a rational person, a thing
          that is not for a moment to be thought of as being one half so
          important as the wing of a beetle, or as the particular flight of a
          sparrow, or the period of the migration of a swallow. All the facts of
          natural history they think valuable and important, but these grander
          truths which have to do with the kingdom of God they despise utterly,
          and think they are but the dream of simpletons. Again, I say, my
          brethren, marvel not at this. Let this be to you another argument that
          the Spirit of God knew what was in man, and rightly judged of the
          human heart when he said, "The natural man receiveth not the things of
          the Spirit of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Probably in this assembly there are very few of either of these two
          classes, but a far more numerous company now claims our attention. The
          great mass of mankind say, "We dare say it is all well, and good, and
          true, and it is a proper thing for ministers think about, and the
          deacons of churches, and so on, no doubt they should see to it: it is
          very proper that there should be a right creed, and that the articles
          of the Church should be defended, and of course the Bible Society
          should spread the Bible, but then, of course, nobody ought to be
          importuned to read it, it is of no particular importance." Better read
          the almanack than read the Bible, according to some; and as to the
          doctrines, "Oh," they say --
        </p>
        <p>"For forms of faith let graceless zealots fight,</p>
        <p>He can't be wrong whose life is in the right."</p>
        <p>
          "O yes, no doubt," they say, when they see some zealous brother
          vindicating a truth, "you are all right, and so is your friend
          opposite who believes the very reverse; you are both right as far as
          you go; and as far as I am concerned, I should never interfere with
          you, for I do not consider the things to be worth the turning of a
          hair; I never trouble my head at all about it. I have so much to do
          with the rise and fall of stocks in the market, of attending to my
          cattle, or seeing after my shop, that it would not do for me to
          attempt to be a theologian. The Bible is an excellent book; I have
          nothing to say against that, certainly; but, at the same time, for a
          farmer, a book on practical chemistry is more useful, and no doubt,
          for a person who holds some office in the parish, he had better buy a
          handy-book of common law than a book on the law of God." I only just
          give you a sketch of what many say and of what many more think. I know
          there are many of you here present to-day who say, "O yes, it is a
          good thing for us to go somewhere on a Sunday; we do not think the
          Sabbath should be broken; we like to hear a minister, and we like to
          see him in earnest, but it is of no importance to us; it is not a
          matter of concern to us." Ah! since, you, too have proved that, "the
          natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they
          are foolishness to him, because they are spiritually discerned." These
          things which are so important, that you should neglect everything else
          to attend to them, are by you thought folly; these eternal realities,
          compared with which the world's highest interests are but as
          unsubstantial shadows, you pass by as being idle dreams and doubtless
          they are dreams to you, because you, still being in your natural
          estate, do not, cannot, will not, receive the things of the Spirit of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not without those persons, also, who even go farther. They say,
          "Well these things are of no importance to me;" and they think that
          those are fools who feel that there is any importance in them to them
          personally. "Oh!" says one, "for a man to sit down and think the
          doctrine of election, and believe himself to be elect -- why the man
          must be of a very debased intellect." "Oh," says another, "to be
          always meditating upon the atonement of Christ -- why there are other
          themes more expansive to think thou this." "Ay," says a third, "to be
          turning over a mere system of divinity, and professing to be able to
          revel in certain mysterious truths, such persons must be of a weak
          mind, or else very fanatical or enthusiastic." And so you will often
          hear persons say, if a man be a little more earnest than usual,
          "Surely that man is going wild; certainly he is attaching an undue
          importance to these matters." They will put him down as a Sectarian,
          perhaps which is one of the most honorable names by which a true
          Christian is known in these times. "Ah!" they will say, "a zealot, a
          bigot!" because a man happens to be honest in what he professes to
          believe, and thinks that if religion be anything, it would be
          everything and if it be worth all our thought, it is worth all our
          thoughts: that if it have any truth in it, it ought to be the master
          and ruler of all other truths, and governor of all the thoughts and
          the acts of life. Now, Christian men and women, when ye see any who
          turn upon their heel and despise you, because with earnestness you
          would seek the Lord your God, and strive to honor him, think it not
          some new display of human depravity; think not that you have made a
          fresh discovery in the awful deep of human departure from God, but
          say, rather now again, "I know, and once more am I confirmed in the
          fact, that the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
          God." It is a great wonder that there is one Christian upon the face
          of the earth. Some religions teach doctrines palatable to human
          nature, but the doctrines of Christ are the most unpalatable that
          could have been suggested. Some religions find that in nature which
          echoes to their voice, but Christ comes and brings a sword upon the
          earth to slay the fondest darlings of our fancy, and put to death the
          proudest favourites of our ambition. Oh! had the religion of Christ
          taught us that man was a noble being, only a little fallen -- had the
          religion of Christ taught that Christ had taken away by his blood, sin
          from every man, and that every man by his own free-will, without
          divine grace, might be saved -- it were indeed a most acceptable
          religion to the mass of men; it would just suit their taste; and as
          the ox drinks down water, so would they drink it down. But such a
          religion as that of Christ, so diametrically opposed as it is to all
          the evil propensities of man, owes its very existence to the might of
          God: that it has not long ago died from the earth, through the decease
          of its last admirer, is only due to that supreme power of the Holy
          Spirit which goeth with the preaching of the gospel wherever Christ is
          faithfully lifted up.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, briefly on my second point. -- THE NATURAL MAN COUNTS THE
          THINGS OF GOD TO BE FOOLISH; but there is nothing whatever in the
          things themselves to justify such an estimation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sir, you do not know what you say when you declare that the gospel of
          Christ is absurd. I am certain you do not understand it, and that you
          are talking of something you have never studied. You are generally
          pretty safe with a man who rails at the Bible, by saying, "Did you
          ever read it?" You are not often wrong, when you hear a minister of
          Christ found fault with, by saying to the man, "Did you ever hear him?
          did you ever read his sermons?" In nine cases out of ten it is, "No, I
          do not know anything about him, yet I do not like him, I do not know
          anything about Christ, but I do not like him, I do not know anything
          about his doctrines, but I do not wish to know." I have heard persons
          rail at Calvinistic doctrine, who never in their lives have read a
          word that Calvin wrote. If you were to offer them a small treatise in
          which that noble system of divinity should be vindicated, they would
          say, "Oh! it is no doubt so dry, I should not be able to read it." Yet
          these learned gentlemen know what is inside a book without opening it!
          They are like some critics of whom I have heard, who, when they meet
          with a new volume, take the knife and cut the first page, smell it,
          and then condemn or praise. Many there are who do just the same with
          the Bible. They have heard some verses of it once or twice, they have
          got some idea of it, and straightway they are wise. They take to
          themselves their own degree of Doctor of Divinity, and they have much
          boldness in their unbelief. Now, of any man who should denounce the
          system of truth which is taught in Scripture as ridiculous and
          foolish, I can only say he has never taken the trouble to search it
          out for himself. Have not the mightiest intellects confessed that the
          truths of this book were infinitely above their highest flights? Even
          Newton, who could thread the spheres, and map the march of what else
          had seemed discordant planets, even he said there were depths here
          which no mortal could fathom. "O the depths of the wisdom of God!"
          This has been the exclamation of some of the most glorious minds that
          have ever enlightened the world. And I can say, and I know it to be a
          truth, that every man who reads the Word of God, and studies the
          divinity therein revealed -- if he at first thinketh that he
          understandeth it, when he reads again, finds that he has only begun to
          know; and when he shall have searched year after year, and have become
          more than usually prescient in the study of the things of God, he will
          still say, "Now I begin to know my folly, now I began to discover that
          God is above me and beneath me, but I cannot grasp him, I cannot find
          out the Almighty to perfection, his words, his works, his ways, herein
          revealed to the sons of men, are past finding out." You wise fellows
          who turn upon your heels, and sneer at things which have astonished
          minds infinitely vaster than yours, prove your own folly when you call
          the things of God folly. With regard to that particular form of divine
          truth which we hold so dear, currently called Calvinistic doctrines --
          there is no philosophy propounded by any sage, so profound as that
          philosophy. There are no truths that were ever taught so wonderful, so
          worthy of the profoundest research of the most expanded minds, as
          those doctrines of the eternal love, the discriminating grace, and the
          infinite power of God, co-working to produce the results which his
          wisdom had decreed. When every other science shall have been
          exhausted, when astronomy shall have no wonders left, when geology
          shall have no secrets to unravel, when natural history and philosophy
          shall have given up all their infinite treasures, there will still
          remain a mine without a bottom, there will still remain a sea of
          wisdom without a shore, in the doctrines of the gospel of the grace of
          God. The folly, therefore, cannot be in the doctrines themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as on the one hand, these things of the Spirit of God are wise and
          profound, so on the other hand, they are most important, and most
          imperatively necessary to be understood, so that if they be not
          received, it is not because they are uncongenial with our necessities.
          There are some speculations which a man need not enter upon. I receive
          constantly questions upon speculations which never struck my mind
          before, and certainly never will again. Persons want to know what is
          the origin of sin; they ask ten thousand questions which, if they
          could be answered, would not make them a whit the better. But the
          things of the gospel of God, which are as important as life and death
          depending upon them, men are content to slur over without making any
          earnest enquiry, or setting themselves to ascertain their truth. O
          sirs! the doctrines of God teach you your relationship to your Maker
          -- is not that worth understanding? They teach you your condition
          before the Most High God -- should you not know that? Ought you not to
          have clear ideas of it? They show you how God can be just to man, and
          yet be gracious -- is not that a riddle that is worthy to have an
          answer? They reveal to you how you can approach to God, and become his
          child; how you may be conformed to his image, and made a partaker of
          his glory -- is not that worth understanding? They reveal to you the
          world to come; they put to your short-sighted eye, a telescope which
          enables you to pierce the darkness and to see the unseen. The
          doctrines of grace put into your hands the keys of heaven, and unveil
          the secrets of death, and hell -- are not these things worth grasping?
          Are not the secrets of these places worth the discovery? The doctrines
          of grace put inside your hands powers infinitely greater than ever
          wizard was conceived to have wielded when he used his magic rod. By
          their might you can destroy your troubles; you can see your sins
          swallowed up; you can behold your enemies defeated; you can see death
          destroyed, the grave swallowed up, and life and immortality brought to
          light. If you, then, as a natural man, say that the things that are
          written in this book are foolish, it is not because they are trivial,
          unimportant, and despicable, for no man can ever over-estimate their
          value, and no soul can solemnly enough weigh them, and understand how
          important they are. It argues a high excess of impiety, when a man
          shall say that that which came from God is foolish. Perhaps blasphemy
          itself cannot outlive that, and yet how many have been guilty of this
          constructive blasphemy! Let my finger run around these galleries, and
          along these seats beneath; are there not many of you who have said the
          Bible was a dull and uninteresting book? And yet God wrote it! And
          what have you said? Have you not impugned your Maker? Have you not
          said, perhaps, that the doctrines of the Gospel were very unimportant?
          Can you believe that your Maker sat down to write an unimportant book,
          or that the Holy Ghost inspired men of old to write that which, if not
          nonsense, is certainly of no importance whatever? Come, bow your head
          and repent of this your grave offense, for an offense it is, since it
          is not within the compass of any modest reason to imagine that any
          word which God has written can be foolish, or unimportant or unworthy
          to be understood. I suppose it is granted by all who love the Word of
          God, and to those mainly I must appeal, that the reason why the
          natural man rejects the sinners of God is not because they are
          foolish; then there must be some other reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Thirdly, therefore. I propose to speak of THE REASON FOR THE
          REJECTION OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE GOSPEL BY NATURAL MEN.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reasons are to be found in themselves. And what are those reasons?
          The apostle tells us they cannot receive them, for they are
          foolishness unto them. I think he means they cannot receive them,
          first of all, for want of taste. You have sometimes seen a man
          standing before a splendid picture. It was painted by Raphael, or
          Rubens, or Titiens, and he stands and admires it. "What a noble
          countenance!" says he, "How well the colouring has been placed! How
          excellently he understands his lights and shadows! What a fine
          conception! I could stand a week and admire that splendid picture."
          Some country bumpkin, who is walking through the gallery, hears what
          our friend the artist is saying, and he says, "I should not like to
          stand a week and look at it, it looks to me to be an old decayed piece
          of canvas that wants cleaning. "I do not think the world would be much
          the worse if it should all get cleaned off." He walks through the
          gallery, and notices that on the wall outside there is a great daub --
          a picture of an elephant standing on its head, and a clown or two
          performing in some circus, and he says, "That's beautiful; that's just
          my taste." Now you blame our country friend because he cannot admire
          that which is really excellent, but finds a great deal more
          satisfaction in a common daub plastered on the wall. It would be quite
          correct to say of him that he cannot receive the beauties of
          refinement and taste, because he has never been in any way instructed
          in the matter; he has a want of taste for such things. Just so is it
          with the natural man. Give him some work of fiction -- a daub upon the
          wall. Give him some fine piece of imagination; (and what is that when
          compared with the word of him that spake from heaven?) and he is
          satisfied. But before the book of God, before the revelation of the
          Most High, of the All-Wise, he stands and he sees nothing; nothing to
          admire; nothing to enchant his heart; nothing to kindle his
          imagination; nothing to enlist his faith; nothing to arouse his
          powers; nothing to excite his hopes. Surely there in a sad want of
          taste here, and the natural man, for want of taste for such things,
          loves not the things of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is not merely for want of taste, it is for want of organs by
          which to appreciates the third. Here is a blind man, and we have taken
          him upon a pilgrimage to the summit of a mountain. What a landscape,
          my friend; what a landscape! What do you think of it? "Not much," says
          he. Why, look at those lakes there melting into one! Do you not see
          the mountain yonder across the valley? What a variety of colors upon
          its sides! Did ever you see such a blending of colors as that which is
          here produced by the Great Artist? And there, cannot you see yonder
          clouds how nobly they sail along? Look downward. What a pleasant sight
          is that village which seems to have diminished till it looks like a
          few children's toys put together there in sport. And now turn yonder
          and see that winding river like a thread of silver going through the
          emerald fields -- what a magnificent view! What do you think of it, my
          friend? "I do not think much of it," says he. You are astonished. At
          last you say, "Well, if you do not think something of this, you must
          be blind." "That is just what I am," says he, "and of course I do not
          think much of this when I am blind." Now that natural man is blind.
          The eye of the Christian is his faith; but the natural man, being
          destitute of a living faith in thy living Saviour, is like a man
          without eyes. He says it is foolish; it is nothing to him. Do you
          think you could get a blind man to count down hundreds of pounds for a
          single picture? It is of no use to him. What would a deaf man give to
          go where you hear the sweetest singing that ever trilled from human
          lips? "Oh! no," thinks he, "it is foolish." He can hardly understand
          why men should spend their money and give the time to listen to the
          numerous combinations of sound produced by a Handel. Or if blind, he
          cannot comprehend why men should build long galleries and hang their
          fortunes out in pictures, or why they should travel to the Alps, or
          wish to cross the sea to view the mighty wonders of other lands. "No,"
          says he, "it is foolish and trivial; better stop at home; there is
          nothing in it." So is it with the natural man. He lacks the organs, he
          has no ear of faith, no eye of faith, and he cannot therefore receive
          the things of God; they are foolishness to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But more than this -- not only does he lack taste and lack organs, but
          he actually lacks the nature which could appreciate these things. I
          will tell you a fable. There was a certain swine exceedingly learned
          among its class. It had studied the flavour of all manners of seeds,
          and fruits, and acorns, and knew right well, by long calculations and
          experience, the right time when the trough would be full, and when it
          would be time for it to come forth from its resting place. Greatly
          respected was this aged swine, and considered by its fellows to be one
          of the great dignitaries of the stye, and one day it enlightened its
          fellows by a speech to this effect: -- "I saw," said he, "the other
          night, by the light of the moon, a man -- poor simple man that he was,
          looking through a long tube at the stars. Now I thought within myself
          that surely he was mad. If he had been scraping up acorns, there would
          have been some common sense in it; if he had been getting together
          husks, why there would have been something practical in it, but for a
          man with two feet and two hands, to be letting them be still, and only
          using his eyes to look up at the stars -- ah! he must be a fanatic and
          an enthusiast; he is not as sensible and practical as you and I are,
          who are content so long as we get our barley meal regularly, and can
          creep back and lie down again in our straw." And all his audience
          grunted their approbation. They said at once that this human being was
          far inferior to the swine in the matter of practical wisdom. Do not
          smile, perhaps you belong to these gentry yourselves. I heard a human
          swine say the other day -- mark, a human swine -- it was one who
          sometimes could look through a telescope, and this human swine said,
          "Ah! there you are! You are going to your chapel on Thursday night,
          and to your prayer-meeting on the Monday, and you spend hours in
          praying and reading your Bible; it is fanaticism. Now, I am the man
          for common-sense; I stick to my business, I do. I say, Leave these
          things to take care of themselves.' I am looking out for the present;
          I am practical, I am." And those that were by, grunted their approval,
          like human swine, as they were, and if a really spiritual man had been
          present he would not have wondered, but he would have said, "Every
          being to its taste; these are natural men, and they set up their own
          nature; it is a swinish nature, and they act up to their swinish
          spirit." He would not have been angry with them, but he would have
          pitied them. Poor things, "The natural man receiveth not the things of
          the Spirit of God." "What a degrading simile!" saith one. It is, sir,
          but not more degrading than human nature is. "Why you make us out to
          be inferior to Christians then! "Of course you are. As much as the
          brute is inferior to a man, so is a mere natural man inferior to a
          spiritually-minded man, because we rise by three steps of the ladder.
          There is the animal, he lacks intellect. God gives intellect, and
          there comes the man; God gives his Spirit, and then comes the
          Christian, but the Christian is a higher and nobler creature than the
          mere offspring of Adam. Just as much as the second Adam, who is the
          Lord from heaven, exceeds the first Adam, who was but made of the dust
          of the earth, so do the seed of the second Adam exceed all the
          offspring of the first Adam; rising to a higher life, to greater
          dignities, and to a nobler destiny than they.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And now, lastly, I come to THE PRACTICAL TRUTHS WHICH FLOW FROM
          THIS GREAT THOUGH SORROWFUL FACT.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you not perceive, men and brethren, that if what I have stated be
          true there is absolute necessity for regeneration, or the work of the
          Spirit? An absolute necessity, I say, because in no one single
          instance can it be dispensed with. You may educate a nature till it
          should attain the highest point, but you cannot educate an old nature
          into a new one. You may educate a horse, but you cannot educate it
          into a man. You shall train the bird that sits upon your finger but
          you cannot train a limpet into an eagle, nor is it possible for you to
          train by the best instruction the natural man into a spiritual man.
          Between the two there is still a great gulf fixed. But cannot the
          natural man, by great efforts long-continued at last come to be
          spiritual? No, he cannot. Let the fish in the water wish as much as
          ever it likes, and despite Dr. Darwin's hypothesis, I aver that no
          pike by all its wishing ever wished itself into an ostrich, and that
          no single minnow was ever known to make itself into a lark. It may get
          as high as its own nature can get it but not beyond; it is a
          transformation which only the Divine Being can effect. So you may by
          your own efforts make yourselves the best of natural men. You may
          become the most patriotic of statesmen, you may become the most sober
          and discreet of moralists, you may become the kindest and most
          benevolent of philanthropists, but into a spiritual man you cannot
          bring yourself. Do what you will, and still at your very best there is
          a division wide as eternity between you and the regenerate man. But
          cannot another man help us out of such a nature into a state of grace?
          No, by no means; as man is powerless for himself, so is he powerless
          for his fellow. The priest may dip his pretentious fingers into the
          water which he professes to have sanctified, and may put the drops
          upon the infant's brow but that the child is regenerate is a lie. He
          may take the child in after-life into the baptismal pool if he will,
          and there bury him agreeably to the apostle's metaphor, but that by
          immersion any more than by sprinkling a soul can be regenerate, is a
          gross and infamous lie. He may put his hand upon his head and bless
          him in God's name, he may perform divers enchantments over him, and
          conclude at last with the final sacred greasing, and dispatch his
          spirit with extreme unction into another world but to regenerate
          another man is as impossible to our fellow-men as to create a world or
          to make another heaven, and rival the majesty of Deity. How, then, is
          it to be done? The Spirit of God alone can do it. O sirs! this is a
          great mystery, but you must know it if you would be saved, it is a
          solemn secret, but it is one which must be known in your consciences,
          or else shut out from heaven you must be. The Spirit of God must new
          make you, ye must be born again. "If a man be in Christ Jesus he is a
          new creature, old things have passed away, behold, all things have
          become new." The same power which raised Christ Jesus from the dead
          must he exerted in raising us from the dead, the very same
          omnipotence, without which angels or worms could not have had a being,
          must again step forth out of its privy-chamber, and do as great a work
          as it did at the first creation in making us anew in Christ Jesus our
          Lord. There have been attempts at all times to get rid of this
          unpleasant necessity. Constantly the Christian Church itself tries to
          forget it, but as often as ever this old doctrine of regeneration is
          brought forward pointedly, God is pleased to favor his Church with a
          revival. The doctrine which looks at first as though it would hush
          every exertion with indolence, and make men sit down with listlessness
          and despair, is really like the trump of God to awake the dead, and
          where it is fully and faithfully preached, though it grate upon the
          carnal ear, though it excite enmity in many against the man who dares
          to proclaim it, yet it is owned of God. Because it honors God, God
          will honor it. This was the staple preaching of Whitfield, and it was
          by the preaching of this that he was made as the mighty angel flying
          through the midst of heaven preaching the everlasting gospel to every
          creature. He was always great upon that which he called the great R --
          Regeneration. Whenever you heard him, the three R's came out clearly
          -- Ruin, Regeneration, and Redemption! Man ruined, wholly ruined,
          hopelessly helplessly, eternally ruined! Man regenerated by the Spirit
          of God, and by the Spirit of God alone wholly made a new creature in
          Christ! Man redeemed, redeemed by precious blood from all his sins,
          not by works of righteousness, not by deeds of the law, not by
          ceremonies, prayers, or resolutions, but by the precious blood of
          Christ! Oh! we must be very pointed, and very plain about
          regeneration, for this is the very pith and marrow of the matter --
          "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Another practical inference. If you and I, or any of us, have received
          the things of the Spirit of God, we ought to look upon that as
          comfortable evidence that we have been born again. What say you, my
          hearer? Does your faith lay her hand this morning upon the head of
          Christ, and take him to be your Saviour, your teacher, and your all?
          If so, blessed art thou, for flesh and blood have not revealed this
          unto thee. Or does thy spirit this morning not only agree to the truth
          of divine election, of assured redemption, and of the finished work
          and immutable love of Christ; but dost thou love the truth in thy
          heart as well as agree to it in the head? If so, the natural man
          receiveth not these things, therefore thou art no natural man; but the
          Spirit of God has brought thee into his kingdom, because he has
          enabled thee to receive his truth. Precious is faith indeed, because
          it assuredly evidences to us what is beyond the reach of our senses.
          You can't tell whether you are born again or not, except by your
          faith. There will be no difference in your face, there will be no
          difference in your flesh, nor even in your mental characteristics; you
          may remain to a great extent the same man as far as mind and body are
          concerned; but faith -- that which was not there before -- faith is
          the grand symptom which betokens returning health; it is the flag hung
          out upon the castle of the soul, showing that the King is the secret
          tenant in the state-room of the soul, it is the light which shows that
          the sun has risen; it is the morning star which heralds the full
          illumination and meridian sunlight of eternal glory. Prize your faith,
          ask for more of it, but look upon it as being an evidence that you
          have passed from death unto life.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, lastly, my dear hearers, how this text shows you the necessity of
          accompanying all your efforts to do good with earnest prayer to God!
          "Old Adam is too strong for young Melancthon." When we first begin to
          preach, we think that the doctrines that are so sweet to us will be
          sure to be sweet to other people; and when persons begin to abuse and
          find fault we are so astonished. Oh! if we had begun to learn the
          truth a little better, we should not be astonished at all, except when
          any receive the truth, for that we should always think to be the
          greatest miracle of all. You have been trying to teach your child, and
          it is not converted yet. Ah! don't marvel, but take your child in the
          arms of your prayer to the spirit of God, and say, "O Lord, I cannot
          put the truth into this child, for it cannot receive it: do thou renew
          its heart, and then it shall receive the truth indeed! "And specially
          may I ask your continued and earnest prayers for me. What is the
          minister of Christ to do? He has to speak to a mountain and bid it be
          removed. Can his words remove it? He has to speak to fire and bid it
          change its nature into water. He has to speak to the dead, and say,
          "Ye dry bones, live! "Is not his ministry a foolish and a futile thing
          unless the Spirit of God be with him? I pray you then, be instant in
          your prayers to God. Strive earnestly at the throne of grace for all
          the ministers of the New Testament, that power may be bestowed upon
          them, for we are better at home than here if the Spirit of God be not
          with us. In vain, O ye unbelievers, ye sound your trumpets! in vain, O
          ye Gideons, ye break your pitchers that the light may shine in vain,
          ye Jonahs, ye cry through the midst of the wretched city! in vain, ye
          Peters, ye preach even to peoples of many nations! If the Spirit come
          not down from on high like tongues of fire, if God send not life, and
          energy, and light with the Word, ye shall go back without your
          sheaves, -- ye shall return without success, wearied by
          disappointment, damaged by fear and ready to lay down and die. But oh!
          if thou comest forth, O Spirit of God! there is not a preacher in the
          corner of the streets who shall not win his souls; there is not a
          minister to-day in the humblest conventicle, in the lowest of back
          streets, which shall not be made like Peter on the Pentecostal day,
          there is not one feeble man or woman teaching children in the
          Sabbath-school who shall not become a winner of souls when the Spirit
          of God is with him!
        </p>
        <p>
          Of all that I have taught this morning, this is the sum. -- Man is
          dead in sin, and life is a gift of God. You who have received it
          should plead with God that that gift should be bestowed on others. "He
          that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; he that believeth not
          shall be damned."<br />
