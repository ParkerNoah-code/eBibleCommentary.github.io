        <p>OR</p>
        <p>PROPHETIC DRAMA</p>
        <p>JEREMIAH'S RHAPSODY OF THE DROUGHT</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they sit in black upon
          the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
        </p>
        <p>
          And their nobles send their little ones to the waters: they come to
          the pits, and find no water; they return with their vessels empty:
          they are ashamed and confounded, and cover their heads.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of the ground which is chapt, for that no rain hath been in
          the land, the plowmen are ashamed, they cover their heads.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yea, the hind also in the field calveth, and forsaketh her young,
          because there is no grass. And the wild asses stand on the bare
          heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail, because
          there is no herbage.
        </p>
        <p>REPENTENT ISRAEL</p>
        <p>
          Though our iniquities testify against us, work thou for thy name's
          sake, O LORD: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against
          thee. O thou hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in the time of
          trouble, why shouldest thou be as a sojourner in the land, and as a
          wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night? Why shouldest
          thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou,
          O LORD, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name: leave
          us not.
        </p>
        <p>THE PROPHET</p>
        <p>
          Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Even so have they loved to
          wander; they have not refrained their feet: therefore the LORD doth
          not accept them; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their
          sins.
        </p>
        <p>THE LORD (to the Prophet)</p>
        <p>
          Pray not for this people for their good. When they fast, I will not
          hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and oblation, I
          will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the
          famine, and by the pestilence.
        </p>
        <p>THE PROPHET</p>
        <p>
          Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the
          sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace
          in this place.
        </p>
        <p>THE LORD</p>
        <p>
          The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I
          commanded them, neither spake I unto them; they prophesy unto you a
          lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of
          their own heart. Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets
          that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and
          famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those
          prophets be consumed. And the people to whom they prophesy shall be
          cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the
          sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor
          their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon
          them. And thou shalt say this word unto them, 'Let mine eyes run down
          with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin
          daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very
          grievous wound. If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain
          with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that
          are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest go about in
          the land and have no knowledge.'
        </p>
        <p>REPENTENT ISRAEL</p>
        <p>
          Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul loathed Zion? why hast
          thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace,
          but no good came; and for a time of healing, and behold dismay! We
          acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers:
          for we have sinned against thee. Do not abhor us, for thy name's sake;
          do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy
          covenant with us. Are there any among the vanities of the heathen that
          can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O
          LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee; for thou hast made all
          these things.
        </p>
        <p>THE LORD (to the Prophet)</p>
        <p>
          Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be
          toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.
          And it shall come to pass, when they say unto thee, Whither shall we
          go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD: Such as are
          for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and
          such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for
          captivity, to captivity. And I will appoint over them four kinds,
          saith the Lord: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls
          of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and to destroy.
          And I will cause them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms
          of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah,
          for that which he did in Jerusalem. For who shall have pity upon thee,
          O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall turn aside to ask
          of thy welfare? Thou hast rejected me, saith the LORD, thou art gone
          backward: therefore have I stretched out my hand against thee, and
          destroyed thee; I am weary with repenting. And I have fanned them with
          a fan in the gates of the land; I have bereaved them of children, I
          have destroyed my people; they have not returned from their ways.
          Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have
          brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at
          noonday: I have caused anguish and terrors to fall upon her suddenly.
          She that hath borne seven languisheth; she hath given up the ghost;
          her sun is gone down while it was yet day; she hath been ashamed and
          confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before
          their enemies, saith the LORD.
        </p>
        <p>THE PROPHET</p>
        <p>
          Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a
          man of contention to the whole earth! I have not lent on usury,
          neither have men lent to me on usury; yet every one of them doth curse
          me.
        </p>
        <p>THE LORD (to the Prophet)</p>
        <p>
          Verily I will strengthen thee for good; verily I will cause the enemy
          to make supplication unto thee in the time of evil and in the time of
          affliction.
        </p>
        <p>THE LORD (to the People)</p>
        <p>
          Can one break iron, even iron from the north, and brass? Thy substance
          and thy treasures will I give for a spoil without price, and that for
          all thy sins, even in all thy borders. And I will make thee to serve
          thine enemies in a land which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled
          in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.
        </p>
        <p>REPENTENT ISRAEL</p>
        <p>
          O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my
          persecutors: take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy
          sake I have suffered reproach. Thy words were found, and I did eat
          them; and thy words were unto me a joy and the rejoicing of mine
          heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts. I sat not in
          the assembly of them that make merry, nor rejoiced: I sat alone
          because of thy hand; for thou hast filled me with indignation. Why is
          my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be
          healed? wilt thou indeed be unto me as a deceitful brook, as waters
          that fail?
        </p>
        <p>THE LORD</p>
        <p>
          Therefore thus saith the LORD: If thou return, then will I bring thee
          again, that thou mayest stand before me; and if thou take forth the
          precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: they shall return
          unto thee, but thou shalt not return unto them.
        </p>
        <p>EPILOGUE (to the Prophet)</p>
        <p>
          And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall; and they
          shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for
          I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD. And I
          will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem
          thee out of the hand of the terrible.
