          1. God, therefore, is one and the same, who rolls up the heaven as a
          book, and renews the face of the earth; who made the things of time
          for man, so that coming to maturity in them, he may produce the fruit
          of immortality; and who, through His kindness, also bestows [upon him]
          eternal things, "that in the ages to come He may show the exceeding
          riches of His grace;" who was announced by the law and the prophets,
          whom Christ confessed as His Father. Now He is the Creator, and He it
          is who is God over all, as Esaias says, "I am witness, saith the Lord
          God, and my servant whom I have chosen, that ye may know, and believe,
          and understand that I am. Before me there was no other God, neither
          shall be after me. I am God, and besides me there is no Saviour. I
          have proclaimed, and I have saved." And again: "I myself am the first
          God, and I am above things to come." For neither in an ambiguous, nor
          arrogant, nor boastful manner, does He say these things; but since it
          was impossible, without God, to come to a knowledge of God, He teaches
          men, through His Word, to know God. To those, therefore, who are
          ignorant of these matters, and on this account imagine that they have
          discovered another Father, justly does one say, "Ye do err, not
          knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. For our Lord and Master, in the answer which He gave to the
          Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, and who do therefore
          dishonour God, and lower the credit of the law, did both indicate a
          resurrection, and reveal God, saying to them, "Ye do err, not knowing
          the Scriptures, nor the power of God." "For, touching the resurrection
          of the dead," He says, "have ye not read that which was spoken by God,
          saying, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of
          Jacob?" And He added, "He is not the God of the dead, but of the
          living; for all live to Him." By these arguments He unquestionably
          made it clear, that He who spake to Moses out of the bush, and
          declared Himself to be the God of the fathers, He is the God of the
          living. For who is the God of the living unless He who is God, and
          above whom there is no other God? Whom also Daniel the prophet, when
          Cyrus king of the Persians said to him, "Why dost thou not worship
          Bel?" did proclaim, saying, "Because I do not worship idols made with
          hands, but the living God, who established the heaven and the earth
          and has dominion over all flesh." Again did he say, "I will adore the
          Lord my God, because He is the living God." He, then, who was adored
          by the prophets as the living God, He is the God of the living; and
          His Word is He who also spake to Moses, who also put the Sadducees to
          silence, who also bestowed the gift of resurrection, thus revealing
          [both] truths to those who are blind, that is, the resurrection and
          God [in His true character]. For if He be not the God of the dead, but
          of the living, yet was called the God of the fathers who were
          sleeping, they do indubitably live to God, and have not passed out of
          existence, since they are children of the resurrection. But our Lord
          is Himself the resurrection, as He does Himself declare, "I am the
          resurrection and the life." But the fathers are His children; for it
          is said by the prophet: "Instead of thy fathers, thy children have
          been made to thee." Christ Himself, therefore, together with the
          Father, is the God of the living, who spake to Moses, and who was also
          manifested to the fathers.

          3. And teaching this very thing, He said to the Jews: "Your father
          Abraham rejoiced that he should see my day; and he saw it, and was
          glad." What is intended? "Abraham believed God, and it was imputed
          unto him for righteousness." In the first place, [he believed] that He
          was the maker of heaven and earth, the only God; and in the next
          place, that He would make his seed as the stars of heaven. This is
          what is meant by Paul, [when he says,] "as lights in the world."
          Righteously, therefore, having left his earthly kindred, he followed
          the Word of God, walking as a pilgrim with the Word, that he might
          [afterwards] have his abode with the Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Righteously also the apostles, being of the race of Abraham, left
          the ship and their father, and followed the Word. Righteously also do
          we, possessing the same faith as Abraham, and taking up the cross as
          Isaac did the wood, follow Him. For in Abraham man had learned
          beforehand, and had been accustomed to follow the Word of God. For
          Abraham, according to his faith, followed the command of the Word of
          God, and with a ready mind delivered up, as a sacrifice to God, his
          only-begotten and beloved son, in order that God also might be pleased
          to offer up for all his seed His own beloved and only-begotten Son, as
          a sacrifice for our redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Since, therefore, Abraham was a prophet and saw in the Spirit the
          day of the Lord's coming, and the dispensation of His suffering,
          through whom both he himself and all who, following the example of his
          faith, trust in God, should be saved, he rejoiced exceedingly. The
          Lord, therefore, was not unknown to Abraham, whose day he desired to
          see; nor, again, was the Lord's Father, for he had learned from the
          Word of the Lord, and believed Him; wherefore it was accounted to him
          by the Lord for righteousness. For faith towards God justifies a man;
          and therefore he said, "I will stretch forth my hand to the most high
          God, who made the heaven and the earth." All these truths, however, do
          those holding perverse opinions endeavour to overthrow, because of one
          passage, which they certainly do not understand correctly.<br />
