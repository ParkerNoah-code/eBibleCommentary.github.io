        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.493)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, February 8th, 1863, by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>

          |And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as
          it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.| -- Luke
          22:44.
        </p>
        <p>
          FEW HAD FELLOWSHIP with the sorrows of Gethsemane. The majority of the
          disciples were not there. They were not sufficiently advanced in grace
          to be admitted to behold the mysteries of |the agony.| Occupied with
          the Passover feast at their own houses, they represent the many who
          live upon the letter, but are mere babes and sucklings as to the
          spirit of the gospel. The walls of Gethsemane fitly typify that
          weakness in grace which effectually shuts in the deeper marvels of
          communion from the gaze of ordinary believers. To twelve, nay, to
          eleven only was the privilege given to enter Gethsemane and see this
          great sight. Out of the eleven, eight were left at some distance; they
          had fellowship, but not of that intimate sort to which the men greatly
          beloved are admitted. Only three highly favored ones, who had been
          with him on the mount of transfiguration, and had witnessed the
          life-giving miracle in the house of Jairus -- only these three could
          approach the veil of his mysterious sorrow: within that veil even
          these must not intrude; a stone's-cast distance must be left between.
          He must tread the wine-press alone, and of the people there must be
          none with him. Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, represent the few
          eminent, experienced, grace-taught saints, who may be written down as
          |Fathers;| these having done business on great waters, can in some
          degree, measure the huge Atlantic waves of their Redeemer's passion;
          having been much alone with him, they can read his heart far better
          than those who merely see him amid the crowd. To some selected spirits
          it is given, for the good of others, and to strengthen them for some
          future, special, and tremendous conflict, to enter the inner circle
          and hear the pleadings of the suffering High priest; they have
          fellowship with him in his sufferings, and are made conformable unto
          his death. Yet I say, even these, the elect out of the elect, these
          choice and peculiar favourites among the kings courtiers, even these
          cannot penetrate the secret places of the Savior's woe, so as to
          comprehend all his agonies. |Thine unknown sufferings| is the
          remarkable expression of the Greek liturgy; for there is an inner
          chamber in his grief, shut out from human knowledge and fellowship.
          Was it not here that Christ was more than ever an |Unspeakable gift|
          to us? Is not Watts right when he sings --
        </p>
        <p>|And all the unknown joys he gives,</p>
        <p>Were bought with agonies unknown.|</p>
        <p>
          Since it would not be possible for any believer, however experienced,
          to know for himself all that our Lord endured in the place of the
          olivepress, when he was crushed beneath the upper and the nether
          mill-stone of mental suffering and hellish malice, it is clearly far
          beyond the preacher's capacity to set it forth to you. Jesus himself
          must give you access to the wonders of Gethsemane: as for me, I can
          but invite you to enter the garden, bidding you put your shoes from
          off your feet, for the place whereon we stand is holy ground. I am
          neither Peter, nor James, nor John, but one who would fain like them
          drink of the Master's cup, and be baptized with his baptism. I have
          hitherto advanced only so far as yonder band of eight, but there I
          have listened to the deep groanings of the man of sorrows. Some of
          you, my venerable friends, may have learned far more than I; but you
          will not refuse to hear again the roarings of the many waters which
          strove to quench the love of the Great Husband of our souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several matters will require our brief consideration. Come Holy
          Spirit, breathe light into our thoughts, life into our words.
        </p>
        <p>I. Come hither and behold the SAVIOR'S UNUTTERABLE WOE.</p>
        <p>
          The emotions of that dolorous night are expressed by several words in
          Scripture. John describes him as saying four days before his passion,
          |Now is my soul troubled,| as he marked the gathering clouds he hardly
          knew where to turn himself, and cried out |What shall I say?| Matthew
          writes of him, |he began to be sorrowful and very heavy.| Upon the
          word ademonein translated |very heavy,| Goodwin remarks that there was
          a distraction in the Savior's agony since the root of the word
          signifies |separated from the people -- men in distraction, being
          separated from mankind.| What a thought, my brethren, that our blessed
          Lord should be driven to the very verge of distraction by the
          intensity of his anguish. Matthew represents the Savior himself as
          saying |My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.| Here the
          word Perilupos means encompassed, encircled, overwhelmed with grief.
          |He was plunged head and ears in sorrow and had no breathing-hole,| is
          the strong expression of Goodwin. Sin leaves no cranny for comfort to
          enter, and therefore the sin-bearer must be entirely immersed in woe.
          Clark records that he began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy.
          In this case thambeisthai, with the prefix ek, shows extremity of
          amazement like that of Moses when he did exceedingly fear and quake. O
          blessed Savior, how can we bear to think of thee as a man astonished
          and alarmed! Yet was it even so when the terrors of God set themselves
          in array against thee. Luke uses the strong language of my text --
          |being in an agony.| These expressions, each of them worthy to be the
          theme of a discourse, are quite sufficient to show that the grief of
          the Savior was of the most extraordinary character; well justifying
          the prophetic exclamation |Behold and see if there be any sorrow like
          unto my sorrow which was done unto me.| He stands before us peerless
          in misery. None are molested by the powers of evil as he was; as if
          the powers of hell had given commandment to their legions, |Fight
          neither with small nor great, save only with the king himself.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Should we profess to understand all the sources of our Lord's agony,
          wisdom would rebuke us with the question |Hast thou entered into the
          springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in search of the depths?| We
          cannot do more than look at the revealed causes of grief. It partly
          arose from the horror of his soul when fully comprehending the meaning
          of sin. Brethren, when you were first convinced of sin and saw it as a
          thing exceeding sinful, though your perception of its sinfulness was
          but faint compared with its real heinousness, yet horror took hold
          upon you. Do you remember those sleepless nights? Like the Psalmist,
          you said |My bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long, for
          day and night thy hand was heavy upon me; my moisture is turned into
          the drought of summer.| Some of us can remember when our souls chose
          strangling rather than life; when if the shadows of death could have
          covered us from the wrath of God we would have been too glad to sleep
          in the grave that we might not make our bed in hell. Our blessed Lord
          saw sin in its natural blackness. He had a most distinct perception of
          its treasonable assault upon his God, its murderous hatred to himself,
          and its destructive influence upon mankind. Well might horror take
          hold upon him, for a sight of sin must be far more hideous than a
          sight of hell, which is but its offspring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another deep fountain of grief was found in the fact that Christ now
          assumed more fully his official position with regard to sin. He was
          now made sin. Hear the word! he, who knew no sin, was made sin for us,
          that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. In that night
          the words of Isaiah were fulfilled -- |The Lord hath laid on him the
          iniquity of us all.| Now he stood as the sin-bearer, the substitute
          accepted by Divine justice to bear that we might never bear the whole
          of wrath divine. At that hour heaven looked on him as standing in the
          sinner's stead, and treated as sinful man had richly deserved to be
          treated. Oh! dear friends, when the immaculate Lamb of God found
          himself in the place of the guilty, when he could not repudiate that
          place because he had voluntarily accepted it in order to save his
          chosen, what must his soul have felt, how must his perfect nature have
          been shocked at such close association with iniquity?
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that at this time, our Lord had a very clear view of all
          the shame and suffering of his crucifixion. The agony was but one of
          the first drops of the tremendous shower which discharged itself upon
          his head. He foresaw the speedy coming of the traitor-disciple, the
          seizure by the officers, the mock-trials before the Sanhedrim, and
          Pilate, and Herod, the scourging and buffeting, the crown of thorns,
          the shame, the spitting. All these rose up before his mind, and, as it
          is a general law of our nature that the foresight of trial is more
          grievous than trial itself, we can conceive how it was that he who
          answered not a word when in the midst of the conflict, could not
          restrain himself from strong crying and tears in the prospect of it.
          Beloved friends, if you can revive before your mind's eye the terrible
          incidents of his death the hounding through the streets of Jerusalem,
          the nailing to the cross, the fever, the thirst, and, above all,
          forsaking of his God, you cannot marvel that he began to be very
          heavy, and was sore amazed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But possibly a yet more fruitful tree of bitterness was this -- that
          now his Father began to withdraw his presence from him. The shadow of
          that great eclipse began to fall upon his spirit when he knelt in that
          cold midnight amidst the olives of Gethsemane. The sensible comforts
          which had cheered his spirit were taken away; that blessed application
          of promises which Christ Jesus needed as a man, was removed, all that
          we understand by the term |consolations of God| were hidden from his
          eyes. He was left single-handed in his weakness to contend for the
          deliverance of man. The Lord stood by as if he were an indifferent
          spectator, or rather, as if he were an adversary, he wounded him |with
          the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But in our judgment the fiercest heat of the Savior's suffering in the
          garden lay in the temptations of Satan. That hour above any time in
          his life, even beyond the forty days' conflict in the wilderness, was
          the time of his temptation. |This is your hour and the power of
          darkness.| Now could he emphatically say, |The prince of this world
          cometh.| This was his last hand-to-hand fight with all the hosts of
          hell, and here must he sweat great drops of blood before the victory
          can be achieved.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have glanced at the fountains of the great deep which were broken
          up when the floods of grief deluged the Redeemer's soul. Brethren,
          this one lesson ere we pass from the contemplation. |We have not an
          high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our
          infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without
          sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we
          may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.| Let us
          reflect that no suffering can be unknown to him. We do but run with
          footmen -- he had to contend with horsemen; we do but wade up to our
          ankles in shallow streams of sorrow -- he had to buffet with the
          swellings of Jordan. He will never fail to succor his people when
          tempted; even as it was said of old, |In all their affliction he was
          afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them.|
        </p>
        <p>II. Turn we next to contemplate THE TEMPTATION OF OUR LORD.</p>
        <p>
          At the outset of his career, the serpent began to nibble at the heel
          of the promised deliverer; and now as the time approached when the
          seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head, that old dragon
          made a desperate attempt upon his great destroyer. It is not possible
          for us to lift the veil where revelation has permitted it to fall, but
          we can form some faint idea of the suggestions with which Satan
          tempted our Lord. Let us, however, remark by way of caution, before we
          attempt to paint this picture, that whatever Satan may have suggested
          to our Lord, his perfect nature did not in any degree whatever submit
          to it so as to sin. The temptations were, doubtless, of the very
          foulest character, but they left no speck or flaw upon him, who
          remained still the fairest among ten thousand. The prince of this
          world came, but he had nothing in Christ. He struck the sparks, but
          they did not fall, as in our case, upon dry tinder; they fell as into
          the sea, and were quenched at once. He hurled the fiery arrows, but
          they could not even scar the flesh of Christ; they smote upon the
          buckler of his perfectly righteous nature, and they fell off with
          their points broken, to the discomfiture of the adversary.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what, think you, were these temptations? It strikes me, from some
          hints given, that they were somewhat as follows -- there was, first, a
          temptation to leave the work unfinished; we may gather this from the
          prayer -- |If it be possible, let this cup pass from me.| |Son of
          God,| the tempter said, |is it so? Art thou really called to bear the
          sin of man? Hath God said, I have laid help upon one that is mighty,'
          and art thou he, the chosen of God, to bear all this load? Look at thy
          weakness! Thou sweatest, even now, great drops of blood; surely thou
          art not he whom the Father hath ordained to be mighty to save; or if
          thou be, what wilt thou win by it? What will it avail thee? Thou hast
          glory enough already. See what miscreants they are for whom thou art
          to offer up thyself a sacrifice. Thy best friends are asleep about
          thee when most thou needest their comfort; thy treasurer, Judas, is
          hastening to betray thee for the price of a common slave. The world
          for which thou sacrificest thyself will cast out thy name as evil, and
          thy Church, for which thou dost pay the ransom-price, what is it
          worth? A company of mortals! Thy divinity could create the like any
          moment it pleaseth thee; why needest thou, then, pour out thy soul
          unto death?| Such arguments would Satan use; the hellish craft of one
          who had then been thousands of years tempting men, would know how to
          invent all manner of mischief. He would pour the hottest coals of hell
          upon the Savior. It was in struggling with this temptation, among
          others, that, being in an agony, our Savior prayed more earnestly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scripture implies that our Lord was assailed by the fear that his
          strength would not be sufficient. He was heard in that he feared. How,
          then, was he heard? An angel was sent unto him strengthening him. His
          fear, then, was probably produced by a sense of weakness. I imagine
          that the foul fiend would whisper in his ear -- |Thou! thou endure to
          be smitten of God and abhorred of men! Reproach hath broken thy heart
          already; how wilt thou bear to be publicly put to shame and driven
          without the city as an unclean thing? How wilt thou bear to see thy
          weeping kinsfolk and thy broken-hearted mother standing at the foot of
          thy cross? Thy tender and sensitive spirit will quail under it. As for
          thy body, it is already emaciated; thy long fastings have brought thee
          very low; thou wilt become a prey to death long ere thy work is done.
          Thou wilt surely fail. God hath forsaken thee. Now will they persecute
          and take thee; they will give up thy soul to the lion, and thy darling
          to the power of the dog.| Then would he picture all the sufferings of
          crucifixion, and say, |Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be
          strong in the day when the Lord shall deal with thee?| The temptation
          of Satan was not directed against the Godhead, but the manhood of
          Christ, and therefore the fiend would probably dwell upon the
          feebleness of man. |Didst thou not say thyself, I am a worm and no
          man, the reproach of men and the despised of the people?' How wilt
          thou bear it when the wrath-clouds of God gather about thee? The
          tempest will surely shipwreck all thy hopes. It cannot be; thou
          canstnot drink of this cup, nor be baptized wiit this baptism.| In
          this manner, we think, was our Master tried. But see he yields not to
          it. Being in an agony, which word means in a wrest ring, he struggles
          with the tempter like Jacob with the angel. |Nay,| saith he, |I will
          not be subdued by taunts of my weakness; I am strong in the strength
          of my Godhead, I will overcome thee yet.| Yet was the temptation so
          awful, that, in order to master it, his mental depression caused him
          to |sweat as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Possibly, also, the temptation may have arisen from a suggestion that
          he was utterly forsaken. I do not know -- there may be sterner trials
          than this, but surely this is one of the worst, to be utterly
          forsaken. |See,| said Satan, as he hissed it out between his teeth --
          |see, thou hast a friend nowhere! Look up to heaven, thy Father hath
          shut up the bowels of his compassion against thee. Not an angel in thy
          Father's courts will stretch out his hand to help thee. Look thou
          yonder, not one of those spirits who honored thy birth will interfere
          to protect thy life. All heaven is false to thee; thou art left alone.
          And as for earth, do not all men thirst for thy blood? Will not the
          Jew be gratified to see thy flesh torn with nails, and will not the
          Roman gloat himself when thou, the King of the Jews, art fastened to
          the cross? Thou hast no friend among the nations; the high and mighty
          scoff at thee, and the poor thrust out their tongues in derision. Thou
          hadst not where to lay thy head when thou wast in thy best estate;
          thou hast no place now where shelter will be given thee. See the
          companions with whom thou hast taken sweet counsel, what are they
          worth? Son of Mary, see there thy brother James, see there thy loved
          disciple John, and thy bold Apostle Peter -- they sleep, they sleep;
          and yonder eight, how the cowards sleep when thou art in thy
          sufferings! And where are the four hundred others? They have forgotten
          thee; they will be at their farms and their merchandize by morning.
          Lo! thou hast no friend left in heaven or earth. All hell is against
          thee. I have stirred up mine infernal den. I have sent my missives
          throughout all regions summoning every prince of darkness to set upon
          thee this night, and we will spare no arrows, we will use all our
          infernal might to overwhelm thee; and what wilt thou do, thou solitary
          one?| It may be, this was the temptation; I think it was, because the
          appearance of an angel unto him strengthening him removed that fear.
          He was heard in that he feared; he was no more alone, but heaven was
          with him. It may be that this is the reason of his coming three times
          to his disciples -- as Hart puts it --
        </p>
        <p>|Backwards and forwards thrice he ran</p>
        <p>As if he sought some help from man.|</p>
        <p>
          He would see for himself whether it was really true that all men had
          forsaken him; he found them all asleep; but perhaps he gained some
          faint comfort from the thought that they were sleeping, not from
          treachery, but from sorrow, the spirit indeed was willing, but the
          flesh was weak.
        </p>
        <p>
          We think Satan also assaulted our Lord with a bitter taunt indeed. You
          know in what guise the tempter can dress it, and how bitterly
          sarcastic he can make the insinuation -- |Ah! thou wilt not be able to
          achieve the redemption of thy people. Thy grand benevolence will prove
          a mockery, and thy beloved ones will perish. Thou shalt not prevail to
          save them from my grasp. Thy scattered sheep shall surely be my prey.
          Son of David, I am a match for thee; thou canst not deliver out of my
          hand. Many of thy chosen have entered heaven on the strength of thine
          atonement, but I will drag them thence, and quench the stars of glory;
          I will thin the courts of heaven of the choristers of God, for thou
          wilt not fulfill thy suretyship; thou canst not do it. Thou art not
          able to bring up all this great people; they will perish yet. See, are
          not the sheep scattered now that the Shepherd is smitten? They will
          all forget thee. Thou wilt never see of the travail of thy soul. Thy
          desired end will never be reached. Thou wilt be for ever the man that
          began to build but was not able to finish.| Perhaps this is more truly
          the reason why Christ went three times to look at his disciples. You
          have seen a mother; she is very faint, weary with a heavy sickness,
          but she labors under a sore dread that her child will die. She has
          started from her couch, upon which disease had thrown her, to snatch a
          moment's rest. She gazes anxiously upon her child. She marks the
          faintest sign of recovery. But she is sore sick herself, and cannot
          remain more than an instant from her own bed. She cannot sleep, she
          tosses painfully, for her thoughts wander; she rises to gaze again --
          |How art thou, my child, how art thou? Are those palpitations of thy
          heart less violent? Is thy pulse more gentle? |But, alas! she is
          faint, and she must go to her bed again, yet she can get no rest. She
          will return again and again to watch the loved one. So, methinks,
          Christ looked upon Peter, and James, and John, as much as to say, |No,
          they are not all lost yet; there are three left,| and, looking upon
          them as the type of all the Church, he seemed to say -- |No, no; I
          will overcome; I will get the mastery; I will struggle even unto
          blood; I will pay the ransom-price, and deliver my darlings from their
          foe.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now these, methinks, were his temptations. If you can form a fuller
          idea of what they were than this, then right happy shall I be. With
          this one lesson I leave the point -- |Pray that ye enter not into
          temptation.| This is Christ's own expression; his own deduction from
          his trial. You have all read, dear friends, John Bunyan's picture of
          Christian fighting, with Apollyon. That master-painter has sketched it
          to the very life. He says, though |this sore combat lasted for above
          half a day, even till Christian was almost quite spent, I never saw
          him all the while give so much as one pleasant look, till he perceived
          he had wounded Apollyon with his two-edged sword; then indeed, he did
          smile and look upward! But it was the dreadfullest sight I ever saw.|
          That is the meaning of that prayer, |Lead us not into temptation.| Oh
          you that go recklessly where you are tempted, you that pray for
          afflictions -- and I have known some silly enough to do that -- you
          that put yourselves where you tempt the devil to tempt you, take heed
          from the Master's own example. He sweats great drops of blood when he
          is tempted. Oh! pray God to spare you such trial. Pray this morning
          and every day, |Lead me not into temptation.|
        </p>
        <p>III. Behold, dear brethren, THE BLOODY SWEAT.</p>
        <p>
          We read, that |he sweat as it were great drops of blood.| Hence a few
          writers have supposed that the sweat was not actually blood, but had
          the appearance of it. That interpretation, however, has been rejected
          by most commentators, from Augustine downward, and it is generally
          held that the words |as it were| do not only set forth likeness to
          blood, but signify that it was actually and literally blood. We find
          the same idiom used in the text -- |We beheld his glory, the glory as
          of the only-begotten of the Father.| Now, clearly, this does not mean
          that Christ was like the only-begotten of the Father, since he is
          really so. So that generally this expression of Holy Scripture sets
          forth, not a mere likeness to a thing, but the very thing itself. We
          believe, then, that Christ did really sweat blood. This phenomenon,
          though somewhat unusual, has been witnessed in other persons. There
          are several cases on record, some in the old medicine books of Galen,
          and others of more recent date, of persons who after long weakness,
          under fear of death have sweat blood. But this case is altogether one
          by itself for several reasons. If you will notice, he not only sweat
          blood, but it was in great drops; the blood coagulated, and formed
          large masses. I cannot better express what is meant than by the word
          |gouts| -- big, heavy drops. This has not been seen in any case. Some
          slight effusions of blood have been known in cases of persons who were
          previously enfeebled, but great drops never. When it is said |falling
          to the ground| -- it shows their copiousness, so that they not only
          stood upon the surface and were sucked up by his garments till he
          became like the red heifer which was slaughtered on that very spot,
          but the drops fell to the ground. Here he stands unrivalled. He was a
          man in good health, only about thirty years of age, and was laboring
          under no fear of death; but the mental pressure arising from his
          struggle with temptation, and the straining of all his strength, in
          order to baffle the temptation of Satan, so forced his frame to an
          unnatural excitement, that his pores sent forth great drops of blood
          which fell down to the ground. This proves how tremendous must have
          been the weight of sin when it was able so to crush the Savior that he
          distilled drops of blood! This proves too, my brethren, the mighty
          power of his love. It is a very pretty observation of old Isaac
          Ambrose that the gum which exudes from the tree without cutting is
          always the best. This precious camphire-tree yielded most sweet spices
          when it was wounded under the knotty whips, and when it was pierced by
          the nails on the cross; but see, it giveth forth its best spice when
          there is no whip, no nail, no wound. This sets forth the voluntariness
          of Christ's sufferings, since without a lance the blood flowed freely.
          No need to put on the leech, or apply the knife; it flows
          spontaneously. No need for the rulers to cry |Spring up, O well;| of
          itself it flows in crimson torrents. Dearly beloved friends, if men
          suffer some frightful pain of mind -- I am not acquainted with the
          medical matter -- apparently the blood rushes to the heart. The cheeks
          are pale; a fainting fit comes on; the blood has gone inward, as if to
          nourish the inner man while passing through its trial. But see our
          Savior in his agony; he is so utterly oblivious of self, that instead
          of his agony driving his blood to the heart to nourish himself, it
          drives it outward to bedew the earth. The agony of Christ, inasmuch as
          it pours him out upon the ground, pictures the fullness of the
          offering which he made for men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you not perceive, my brethren, how intense must have been the
          wrestling through which he passed, and will you not hear its voice to
          you? -- |Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.|
          It has been the lot of some of us to have sore temptations -- else we
          did not know how to teach others -- so sore that in wrestling against
          them the cold, clammy sweat has stood upon our brow. The place will
          never be forgotten by me -- a lonely spot; where, musing upon my God,
          an awful rush of blasphemy went over my soul, till I would have
          preferred death to the trial; and I fell on my knees there and then,
          for the agony was awful, while my hand was at my mouth to keep the
          blasphemies from being spoken. Once let Satan be permitted really to
          try you with a temptation to blasphemy, and you will never forget it,
          though you live till your hairs are blanched; or let him attack you
          with some lust, and though you hate and loathe the very thought of it,
          and would lose your right arm sooner than indulge in it, yet it will
          come, and hunt, and persecute, and torment you. Wrestle against it
          even unto sweat, my brethren, yea, even unto blood. None of you should
          say, |I could not help it; I was tempted.| Resist till you sweat blood
          rather than sin. Do not say, |I was so pressed with it; and it so
          suited my natural temperament, that I could not help falling into it.|
          Look at the great Apostle and High Priest of your profession, and
          sweat even to blood rather than yield to the great tempter of your
          souls. Pray that ye enter not into temptation, so that when ye enter
          into it ye may with confidence say, |Lord, I did not seek this,
          therefore help me through with it, for thy name's sake.|
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. I want you, in the fourth place, to notice THE SAVIOR'S PRAYER.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear friends, when we are tempted and desire to overcome, the best
          weapon is prayer. When you cannot use the sword and the shield, take
          to yourself the famous weapon of All-prayer. So your Savior did. Let
          us notice his prayer. It was lonely prayer. He withdrew even from his
          three best friends about a stone's cast. Believer, especially in
          temptation, be much in solitary prayer. As private prayer is the key
          to open heaven, so is it the key to shut the gates of hell. As it is a
          shield to prevent, so is it the sword with which to fight against
          temptation. Family-prayer, social prayer, prayer in the Church, will
          not suffice, these are very precious, but the best beaten spice will
          smoke in your censer in your private devotions, where no ear hears but
          God. Betake yourselves to solitude if you would overcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark, too, it was humble prayer. Luke says he knelt, but another
          evangelist says he fell on his face. What! does the King fall on his
          face? Where, then, must be thy place, thou humble servant of the great
          Master? Doth the Prince fall flat to the ground? Where, then, wilt
          thou lie? What dust and ashes shall cover thy head? What sackcloth
          shall gird thy loins? Humility gives us good foot-hold in prayer.
          There is no hope of any real prevalence with God, who casteth down the
          proud, unless we abase ourselves that he may exalt us in due time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, it was filial prayer. Matthew describes him as saying |O my
          Father,| and Mark puts it, |Abba, Father.| You will find this always a
          stronghold in the day of trial to plead your adoption. Hence that
          prayer, in which it is written, |Lead us not into temptation, but
          deliver us from evil,| begins with |Our Father which art in heaven.|
          Plead as a child. You have no rights as a subject; you have forfeited
          them by your treason, but nothing can forfeit a child's right to a
          father's protection. Be not then ashamed to say, |My Father, hear my
          cry.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, observe that it was persevering prayer. He prayed three times,
          using the same words. Be not content until you prevail. Be as the
          importunate widow, whose continual coming earned what her first
          supplication could not win. Continue in prayer, and watch in the same
          with thanksgiving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, see how it glowed to a red-hot heat -- it was earnest prayer.
          |He prayed more earnestly.| What groans were those which were uttered
          by Christ! What tears, which welled up from the deep fountains of his
          nature! Make earnest supplication if you would prevail against the
          adversary.
        </p>
        <p>
          And last, it was the prayer of resignation. |Nevertheless, not as I
          will, but as thou wilt.| Yield, and God yields. Let it be as God
          wills, and God will will it that it shall be for the best. Be thou
          perfectly content to leave the result of thy prayer in his hands, who
          knows when to give, and how to give, and what to give, and what to
          withhold. So pleading, earnestly, importunately, yet mingling with it
          humility and resignation, thou shalt yet prevail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear friends, we must conclude, turn to the last point with this as a
          practical lesson -- |Rise and pray.| When the disciples were lying
          down they slept; sitting was the posture that was congenial to sleep.
          Rise; shake yourselves; stand up in the name of God; rise and pray.
          And if you are in temptation, be you more than ever you were in your
          life before, instant, passionate, importunate with God that he would
          deliver you in the day of your conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. As time has failed us we close with the last point, which is, THE
          SAVIOR'S PREVALENCE.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cloud has passed away. Christ has knelt, and the prayer is over.
          |But,| says one, |did Christ prevail in prayer?| Beloved, could we
          have any hope that he would prevail in heaven if he had not prevailed
          on earth? Should we not have had a suspicion that if his strong crying
          and tears had not been heard then, he would fail now? His prayers did
          speed, and therefore he is a good intercessor for us. |How was he
          heard?| The answer shall be given very briefly indeed. He was heard, I
          think, in three respects. The first gracious answer that was given him
          was, that his mind was suddenly rendered calm. What a difference there
          is between |My soul is exceeding sorrowful,| -- his hurrying too and
          fro, his repetition of the prayer three times, the singular agitation
          that was upon him -- what a contrast between all these and his going
          forth to meet the traitor with |Betrayest thou the Son of Man with a
          kiss?| Like a troubled sea before, and now as calm as when he himself
          said, |Peace be still,| and the waves were quiet. You cannot know a
          profounder peace than that which reigned in the Savior when before
          Pilate he answered him not a word. He is calm to the last, as calm as
          though it were his day of triumph rather than his day of trouble. Now
          I think this was vouchsafed to him in answer to his prayer. He had
          sufferings perhaps more intense, but his mind was now quieted so as to
          meet them with greater deliberation. Like some men, who when they
          first hear the firing of the shots in a battle are all trepidation,
          but as the fight grows hotter and they are in greater danger, they are
          cool and collected; they are wounded, they are bleeding, they are
          dying; yet are they quiet as a summer's eve; the first young flush of
          trouble is gone, and they can meet the foe with peace -- so the Father
          heard the Savior's cry, and breathed such a profound peace into his
          soul, that it was like a river, and his righteousness like the waves
          of the sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we believe that he was answered by God strengthening him through
          an angel. How that was done we do not know. Probably it was by what
          the angel said, and equally likely is it that it was by what he did.
          The angel may have whispered the promises; pictured before his mind's
          eye the glory of his success; sketched his resurrection; pourtrayed
          the scene when his angels would bring his chariots from on high to
          bear him to his throne; revived before him the recollection of the
          time of his advent, the prospect when he should reign from sea to sea,
          and from the river even to the ends of the earth; and so have made him
          strong. Or, perhaps, by some unknown method God sent such power to our
          Christ, who had been like Samson with his locks shorn, that he
          suddenly received all the might and majestic energy that were needed
          for the terrific struggle. Then he walked out of the garden no more a
          worm and no man, but made strong with an invisible might that made him
          a match for all the armies that were round about him. A troop had
          overcome him, like Gad of old, but he overcame at last. Now he can
          dash through a troop; now he can leap over a wall. God has sent by his
          angel force from on high, and made the man Christ strong for battle
          and for victory.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I think we may conclude with saying, that God heard him in
          granting him now, not simply strength, but a real victory over Satan.
          I do not know whether what Adam Clarke supposes is correct, that in
          the garden Christ did pay more of the price than he did even on the
          cross; but I am quite convinced that they are very foolish who get to
          such refinement that they think the atonement was made on the cross,
          and nowhere else at all. We believe that it was made in the garden as
          well as on the cross; and it strikes me that in the garden one part of
          Christ's work was finished, wholly finished, and that was his conflict
          with Satan. I conceive that Christ had now rather to bear the absence
          of his Father's presence and the revilings of the people and the sons
          of men, than the temptations of the devil. I do think that these were
          over when he rose from his knees in prayer, when he lifted himself
          from the ground where he marked his visage in the clay in drops of
          blood. The temptation of Satan was then over, and he might have said
          concerning that part of the work -- |It is finished; broken is the
          dragon's head; I have overcome him.| Perhaps in those few hours that
          Christ spent in the garden the whole energy of the agents of iniquity
          was concentrated and dissipated. Perhaps in that one conflict all that
          craft could invent, all that malice could devise, all that infernal
          practice could suggest, was tried on Christ, the devil having his
          chain loosened for that purpose, having Christ given up to him, as Job
          was, that he might touch him in his bones and in his flesh, yea, touch
          him in his heart and his soul, and vex him in his spirit. It may be
          that every devil in hell and every fiend of the pit was summoned, each
          to vent his own spite and to pour their united energy and malice upon
          the head of Christ. And there he stood, and he could have said as he
          stood up to meet the next adversary -- a devil in the form of man --
          Judas -- |I come this day from Bozrah, with garments dyed red from
          Edom; I have trampled on my enemies, and overcome them once for all;
          now go I to bear man's sin and my Father's wrath, and to finish the
          work which he has given me to do.| If this be so, Christ was then
          heard in that he feared; he feared the temptation of Satan, and he was
          delivered from it; he feared his own weakness, and he was
          strengthened; he feared his own trepidation of mind, and he was made
          calm.
        </p>
        <p>
          What shall we say, then, in conclusion, but this lesson. Does it not
          say |Whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall have.|
          Then if your temptations reach the most tremendous height and force,
          still lay hold of God in prayer and you shall prevail. Convinced
          sinner! that is a comfort for you. Troubled saint! that is a joy for
          you. To one and all of us is this lesson of this morning -- |Pray that
          ye enter not into temptation.| If in temptation let us ask that Christ
          may pray for us that our faith fail not, and when we have passed
          through the trouble let us try to strengthen our brethren, even as
          Christ has strengthened us this day.|<br />
