          1. It was necessary, therefore, that the Lord, coming to the lost
          sheep, and making recapitulation of so comprehensive a dispensation,
          and seeking after His own handiwork, should save that very man who had
          been created after His image and likeness, that is, Adam, filling up
          the times of His condemnation, which had been incurred through
          disobedience, -- [times] "which the Father had placed in His own
          power." [This was necessary,] too, inasmuch as the whole economy of
          salvation regarding man came to pass according to the good pleasure of
          the Father, in order that God might not be conquered, nor His wisdom
          lessened, [in the estimation of His creatures.] For if man, who had
          been created by God that he might live, after losing life, through
          being injured by the serpent that had corrupted him, should not any
          more return to life, but should be utterly [and for ever] abandoned to
          death, God would [in that case] have been conquered, and the
          wickedness of the serpent would have prevailed over the will of God.
          But inasmuch as God is invincible and long-suffering, He did indeed
          show Himself to be long-suffering in the matter of the correction of
          man and the probation of all, as I have already observed; and by means
          of the second man did He bind the strong man, and spoiled his goods,
          and abolished death, vivifying that man who had been in a state of
          death. For as the first Adam became a vessel in his (Satan's)
          possession, whom he did also hold under his power, that is, by
          bringing sin on him iniquitously, and under colour of immortality
          entailing death upon him. For, while promising that they should be as
          gods, which was in no way possible for him to be, he wrought death in
          them: wherefore he who had led man captive, was justly captured in his
          turn by God; but man, who had been led captive, was loosed from the
          bonds of condemnation.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But this is Adam, if the truth should be told, the first formed
          man, of whom the Scripture says that the Lord spake, "Let Us make man
          after Our own image and likeness;" and we are all from him: and as we
          are from him, therefore have we all inherited his title. But inasmuch
          as man is saved, it is fitting that he who was created the original
          man should be saved. For it is too absurd to maintain, that he who was
          so deeply injured by the enemy, and was the first to suffer captivity,
          was not rescued by Him who conquered the enemy, but that his children
          were, -- those whom he had begotten in the same captivity. Neither
          would the enemy appear to be as yet conquered, if the old spoils
          remained with him. To give an illustration: If a hostile force had
          overcome certain [enemies], had bound them, and led them away captive,
          and held them for a long time in servitude, so that they begat
          children among them; and somebody, compassionating those who had been
          made slaves, should overcome this same hostile force; he certainly
          would not act equitably, were he to liberate the children of those who
          had been led captive, from the sway of those who had enslaved their
          fathers, but should leave these latter, who had suffered the act of
          capture, subject to their enemies, -- those, too, on whose very
          account he had proceeded to this retaliation, -- the children
          succeeding to liberty through the avenging of their fathers' cause,
          but not so that their fathers, who suffered the act of capture itself,
          should be left [in bondage]. For God is neither devoid of power nor of
          justice, who has afforded help to man, and restored him to His own
          liberty.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It was for this reason, too, that immediately after Adam had
          transgressed, as the Scripture relates, He pronounced no curse against
          Adam personally, but against the ground, in reference to his works, as
          a certain person among the ancients has observed: "God did indeed
          transfer the curse to the earth, that it might not remain in man." But
          man received, as the punishment of his transgression, the toilsome
          task of tilling the earth, and to eat bread in the sweat of his face,
          and to return to the dust from whence he was taken. Similarly also did
          the woman [receive] toil, and labour, and groans, and the pangs of
          parturition, and a state of subjection, that is, that she should serve
          her husband; so that they should neither perish altogether when cursed
          by God, nor, by remaining unreprimanded, should be led to despise God.
          But the curse in all its fulness fell upon the serpent, which had
          beguiled them. "And God," it is declared, "said to the serpent:
          Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and
          above all the beasts of the earth." And this same thing does the Lord
          also say in the Gospel, to those who are found upon the left hand:
          "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, which my Father
          hath prepared for the devil and his angels;" indicating that eternal
          fire was not originally prepared for man, but for him who beguiled
          man, and caused him to offend -- for him, I say, who is chief of the
          apostasy, and for those angels who became apostates along with him;
          which [fire], indeed, they too shall justly feel, who, like him,
          persevere in works of wickedness, without repentance, and without
          retracing their steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. [These act] as Cain [did, who], when he was counselled by God to
          keep quiet, because he had not made an equitable division of that
          share to which his brother was entitled, but with envy and malice
          thought that he could domineer over him, not only did not acquiesce,
          but even added sin to sin, indicating his state of mind by his action.
          For what he had planned, that did he also put in practice: he
          tyrannized over and slew him; God subjecting the just to the unjust,
          that the former might be proved as the just one by the things which he
          suffered, and the latter detected as the unjust by those which he
          perpetrated. And he was not softened even by this, nor did he stop
          short with that evil deed; but being asked where his brother was, he
          said, "I know not; am I my brother's keeper?" extending and
          aggravating [his] wickedness by his answer. For if it is wicked to
          slay a brother, much worse is it thus insolently and irreverently to
          reply to the omniscient God as if he could battle Him. And for this he
          did himself bear a curse about with him, because he gratuitously
          brought an offering of sin, having had no reverence for God, nor being
          put to confusion by the act of fratricide.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The case of Adam, however, had no analogy with this, but was
          altogether different. For, having been beguiled by another under the
          pretext of immortality, he is immediately seized with terror, and
          hides himself; not as if he were able to escape from God; but, in a
          state of confusion at having transgressed His command, he feels
          unworthy to appear before and to hold converse with God. Now, "the
          fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;" the sense of sin leads
          to repentance, and God bestows His compassion upon those who are
          penitent. For [Adam] showed his repentance by his conduct, through
          means of the girdle [which he used], covering himself with fig-leaves,
          while there were many other leaves, which would have irritated his
          body in a less degree. He, however, adopted a dress conformable to his
          disobedience, being awed by the fear of God; and resisting the erring,
          the lustful propensity of his flesh (since he had lost his natural
          disposition and child-like mind, and had come to the knowledge of evil
          things), he girded a bridle of continence upon himself and his wife,
          fearing God, and waiting for His coming, and indicating, as it were,
          some such thing [as follows]: Inasmuch as, he says, I have by
          disobedience lost that robe of sanctity which I had from the Spirit, I
          do now also acknowledge that I am deserving of a covering of this
          nature, which affords no gratification, but which gnaws and frets the
          body. And he would no doubt have retained this clothing for ever, thus
          humbling himself, if God, who is merciful, had not clothed them with
          tunics of skins instead of fig-leaves. For this purpose, too, He
          interrogates them, that the blame might light upon the woman; and
          again, He interrogates her, that she might convey the blame to the
          serpent. For she related what had occurred. "The serpent," says she,
          "beguiled me, and I did eat." But He put no question to the serpent;
          for He knew that he had been the prime mover in the guilty deed; but
          He pronounced the curse upon him in the first instance, that it might
          fall upon man with a mitigated rebuke. For God detested him who had
          led man astray, but by degrees, and little by little, He showed
          compassion to him who had been beguiled.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Wherefore also He drove him out of Paradise, and removed him far
          from the tree of life, not because He envied him the tree of life, as
          some venture to assert, but because He pitied him, [and did not
          desire] that he should continue a sinner for ever, nor that the sin
          which surrounded him should be immortal, and evil interminable and
          irremediable. But He set a bound to his [state of] sin, by interposing
          death, and thus causing sin to cease, putting an end to it by the
          dissolution of the flesh, which should take place in the earth, so
          that man, ceasing at length to live to sin, and dying to it, might
          begin to live to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. For this end did He put enmity between the serpent and the woman
          and her seed, they keeping it up mutually: He, the sole of whose foot
          should be bitten, having power also to tread upon the enemy's head;
          but the other biting, killing, and impeding the steps of man, until
          the seed did come appointed to tread down his head, -- which was born
          of Mary, of whom the prophet speaks: "Thou shalt tread upon the asp
          and the basilisk; thou shalt trample down the lion and the dragon;" --
          indicating that sin, which was set up and spread out against man, and
          which rendered him subject to death, should be deprived of its power,
          along with death, which rules [over men]; and that the lion, that is,
          antichrist, rampant against mankind in the latter days, should be
          trampled down by Him; and that He should bind "the dragon, that old
          serpent" and subject him to the power of man, who had been conquered
          so that all his might should be trodden down. Now Adam had been
          conquered, all life having been taken away from him: wherefore, when
          the foe was conquered in his turn, Adam received new life; and the
          last enemy, death, is destroyed, which at the first had taken
          possession of man. Therefore, when man has been liberated, "what is
          written shall come to pass, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death,
          where is thy sting?" This could not be said with justice, if that man,
          over whom death did first obtain dominion, were not set free. For his
          salvation is death's destruction. When therefore the Lord vivifies
          man, that is, Adam, death is at the same time destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. All therefore speak falsely who disallow his (Adam's) salvation,
          shutting themselves out from life for ever, in that they do not
          believe that the sheep which had perished has been found. For if it
          has not been found, the whole human race is still held in a state of
          perdition. False, therefore, is that, man who first started this idea,
          or rather, this ignorance and blindness -- Tatian. As I have already
          indicated, this man entangled himself with all the heretics. This
          dogma, however, has been invented by himself, in order that, by
          introducing something new, independently of the rest, and by speaking
          vanity, he might acquire for himself hearers void of faith, affecting
          to be esteemed a teacher, and endeavouring from time to time to employ
          sayings of this kind often [made use of] by Paul: "In Adam we all
          die;" ignorant, however, that "where sin abounded, grace did much more
          abound." Since this, then, has been clearly shown, let all his
          disciples be put to shame, and let them wrangle about Adam, as if some
          great gain were to accrue to them if he be not saved; when they profit
          nothing more [by that], even as the serpent also did not profit when
          persuading man [to sin], except to this effect, that he proved him a
          transgressor, obtaining man as the first-fruits of his own apostasy.
          But he did not know God's power. Thus also do those who disallow
          Adam's salvation gain nothing, except this, that they render
          themselves heretics and apostates from the truth, and show themselves
          patrons of the serpent and of death.<br />
