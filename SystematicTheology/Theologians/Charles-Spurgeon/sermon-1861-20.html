        <p>A Sermon</p>

        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>

          "But he is in one minds, and who can turn him? and what his soul
          desireth, even that he doeth. -- Job 23:13.

        <p>
          IT is very advantageous to the Christian mind frequently to consider
          the deep and unsearchable attributes of God. The beneficial effect is
          palpable in two ways, exerting a sacred influence both on the judgment
          and the heart. In respect to the one, it tends to confirm us in those
          good old orthodox doctrines which lie at the basis of our faith. If we
          study man, and make him the only object of our research, there will be
          a strong tendency in our minds to exaggerate his importance. We shall
          think too much of the creature and too little of the Creator,
          preferring that knowledge which is to be found out by observation and
          reason to that divine truth which revelation alone could make known to
          us. The basis and groundwork of Arminian theology lies in attaching
          undue importance to man, and giving God rather the second place than
          the first. Let your mind dwell for a long time upon man as a free
          agent, upon man as a responsible being, upon man, not so much as being
          under God's claims as having claims upon God, and you will soon find
          upspringing in your thoughts a set of crude doctrines, to support
          which the letter of some few isolated texts in Scripture may be
          speciously quoted, but which really in spirit are contrary to the
          whole tenour of the Word of God. Thus your orthodoxy will be shaken to
          its very foundations, and your soul will be driven out to sea again
          without peace or joy. Brethren, I am not afraid that any man, who
          thinks worthily about the Creator, stands in awe of his adorable
          perfections and sees him sitting upon the throne, doing all things
          according to the counsel of his will, will go far wrong in his
          doctrinal sentiments. He may say, "My heart is fixed, O God;" and when
          the heart is fixed with a firm conviction of the greatness, the
          omnipotence, the divinity indeed of him whom we call God, the head
          will not wander far from truth. Another happy result of such
          meditation is the steady peace, the grateful calm it gives to the
          soul. Have you been a long time at sea, and has the continual motion
          of the ship sickened and disturbed you? Have you come to look upon
          everything as moving till you scarcely put one foot before the other
          without the fear of falling down because the floor rocks beneath your
          tread? With what delight do you put your feet at last upon the shore
          and say, "Ah! this does not move; this is solid ground. What though
          the tempest howl, this island is safely moored. She will not start
          from her bearings; when I tread on her she will not yield beneath my
          feet." Just so is it with us when we turn from the ever-shifting,
          often boisterous tide of earthly things to take refuge in the Eternal
          God who hath been "our dwelling-place in all generations." The
          fleeting things of human life, and the fickle thoughts and showy deeds
          of men, are as moveable and changeable as the waters of the
          treacherous deep; but when we mount up, as it were, with eagles' wings
          to him that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, before whom all its
          inhabitants are as grasshoppers, we nestle in the Rock of ages, which
          from its eternal socket never starts, and in its fixed immoveability
          never can be disturbed. Or to use another simile. You have seen little
          children running round, and round, and round till they get giddy, and
          they stand still and hold fast a moment and everything seems to he
          flying round about them, but by holding fast and still, and getting
          into the mind the fact that that to which they hold at least is firm,
          at last the braise grows still again, and the world ceases to whirl.
          So you and I have been these six days like little children running
          round in circles, and everything has been moving with us, till perhaps
          as we came, to this place this morning we felt as if the very promises
          of God had moved, as if Providence had shifted, our friends had dial,
          our kindred passed away, and we came to look on everything as a
          floating mass -- nothing firm, nothing fixed. Brethren, let us get a
          good grip to-day of the immutability of God. Let us stand still
          awhile, and know that the Lord is God. We shall see at length that
          things do not move as we dreamed they did: "to every thing there is a
          season, and a time to every purpose under the heavens." There is still
          a fixedness in that which seems most fickle. That which appears to be
          most dreamy has a reality, inasmuch as it is a part of that divinely
          substantial scheme which God is working out, the end whereof shall be
          his eternal glory. Twill cool your brain, twill calm your heart, my
          brother, twill make you go back to the world's fight quiet and
          composed, twill make you stand fast in the day of temptation if now
          through divine grace you can come near to God and offer him the
          tribute of our devotion, who is without variableness or shadow of a
          turning.
        </p>

          The text will be considered by us this morning -- first, as
          enunciating a great general truth; and, secondly, out of that general
          truth, we shall fetch another upon which we shall enlarge, I trust, to
          our comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The text may be regarded as TEACHING A GENERAL TRUTH. We will take
          the first clause of the sentence, "He is in one mind." Now, the fact
          taught here is, that in all the acts of God in Providence, he has a
          fixed and a settled purpose. "He is in one mind." It is eminently
          consolatory to us who are God's creatures, to know that he did not
          make us without a purpose, and that now, in all his dealings with us
          he has the same wise and gracious end to be served. We suffer, the
          head aches, the heart leaps with palpitations, the blood creeps
          sluggishly along where its healthy flow should have been more rapid.
          We lose our limbs, crushed by accident, some sense fails us; the eye
          is eclipsed in perpetual night; our mind is racked and disturbed; our
          fortunes vary; our goods disappear before our eyes; our children,
          portions of ourselves, sicken and die. Our crosses are as continual as
          our lives, we are seldom long at ease; we are born to sorrow, and
          certainly it is an inheritance of which we are never deprived; we
          suffer continually. Will it not reconcile us to our sorrows, that they
          serve some end? To be scourged needlessly we consider to be a
          disgrace, but to be scourged if our country were to be served we
          should consider an honor, because there is a purpose in it. To suffer
          the maiming of our bodies, because of some whim of a tyrant, would be
          a thing hard to bear, but if we administer thereby to the weal of our
          families, or to the glory of our God, we would be content not to he
          mutilated once but to be cut piece-meal away, that so his great
          purpose might be answered. O believer, ever look, then, on all thy
          sufferings as being parts of the divine plan, and say, as wave upon
          wave rolls over thee, "He is in one mind!" He is carrying out still
          his one great purpose; none of these cometh by chance, none of these
          happeneth to me out of order, but everything cometh to me according to
          the purpose of his own will, and answereth the purpose of his own
          great mind. We have to labor too. How hard do some men labor who have
          to toil for their daily bread! Their bread is saturated with their
          sweat; they wear no garment which they have not woven out of their own
          nerves and muscles. How sternly, too, do others labor, who have with
          their brain to serve their fellow-men or their God! How have some
          heroic missionaries spent themselves, and been spent in their fond
          enterprise! How have many ministers of Christ exhausted not simply the
          body, but the mind! Their hilarity so natural to them has given place
          to despondency, and the natural effervescence of their spirits has at
          last died out into oneness of soul, through the desperateness of their
          ardor. Well, and sometimes this labor for God is unrequited. We
          plough, but the furrow yields no harvest. We sow, but the field
          refuses the grain, and the devouring belies of the hungry birds alone
          are satisfied therewith. We build, but the storm casts down the stones
          which we had quarried with Herculean efforts piling one on another. We
          sweat, we toil, we moil, we fail. How often do we come back weeping
          because we have toiled, as we think, without success! Yet, Christian
          man, thou hast not been without sucess, for "He is still in one mind."
          All this was necessary to the fulfillment of his one purpose. Thou art
          not lost; thy labor has not rotted under the clods. All, though thou
          seest it not, has been working together towards the desired end. Stand
          upon the sea-beach for a moment. A wave has just come up careening in
          its pride. Its crown of froth is spent. As it leaps beyond its fellow,
          it dies, it dies. And now another, and it dies, and now another, and
          it dies. Oh! weep not, deep sea, be not thou sorrowful, for though
          each wave dieth, yet thou prevailest! O thou mighty ocean! onward does
          the flood advance, till it has covered all the sand and washed the
          feet of the white cliffs. So its it with God's purpose. You and I are
          only waves of his great sea; we wash up, we seem to retire, as if
          there had been no advance; anther wave comes still each wave must
          retire as though there had been no progress; but the great divine sea
          of his purpose is still moving on. He is still of one mind and
          carrying out his plan. How sorrowful it often seems to think how good
          men die! They learn through the days of their youth, and often before
          they come to years to use their learning, they are gone. The blade is
          made and annealed in many a fire, but ere the foeman useth it, it
          snaps! How many laborers, too, in the Master's vineyard, who when by
          their experience they were getting more useful than ever, have been
          taken away just when the Church wanteth them most! He that stood
          upright in the chariot, guiding the steeds, suddenly falls back, and
          we cry, "My father, my father, the horsemen of Israel and the chariot
          thereof!" Still notwithstanding all, we may console ourselves in the
          midst of our grief with the blessed reflection that everything is a
          part of God's plan. He is still of one mind: nothing happeneth which
          is not a part of the divine scheme. To enlarge our thoughts a
          monument, have you never noticed, in reading history, how nationals
          suddenly decay? When their civilization has advanced so far that we
          thought it would produce men of the highest mould, suddenly old age
          begins to wrinkle its brow, its arm grows weak, the scepter falls, and
          the crown droops from the head, and we have said, "Is not the world
          gone back again?" The barbarian fall has sacked the city, and where
          once everything was beauty, now there is nothing but ruthless
          bloodshed and destruction. Ah! but, my brethren, all those things were
          but the carrying out of the divine plan. Just so you may have seen
          sometimes upon the hard rock the lichen spring. Soon as the lichen
          race grows grand, it dies. But wherefore? It is because its death
          prepares the moss, and the moss which is feebler compared with the
          lichen growth, at last increases till you see before you the finest
          specimens of that genus. But the moss decays. Yet weep not for its
          decaying, its ashes shall prepare a soil for some plants of a little
          higher growth, and as these decay, one after another, race after race,
          they at last prepare the soil upon which even the goodly cedar itself
          might stretch out its roots. So has it been with the race of men --
          Egypt, and Assyria, Babylon, Greece, and Rome, have crumbled, each and
          all, when their hour had come, to be succeeded by a better. And if
          this race of ours should ever be eclipsed, if the Anglo Saxons'
          boasted pride should yet be stained, even then it will prove to be a
          link in the divine purpose. Still, in the end his one mind shall be
          carried out, his one great result shall be thereby achieved. Not only
          the decay of nations, but the apparent degeneration of some races of
          men, and even the total extinction of others, forms a part of the like
          fixed purpose. In all those cases there may be reasons of sorrow, but
          faith sees grounds of rejoicing. To gather up all in one, the
          calamities of earthquake, the devastations of storm, the extirpations
          of war, and all the terrible catastrophes of plague, have only been
          co-workers with God -- slaves compelled to tug the galley of the
          divine purpose across the sea of time. From every evil good has come,
          and the more the evil has accumulated the more hath God glorified
          himself in bringing out at last his grand, his everlasting design.
          This, I take it, is the first general lesson of the text -- in every
          event of Providence, God has a purpose. "He is in one mind." Mark, not
          only a purpose, but only one purpose, for all history is but one.
          There are many scenes, but it is one drama; there are many pages, but
          it is one book; there are many leaves, but it is one tree, there are
          many provinces, yea, and there be lords many and rulers many, yet is
          there but one empire, and God the only Potentate. "O come let us
          worship and bow down before him: for the Lord is a great God, and a
          great King above all gods!"
        </p>
        <p>
          2. "Who can turn him?" This is the second clause of the sentence, and
          here I think we are taught the doctrine that the purpose of God is
          unchanged. The first sentence shows that he has a purpose, the second
          shows that it is incapable of change. "Who can turn him?" There are
          some shallow thinkers who dream that the great plan and design of God
          was thrown out of order by the fall of man. The fall they consider all
          accidental circumstances, not intended in the divine plan, and so, God
          being placed in a delicate predicament of requiring to sacrifice his
          justice or his mercy, used the plan of the atonement of Christ as a
          divine expedient Brethren, it may be lawful to use such terms, it may
          be lawful to you, it would not be to me, for well am I persuaded that
          the very fall of man was a part of the divine purpose -- that even the
          sin of Adam, though he did it freely, was nevertheless contemplated in
          the divine scheme, and was by no means such a thing as to involve a
          digression from his primary plan. Then came the delude, and the race
          of man was swept away, but God's purpose was not affected by the
          destruction of the race. In after years his people Israel forsook him
          and worshipped Baal and Ashtoreth, but his purpose, was not changed
          any more by the defection of his chosen nation than by the destruction
          of his creatures. And when in after years the gospel was sent to the
          Jews and they resisted it, and Paul and Peter turned to the Gentiles,
          do not suppose that God had to take down his book and make an erasure
          or an amendment. No, the whole was written there from the beginning,
          he knew everything of it, he has never altered a single sentence nor
          changed a single line of the divine purpose. What he intended the
          great picture to be, that it shall be at the end, and where you see
          some black strokes which seem not in keeping, these shall yet be toned
          down; and where there are some brighter dashes, too bright for the
          sombre picture, these shall yet be brought into harmony; and when in
          the end God shall exhibit the whole, he shall elicit both from men and
          angels tremendous shouts of praise, while they say, "Great and
          marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy
          ways, thou King of Saints! Thou only art holy. All nations shall come
          and worship before Thee, for thy judgments are made manifest." Where
          we have thought his government wrong, there shall it prove most right,
          and where we dreamed he had forgotten to be good, there shall his
          goodness be most clear. It is a sweet consolation to the mind of one
          who muses much upon these deep matters, that God never has changed in
          any degree from his purpose; and the result will be, notwithstanding
          everything to the contrary, just precisely in every jot and tittle
          what he foreknow and fore-ordained it should be. Now then, wars, ye
          may rise, and other Alexanders and Caesars may spring up, but he will
          not change. Now, nations and peoples, lift up yourselves and let your
          parliaments pass your decrees but he changeth not. Now, rebels, foam
          at the mouth and let your fury boil, but he changeth not for you. Oh!
          nations, and peoples, and tongues, and thou round earth, thou speedest
          on thy orbit still, and all the fury of thine inhabitants cannot make
          thee move from thy predestinated pathway. Creation is an arrow from
          the bow of God and that arrow goes on, straight on, without deviation,
          to the center of that target which God ordained that it should strike.
          Never varied is his plan; he is without variableness or shadow of a
          turning. Albert Barnes very justly says, "It is, when properly
          understood, a matter of unspeakable consolation that God has a plan --
          for who could honor a God who had no plan, but who did everything by
          haphazard? It is matter of rejoicing that he has one great purpose
          which extends through all ages, and embraces all things; for then
          everything falls into its proper place, and has its appropriate
          bearing on other events. It is a matter of joy that God does execute
          all his purposes for as they were all good and wise, it is desirable
          that they should be executed. It could be a calamity if a good plan
          were not executed. Why, then, should men murmur at the purposes or the
          decrees of God?"
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The text also teaches a third general truth. While God had a
          purpose, and that purpose has never changed, the third clause teaches
          us that this purpose is sure to be effected. "What his soul desireth,
          that he doeth." He made the world out of nothing, there was no
          resistance there. "Light be," said he, and light was, there was no
          resistance there. "Providence be," said he, and Providence shall be,
          and when you shall come to see the end as well as the beginning, you
          shall find that there was no resistance there. It is a wonderful thing
          how God effects his purpose while still the creature is free. They who
          think that predestination and the fulfillment of the divine purpose is
          contrary to the free-agency of man, know not what they say, nor
          whereof they affirm. It were no miracle for God to effect his own
          purpose, if he were dealing with stocks and stones, with granite and
          with trees but this is the miracle of miracles, that the creatures are
          free, absolutely free, and joy the divine purpose stands! Herein is
          wisdom! This is a deep unsearchable. Man walks without a fetter, yet
          treads in the very steps which God ordained him to tread in, as
          certainly as though manacles had bound him to the spot. Man chooses
          his own seat, selects his own position, guided by his will he chooses
          sin, or guided by diving grace he chooses the right, and yet in his
          choice sits as sovereign, on the throne: not disturbing, but still
          over-ruling, and proving himself to be able to deal as with free
          creatures as with creatures without freedom, as wall able to effect
          his purpose when he has endowed men with thought, and reason, and
          judgment, as when he had only to deal with the solid rocks and with
          the imbedded sea. O Christians! you shall never be able to fathom
          this, but you may wonder at it. I know there is an easy way of getting
          out of this great deep, either by denying predestination altogether or
          by denying free-agency altogether, but if you can hold the two, if you
          can say, "Yes, my consciousness teaches me that man does as he wills,
          but my faith teaches me that God does as he wills, and these two are
          not contrary the one to the other; and yet I cannot tell how it is, I
          cannot tell how God effects his end, I can only wonder and admire, and
          say, "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of
          God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding
          out." Every creature free and doing as it wills yet God more free
          still and doing as he wills, not only in heaven but among the
          inhabitants of this lower earth. I have thus given you a general
          subject upon which I would invite you to spend your meditations in
          your quiet hours, for I am persuaded that sometimes to think of these
          deep doctrines will be found very profitable it will be to you like
          the advice of Christ to Simon Peter: -- "Launch out into the deep and
          let down your nets for a draught." You shall have a draught of
          exceeding great thoughts and exceeding great graces if you dare to
          launch out into this exceeding deep sea, and let out the nets of your
          contemplation at the command of Christ. "Behold God is great." "O
          Lord! how great are thy works, and thy thoughts are very deep! A
          brutish man knoweth not, neither doth a fool understand this."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I now come to the second part of my subject, which will be, I
          trust, cheering to the people of God. From the general doctrine that
          God has a plan, that this plan is invariable, and that this plan is
          certain to be carried out, I drew the most precious doctrine that IN
          SALVATION GOD IS OF ONE MIND, -- and who can turn him? -- and what his
          heart desireth, that he doeth. Now, mark, I address myself at this
          hour only to you who as the people of God. Dost thou believe in the
          Lord Jesus Christ with all thine heal? Is the spirit of adoption given
          to thee whereby thou canst say, "Abba, Father?" If so draw nigh, for
          this truth is for thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come then, my brethren, in the first place let us consider that God is
          of one mind. Of old, my soul, he determined to save thee. Thy calling
          proves thine election, and thine election teaches thee that God
          ordained to save thee. He is not a man that he should lie, nor the Son
          of Man that he should repent. He is of one mind. He saw thee ruined in
          the fall of thy father Adam, but his mind never changed from his
          purpose to save thee. He saw thee in thy nativity. Thou well test
          astray from the woman speaking lies, thy youthful follies and
          disobedience he saw, but never did that gracious mind alter in its
          designs of love to thee. Then in thy manhood thou didst plunge into
          vice and sin. Cover, O darkness, all on guilt, and let the night
          conceal it from our eyes for ever! Though he added sin to sin, and our
          pride waxed exceeding high and hot, yet he has of one mind.
        </p>
        <p>"Determined to save, he watched o'er my path</p>
        <p>When Satan's blind slave, I spotted with death."</p>
        <p>
          At last, when the happy hour arrived, he came to our door and knocked,
          and he said, "Open to me." And do you remember, O my brothel, how we
          said, "Get thee gone, O Jesu, we want thee not?" We scorned his grace,
          defied his love, but he was of one mind, and no hardness of heart
          could turn him. He had determined to have us for his spouse, and he
          would not take "No" for an answer. He said he would have us, and he
          persevered. He knocked again, and do you remember how we half opened
          the door? But then some strong temptation came and we shut it in his
          very face, and he said, "Open to me, my dove, my head is wet with the
          dew, and my locks with the drops of the night" -- yet we bolted and
          barred the door, and would not let him in. But he was of one mind and
          none could turn him. Oh! my soul weeps now when I think of the many
          convictions that I stifled, of the many movings of his Spirit that I
          rejected, and those many times when conscience bade me repent, and
          urged me to flee to him, but I would not; of those seasons when a
          mother's tears united with all the intercession of the Saviour, yet
          the heart harder than adamant, and less eat to be melted than the
          granite itself, refused to move and would not yield. But he was of one
          mind. He had no fickleness in him. He said he would have us, and have
          us he would. He had written our names in his book, and he would not
          cross them out. It was his solemn purpose that yield we should. And O
          that hour when we yielded at the last! Then did he prove that in all
          our wanderings he had been of one mind. And O since then, how
          sorrowful the reflection! Since then, how often have you and I turned!
          We have backslidden, and if we had the Arminian's God to deal with, we
          should either have been in hell, or out of the covenant at this hour.
          I know I should be in the covenant and out of the covenant a hundred
          times a day if I had a God who put me out every time I sinned and then
          restored it when I repented. But no, despite our sin, our unbelief,
          our backslidings, our forgetfulness of him, he was of one mind. And
          brethren, I know this, that though we shall wander still, though in
          dark hours you and I may slip, and often fall, yet his lovingkindness
          changes not. Thy strong arm, O God shall bear us on; thy loving heart
          will never fail; thou wilt not turn thy love away from us, or make it
          cease or pour upon us thy fierce anger, but having begun, thou wilt
          complete the triumphs of thy grace. Nothing shall make thee change thy
          mind. What joy is this to you, believers? for your mind changes every
          day, your experience varies like the wind, and if salvation were to be
          the result of any purpose on your part, certainly it never would be
          effected. But since it is God's work to save, and we have proved
          hitherto that he is of one mind, our faith shall revel in the thought
          that he will be of one thought even to the end, till all on glory's
          summit we shall sing of that fixed purpose and that immutable love
          which never turned aside until the deed of grace was triumphantly
          achieved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, believer, listen to the second lesson: "Who can turn him?" While
          he is immutable from within, he is immovable from without. "Who can
          turn him?" That is a splendid picture presented to us by Moses in the
          Book of Numbers. The children of Israel were encamped in the plains of
          Moab. As the trees of lign aloes which the Lord had planted, and as
          cedar trees beside the waters, were their tents. Quietly and calmly
          they were resting in the valley -- the tabernacle of the Lord in their
          midst, and the pillar of cloud spread over them as a shield. But on
          the mountain range there were two men -- Balak, the son of Zippor,
          king of the Moabites, and Balaam the prophet of Pethor. They had
          builded seven altars and offered seven bullocks, and Balak said unto
          Balsam, "Come, curse me Jacob, come, defy Israel." Four times did the
          prophet take up his parable. Four times did he use his enchantments,
          offering the sacrifices of God on the altars of Baal. Four times did
          he vainly attempt a false divination. But I would have you mark that
          in each succeeding vision the mind God is brought out in deeper
          characters. First, he confesses his own impotence, "How shall I curse,
          whom God hath not cursed, how shall I defy, whom the Lord hath not
          defied?" Then the second oracle brings out more distinctly the divine
          blessing. "Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath
          blessed, and I cannot reverse it." A third audacious attempt is not
          with a heavier repulse, for the stifled curse recoils on themselves --
          "Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth
          thee." Once again in the vision that closes the picture, the eyes of
          Balaam are opened till he gets a glimpse of the Star that should come
          out of Jacob, and the Scepter that shall rise out of Israel, with the
          dawning glory of the latter days. Well might Balaam say, "There is no
          enchantment against Jacob, no divination against Israel. And now
          transfer that picture in your mind to all your enemies, and specially
          to that arch-fiend of hell. He comes before God to-day with the
          remembrance of your sins, and he desires that he may curse Israel, but
          he has found a hundred times that there is no enchantment against
          Jacob nor divination against Israel He took David into the sin of
          lust, and he found that God would not curse him there, but bless him
          with a sorrowful chastisement and with a deep repentance He took Peter
          into the sin of denying his Master, and he denied him with oaths and
          curses. But the Lord would not curse him even there, but turned and
          looked on Peter, not with a lightning glance that might have shivered
          him, but with a look of love that made him weep bitterly. He had taken
          you and me at divers times into positions of unbelief, and we have
          doubted God. Satan said -- "Surely, surely God will curse him there,"
          but never once has he done it. He has smitten, but the blow was full
          of love. He has chastised, but the chastisement was fraught with
          mercy. He has not cursed us, nor will he. Thou canst not turn God's
          mind, then, fiend of hell, thine enchantments cannot prosper, thine
          accusations shall not prevail. "He is in one mind, who can turn him?
          "And brethren, you know when men are turned, they are sometimes turned
          by advice. Now who can advise with God. Who shall counsel the Most
          High to cast off the darlings of his bosom, or persuade the Saviour to
          reject his spouse? Such counsel offered were blasphemy, and it would
          be not pugnant to his soul. Or else men are turned by entreaties. But
          how shall God listen to the entreaties of the evil one? Are not the
          prayers of the wicked an abomination to the? Lord? Let them pray
          against us, let them entreat the Lord to curse us. But he is of one
          mind and no revengeful prayer should change the purpose of his love.
          Sometimes as men are changed by the ties of relationship: a another
          interposes and lose yields, but in our case, who can interpose? God's
          only begotten Son is as much concerned in our salvation as his Father,
          and instead of interposing to change, he would -- if such a thing were
          needed -- still continue to plead that the love and mercy of God might
          never be withdrawn. Oh, let us rejoice in this, --
        </p>
        <p>"Midst all our sin, and care, and woe,</p>
        <p>His Spirit will not let us go."</p>
        <p>
          The Lord will not forsake his people for his great name's sake;
          because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people. "He is in one
          mind, and who can turn him?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I know not how it is, but I feel that I cannot preach from this text
          as I should like. But oh! the text itself is music to my ears. It
          seems to sound like the martial trumpet of the battle, and my soul is
          ready for the fray. It seems now that if trials and troubles should
          come, if I could but hold my hand upon this precious text, I would
          laugh at them all. "Who can turn him?" -- I would shout -- "Who can
          turn him?" Come on, earth and hell, come on, for "who can turn him?"
          Come on, ye boisterous troubles, come on, ye innumerable temptations,
          come on, slanderer and liar, "who can turn him?" And since he cannot
          be changed, my soul must and will rejoice "with joy unspeakable and
          full of glory." I wish I could throw the text like a bombshell into
          the midst of the army of doubters, that that army might be routed at
          once, for when we get a text like this, it must be the text which
          takes effect, and not our explanation. This surely is a most
          marvellous death-blow to our doubts and fears.
        </p>
        <p>"He is in one mind, and who can turn him?"</p>
        <p>
          And now with a few words upon the last sentence I shall conclude: --
          God's purpose must be effected -- "What his soul desireth, that he
          doeth." Beloved, what God's soul desireth is your salvation and mine,
          if we be his chosen. Well, that he doeth. Part of that salvation
          consists in our perfect sanctification. We have had a long struggle
          with inbred sin, and as far as we can judge, we have not made much
          progress, for still is the Philistine in the land, and still doth the
          Canaanite invade us. We sin still, and our hearts still have in sheen
          unbelief and proneness to depart from the living God. Can you think it
          possible that you will ever be without any tendency to sin? Does it
          not seem a dream that you should ever be without fault before the
          throne of God -- without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing? But yet
          you shall be; his heart desireth it, and that he doeth. He would have
          his spouse without any defilement he would have his chosen generation
          without anything to mar their perfection. Now, inasmuch as he spake
          and it was done, he has but to speak and it shall be done with you.
          You cannot rout your foes but he can. You cannot overcome your
          besetting sins, but he can do it. You cannot drive out your
          corruptions, for they have chariots of iron, but he will drive out the
          last of them, till the whole land shall be without one enemy to
          disturb its perpetual peace. O what a joy to know that it will be ere
          long! Oh! it will be so soon with some of us -- such a few weeks,
          though we perhaps are reckoning on years of life! A few weeks, or a
          few days, and we shall have passed through Jordan's flood and stand
          complete in him, accepted in the Beloved! And should it be many years
          -- should we be spared till the snows of a century shall have fallen
          upon our frosted hair -- yet even then we must not doubt that his
          purpose shall at last be fulfilled. We shall be spotless and faultless
          and unblameable in his sight ere long.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another part of our salvation is, that we should at last be without
          pain, without sorrow, gathered with the Church of the first-born
          before the Father's face. Does it not seem, when you sit down to think
          of yourself as being in heaven, as a pretty dream that never will be
          true? What! shall these fingers one day smite the strings of a golden
          harp? O aching head! shalt thou one day wear a crown of glory that
          fadeth not away? O toil-worn body! shalt thou bathe thyself in seas of
          heavenly rest? Is not heaven too good for us, brothers and sisters?
          Can it be that we, poor we, shall ever get inside those pearly gates,
          or tread the golden streets? Oh shall we ever see his face? Will he
          ever kiss us with the kisses of his lips? Will the King immortal,
          invisible, the only wise God, our Saviour, take us to his bosom, and
          call us all his own? Oh! shall we ever drink out of the rivers of
          pleasure that are at the right hand of the Most High? Shall we be
          among that happy company who shall be led to the living fountains of
          waters and kill tears be wiped away from our eyes? Ah! that we shall
          be! for "he is in one mind and who can turn him? and what his soul
          desireth, that he doeth." "Father, I will that they whom thou hath
          given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory." That
          is an immortal omnipotent desire. We shall be with him where be is;
          his purpose shall be effected, and we shall partake of his bliss. Now
          rise, ye who love the Saviour, and put your trust in him -- rise like
          men who have God within you, and sit no longer down upon your
          dunghills. Come, ye desponding ones; if salvation were to be your own
          work, ye might despair, but since it is his, and he changes not, you
          must not even doubt.
        </p>
        <p>"Now let the feeble all be strong,</p>
        <p>And make Jehovah's power their song;</p>
        <p>His shield is spread o'er every saint.</p>
        <p>And thus supported, who can faint?"</p>
        <p>
          If you perish -- even the weakest of you -- God's purpose cannot be
          effected. If you fall, his honor will be stained. If you perish,
          heaven itself will be dishonored; Christ will have lost one of his
          members; the Divine Husband will be disappointed in part of his
          well-beloved spouse; he will be a king whose regalia has been stolen;
          nay, he will not be complete himself, for the Church is his fullness,
          and how can he be full if a part of his fullness shall be cast away?
          Putting these things together, let us take courage, and in the name of
          God let us set up our banners. He that has been with us hitherto will
          preserve us to the end, and we shall soon sing in the fruition of
          glory as we now recite in the confidence of faith, that his purpose is
          completed, and his love immutable.
        </p>
        <p>
          This I say by way of close such a subject ought to inspire every man
          with awe. I speak to some here who are unconverted. It is an awful
          thought; God's purpose will be subserved in you. You may hate him, but
          as he get him honor upon Pharaoh and all his hosts, so will he upon
          you. You may think that you will spoil his designs: that shall be your
          idea, but your very acts, though guided with that intent, shall only
          tend to sum serve his glory. Think of that! To rebel against God is
          useless, for you cannot prevail. To resist him is not only
          impertinence but folly. He will be as much glorified by you, whichever
          way you go. You shall either yield him willing honor or unwilling
          honor, but either way his purpose in you shall most certainly be
          subserved. O that this thought might make you bow your heads and say,
          "Great God, glorify thy mercy in me, for I have revolted; show that
          thou canst forgive. I have sinned, deeply sinned. Prove the depths of
          thy mercy by pardoning me. I know that Jesus died, and that he is set
          forth as a propitiator; I believe on him as such. O God! I trust him:
          I pray thee, glorify thyself in me by showing what thy grace can do in
          casting sin behind thy back, and blotting out iniquity, transgression,
          and sin." Sinner, he will do it, he will do it, if thus you plead and
          thus you pray, he will do it, for there was never a sinner rejected
          yet, that came to God with humble prayer and faith. Going to God
          to-day, confessing your sin, and taking hold of Christ, as upon the
          horns of the altar of mercy, and of sacrifice, you shall find that it
          was a part of the divine plan to bring you here to-day, to strike your
          mind with awe, to lead you humbly to the cross, to lead you afterwards
          joyfully to your God, and to bring you perfect at last before his
          throne.
        </p>
        <p>God add his blessing for Christ's sake! Amen.<br /></p>
