        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.32)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, July 1, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          |And the apostle said unto the Lord, increase our faith.| -- Luke
          17:5.
        </p>
        <p>
          VERILY IF THE APOSTLE said this, one and all of us had need take up
          the prayer. If the twelve mightiest in the army of the Lord of hosts
          had need of such a supplication, what shall we say who are but the
          interior soldiers -- the feeblest saints? If ye hope to win the day,
          does it not well become us to pray, |Increase our faith?|
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a matter of dispute as to the occasion when these words were
          uttered. Some think that we must look at the connection of the chapter
          for the explanation. Jesus Christ had been teaching his disciples that
          if their brother should trespass against them seven times a day, and
          seven times a day turned again to them, saying, I repent, they were to
          forgive him, and that constrained the apostle to say |increase our
          faith.| They conceived it to be so hard a duty incessantly to pardon
          and constantly to forgive, that they felt unable to accomplish it
          without a large increase of faith. Others think -- very possibly with
          greater truth -- that the prayer was offered when the apostles
          endeavored to cast out the evil spirits from the poor demoniac and
          failed in the attempt. |And they said to Jesus, why could not we cast
          him out? And he said, verily, if ye had faith as a grain of mustard
          seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, be thou plucked up by the
          root, and be thou planted in the sea, and it should obey you.| Then
          they said to the Lord, |Increase our faith.| However, whatever was the
          occasion in this particular instance we shall always find good enough
          occasion for presenting the prayer: and I know not but this morning
          may be a season when each of us may have special necessity to put it
          up to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Increase our faith.| Proceeding at once to the subject, the first
          thing we shall consider is the object of their solicitude. It was
          their |faith.| Secondly, the desire of their hearts -- |Increase our
          faith.| And then, thirdly the person on whom they trusted to
          strengthen their faith -- |They said to the Lord, increase our faith.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, THE OBJECT OF THEIR SOLICITUDE WAS THEIR FAITH. Faith
          is of the utmost importance to a Christian. There is nothing of which
          we should have a greater and a more earnest concern than our faith. I
          shall endeavor to show you this from seven or eight reasons, and may
          God press them to your hearts and send them so home, that every one of
          us may become deeply anxious as to whether we have a real vital faith
          which unites us to the Lamb and brings salvation to our souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. We ought; my friends, to be extremely careful of our faith -- both
          of its rightness and of its strength, First of all: when we consider
          the position which faith occupies in salvation. Faith is the
          salvation-grace. We are not saved by love; but we are saved by grace,
          and we are saved by faith. We are not saved by courage, we are not
          saved by patience; but we are saved by faith. That is to say, God
          gives his salvation to faith and not to any other virtue. It is
          nowhere written -- he that loveth shall be saved. It is nowhere
          recorded -- that a patient sinner shall be saved. But it is said, |He
          that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.| Faith is the vital
          part of salvation. If a man lacks faith he lacks everything. |Without
          faith it is impossible to please God.| If a man has true faith --
          however little he has of any other virtue -- that man is secure. But
          supposing it possible for a man to possess every virtue in the world,
          let him be as much a Christian in his exterior; the apostle Paul
          himself; let him be as earnest as a seraph; let him be as diligent in
          the service of his Master as you could conceive even an angel on high
          to be, still |Without faith| -- so God's Word declares -- |it is
          impossible to please God.| Faith is the saving grace -- it is the
          connecting-link between the soul and Christ. Take that away and all is
          gone. Remove faith, you have sawn through the ship's keel, and she
          must sink. Take away faith, you have taken away my shield and I must
          be slain. Remove faith, and Christian life becomes a nonentity: it is
          extinct at once, for |the just shall live by faith:| and without faith
          how could they live at all? Consider then, that since faith is so
          important in salvation, it becomes each of us more earnestly to
          inquire whether we have faith or not? O, my brethren, there are a
          thousand shams in the world -- a thousand imitations of faith; but
          there is only one true vital saving faith. There are scores of
          notional faiths -- a faith which consists in holding a sound creed, a
          faith which bids men believe a lie, by wrapping them up with
          assurances of their safety, when they are still in the gall of
          bitterness and the bonds of iniquity, a faith which consists in
          presumptuously trusting to ourselves. There are scores of false
          faiths; but there is only one true one. Oh! as ye wish to be saved at
          last; as ye would not be self-deceived and go marching to damnation
          with your eyes shut, take your faith in your hand this morning and see
          whether it is genuine sterling coin. We ought to be more careful of
          our faith than of anything else. True, we ought to examine our
          conduct, we ought to search our works, we ought to try our love, but,
          above all, our faith: for if faith be wrong all is wrong; if faith be
          right, we may take that as the touchstone of our sincerity. |He that
          believeth on the Son of God hath eternal life abiding in him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Secondly: -- Be anxious about your faith, for all your graces hang
          upon it. Faith is the root-grace: all other virtues and graces spring
          from it, Tell me of love; how can I love him in whom I do not believe.
          If I do not believe that there is a God, and that he is the rewarder
          of all them that diligently seek him, how can I possibly love him?
          Tell me of patience: how can I exercise patience unless I have faith?
          For faith looks to the recompense of the reward: she says, that |all
          things are working together for our good,| she believes that from our
          distresses the greater glory shall spring, and therefore she can
          endure. Tell me of courage: but who can have courage if he has not
          faith? Take what virtue you will, and you will see that it depends on
          faith. Faith is the silver thread upon which the pearls of the graces
          are to be strung. Break that, and you have broken the string -- the
          pearls lie scattered on the ground, nor can you wear them for your own
          adornment. Faith is the mother of virtues. Faith is the fire which
          consumes the sacrifice. Faith is the water which nurtures the root.
          Faith is the sap which imparts vitality to all the branches. If you
          have not faith all your graces must die. And in proportion as your
          faith increases so will all your virtues, not all in the same
          proportion, but all in some degree. The man of little faith is the man
          of little love. The man of great faith is the man of great affection.
          He that has great faith in God could give himself to die for God, but
          he who has little faith in him would shrink at the stake because his
          love would be feeble. Have care of your faith, for on that your virtue
          depends; and if you would cultivate things that are goodly, |things
          that are lovely, things that are of good repute,| things that are
          honorable to yourself, and pleasing to God, guard well your faith, for
          on your faith all things must rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Thirdly: -- Take heed of your faith, because Christ thinks much of
          it. There are three things in the New Testament which are called
          precious: -- One of them, you know, is the precious blood of Christ;
          another is the exceeding great and precious promises; and faith has
          the honor of being the third thing -- |To them that have obtained like
          precious faith.| So that faith is one of God's three precious things,
          It is one of the things which he values above all others. I was
          astonished yesterday, when I met with an idea in an old divine,
          concerning the honor which God puts on faith: says he, |Christ takes
          the crown off his own head to put it on to faith's head.| Mark you how
          often he says, |Thy faith hath saved thee.| Now it is not faith that
          saves, it is Christ that saves. |Thy faith hath healed thee,| says
          Christ. Now faith did not heal, it was Christ that healed, but Christ
          did uncrown himself to crown faith. He took the royal diadem of
          salvation from his own head and placed it on the brow of faith, and
          therein he made faith |the King of kings| -- for it wears the crown
          which the King of kings alone can wear -- |the crown of salvation.| Do
          you not know that we read, |We are justified by faith.| Now, in one
          sense this is not the fact, for the matter of justification is the
          imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ. We are justified by Christ, but
          Christ arrays faith in his own royal garments, and renders it truly
          illustrious. Jesus Christ always puts faith in the seat of honor. When
          that poor woman came whose daughter was ill, he said, |O woman great
          is thy faith!'| He might have said, |Woman, great is thy love| for it
          was great love that made her force her way through the crowd and speak
          on her daughter's behalf, or, |Great is thy patience,| for when he
          called her |dog,| she still stuck to him, and would not depart: or, he
          might have said, |Great is thy courage;| for she said, |Yet the dogs
          eat of the crumbs.| Or, he might have said, |Great is thy wisdom;| for
          she was a wise woman to extract sweets out of the bitters, and to say,
          |Truth, Lord, but the dogs eat of the crumbs.| But he overlooks all
          that, and says, |Great is thy faith.| Well, if Christ thinks so much
          of faith ought we not to esteem it most highly. Is it possible to
          think too highly of that jewel which Christ reckons to be the most
          valuable? If he sets faith in the forefront of the forehead of virtue,
          and if he regards it as the choicest gem in the crown of the
          Christian, oh! will it not awaken us to see whether we have it or not?
          For if we have it we are rich -- rich in faith and promises; but if we
          possess it not, whatever we have, we are poor -- poor in this world,
          and poor in the next.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Next, Christian, take good care of thy faith, for recollect faith
          is the only way whereby thou canst obtain blessings. If we want
          blessings from God, nothing can fetch them down except faith. Prayer
          cannot draw down answers from God's throne except it is the earnest
          prayer of the man who believes. Faith is the ladder on which my soul
          must walk to ascend to heaven. If I break that ladder how can I ever
          approach my God? Faith is the angelic messenger between the soul and
          heaven. Let that angel be withdrawn, I can neither send prayer up nor
          receive the answers down. Faith is the telegraphic wire which links
          earth and heaven -- on which God's blessings move so fast that before
          we call he answers, and while we are yet speaking he hears us. But if
          that telegraphic wire of faith be snapped, how can we receive the
          promise? Am I in trouble: I can obtain help for trouble by faith. Am I
          beaten about by the enemy: my soul on that dear refuge leans by faith.
          But, take faith away -- in vain I call to God. There is no road
          betwixt my soul and heaven. In the deepest winter time faith is a road
          on which the horses of prayer may travel -- ay, and all the better for
          the biting frost! But blockade the road, and how can we communicate
          with our great king? Faith links me with divinity. Faith clothes me
          with the robes of deity. Faith engages on my side the omnipotence of
          Jehovah. Faith gives me the might of God; for it ensures that power on
          my behalf. It gives me to defy the hosts of hell. It makes me march
          triumphant over the necks of my enemies. But without faith how can I
          receive anything of the Lord? Let not him that wavereth -- who is like
          a wave of the sea -- expect that he will receive anything of God! O
          then, Christians watch well thy faith; for with it thou canst win all
          things, however poor thou art, but without it thou canst obtain
          nothing. It is said of Midas, that he had the power to turn everything
          into gold by the touch of his hand; and it is true of faith -- it can
          turn everything into gold; but destroy faith, we have lost our all; we
          are miserably poor, because we can hold no fellowship with the Father
          and with his Son Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Next, my friends, take care of your faith perpetually, because of
          your enemies; for if you do not want faith when you are with friends,
          you will require it when you have to deal with your foes. That good
          old warrior, Paul, once led the Ephesians into the armoury and after
          he had shown them the shoes they were to wear, the girdle, the breast
          plate, the helmet, and the sword, he solemnly said, |Above all take
          the shield of faith.| Even if you forget the helmet, be quite sure of
          the shield, for if your helmet should be off you may ward off a blow
          with the shield, and save it from your head. You had better put on the
          |shoes of peace and the breast-plate of righteousness,| but if you
          omit one of them, take care that you have |the shield of faith, where
          with you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
          one.| Well, now, faith makes a man very mighty when he deals with
          enemies. If a man believes he is right, only taking it in a natural
          point of view -- bring that man before princes and kings, for the sake
          of truth, how lion-like will he be! He will say, |I cannot yield, I
          must not, for I have the truth on my side.| Ay, though others may
          style it dogged obstinacy, it is a true nobility of soul which bids a
          man declare, |I will not yield.| Much more strong is true spiritual
          faith; it has taken the martyr to the stake, and enabled him to sing
          when the flames have girdled him. It has led another to the sea; and
          like him of whom we read in the old martyrologies, it has helped even
          the aged matron to cry, |Christ is all yet.| Faith has quenched the
          violence of the flames, shut the mouth of lions, and out of weakness
          it has made us strong. It has overcome more enemies than the whole
          host of conquerors. Tell me not of the victories of Wellington;
          mention not the battles of Napoleon; tell me of what faith has done!
          Oh! if we should erect a monument to the honor of faith, what various
          names should we carve upon the mighty pedestal! We should inscribe,
          here |The lion's den,| there, |The battle of the leopards;| or, here,
          we should have recorded how faith divided the Red Sea; and there, how
          faith smote the Midianites; and there, how Jael slew Sisera by faith.
          What conflicts of faith should we have to engrave? O, faith! thy
          banner high shall wave! Thine escutcheon is most glorious! Great art
          thou and full of victories! With thee, O faith, I cast the gauntlet to
          the world, secure of victory. Give me a child to fight with, and
          without faith -- like poor Peter before the little maid, I should
          tremble and deny my Master. But that same Peter, with faith, fears not
          to stand before a frowning sanhedrim; to speak of his Master amid the
          scoffings of the high priests. Mary, Queen of Scots, said she was
          |more afraid of John Knox's prayers and faith than she was of an army
          of ten thousand men,| and a sensible enemy may well tremble when such
          invincibles are at war with him. I should not like to have a man of
          faith opposing me. Tell me the world hates me, and I will rejoice at
          it; but tell me that a man of faith has determined to crush me, and I
          have need to tremble then, for there is a potency in that man's arm;
          his blows strike hard; and, when he does smite, he smites home, as
          with a rod of iron. Tremble, ye foes of God, for faith must overcome.
          And O ye servants of the living God, guard well your faith, for by
          this shall ye be victorious; and shall stand like rocks, unmoved amid
          the storms, unshaken by the tempests of persecution.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. And now for a sixth reason. Take care of your faith, because
          otherwise you cannot well perform your duty. Faith is the foot of the
          soul by which it can march along the road of the commandments. Love
          can make the feet move more swiftly; but faith is the foot which
          carries the soul. Faith is the oil enabling the wheels of holy
          devotion and of earnest piety to move well; but without faith the
          wheels are taken from the chariot and we drag along heavily. With
          faith I can do all things; without faith I shall neither have the
          inclination nor the power to do anything in the service of God. If you
          would find the men who serve God the best, you will find them the men
          of the most faith. Little faith will save a man, but little faith
          cannot do great things. Poor Little Faith could not have fought
          |Apollyon.| No, it wanted |Christian| to do that. Poor Little Faith
          could not have slain |Giant Despair;| it required |Greatheart's| arm
          to knock that monster down. Little faith can get to heaven very
          surely, but it often has to run and hide itself in a nutshell; and to
          lose all but its jewels. If there are great battles and great works to
          do, there must be great faith. Assurance can carry mountains on its
          back; little faith stumbles at a mole-hill. Great faith, like
          Behemoth, can |snuff' up Jordan at a draught:| little faith is drowned
          in a drop of rain: it beginneth to think of going back at the
          slightest trouble. Great faith can build temples; she can pile
          castles; she can preach the gospel; she can proclaim Christ's name
          before enemies; she can do all things; and if you would be great
          indeed, and serve your Master much, as I trust you will, you will seek
          increased faith! for by so doing you will be more diligent in duty. O
          ye active Christians, be full of faith! ye busy Christians, be sure to
          guard that I for once let that fall, what will ye do? As
          Sabbath-school teachers, as preachers, as visitors of the sick, or
          whatever ye have to do, rest assured that faith must be your strength
          and confidence. If that fails, where are you then?
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: take care of your faith; for only faith can comfort you in your
          troubles. Ay, say some, this is about all we think of, the uses of
          faith to console us in our troubles. Now I never like to laugh at
          God's people because they desire comfort. I believe that it is a very
          great proof that they are children that they like sweet things. If
          they did not, I should fear they were not God's children at all. But I
          hear ministers saying, |Ah, you are always saying you want comfort,
          you want comfort.| Ay, to be sure, I say, they do; and they want it
          because they never get it from you, sir. I believe God's people do
          need comfort, though, it is true, they want too much of it when they
          ought not to have it. But they require a promise very often, and they
          ought to have it. Now faith is the best cordial to the soul. O, how
          faith will realize a promise at a time when there is great trouble
          coming! |Ah!| says faith, |God says, As thy days so shall thy strength
          be.' |Ah!| says faith, |it is a rough road; the thorns are sharp; the
          flints are strewn about it, but then; thy shoes shall be iron and
          brass,'| and faith looks at the strong old shoes, and say, |I will
          even venture,| and off she goes. Little faith sits murmuring in a
          corner; great faith is singing in the fire. |They shall praise him
          aloud in their beds, they shall sing his high praise in the fire.|
          Little faith stands desponding, mingling her tears with the flood.
          Great faith says, |When thou passest through the river, I will be with
          thee, the flood shall not overflow thee; when thou passest through the
          fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flames kindle upon
          thee.| Would you be comfortable and happy? Would you enjoy religion?
          Would you have the religion of cheerfulness and not that of gloom?
          Then seek more faith. You will be saved with ever so little faith, but
          you will not be saved happily. You will be happy hereafter if you
          believe in the slightest degree; but you will not be happy here unless
          you fully, habitually, and earnestly believe -- believe strongly in
          the faithful promises of Jehovah, in all the glorious dignity of his
          person, and in all the faithfulness and immutability of his grace. If
          ye would be Christian larks, and not Christian owls, seek to have more
          faith. If ye love darkness, and would fly about in it in gloom and
          misery, then be content with little faith. But if ye would mount in
          sunshine, and carol like the bird of day, then seek strong confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          One more reason. Take care of your faith, my friends; for it's very
          often so weak, that it demands all your attention. I do not know
          whether any of you feel that your faith is too strong; but I never
          feel mine strong enough. It seems to be exactly strong enough to bear
          the day's troubles, but it would not stand cutting in the least degree
          with the plane. I could not afford to take the least atom off; it is
          just enough, and no more. As for some of us, our faith is so weak that
          the least trouble threatens to devour it. The goat passes and nips its
          tender shoot, the winter chills and freezes it; it is almost ready to
          die. And my faith very often hangs upon the feeblest thread; it
          appears ready to expire. Take care of your faith, Christian take care
          of your faith whatever you leave out of doors of a night, do not leave
          that little child of faith, whatsoever plant is exposed to the frost,
          be sure to put faith within. Take care of faith, for it is so weak
          generally, it needs well to have a good preservation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus have I tried, as well as I can, this morning, to set forth the
          great necessity of looking to our faith; and our prayer must be, as it
          was that of the apostles, |increase our faith.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. This brings us, secondly, to consider THE HEART'S DESIRE OF THE
          APOSTLES. |Increase our faith.| They did not say, |Lord keep our faith
          alive: Lord sustain it as it is at present,| but, |Increase our
          faith.| For they knew very well that it is only by increase that the
          Christian keeps alive at all. Napoleon once said, |I must fight
          battles, and I must win them: conquest has made me what I am, and
          conquest must maintain me.| And it is so with the Christian. It is not
          yesterday's battle that will save me to-day; I must be going onwards.
          A wheel will remain erect as long as it moves, but when it begins to
          stand still it falls. Christian men are saved by progress: constantly
          going onwards keeps the Christian alive. If it were possible for me to
          stop, I know not where my life would be. The Christian must be going
          onward; for the arrow will mount while still it is in progress, but it
          stalls the moment the power stops that keeps it aloft. So the apostle
          said unto the Lord, |increase our faith.|
        </p>
        <p>
          First: |Increase our faith,| in its extent; the extent of what it will
          receive. Usually, when we commence the Christian life, faith does not
          grasp much; it only believes a few elementary doctrines. I find that
          many young converts have not gone much farther than believing that
          Jesus Christ died for sinners, by-and-bye they get a little advanced,
          and believe election; but there is something a little beyond that they
          do not receive, and it is not until after years that they believe the
          entire gospel. Some of you, my hearers, and a great many that are not
          my hearers are miserable little cramped souls; you have learned a
          cast-iron creed, and you will never move out of it. A certain somebody
          drew up five or six doctrines, and said, |There are the doctrines of
          the Bible,| and ye believe these, but you want to have your faith
          increased, for you do not believe a great deal more that is in the
          Bible. I do not think I differ from any of my hyper-calvinistic
          brethren in what I do believe, but I differ from them in what they do
          not believe. I do not believe any less than they do, but I believe a
          little more, and think, as we grow we shall have our belief increased;
          not only are there a few cardinal doctrines that will be enough to
          steer our ship by, north, south, east, or west, but we shall begin to
          learn something about the north-west and north-east, and that which
          lies between the four points. Many people, when they hear something a
          little contrary to what they have usually heard, say at once, |That is
          not sound.| But who made you a judge of what is sound? And there are
          some little souls who set themselves up for princes in Israel, and
          think every man must believe as they believe, or else he is decidedly
          wrong, and will hold no Christian communication or fellowship with
          him. I am sure I may pray to the Lord for them -- |Increase their
          faith!| Help them to believe a little more; help them to believe there
          may be Christian Wesleyans; that there are good Church people; and not
          only that particular Baptists are very good sort of people, but that
          there are some of God's elect everywhere. I am sure I pray for all
          bigots, that they may have a little wider heart. I should like to
          stretch their hearts a little. But, no, they have reached the ultima
          thule, they have come to the last of the fortunate islands, there
          cannot be any shore beyond. It is dangerous for a mariner to spread
          his sails on untried seas. |Hitherto,| says pious Crisp, and therefore
          many fancy, |hitherto shalt thou go, and no further.| Dr. Gill
          declares just so much, and who shall venture to say more; or perhaps
          Calvin is made the standard and what business has any man to think a
          single thought beyond Calvin? Blessed be God, we have gone a little
          beyond that; and we can say, |Increase our faith.| With all our
          admiration for these great standard divines, we are not prepared to
          shut ourselves up in their little iron cages; but we say, |Open the
          door, and let me fly -- let me still feel that I am at liberty.
          Increase my faith, and help me to believe a little more.| I know I can
          say I have had an increase of faith in one or two respects within the
          last few months. I could not, for a long time, see anything like the
          Millenium in the Scriptures; I could not much rejoice in the Second
          Coming of Christ, though I did believe it; but gradually my faith
          began to open to that subject, and I find it now a part of my meat and
          drink, to be looking for, as well as hastening unto, the coming of our
          Lord Jesus Christ. I believe I have only just begun to learn the A B C
          of the Scriptures yet, and will constantly cry to the Lord, |Increase
          my faith,| that I may know more and believe more, and understand thy
          Word far better. |Increase my faith,| in its extent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, |Increase my faith,| in its intensity. Faith needs to be
          increased in its power, as well as in its extent. We do not wish to
          act as some do with a river, when they break the banks, to let it
          spread over the pasture, and so make it shallower but we wish, while
          it increases in surface, that it may increase likewise in its depth.
          Increase |the intensity of our faith!| Faith at first takes God's
          mercy with an open palm: as it increases it holds it with his fingers,
          and not more firmly; but when faith grows strong, ah! she takes it, as
          with an iron vice, and grasps it, and not death nor hell could rend a
          promise from faith's hand when faith is strong. The young Christian at
          first is not constant in his faith a little wind comes, and he shakes,
          when he gets an old Christian he will take old Boreas, with fifty of
          his winds, to move him. Do you not feel, my dear friends, that you
          want faith to be increased in its intensity? Would you not sing with
          Watts:
        </p>
        <p>|Oh! that I had a stronger faith,</p>
        <p>To look within the veil;</p>
        <p>To credit what my Saviour saith,</p>
        <p>Whose word can never fail?|</p>
        <p>
          Your poor little faith cannot see many yards before it, for there are
          clouds of darkness all around; but strong faith can climb the hill
          that is called |Clear,| and from the top thereof can see the celestial
          city, and the land that is very far off. Oh! may God increase your
          faith to such a degree, that you may often have visions of heaven| --
          that you may sweetly sing, as Moses might have done at the top of
          Pisgah, --
        </p>
        <p>|Oh! the transporting rapturous scene</p>
        <p>That rises to my sight.</p>
        <p>Sweet fields arrayed in living green,</p>
        <p>And rivers of delight.|</p>
        <p>
          That you may climb up there, bathe your eyes in splendor, plunge your
          soul in rivers of bliss, and be thoroughly transported and carried
          away by visions of that state of beatitude which shortly shall be
          yours, let me exhort you to cry to the Lord, |Increase my faith |in
          its power of realizing heaven and in every other way.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I have no time to dwell upon this, but must close up by very
          briefly mentioning THE PERSON TO WHOM THE APOSTLES ADDRESSED THEIR
          PRAYER. The apostles said to the Lord, |Increase our faith!| They went
          to the right person. They did not say to themselves, |I will increase
          my faith,| they did not cry to the minister, |Preach a comforting
          sermon, and increase my faith,| they did not say, |I will read
          such-and-such a book, and that will increase my faith.| No, they said
          to the Lord, |Increase our faith.| Faiths author can alone increase
          it. I could inflate your faith till it turned into presumption, but I
          could not make it grow. It is God's work to feed faith, as well as to
          give it life at first; and if any of you desire to have a growing
          faith, go and take your burden this morning to God's throne, crying
          |Lord, increase our faith!| If you feel that your troubles have been
          increased, go to the Lord, and say, |increase our faith!| If your
          money is accumulating, go to the Lord, and say, |Increase our faith;|
          for you will want more faith as you get more prosperity. If your
          property is diminishing, go to him, and say, |increase our faith,| so
          that what you lose in one scale you may gain in the other. Are you
          sickly and full; of pain this morning? Go to your Master, and say,
          |increase my faith,' so that I may not be impatient, but be able to
          bear it well.| Are you tired and weary? Go and supplicate, |Increase
          our faith!| Have you little faith? Take it to God, and he will turn it
          into great faith. There is no hot-house for growing tender plants in,
          like a house that is within the curtains -- the tabernacle of God,
          where the Shekinah dwelleth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been speaking in very great pain; but I would, if possible,
          close by asking you, who are Christians, whether you do not think this
          prayer very necessary to your own state. Let each one ask himself, Do
          not I want more faith? My brethren and sisters in the Lord Jesus
          Christ, rest assured, you will never get too much of this precious
          grace. If you pay all the way to heaven, you will never have a penny
          to spare when you get to heaven's gate, if you live on faith all your
          journey through, you will not have a pot of manna left. Pray, then,
          for an increase of faith. You want this church to stand, do you not?
          It can stand only in proportion as you are men of faith. I know I
          might exhort you to be men of prayer; but faith is the foundation
          stone; prayer comes next. Prayer without faith would be an empty
          mockery; it would win nothing of God. Do you want us to stand? Do you
          know how the world speaks of us -- how the enthusiasm of the renting
          people of Park Street is talked of? How is it to be kept up, except
          through your faith. How shall your minister's hands be held up, except
          by your faith and your prayers? Let faith be the Aaron; let prayer be
          the Ur; and faith and prayer can hold up the hands of Moses, whilst
          the army below is fighting the enemy. Would ye be kept from falling?
          Ye must be strong in faith. Little faith falls, strong faith stands.
          Would ye win the day, and reign in heaven, with a starry crown more
          brilliant than you might otherwise expect? Then be ye increased in
          faith. And would ye honor God much, and enter heaven, after having
          fought a good fight and won a crown? Then I will offer the
          supplication, |increase the faith of my people,| and put up the
          prayer, |increase my faith.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But there are some of you, dear friends, who could not use this
          petition, and dare not. What would it avail you if you did so? Seeing
          you have no faith, how could that be increased which has no existence.
          Rather, your first need is the possession of the simple germs of
          faith. Oh! my hearers, I marvel what some of you do without the
          comforts which faith can alone afford. Some of you are very poor
          people: how do you manage to endure your toils and troubles without
          faith? Where is your comfort? I do not wonder at your going to get
          drunk, or rioting in the ale-house, if you have no other comfort in
          this world. When I have penetrated some of our back streets and seen
          the poverty of the people, I have thought, |If these people have no
          religion, what have they to comfort them? They are not like the rich
          man, who can indulge himself in every way: what have they got in this
          world worth living for?| I suppose they have some kind of happiness:
          what sort of a thing it is I cannot tell: it is to me a source of
          continual inquiry. And you rich men, what will you do without faith?
          You know that you must leave all your properly behind you; surely this
          will make the idea of death dreadful to you. I cannot understand even
          your happiness, if you have any. I know this -- that
        </p>
        <p>|I would not change my blest estate</p>
        <p>For all the earth calls good or great;</p>
        <p>And while my faith can keep her hold,</p>
        <p>I envy not the sinner's gold.|</p>
        <p>
          But I want to ask you what would you do in the next world without
          faith. Remember, you are standing now upon the edge of the vast gulf
          of an unknown future. Your soul stands quivering on the verge of the
          dark abyss; each time your pulse heats your soul is brought nearer to
          eternity. Faith gives wings to the soul; but what will you do without
          wings? There is a narrow gulf dividing earth from heaven; the
          Christian flaps his wings, and borne upon them, he flies to heaven;
          but what will you do without wings? It will be a leap -- a leap into
          perdition, to sink for ever, without the power of ever recovering
          yourself. If a Christian could sink on his journey to heaven he would
          not sink far for he would flap his wings and be up again. But there
          you will be, perpetually descending through that pit that has no
          bottom -- struggling to rise, but you cannot, for you have no wings.
          Once more, oh! unbeliever, what will you do without faith? For faith
          gives eyes to the soul; faith gives us to see things that are not
          seen: it is |the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things
          not seen.| The Christian, when he dies, will enter the land of death
          with his eyes open; by means of which, goodly hosts of angels shall
          cheer his vision; but you must die a blind and eyeless spirit. Unhappy
          is the lot of the blind in this present world, but how infinitely
          deplorable that eternal blindness which shall prevent a sight of the
          splendours of paradise, and shut out for ever even the feeblest ray of
          joy or hope. And, once more; faith is the hand of the soul. The
          Christian, when he dies, catches hold of Christ's garment, and Christ
          bears him into heaven. A bright angel descends, -- I clasp that angel,
          and on his wings he wafts me up to bliss. But when the unbeliever dies
          the angel would have a useless errand, for he has no hands. Suppose, O
          sinner, Christ is there, but you cannot even touch his garments, for
          you have no hands to do it with. What will you do in the next world
          without hands? Do you think God will suffer such deformed souls in
          heaven, without hands and without eyes? No, not at all. But how could
          you get in without hands? You could not open the gates of heaven. What
          would you do? You would call on God for mercy; and if the mercy were
          held out to you, you have not hands with which to lay hold upon it. I
          do not understand how some of you are happy without religion, I do not
          know what you mean to do if you die without faith. Go home and think
          of what you will do if you die without religion; whether you intend to
          brazen it out before the face of the Eternal, or tamely to submit.
          Sinner! thou canst not enter into heaven without faith, but what hast
          thou made up thy mind to do? Dost thou intend to rend down the gates
          of heaven? Dost thou think thou hast omnipotence enough to force thy
          way through squadrons of cherubim and legions of angels, and so to
          enter by main force? Or what dost thou design to do? Dost thou intend
          quietly to lie down in beds of sulphur? Dost thou design to be
          willingly tossed perpetually in that brimstone lake where there is no
          bottom; where briny tears for ever fall? Will ye do that? Will ye make
          your bed in hell? Sirs, are you so besotted that ye are content with
          such a doom eternally? Is your reason clean gone? Are your senses so
          benighted that ye can thus cast yourselves away? Surely ye have
          resolved to do something. What, then, will ye do? Do you fancy that
          without faith you will enter heaven, when it is written, |Without
          faith it is impossible to please God?| And when God has said. |He that
          believeth not shall be damned,| dost thou think thou canst reverse the
          decree? Wilt thou mount the throne of Jehovah, and forswear Jehovah's
          self? Wilt thou change his mandate and admit the unbeliever into
          heaven? No, thou canst not! Tremble, then, unbeliever, tremble; for
          there awaits thee nothing but |a fearful looking for of judgment and
          of fiery indignation.| What will ye do in the swellings of Jordan,
          without faith to keep your heads above the waters? God give faith to
          those that have none; and as for others, may he increase their faith!
