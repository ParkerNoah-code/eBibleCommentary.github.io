 </p>
</b></font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">SUBJECT. This is a choice song for the redeemed of the 
    Lord (Verse 2). Although <i>it celebrates providential deliverances</i>, and 
    therefore may be sung by any man whose life has been preserved in time of 
    danger; yet under cover of this, it mainly magnifies the Lord for spiritual 
    blessings, of which temporal favors are but types and shadows. </p>
<p align="justify">The <i>theme </i>is thanksgiving, and the motives for it.
    </p>
<p align="justify">The <i>construction </i>of the psalm is highly poetic, 
    and merely as a composition it would be hard to find its compeer among human 
    productions. The bards of the Bible hold no second place among the sons of 
    song.</p>
<p align="justify">DIVISION. </p>
<p align="justify">The psalmist commences by dedicating his poem to the 
    redeemed who have been gathered from captivity, Verses 1-3; </p>
<p align="justify">he then likens their history to that of <i>travelers </i>
    lost in the desert, Verses 4-9; </p>
<p align="justify">to that of <i>prisoners </i>in iron bondage, Verses 
    10-16; </p>
<p align="justify">to that of <i>sick </i>men, Verses 17-22; </p>
<p align="justify">and to that of <i>mariners </i>tossed with tempest, 
    Verses 23-32. </p>
<p align="justify">In the closing verses the judgment of God on the 
    rebellious, and the mercies of God to his own afflicted people are made the 
    theme of the song, Verses 33-42; </p>
<p align="justify">and then the psalm closes with a sort of summing up, in 
    Verses 43, which declares that those who study the works and ways of the 
    Lord shall be sure to see and praise his goodness.</p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It is <i>all </i>we can give him, and the <i>least </i>we 
    can give; therefore let us diligently render to him our thanksgiving. The 
    psalmist is in earnest in the exhortation, hence the use of the interjection 
    "O", to intensity his words.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us be at all times thoroughly fervent in the praises 
    of the Lord, both with our <i>lips </i>and with our <i>lives</i>, by thanks-<i>giving</i> 
    and thanks <i>living</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">JEHOVAH, for that is the name here used, is not to be 
    worshiped with groans and cries—but with thanks, for he is good; and these 
    thanks should be heartily rendered, for his is no common goodness—he is good 
    by nature, and essence, and proven to be good in all the acts of his 
    eternity. Compared with him there is none good, no, not one. <i>He is 
    essentially, perpetually, superlatively, infinitely good. </i>We are the 
    perpetual partakers of his goodness, and therefore ought above all his 
    creatures to magnify his name. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">For his mercy endures forever</p></b>.
<p align="justify">Our praise should be increased by the fact that the 
    divine goodness is not a transient thing—but in the attribute of <i>mercy
    </i>abides forever the same. The word endures has been properly supplied by 
    the translators—but yet it somewhat restricts the sense, which will be 
    better seen if we read it, "for his mercy forever." That mercy had no 
    beginning, and shall never know an end. Our sin required that goodness 
    should display itself to us in the form of mercy, and it has done so, and 
    will do so evermore; let us not be slack in praising the goodness which thus 
    adapts itself to our fallen nature.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. Let the redeemed of the LORD say so. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Whatever others may think or say, the redeemed have 
    overwhelming reasons for declaring the goodness of the Lord. Theirs is a 
    peculiar redemption, and for it they ought to render peculiar praise. <i>The 
    Redeemer is so glorious, the ransom price so immense, and the redemption so 
    complete</i>, that they are under sevenfold obligations to give thanks unto 
    the Lord, and to exhort others to do so. Let them not only feel so but say 
    so; let them both sing and bid their fellows sing. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Whom he has redeemed from the hand of the enemy. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Snatched by superior power away from fierce oppressions, 
    they are bound above all men to adore the Lord, their Liberator. Theirs is a 
    divine redemption, "he has redeemed" them, and no one else has done it. His 
    own unaided arm has wrought out their deliverance. <i>Should not emancipated 
    slaves be grateful to the hand which set them free? What gratitude can 
    suffice for a deliverance from the power of sin, death, and Hell? In Heaven 
    itself there is no sweeter hymn than that whose burden is, "You have 
    redeemed us unto God by your blood."</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. And gathered them out of the lands, from the 
    east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Gathering follows upon redeeming. The captives of old 
    were restored to their own land from every quarter of the earth, and even 
    from beyond the sea; for the word translated south is really the sea. No 
    matter what divides, the Lord will gather his own into one body, and first 
    on earth by "one Lord, one faith, and one baptism", and then in Heaven by 
    one common bliss they shall be known to be the one people of the One God.
    </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">What a glorious Shepherd must he be who thus collects the 
    blood bought flock from the remotest regions, guides them through countless 
    perils, and at last makes them to lie down in the green pastures of 
    Paradise.</p></i> Some have wandered one way and some another they have all left 
    Immanuel's land and strayed as far as they could, and great are the grace 
    and power by which they are all collected into one flock by the Lord Jesus. 
    With one heart and voice let the redeemed praise the Lord who gathers them 
    into one.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. They wandered in the wilderness. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They wandered, for the track was lost, no vestige of a 
    road remained; worse still, they wandered in a wilderness, where all around 
    was burning sand. <i>They were lost in the worst possible place, even as the 
    sinner is who is lost in sin.</i> They wandered up and down in vain searches 
    and re-searches as a sinner does when he is awakened and sees his lost 
    estate; but it ended in nothing, for they still continued in the wilderness, 
    though they had hoped to escape from it. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">In a solitary way. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">No dwelling of man was near, and no other company of 
    travelers passed within hail. Solitude is a great intensifier of misery. The 
    loneliness of a desert has a most depressing influence upon the man who is 
    lost in the boundless waste. The traveler's way in the wilderness is a waste 
    way, and when he leaves even that poor, barren trail, to get utterly beyond 
    the path of man, he is in a wretched plight indeed. A soul without sympathy 
    is on the borders of Hell—a solitary way is the way of despair. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">They found no city to dwell in. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">How could they? There was none. Israel in the wilderness 
    abode under canvas, and enjoyed none of the comforts of settled life. 
    Wanderers in the Sahara find no town or village. Men when under distress of 
    soul find nothing to rest upon, no comfort and no peace; their efforts after 
    salvation are many, weary, and disappointing, and the dread solitude of 
    their hearts fills them with dire distress.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The spirits sink when the bodily frame becomes exhausted 
    by long privations. Who can keep his courage up when he is ready to fall to 
    the ground at every step through utter exhaustion? The supply of food is all 
    eaten, the water is spent in the bottles, and there are neither fields nor 
    streams in the desert—the heart therefore sinks in dire despair. </p>
<p align="justify">Such is the condition of an awakened conscience before it 
    knows the Lord Jesus; it is full of unsatisfied cravings, painful needs, and 
    heavy fears. It is utterly spent and without strength, and there is nothing 
    in the whole creation which can minister to its refreshment.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Not until they were in extremities did they pray—but the 
    mercy is that they prayed then, and prayed in the right manner, with a cry, 
    and to the right person, even to the Lord. Nothing else remained for them to 
    do; they could not help themselves, or find help in others, and therefore 
    they cried to God. </p>
<p align="justify">Supplications which are forced out of us by stern 
    necessity are none the less acceptable with God; indeed, they have all the 
    more prevalence, since they are evidently sincere, and make a powerful 
    appeal to the divine pity. </p>
<p align="justify">Some men will never pray until they are half starved, and 
    for their best interests it is far better for them to be empty and faint 
    than to be full and stout-hearted. If <i>hunger </i>brings us to our knees, 
    it is more useful to us than feasting. If <i>thirst </i>drives us to the 
    fountain, it is better than the deepest draughts of worldly joys. If <i>
    fainting </i>leads to crying, it is better than the strength of the mighty.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And he delivered them out of their distresses. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Deliverance follows prayer most surely. The cry must have 
    been very feeble, for they were faint, and their faith was as weak as their 
    cry; but yet they were heard, and heard at once. A little delay would have 
    been their death: but there was none, for the Lord was ready to save them.</p>
<p align="justify">The Lord delights to come in when no one else can be of 
    the slightest avail. The case was hopeless until Jehovah interposed, and 
    then all was changed immediately; the people were shut up, straitened, and 
    almost pressed to death—but enlargement came to them at once when they began 
    to remember their God, and look to him in prayer. </p>
<p align="justify">Those deserve to die of hunger who will not so much as 
    ask for bread, and he who being lost in a desert will not beg the aid of a 
    guide, cannot be pitied even if he perish in the wilds and feed the vultures 
    with his flesh.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. And he led them forth by the right way. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">There are many wrong ways—but only one right one, and 
    into this none can lead us but God himself. When the Lord is leader the way 
    is sure to be right; we never need question that. Forth from the pathless 
    mazes of the desert he conducted the lost ones; he found the way, made the 
    way, and enabled them to walk along it, faint and hungry as they were. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">That they might go to a city of habitation. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The end was worthy of the way: he did not lead them from 
    one desert to another—but he gave the wanderers an abode, the weary ones a 
    place of rest. They found no city to dwell in—but he found one readily 
    enough. What we can do and what God can do are two very different things. <i>
    What a difference it made to them to leave their solitude for a city, their 
    trackless path for well frequented streets, and their faintness of heart for 
    the refreshment of a home! </i></p>

<p align="justify">Far greater are the changes which divine love works in 
    the condition of sinners when God answers their prayers and brings them to 
    Jesus. Shall not the Lord be magnified for such special mercies? Can we who 
    have enjoyed them sit down in ungrateful silence?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. Oh that men would praise the LORD for his 
    goodness.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Men are not mentioned here in the original—but the word 
    is fitly supplied by the translators; the psalmist would have all things in 
    existence magnify Jehovah's name. Surely men will do this without being 
    exhorted to it when the deliverance is fresh in their memories. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">They must be horrible ingrates who will not honor such a 
    deliverer for so happy a rescue from the most cruel death.</p></i> It is well 
    that the redeemed should be stirred up to bless the Lord again and again, 
    for preserved life deserves life long thankfulness. 
<p align="justify">Even those who have not encountered the like peril, and 
    obtained the like deliverance, should bless the Lord in sympathy with their 
    fellows, sharing their joy.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And for his wonderful works to the children of men.</p></b>

<p align="justify">These favors are bestowed upon our race, upon children of 
    the family to which we belong, and therefore we ought to join in the praise.
    </p>
<p align="justify">The children of men are so insignificant, so feeble, and 
    so undeserving, that it is a great wonder that the Lord should do anything 
    for them; but he is not content with doing little works, he puts forth his 
    wisdom, power, and love to perform marvels on the behalf of those who seek 
    him.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">In the life of each one of the redeemed there is a world 
    of wonders, and therefore from each there should resound a world of praises.</p></i> 
    As to the marvels of grace which the Lord has wrought for his church as a 
    whole there is no estimating them, they are as high above our thoughts as 
    the heavens are high above the earth. When shall the day dawn when the 
    favored race of man shall be as devoted to the praise of God, as they are 
    distinguished by the favor of God?
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. For he satisfies the longing soul. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This is the summary of the lost traveler's experience. He 
    who in a natural sense has been rescued from perishing in a howling 
    wilderness ought to bless the Lord who brings him again to eat bread among 
    men. </p>
<p align="justify">The spiritual sense is, however, the more rich in 
    instruction. The Lord sets us longing and then completely satisfies us. That 
    longing leads us into solitude, separation, thirst, faintness and 
    self-despair, and all these conduct us to prayer, faith, divine guidance, 
    satisfying of the soul's thirst, and rest. The good hand of the Lord is to 
    be seen in the whole process and in the divine result. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And fills the hungry soul with goodness. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">As for thirst he gives satisfaction, so for hunger he 
    supplies filling. In both cases the need is more than met, there is an 
    abundance in the supply which is well worthy of notice: the Lord does 
    nothing in a niggardly fashion; satisfying and filling are his peculiar 
    modes of treating his guests. None who come under the Lord's providing ever 
    complain of short commons. </p>
<p align="justify">Nor does he fill the hungry with common fare—but with 
    goodness itself. It is not so much good, as the essence of goodness which he 
    bestows on needy suppliants. Shall man be thus royally supplied and return 
    no praise for the large gifts of love? It must not be so. We will even now 
    give thanks with all the redeemed church, and pray for the time when the 
    whole earth shall be filled with his glory.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of 
    death.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">The cell is dark of itself, and the fear of execution 
    casts a still denser gloom over the prison. Such is the cruelty of man to 
    man, that tens of thousands have been made to linger in places only fit to 
    be tombs—unhealthy, suffocating, filthy sepulchers, where they have sickened 
    and died of broken hearts. </p>
<p align="justify">Meanwhile the dread of sudden death has been the most 
    hideous part of the punishment; the prisoners have felt as if the chill 
    shade of death himself froze them to the very marrow. </p>
<p align="justify">The state of a soul under conviction of sin is forcibly 
    symbolized by such a condition; persons in that state cannot see the 
    promises which would yield them comfort; they sit still in the inactivity of 
    despair, they fear the approach of judgment, and are thereby as much 
    distressed as if they were at death's door. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Being bound in affliction and iron. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Many prisoners have been thus doubly fettered in heart 
    and hand. Or the text may mean that affliction becomes as an iron band to 
    them, or that the iron chains caused them great affliction. </p>
<p align="justify">None know these things but those who have felt them; we 
    would prize our liberty more if we knew by actual experience what manacles 
    and fetters mean.</p>
<p align="justify">In a spiritual sense affliction frequently attends 
    conviction of sin, and then the double grief causes a double bondage. In 
    such cases the iron enters into the soul, the poor captives cannot stir 
    because of their bonds, cannot rise to hope because of their grief, and have 
    no power because of their despair. Misery is the companion of all those who 
    are shut up and cannot come forth. O you who are made free by Christ Jesus, 
    remember those who are in bonds.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. Because they rebelled against the words of God.</p></b>

<p align="justify">This was the general cause of bondage among the ancient 
    people of God, they were given over to their adversaries because they were 
    not loyal to the Lord. God's words are not to be trifled with, and those who 
    venture on such rebellion will bring themselves into bondage. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And despised the counsel of the Most High. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They thought that they knew better than the Judge of all 
    the earth, and therefore they left his ways and walked in their own. When 
    men do not follow the divine counsel, they give the most practical proof of 
    their contempt for it. <i>Those who will not be bound by God's law will, 
    before long, be bound by the fetters of judgment</i>. There is too much 
    despising of the divine counsel, even among Christians, and hence so few of 
    them know the liberty with which Christ makes us free.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. Therefore he brought down their heart with 
    labor. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">In eastern prisons men are frequently made to labor like 
    beasts of the field. As they have no liberty, so they have no rest. This 
    soon subdues the stoutest heart, and makes the proud boaster sing another 
    tune. Trouble and hard toil are enough to tame a lion. God has methods of 
    abating the loftiness of rebellious looks; the cell and the mill make even 
    giants tremble. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">They fell down, and there was none to help. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Stumbling on in the dark beneath their weary task, they 
    at last fell prone upon the ground—but no one came to pity them or to lift 
    them up. Their fall might be fatal for anything that any man cared about 
    them; their misery was unseen—or, if observed, no one could interfere 
    between them and their tyrant masters. </p>
<p align="justify">In such a wretched plight the rebellious Israelite became 
    more lowly in mind, and thought more tenderly of his God and of his offences 
    against him. </p>
<p align="justify">When a soul finds all its efforts at self-salvation prove 
    abortive, and feels that it is now utterly without strength, then the Lord 
    is at work hiding pride from man and preparing the afflicted one to receive 
    his mercy. </p>
<p align="justify">The spiritual case which is here figuratively described 
    is desperate, and therefore affords the finer field for the divine 
    interposition; some of us remember well how brightly mercy shone in our 
    prison, and what music the fetters made when they fell off from our hands. 
    Nothing but the Lord's love could have delivered us—without it we must have 
    utterly perished.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Not a prayer until then. While there was any to help 
    below they would not look above. <i>No cries until their hearts were brought 
    down and their hopes were all dead</i>—then they cried, but not before. So 
    many a man offers what he calls prayer when he is in good ease and thinks 
    well of himself—but in very deed <i>the only real cry to God is that which 
    is forced out of him by a sense of utter helplessness and misery. We pray 
    best when we are fallen on our faces in painful helplessness</i>. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And he saved them out of their distresses.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Speedily and willingly he sent relief. They were long 
    before they cried—but he was not long before he saved. They had applied 
    everywhere else before they came to him—but when they did address themselves 
    to him, they were welcome at once. He who saved men in the open wilderness, 
    can also save in the shut up prison—bolts and bars cannot shut him out, nor 
    long shut in his redeemed ones.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14. He brought them out of darkness and the shadow 
    of death.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The Lord in providence fetches out prisoners from their 
    cells and bids them breathe the sweet fresh air again, and then he takes off 
    their fetters, and gives liberty to their aching limbs. So also he frees men 
    from care and trouble, and especially from the misery and slavery of sin. 
    This he does with his own hand, for in the experience of all the saints it 
    is certified that <i>there is no jail delivery unless by the Judge himself</i>.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And broke their bands in sunder. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Set them free by force, so liberating them that they 
    could not be chained again, for he had broken the manacles to pieces. The 
    Lord's deliverances are of the most complete and triumphant kind, he neither 
    leaves the soul in darkness nor in bonds, nor does he permit the powers of 
    evil again to enthral the liberated captive. What he does is done forever. 
    Glory be to his name.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 15. Oh that men would praise the LORD for his 
    goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The sight of such goodness makes a right-minded man long 
    to see the Lord duly honored for his amazing mercy. When dungeon doors fly 
    open, and chains are snapped—who can refuse to adore the glorious goodness 
    of the Lord? It makes the heart sick to think of such gracious mercies 
    remaining unsung—we cannot but plead with men to remember their obligations 
    and extol the Lord their God.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 16. For he has broken the gates of brass, and cut 
    the bars of Zion asunder.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This verse belongs to that which precedes it, and sums up 
    the mercy experienced by captives. <i>The Lord breaks the strongest gates 
    and bars when the time comes to set free his prisoners</i>. Spiritually the 
    Lord Jesus has broken the most powerful of spiritual bonds and made us free 
    indeed. Brass and iron are as thread before the flame of Jesus' love. The 
    gates of Hell shall not prevail against us, neither shall the bars of the 
    grave detain us. Those of us who have experienced his redeeming power must 
    and will praise the Lord for the wonders of his grace displayed on our 
    behalf.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 17. Fools because of their transgression, and 
    because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</p></b> 
<i>
<p align="justify">Many sicknesses are the direct result of foolish acts.</p></i> 
    Thoughtless and lustful men by drunkenness, gluttony, and the indulgence of 
    their passions fill their bodies with diseases of the worst kind. <i>Sin is 
    at the bottom of all sorrow—but some sorrows are the immediate results of 
    wickedness</i>. Men by a course of transgression afflict themselves and are 
    fools for their pains. Worse still, even when they are in affliction they 
    are fools still; and if they were beaten in a mortar among wheat with a 
    pestle—yet would not their folly depart from them. From one transgression 
    they go on to many iniquities, and while under the rod they add sin to sin. 
    Alas, even the Lord's own people sometimes play the fool in this sad manner.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 18. Their soul abhors all manner of food. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Appetite departs from men when they are sick—the best of 
    food is nauseous to them, their stomach turns against it.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And they draw near unto the gates of death. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">From lack of food, and from the destructive power of 
    their malady, they slide gradually down until they lie at the door of the 
    grave; neither does the skill of the physician suffice to stay their 
    downward progress. As they cannot eat there is no support given to the 
    system, and as the disease rages their little strength is spent in pain and 
    misery. </p>
<p align="justify">Thus it is with souls afflicted with a sense of sin, they 
    cannot find comfort in the choicest promises—but turn away with loathing 
    even from the gospel, so that they gradually decay into the grave of 
    despair. The mercy is that though near the gates of death, they are not yet 
    inside the sepulcher.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 19. Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble.</p></b>

<p align="justify">They join the <i>praying legion </i>at last. Saul also is 
    among the prophets. The fool lays aside his vanity in prospect of the 
    shroud, and betakes himself to his knees. What a cure for the soul sickness 
    of body, is often made to be by the Lord's grace! </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And he saves them out of their distresses. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Prayer is as effectual on a sick bed as in the wilderness 
    or in prison; it may be tried in all places and circumstances with certain 
    result. We may pray about our bodily pains and weaknesses, and we may look 
    for answers too. When we have no appetite for food, we may have an appetite 
    for prayer. He who cannot feed on the word of God, may yet turn to God 
    himself and find mercy.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 20. He sent his word and healed them. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Man is not healed by medicine alone—but by the word which 
    proceeds out of the mouth of God is man restored from going down to the 
    grave. A word will do it, a word has done it thousands of times. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And delivered them from their destructions. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They escape though dangers had surrounded them, dangers 
    many and deadly. The word of the Lord has a great delivering power; he has 
    but to speak and the armies of death flee in an instant. </p>
<p align="justify">Sin-sick souls should remember the power of the Word, and 
    be much in hearing it and meditating upon it. </p>
<p align="justify">Spiritually considered, these verses describe a sin-sick 
    soul: foolish but yet aroused to a sense of guilt, it refuses comfort from 
    any and every quarter, and a lethargy of despair utterly paralyzes it. To 
    its own apprehension nothing remains but utter destruction in many forms; 
    the gates of death stand open before it, and it is, in its own apprehension, 
    hurried in that direction. Then is the soul driven to cry in the bitterness 
    of its grief unto the Lord—and Christ, the eternal Word, comes with healing 
    power in the direst extremity, saving to the uttermost.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 21. Oh that men would praise the Lord for his 
    goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It is marvelous that men can be restored from sickness 
    and yet refuse to bless the Lord. It would seem impossible that they should 
    forget such great mercy, for we should expect to see both themselves and the 
    friends to whom they are restored uniting in a lifelong act of thanksgiving.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Yet when ten are healed, it is seldom that more than one 
    returns to give glory to God. Alas, where are the nine? When a spiritual 
    cure is wrought by the great Physician, praise is one of the surest signs of 
    renewed health. <i>A mind rescued from the disease of sin and the weary 
    pains of conviction, must and will adore Jehovah Rophi, the healing God</i>—yet 
    it were well if there were a thousand times as much even of this.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 22. And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of 
    thanksgiving. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">In such a case let there be gifts and oblations as well 
    as words. Let the good Physician have his <i>fee of gratitude</i>. Let life 
    become a sacrifice to him who has prolonged it; let the deed of self-denying 
    gratitude be repeated again and again. There must be many cheerful 
    sacrifices to celebrate the marvelous blessing. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And declare his works with rejoicing. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Such things are worth telling, for the personal 
    declaration honors God, relieves ourselves, comforts others, and puts all 
    men in possession of facts concerning the divine goodness which they will 
    not be able to ignore.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 23. Those who go down to the sea in ships. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Navigation was so little practiced among the Israelites 
    that mariners were invested with a high mystery, and their craft was looked 
    upon as one of singular daring degree of and peril. Tales of the sea 
    thrilled all hearts with awe, and he who had been to Ophir or to Tarshish 
    and had returned alive was looked upon as a man of renown—an ancient mariner 
    to be listened to with reverent attention. Voyages were looked on as 
    descending to an abyss, "going <i>down </i>to the sea in ships"; whereas now 
    our bolder and more accustomed sailors talk of the "<i>high </i>seas." </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">That do business in great waters. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">If they had not had business to do, they would never have 
    ventured on the ocean, for we never read in the Scriptures of any man taking 
    his pleasure on the sea. So averse was the Israelitish mind to seafaring, 
    that we do not hear of even Solomon himself keeping a pleasure boat. The 
    Mediterranean was "the great sea" to David and his countrymen, and they 
    viewed those who had business upon it with no small degree of admiration.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 24. These see the works of the LORD. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Beyond the dwellers on the land they see the Lord's 
    greatest works, or at least such as stayers at home judge to be so when they 
    hear the report thereof. <i>Instead of the ocean proving to be a watery 
    wilderness, it is full of God's creatures</i>, and if we were to attempt to 
    escape from his presence by flying to the uttermost parts of it, we would 
    only rush into Jehovah's arms, and find ourselves in the very center of his 
    workshop.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And his wonders in the deep. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They see wonders in it and on it. It is in itself a 
    wonder and it swarms with wonders. Seamen, because they have fewer objects 
    around them, are more observant of those they have than landsmen are, and 
    hence they are said to see the wonders in the deep. </p>
<p align="justify">At the same time, the ocean really does contain many of 
    the more striking of God's creatures, and it is the scene of many of the 
    more tremendous of the physical phenomena by which the power and more 
    majesty of the Lord are revealed among men. </p>
<p align="justify">The chief wonders alluded to by the Psalmist are a sudden 
    storm and the calm which follows it. </p>
<p align="justify">All believers have not the same deep experience; but for 
    wise ends, that they may do business for him, the Lord sends some of his 
    saints to the sea of soul trouble, and there they see, as others do not, the 
    wonders of divine grace. Sailing over the deeps of inward depravity, the 
    waste waters of poverty, the billows of persecution, and the rough waves of 
    temptation—they need God above all others, and they find him.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 25. For he commands.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">His word is enough for anything, he has but to will it 
    and the tempest rages. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And raises the stormy wind. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It seemed to be asleep before—but it knows its Master's 
    bidding, and is up at once in all its fury. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Which lifts up the waves thereof. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The glassy surface of the sea is broken, and myriads of 
    white-heads appear and rage and toss themselves to and fro as the wind blows 
    upon them. Whereas they were lying down in quiet before, the waves rise in 
    their might and leap towards the sky as soon as the howling of the wind 
    awakens them. </p>
<p align="justify">Thus it needs but a word from God and the soul is in 
    troubled waters, tossed to and fro with a thousand afflictions. Doubts, 
    fears, terrors, anxieties lift their heads like so many angry waves, when 
    once the Lord allows the storm winds to beat upon us.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 26. They mount up to the Heaven. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Borne aloft on the crest of the wave, the sailors and 
    their vessels appear to climb the skies—but it is only for a moment, for 
    very soon in the trough of the sea they go down again to the depths. As if 
    their vessel were but a sea-bird, the mariners are tossed "up and down, up 
    and down, from the base of the wave to the billow's crown." </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Their soul is melted because of trouble.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Weary, wet, dispirited, hopeless of escape—their heart is 
    turned to water, and they seem to have no manhood left.</p>
<p align="justify">Those who have been on the spiritual deep in one of the 
    great storms which occasionally agitate the soul know what this verse means. 
    In these spiritual cyclones presumption alternates with despair, 
    indifference with agony. No heart is left for anything, courage is gone, 
    hope is almost dead. Such an experience is as real as the tossing of a 
    literal tempest and far more painful. Some of us have weathered many such an 
    internal hurricane, and have indeed seen the Lord's wondrous works.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 27. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a 
    drunken man. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The violent motion of the vessel prevents their keeping 
    their legs, and their fears drive them out of all power to use their brains, 
    and therefore they look like intoxicated men. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And are at their wit's end. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">What more can they do? They have used every expedient 
    known to navigation—but the ship is so strained and beaten about that they 
    know not how to keep her afloat. </p>
<p align="justify">Here too the spiritual mariner's log agrees with that of 
    the sailor on the sea. We have staggered frightfully! We could stand to 
    nothing and hold by nothing. We knew not what to do, and could have done 
    nothing if we had known it. We were as men distracted, and felt as if 
    destruction itself would be better than our horrible state of suspense. As 
    for wit and wisdom, they were clean washed out of us, we felt ourselves to 
    be altogether bewildered.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 28. Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Though at their wit's end, they had wit enough to pray; 
    their heart was melted, and it ran out in cries for help. This was well and 
    ended well, for it is written, </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And he brought them out of their distresses. </p></b>Prayer 
    is good in a storm. We may pray staggering and reeling, and pray when we are 
    at our wit's end. God will hear us amid the thunder, and answer us out of 
    the storm. He brought their distresses upon the mariners, and therefore they 
    did well to turn to him for the removal of them; nor did they look in vain.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 29. He makes the storm a calm. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He reveals his power in the sudden and marvelous 
    transformations which occur at his bidding. He commanded the storm—and now 
    he ordains a calm. <i>God is in all natural phenomena, and we do well to 
    recognize his working. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">So that the waves thereof are still. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They bow in silence at his feet. Where huge billows 
    leaped aloft—there is now scarcely a ripple to be seen. When God makes peace 
    it is peace indeed, the peace of God which passes all understanding. He can 
    in an instant change the condition of a man's mind, so that it shall seem an 
    absolute miracle to him that he has passed so suddenly from hurricane to 
    calm. O that the Lord would thus work in the reader, should his heart be 
    storm-beaten with outward troubles or inward fears. Lord, say the word and 
    peace will come at once.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 30. Then are they glad because they are quiet. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">No one can appreciate this verse unless he has been in a 
    storm at sea. No music can be sweeter than the rattling of the chain as the 
    shipmen let down the anchor; and no place seems more desirable than the 
    little cove, or the wide bay, in which the ship rests in peace. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">So he brings them unto their desired haven. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The rougher the voyage the more the mariners long for 
    port. <i>Heaven becomes more and more "a desired haven", as our trials 
    multiply. </i>By storms and by favorable breezes, though tempest and fair 
    weather, the great Pilot and Ruler of the sea brings mariners to port, and 
    his people to Heaven. He must have the glory of the successful voyage of 
    time, and when we are moored in the river of life above, we shall take care 
    that his praises are not forgotten. </p>
<p align="justify">We would long ago have been wrecked if it had not been 
    for his preserving hand, and our only hope of outliving the storms of the 
    future is based upon his wisdom, faithfulness and power. Our heavenly haven 
    shall ring with shouts of grateful joy when once we reach its blessed shore.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 31. Oh that men would praise the Lord for his 
    goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Let the sea sound forth Jehovah's praises because of his 
    delivering grace. As the sailor touches the shore, let him lift the solemn 
    hymn to Heaven, and let others who see him rescued from the jaws of death 
    unite in his thanksgiving.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 32. Let them exalt him also in the congregation of 
    the people.</p></b> Thanks for such mercies should be given in public in the 
    place where men congregate for worship. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And praise him in the assembly of the elders. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The praise should be presented with great solemnity in 
    the presence of men of years, experience, and influence. High and weighty 
    service should be rendered for great and distinguished favors, and therefore 
    let the sacrifice be presented with due decorum and with grave seriousness.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Often when men hear of a narrow escape from shipwreck 
    they pass over the matter with a careless remark about good luck—but it 
    should never be thus jested with. </p>
<p align="justify">When a heart has been in great spiritual storms and has 
    at last found peace, there will follow as a duty and a privilege the 
    acknowledgment of the Lord's mercy before his people, and it is well that 
    this should be done in the presence of those who hold office in the church, 
    and who from their riper years are better able to appreciate the testimony.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 33. He turns rivers into a wilderness, and the 
    water springs into dry ground.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">When the Lord deals with rebellious men he can soon 
    deprive them of those blessings of which they feel most assured. Their 
    rivers and perennial springs they look upon as certain never to be taken 
    from them—but the Lord at a word can deprive them even of these. </p>
<p align="justify">In hot climates after long droughts streams of water 
    utterly fail, and even springs cease to flow, and this also has happened in 
    other parts of the world when great convulsions of the earth's surface have 
    occurred. </p>
<p align="justify">In providence, this physical catastrophe finds its 
    counterpart when business ceases to yield profit and sources of <i>wealth
    </i>are made to fail; as also when <i>health </i>and strength are taken 
    away; when friendly aids are withdrawn; and comfortable associations are 
    broken up. </p>
<p align="justify">So, too, in soul matters, <i>the most prosperous 
    ministries may become dry</i>, the most delightful meditations cease to 
    benefit us, and the most fruitful religious exercises grow void of the 
    refreshment of grace which they formerly yielded. Since</p>
<p align="justify">"It is God who lifts our comforts high,<br/>
 Or sinks them in the grave."</p>
<p align="justify">it behooves us to walk before him with reverential 
    gratitude, and <i>so to live that it may not become imperative upon him to 
    afflict us.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 34. A fruitful land into barrenness. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This has been done in many instances, and notably in the 
    case of the psalmist's own country, which was once the glory of all lands 
    and is now almost a desert. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">For the wickedness of them that dwell therein. </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">Sin is at the bottom of sorrow. It first made the ground 
    sterile in father Adam's day, and it continues to have a blighting effect 
    upon all that it touches</p></i>. If we have not the salt of holiness, we shall 
    soon receive the salt of barrenness, for the text in the Hebrew is, "a 
    fruitful land into saltiness." 
<i>
<p align="justify">If we will not yield the Lord a harvest of obedience, he 
    may forbid the soil to yield us a harvest of bread</p></i>, and what then? If we 
    turn good into evil can we wonder if the Lord pays us in kind, and returns 
    our baseness into our own bosoms? 
<i>
<p align="justify">Many a barren church owes its present sad estate to its 
    inconsistent behavior, and many a barren Christian has come into this 
    mournful condition by a careless, unsanctified walk before the Lord. </p></i>Let 
    not saints who are now useful run the risk of enduring the loss of their 
    mercies—but let them be watchful that all things may go well with them.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 35. He turns the wilderness into pools of water.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">With another turn of his hand he more than restores that 
    which in judgment he took away. He does his work of mercy on a royal scale, 
    for a deep lake is seen where before there was only a sandy waste. It is not 
    by natural laws, working by some innate force, that this wonder is 
    wrought—but by himself. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And dry ground into water springs. </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">Continuance</p></i>, <i>abundance</i>, and <i>perpetual 
    freshness </i>are all implied in water springs, and these are created where 
    all was dry. This wonder of mercy is the precise reversal of the deed of 
    judgment, and wrought by the selfsame hand. 
<i>
<p align="justify">Even thus in the church, and in each individual saint, 
    the mercy of the Lord soon works wonderful changes where restoring and 
    renewing grace begin their gracious work.</p></i><b> </b>O that we might see 
    this verse fulfilled in all around us, and within our own hearts. Then would 
    these words serve us for an exclamation of grateful astonishment, and a song 
    of well deserved praise.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 36. And there he makes the hungry to dwell, where 
    none could dwell before. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They will appreciate the change and prize his grace; as 
    the barrenness of the land caused their hunger so will its fertility banish 
    it forever, and they will settle down a happy and thankful people to bless 
    God for every handful of grain which the land yields to them. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">None are so ready to return a revenue of praise to God 
    for great mercies, as those who have known the lack of them.</p></i> Hungry 
    souls make sweet music when the Lord fills them with his gracious gifts. Are 
    we hungry? <i>Or are we satisfied with the husks of this poor, swinish 
    world? 
</i><b>
<p align="justify">That they may prepare a city for habitation. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">When the earth is watered and men cultivate it, cities 
    spring up and teem with inhabitants. Just so, when grace abounds where sin 
    formerly reigned, hearts find peace and dwell in God's love as in a strong 
    city. The church is built up where once all was a waste, when the Lord 
    causes the broad rivers and streams of gospel grace to flow forth.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 37. And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which 
    may yield fruits of increase. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Men work when God works. His blessing encourages the 
    sower, cheers the planter, and rewards the laborer. Not only <i>necessities
    </i>but <i>luxuries </i>are enjoyed, wine as well as corn, when the heavens 
    are caused to yield the needed rain to fill the watercourses. </p>
<p align="justify">Divine visitations bring great spiritual riches, foster 
    varied works of faith and labors of love, and cause every good fruit to 
    abound to our comfort and to God's praise. When God sends the blessing it 
    does not supersede—but encourages and develops human exertion. Paul plants, 
    Apollos waters—and God gives the increase.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 38. He blesses them also, so that they are 
    multiplied greatly; and suffers not their cattle to decrease. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">God's blessing is everything. It not only makes men 
    happy—but it makes men themselves, by causing men to be multiplied upon the 
    earth. When the Lord made the first pair he blessed them and said "be 
    fruitful and multiply", and here he restores the primeval blessing. </p>
<p align="justify">Observe that beasts as well as men fare well when God 
    favors his people: they share with men in the goodness or severity of divine 
    providence. Plagues and pests are warded off from the flock and the herd, 
    when the Lord means well towards a people; but when chastisement is 
    intended, the flocks and herds rot from off the face of the earth. <i>O that 
    nations in the day of their prosperity would but own the gracious hand of 
    God, for it is to his blessing that they owe their all.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 39. Again they are diminished and brought low 
    through oppression, affliction, and sorrow. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">As they change in character, so do their circumstances 
    alter. Under the old dispensation, this was very clearly to be observed. 
    Israel's ups and downs were the direct consequences of her sins and 
    repentance. </p>
<p align="justify">Trials are of various kinds; here we have three words for 
    affliction, and there are numbers more. God has many rods and we have many 
    smarts; and all because we have many sins. Nations and churches soon 
    diminish in number when they are diminished in grace. If we are low in love 
    to God, it is small wonder that he brings us low in other respects. God can 
    reverse the order of our prosperity; therefore let us walk before him with 
    great tenderness of spirit, conscious of our dependence upon his smile.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verses 40-41. But he lifted the needy out of their 
    affliction and increased their families like flocks. The upright see and 
    rejoice, but all the wicked shut their mouths. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">In these two verses we see how the Lord at will turns the 
    wheel of providence. Paying no respect to man's imaginary grandeur, he puts 
    princes down and makes them wander in banishment as they had made their 
    captives wander when they drove them from land to land. </p>
<p align="justify">At the same time, having ever a tender regard for the 
    poor and needy, the Lord delivers the distressed and sets them in a position 
    of comfort and happiness. </p>
<p align="justify">This is to be seen upon the roll of history again and 
    again, and in spiritual experience we remark its counterpart: <i>the 
    self-sufficient are made to despise themselves and search in vain for help 
    in the wilderness of their nature, while poor convicted souls are added to 
    the Lord's family and dwell in safety as the sheep of his fold.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 42. The righteous shall see it, and rejoice. </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">Divine providence causes joy to God's true people; they 
    see the hand of the Lord in all things, and delight to study the ways of his 
    justice and of his grace.</p>
</i><b>
<p align="justify">And all iniquity shall stop her mouth. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">What can she say? God's providence is often so conclusive 
    in its arguments of fact, that there is no replying or questioning. It is 
    not long that the impudence of ungodliness can be quiet—but when God's 
    judgments are abroad it is driven to hold its tongue.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 43. Whoever is wise, let him heed these things and 
    consider the great love of the LORD. </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">Those who notice providence shall never be long without a 
    providence notice</p></i>. It is wise to observe what the Lord does, for he is 
    wonderful in counsel; has given us eyes to see with, and it is foolish to 
    close them when there is most to observe. But we must observe wisely, 
    otherwise we may soon confuse ourselves and others with hasty reflections 
    upon the dealings of the Lord. 
<p align="justify">In a thousand ways the loving-kindness of the Lord is 
    shown, and if we will prudently watch, we shall come to a better 
    understanding of it. To understand the delightful attribute of 
    loving-kindness is an attainment as pleasant it is profitable: those who are 
    proficient scholars in this are will be among sweetest singers to the glory 
    of Jehovah.</p>
