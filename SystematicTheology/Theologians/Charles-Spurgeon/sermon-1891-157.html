          1. And such or so important a dispensation He did not bring about by
          means of the creations of others, but by His own; neither by those
          things which were created out of ignorance and defect, but by those
          which had their substance from the wisdom and power of His Father. For
          He was neither unrighteous, so that He should covet the property of
          another; nor needy, that He could not by His own means impart life to
          His own, and make use of His own creation for the salvation of man.
          For indeed the creation could not have sustained Him [on the cross],
          if He had sent forth [simply by commission] what was the fruit of
          ignorance and defect. Now we have repeatedly shown that the incarnate
          Word of God was suspended upon a tree, and even the very heretics do
          acknowledge that He was crucified. How, then, could the fruit of
          ignorance and defect sustain Him who contains the knowledge of all
          things, and is true and perfect? Or how could that creation which was
          concealed from the Father, and far removed from Him, have sustained
          His Word? And if this world were made by the angels (it matters not
          whether we suppose their ignorance or their cognizance of the Supreme
          God), when the Lord declared, "For I am in the Father, and the Father
          in Me," how could this workmanship of the angels have borne to be
          burdened at once with the Father and the Son? How, again, could that
          creation which is beyond the Pleroma have contained Him who contains
          the entire Pleroma? Inasmuch, then, as all these things are impossible
          and incapable of proof, that preaching of the Church is alone true
          [which proclaims] that His own creation bare Him, which subsists by
          the power, the skill, and the wisdom of God; which is sustained,
          indeed, after an invisible manner by the Father, but, on the contrary,
          after a visible manner it bore His Word: and this is the true [Word].
        </p>
        <p>
          2. For the Father bears the creation and His own Word simultaneously,
          and the Word borne by the Father grants the Spirit to all as the
          Father wills. To some He gives after the manner of creation what is
          made; but to others [He gives] after the manner of adoption, that is,
          what is from God, namely generation. And thus one God the Father is
          declared, who is above all, and through all, and in all. The Father is
          indeed above all, and He is the Head of Christ; but the Word is
          through all things, and is Himself the Head of the Church; while the
          Spirit is in us all, and He is the living water, which the Lord grants
          to those who rightly believe in Him, and love Him, and who know that
          "there is one Father, who is above all, and through all, and in us
          all." And to these things does John also, the disciple of the Lord,
          bear witness, when he speaks thus in the Gospel: "In the beginning was
          the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. This was in
          the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him
          was nothing made." And then he said of the Word Himself: "He was in
          the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not.
          To His own things He came, and His own people received Him not.
          However, as many as did receive Him, to these gave He power to become
          the sons of God, to those that believe in His name." And again,
          showing the dispensation with regard to His human nature, John said:
          "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us." And in continuation
          he says, "And we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten
          by the Father, full of grace and truth." He thus plainly points out to
          those willing to hear, that is, to those having ears, that there is
          one God, the Father over all, and one Word of God, who is through all,
          by whom all things have been made; and that this world belongs to Him,
          and was made by Him, according to the Father's will, and not by
          angels; nor by apostasy, defect, and ignorance; nor by any power of
          Prunicus, whom certain of them also call "the Mother;" nor by any
          other maker of the world ignorant of the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. For the Creator of the world is truly the Word of God: and this is
          our Lord, who in the last times was made man, existing in this world,
          and who in an invisible manner contains all things created, and is
          inherent in the entire creation, since the Word of God governs and
          arranges all things; and therefore He came to His own in a visible
          manner, and was made flesh, and hung upon the tree, that He might sum
          up all things in Himself. "And His own peculiar people did not receive
          Him," as Moses declared this very thing among the people: "And thy
          life shall be hanging before thine eyes, and thou wilt not believe thy
          life." Those therefore who did not receive Him did not receive life.
          "But to as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the
          sons of God." For it is He who has power from the Father over all
          things, since He is the Word of God, and very man, communicating with
          invisible beings after the manner of the intellect, and appointing a
          law observable to the outward senses, that all things should continue
          each in its own order; and He reigns manifestly over things visible
          and pertaining to men; and brings in just judgment and worthy upon
          all; as David also, clearly pointing to this, says, "Our God shall
          openly come, and will not keep silence." Then he shows also the
          judgment which is brought in by Him, saying, "A fire shall burn in His
          sight, and a strong tempest shall rage round about Him. He shall call
          upon the heaven from above, and the earth, to judge His people."<br />
