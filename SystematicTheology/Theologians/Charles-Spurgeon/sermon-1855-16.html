        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.17)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, April 1, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand</p>
        <p>
          "The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him;
          but his bow abode in strength; and the arms of his hands were made
          strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; from thence is the
          shepherd, the stone of Israel." -- Genesis 49:23,24.
        </p>
        <p>
          It must have been a fine sight to see the hoary-headed Jacob sitting
          up in his bed whilst he bestowed his parting benediction upon his
          twelve sons. He had been noble in many instances during his life -- at
          the sleeping place of Bethel, the brook of Jabbok, and the halting of
          Peniel. He had been a glorious old man; one before whom we might bow
          down with reverence, and truly say, "There were giants in those days."
          But his closing scene was the best. I think if ever he stood out more
          illustrious than at any other time, if his head was at any one season
          more than another, encircled with a halo of glory, it was when he came
          to die. Like the sun at setting, he seemed then to be the greater in
          brilliance, tinging the clouds of his weakness with the glory of grace
          within. Like good wine, which runs clear to the very bottom, unalloyed
          by dregs, so did Jacob till his dying hour continue to sing of love,
          of mercy, and of goodness, past and future. Like the swan, which (as
          old writers say) singeth not all its life until it comes to die, so
          the old patriarch remained silent as a songster for many years; but
          when he stretched himself on his last couch of rest, he stayed himself
          up in his bed, turned his burning eye from one to another, and
          although with a hoarse and faltering voice, he sang a sonnet upon each
          of his offspring, such as earthly poets, uninspired, cannot attempt to
          imitate. Looking upon his son Reuben, a tear was in his eye, for he
          recollected Reuben's sin; he passed over Simeon and Levi, giving some
          slight rebuke; upon the others he sung a verse of praise, as his eyes
          saw into the future history of the tribes. By-and-by his voice failed
          him, and the good old man, with long-drawn breath, with eyes pregnant
          with celestial fire, and heart big with heaven, lifted his voice to
          God, and said, "I have waited for thy salvation, O God," rested a
          moment on his pillow, and then again sitting up, recommenced the
          strain, passing briefly by the names of each. But oh! when he came to
          Joseph, his youngest son but one -- when he looked on him, I picture
          that old man as the tears ran down his cheeks. There stood Joseph,
          with all his mother Rachel in his eyes -- that dear loved wife of his
          -- there he stood, the boy for whom that mother had prayed with all
          the eagerness of an Eastern wife. For a long twenty years she had
          tarried a barren woman and kept no house, but then she was a joyful
          mother, and she called her son "Increase." Oh! how she loved the boy;
          and for that mother's sake, though she had been buried for some years,
          and hidden under the cold sod, old Jacob loved him too. But more than
          that, he loved him for his troubles. He was parted from him to be sold
          into Egypt. His father recollected Joseph's trials in the round-house
          and the dungeon, and remembered his royal dignity as prince of Egypt;
          and now, with a full burst of harmony, as if the music of heaven had
          united with his own, as when the widened river meets the sea, and the
          tide coming up doth amalgamate with the stream that cometh down, and
          swelleth into a broad expanse, so did the glory of heaven meet the
          rapture of his earthly feelings, and giving vent to his soul , he
          sung, "Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;
          whose branches run over the wall; the archers have sorely grieved him,
          and shot at him, and hated him; but his bow abode in strength, and the
          arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of
          Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel); even by the
          God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall
          bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that
          lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb; the blessings
          of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors,
          unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills; they shall be on the
          head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate
          from his brethren." What a splendid stanza with which to close! He has
          only one more blessing to give; but surely this was the richest which
          he conferred on Joseph.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joseph is dead, but the Lord has his Josephs now. There are some still
          who understand by experience -- and that is the best kind of
          understanding -- the meaning of this passage, "The archers have sorely
          grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him; but his bow abode in
          strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of
          the mighty God of Jacob."
        </p>
        <p>
          There are four things for us to consider this morning. First of all,
          the cruel attack -- "the archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at
          him, and hated him;" secondly, the shielded warrior -- "but his bow
          abode in strength;" thirdly, his secret strength -- "the arms of his
          hands were made strong by the mighty power of the God of Jacob;" and
          fourthly, the glorious parallel drawn between Joseph and Christ --
          "from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, we commence with THE CRUEL ATTACK. "The archers have
          sorely grieved him." Joseph's enemies were archers. The original has
          it, "masters of the arrows;" that is, men who were well skilled in the
          use of the arrows. Though all weapons are alike approved by the
          warrior in his thirst for blood, there seems something more cowardly
          in the attack of the archer than in that of the swordsman. The
          swordsman plants himself near you, foot to foot, and lets you defend
          yourself, and deal your blows against him; but the archer stands at a
          distance, hides himself in ambuscade, and, without you knowing it, the
          arrow comes whizzing through the air, and perhaps penetrates your
          heart. Just so are the enemies of God's people. They very seldom come
          foot to foot with us; they will not show their faces before us; they
          hate the light, they love darkness; they dare not come and openly
          accuse us to our face, for then we could reply; but they shoot the bow
          from a distance, so that we cannot answer them; cowardly and dastardly
          as they are, they forge their arrow-heads, and aim them, winged with
          hell-birds feathers, at the hearts of God's people. The archers sorely
          grieved poor Joseph. Let us consider who are the archers who so
          cruelly shot at him. First, there were the archers of envy; secondly,
          the archers of temptation; and thirdly, the archers of slander and
          calumny.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, Joseph had to endure the archers of ENVY. When he was a boy,
          his father loved him. The youth was fair and beautiful; in person he
          was to be admired; moreover, he had a mind that was gigantic, and an
          intellect that was lofty; but, best of all, in him dwelt the Spirit of
          the living God. He was one who talked with God; a youth of piety and
          prayerfulness; beloved of God, even more than he was by his earthly
          father. O! how his father loved him! for in his fond affection, he
          made him a princely coat of many colors, and treated him better than
          the others -- a natural but foolish way of showing his fondness.
          Therefore his brethren hated him. Full often did they jeer at the
          youthful Joseph, when he retired to his prayers; when he was with them
          at a distance from his father's house, he was their drudge, their
          slave; the taunt, the jeer, did often wound his heart, and the young
          child endured much secret sorrow. On an ill day, as it happened, he
          was with them at a distance from home, and they thought to slay him;
          but upon the entreaty of Reuben, they put him into a pit, until, as
          Providence would have it, the Ishmaelites did pass that way. They then
          sold him for the price of a slave, stripped him of his coat, and sent
          him naked, they knew not, and they cared not, whither, so long as he
          might be out of their way, and no longer provoke their envy and their
          anger. Oh! the agonies he felt -- parted from his father, losing his
          brethren, without a friend, dragged away by cruel man-sellers, chained
          upon a camel it may be, with fetters on his hands. Those who have
          borne the gyves and fetters, those who have felt that they were not
          free men, that they had not liberty, might tell how sorely the archers
          grieved him when they shot at him the arrows of their envy. He became
          a slave, sold from his country, dragged from all he loved. Farewell to
          home and all its pleasures -- farewell to a father's smiles and tender
          cares. He must be a slave, and toil where the slave's task-master
          makes him; he must be stripped in the streets, he must be beaten, he
          must be scourged, he must be reduced from the man to the animal, from
          the free man to the slave. Truly the archers sorely shot at him. And,
          my brethren, do you hope, if you are the Lord's Josephs, that you
          shall escape envy? I tell you, nay; that green-eyed monster, envy,
          lives in London as well as elsewhere, and he creeps into God's church,
          moreover. Oh! it is hardest of all, to be envied by one's brethren. If
          the devil hates us, we can bear it; if the foes of God's truth speak
          ill of us, we buckle up our harness, and say, "Away, away, to the
          conflict." But when the friends within the house slander us; when
          brethren who should uphold us, turn our foes; and when they try to
          tread down their younger brethren; then, sirs, there is some meaning
          in the passage, "The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him,
          and hated him." But, blessed be God's name, it is sweet to be informed
          that "his bow abode in strength." None of you can be the people of God
          without provoking envy; and the better you are, the more you will be
          hated. The ripest fruit is most pecked by the birds, and the blossoms
          that have been longest on the tree, are the most easily blown down by
          the wind. But fear not; you have naught to do with what man shall say
          of you. If God loves you, man will hate you; if God honors you, man
          will dishonor you. But recollect, could ye wear chains of iron for
          Christ's sake, ye should wear chains of gold in heaven; could ye have
          rings of burning iron round your waists, ye should have your brow
          rimmed with gold in glory; for blessed are ye when men shall say all
          manner of evil against you falsely, for Christ's name's sake; for so
          persecuted they the prophets that were before you. The first archers
          were the archers of envy.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But a worse trial than this was to overtake him. The archers of
          TEMPTATION shot at him. Here I know not how to express myself. I would
          that some one more qualified to speak were here, that he might tell
          you the tale of Joseph's trial, and Joseph's triumph. Sold to a master
          who soon discovered his value, Joseph was made the bailiff of the
          house, and the manager of the household. His wanton mistress fixed her
          adulterous love on him; and he, being continually in her presence, was
          perpetually, day by day, solicited by her to evil deeds. Constantly
          did he refuse; still enduring a martyrdom at the slow fire of her
          enticements. On one eventful day she grasped him, seeking to compel
          him to crime; but he, like a true hero as he was, said to her, "How
          can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?" Like a wise
          warrior, he knew that in such a case fleeing was the better part of
          valor. He heard a voice in his ears: "Fly, Joseph, fly; there remains
          no way of victory but flight;" and out he fled, leaving his garment
          with his adulterous mistress. Oh, I say in all the annals of heroism
          there is not one that shall surpass this. You know it is opportunity
          that makes a man criminal; and he had abundant opportunity; but
          importunity will drive most men astray. To be haunted day by day by
          solicitations of the softest kind -- to be tempted hour by hour -- oh!
          it needs a strength super-angelic, a might more that human, a strength
          which only God can grant, for a young man thus to cleanse his way, and
          take heed thereto according to God's word. He might have reasoned
          within himself, "Should I submit and yield, there lies before me a
          life of ease and pleasure; I shall be exalted, I shall be rich. She
          shall prevail over her husband, to cover me with honors; but should I
          still adhere to my integrity, I shall be cast into prison, I shall be
          thrown into the dungeon; there awaits me nothing but shame and
          disgrace." Oh! there was a power indeed within that heart of his;
          there was an inconceivable might, which made him turn away with
          unutterable disgust, with fear and trembling, while he said, "How can
          I? how can I -- God's Joseph -- how can I -- other men might, but how
          can I do this great wickedness and sin against God." Truly the archers
          sorely grieved him and shot at him; but his bow abode in strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Then another host of archers assailed him; these were the archers
          of MALICIOUS CALUMNY. Seeing that he would not yield to temptation,
          his mistress falsely accused him to her husband, and his lord,
          believing the voice of his wife, cast him into prison. It was a
          marvelous providence that he did not put him to death; for Potiphar,
          his master, was the chief of the slaughtermen; he had only to call in
          a soldier, who would have cut him in pieces on the spot. But he cast
          him into prison. There was poor Joseph. His character ruined in the
          eyes of man, and very likely looked upon with scorn even in the
          prison-house; base criminals went away from him as if they thought him
          viler than themselves, as if they were angels in comparison with him.
          Oh! it is no easy thing to feel your character gone, to think that you
          are slandered, that things are said of you that are untrue. Many a
          man's heart has been broken by this, when nothing else could make him
          yield. The archers sorely grieved him when he was so maligned -- so
          slandered. O child of God, dost thou expect to escape these archers?
          Wilt thou never be slandered? Shalt thou never be calumniated? It is
          the lot of God's servants, in proportion to their zeal, to be evil
          spoken of. Remember the noble Whitefield, how he stood and was the
          butt of all the jeers and scoffs of half an age; while his only answer
          was a blameless life.
        </p>
        <p>"And he who forged, and he who threw the dart,</p>
        <p>Had each a brother's interest in his heart."</p>
        <p>
          They reviled him and imputed to him crimes that Sodom never knew. So
          shall it be always with those who preach God's truth, and all the
          followers of Christ -- they must all expect it; but, blessed be God,
          they have not said worse things of us than they said of our Master.
          What have they laid to our charge? They may have said, "he is drunken
          and a wine-bibber;" but they have not said, "he hath a devil." They
          have accused us of being mad, so was it said of Paul. Oh, holy
          infatuation, heavenly furor, would that we could bite others until
          they had the same madness. We think, if to go to heaven be mad, we
          will not choose to be wise; we see no wisdom in preferring hell; we
          can see no great prudence in despising and hating God's truth. If to
          serve God be vile, we purpose to be viler still. Ah! friends, some now
          present know this verse by heart, "The archers have sorely grieved
          him, and shot at him, and hated him." Expect it; do not think it a
          strange thing; all God's people must have it. There are no royal roads
          to heaven -- they are paths of trial and trouble; the archers will
          shoot at you as long as you are on this side the flood.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We have seen these archers shoot their flights of arrows; we will
          now go up the hill a little, behind a rock, to look at the SHIELDED
          WARRIOR and see how his courage is while the archers have sorely
          grieved him. What is he doing? "His bow abideth in strength." Let us
          picture God's favorite. The archers are down below. There is a parapet
          of rock before him; now and then he looks over it to see what the
          archers are about, but generally he keeps behind. In heavenly security
          he is set upon a rock, careless of all below. Let us follow the track
          of the wild goat and behold the warrior in his fastness.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we notice that he has a bow himself, for we read that "his bow
          abode in strength." He could have retaliated if he pleased, but he was
          very quiet and would not combat with them. Had he pleased, he might
          have drawn his bow with all his strength, and sent his weapon to their
          hearts with far greater precision that they had ever done to him. But
          mark the warrior's quietness. There he rests, stretching his mighty
          limbs; his bow abode in strength; he seemed to say, "Rage on, aye, let
          you arrows spend themselves, empty your quivers on me, let your
          bow-strings be worn out, and let the wood be broken with its constant
          bending; here am I, stretching myself in safe repose; my bow abides in
          strength; I have other work to do besides shooting at you; my arrows
          are against yon foes of God, the enemies of the Most High; I cannot
          waste an arrow on such pitiful sparrows as you are; ye are birds
          beneath my noble shot; I would not waste an arrow on you." Thus he
          remains behind the rock and despises them all. "His bow abideth in
          strength."
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark well his quietness. His bow "abideth." It is not rattling, it is
          not always moving, but it abides, it is quite still; he takes no
          notice of the attack. The archers sorely grieved Joseph, but his bow
          was not turned against them, it abode in strength. He turned not his
          bow on them. He rested while they raged. Doth the moon stay herself to
          lecture every dog that bayeth at her? Doth the lion turn aside to rend
          each cur that barketh at him? Do the stars cease to shine because the
          nightingales reprove them for their dimness? Doth the sun stop in its
          course because of the officious cloud which veils it: Or doth the
          river stay because the willow dippeth its leaves into its waters? Ah!
          no; God's universe moves on, and if men will oppose it, it heeds them
          not. It is as God hath made it; it is working together for good, and
          it shall not be stayed by the censure nor moved on by the praise of
          man. Let your bows, my brethren, abide. Do not be in a hurry to set
          yourselves right. God will take care of you. Leave yourselves alone;
          only be very valiant for the Lord God of Israel; be steadfast in the
          truth of Jesus and your bow shall abide.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we must not forget the next word. "His bow abode IN STRENGTH."
          Though his bow was quiet it was not because it was broken. Joseph's
          bow was like that of William the Conqueror; no man could bend it but
          Joseph himself; it abode in "strength." I see the warrior bending his
          bow -- how with his mighty arms he pulls it down and draws the string
          to make it ready. His bow abode in strength; it did not snap, it did
          not start aside. His chastity was his bow, and he did not lose that;
          his faith was his bow, and that did not yield, it did not break; his
          courage was his bow, and that did not fail him; his character, his
          honesty was his bow, nor did he cast it away. Some men are so very
          particular about reputation. They think, "surely, surely, surely they
          shall lose their character." Well, well, if we do not lose them
          through our own fault, we never need care about anybody else. You know
          there is not a man that stands at all prominent, but what any fool in
          the world can set afloat some bad tale against him. It is a great deal
          easier to set a story afloat than to stop it. If you want truth to go
          round the world you must hire an express train to pull it; but if you
          want a lie to go round the world, it will fly: it is as light as a
          feather, and a breath will carry it. It is well said in the old
          proverb, "A lie will go round the world while truth is pulling its
          boots on." Nevertheless, it does not injure us; for if light as
          feather it travels as fast, its effect is just about as tremendous as
          the effect of down, when it is blown against the walls of a castle; it
          produces no damage whatever, on account of its lightness and
          littleness. Fear not, Christian. Let slander fly, let envy send forth
          its forked tongue, let it hiss at you, your bow shall abide in
          strength. Oh! shielded warrior, remain quiet, fear no ill; but, like
          the eagle in its lofty eyrie, look thou down upon the fowlers in the
          plain, turn thy bold eye upon them and say, "Shoot ye may, but your
          shots will not reach half-way to the pinnacle where I stand. Waste
          your powder upon me if ye will; I am beyond your reach." Then clap
          your wings, mount to heaven, and there laugh them to scorn, for ye
          have made your refuge God, and shall find a most secure abode.

          III. The third thing in our text is THE SECRET STRENGTH. "The arms of
          his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob."
          First, notice, concerning his strength, that it was real strength. It
          says, "the arms of his hands," not his hands only. You know some
          people can do a great deal with their hands, but then it is often
          fictitious power; there is no might in the arm -- there is no muscle;
          but of Joseph it is said; "the arms of his hands were made strong. It
          was real potency, true muscle, real sinew, real nerve. It was not
          simply sleight of hand -- the power of moving his finger very swiftly
          -- but the arms of his hands were made strong. Now that strength which
          God gives to his Josephs is real strength; it is not a boasted valor,
          a fiction, a thing of which men talk, an airy dream, an unsubstantial
          unreality, but it is real strength. I should not like to have a combat
          with one of God's Josephs. I should find their blows very heavy. I
          fear a Christian's strokes more than any other man's for he has bone
          and sinew, and smites hard. Let the foes of the church expect a hard
          struggle if they attack an heir of life. Mightier than giants are men
          of the race of heaven; should they once arouse themselves to battle
          they could laugh at the spear and the habergeon. But they are a
          patient generation, enduring ills without resenting them suffering
          scorn without reviling the scoffer. Their triumph is to come when
          their enemies shall receive the vengeance due; then shall it be seen
          by an assembled world that the "little flock" were men of high estate,
          and the "offscouring of all things" were verily men of real strength
          and dignity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though the world perceive it not, the favored Joseph has real
          strength, not in his hands only, but in his arms -- real might, real
          power. O ye foes of God, ye think God's people are despicable and
          powerless; but know that they have true strength from the omnipotence
          of their Father, a might substantial and divine. Your own shall melt
          away, and droop and die, like the snow upon the low mountain top, when
          the sun shines upon it, it melteth into water; but our vigor shall
          abide like the snow on the summit of the Alps, undiminished for ages.
          It is real strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then observe that the strength of God's Joseph is divine strength. His
          arms were made strong by God. Why does one of God's ministers preach
          the gospel powerfully? Because God gives him assistance. Why does
          Joseph stand against temptation? Because God gives him aid. The
          strength of a Christian is divine strength. My brethren, I am more and
          more persuaded every day that the sinner has no power of himself,
          except that which is given him from above. I know that if I were to
          stand with my foot upon the golden threshold of heaven's portal, if I
          could put this thumb upon the latch, I could not open that door, after
          having gone so far towards heaven, unless I had still supernatural
          power communicated to me in that moment. If I had a stone to lift, to
          work my own salvation, without God's help to do that, I must be lost,
          even though it were so little. There is naught that we can do without
          the power of God. All true strength is divine. As the light cometh
          from the sun, as the shower from heaven; so doth spiritual strength
          come from the Father lights, with whom there is neither variableness
          nor shadow of a turning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: I would have you notice in the text in what a blessedly
          familiar way God gives this strength to Joseph. It say, "the arms of
          his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob."
          Thus it represents God as putting his hands on Joseph's hands, placing
          his arms on Joseph's arms. In old times, when every boy had to be
          trained up to archery, if his father were worth so many pounds a year,
          you might see the father putting his hands on his boy's hands and
          pulling the bow for him, saying, "there, my son, in this manner draw
          the bow." So the text represents God as putting his hand on the hand
          of Joseph, and laying his broad arm along the arm of his chosen child,
          that he might be made strong. Like as a father teacheth his children;
          so the Lord teaches them that fear him. He puts his arms upon them. As
          Elijah laid with his mouth upon the child's mouth, with his hand upon
          the child's hand, with his foot upon the child's foot, so does "God
          put his mouth to his children's mouth, his hand to his ministers'
          hand, his foot to his people's foot; and so he makes us strong.
          Marvelous condescension! Ye stars of glory, have ye ever witnessed
          such stoops of love? God Almighty, Eternal, Omnipotent, stoops from
          his throne and lays his hand upon the child's hand, stretching his arm
          upon the arm of Joseph, that he may be made strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          One more thought, and I have done. The strength was covenant strength,
          for it is said, "The arms of his hands were made strong by the hands
          of the mighty God of Jacob." Now, wherever you read of the God of
          Jacob in the Bible, you may know that that respects God's covenant
          with Jacob. Ah! I love to talk about God's everlasting covenant. Some
          of the Arminians cannot bear it, but I love a covenant salvation -- a
          covenant not made with my father, not between me and God, but between
          Christ and God. Christ made the covenant to pay a price, and God made
          the covenant that he should have the people. Christ has paid the price
          and ratified the covenant; and I am quite sure that God will fulfil
          his part of it, by giving every elect vessel of mercy into the hands
          of Jesus. But, beloved, all the power, all the grace, all the
          blessings, all the mercies, all the comforts, all the things we have,
          we have through the covenant. If there were no covenant; if we could
          rend the everlasting charter up; if the king of hell could cut it with
          his knife, as the king of Israel did the roll of Baruck, then we
          should fail indeed; for we have no strength, except that which is
          promised in the covenant. Covenant mercies, covenant grace, covenant
          promises, covenant blessings, covenant help, covenant everything --
          the Christian must receive, if he would enter into heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, Christian, the archers have sorely grieved you, and shot at you,
          and wounded you; but your bow abides in strength, and the arms of your
          hands are made strong. But do you know, O believer, that you are like
          your Master in this?
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. That is our fourth point -- A GLORIOUS PARALLEL. "From thence is
          the shepherd, the stone of Israel." Jesus Christ was served just the
          same; the shepherd, the stone of Israel, passed through similar
          trials; he was shot at by the archers, he was grieved and wounded, but
          his bow abode in strength; his arms were made strong by the God of
          Jacob, and now every blessing rests "upon the crown of the head of him
          who was separated from his brethren." I shall not detain you long, but
          I have a few things to tell you; first about Christ as the shepherd,
          and then about Christ the stone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ came into the world as a shepherd. As soon as he made his
          appearance, the Scribes and Pharisees said, "Ah! we have been the
          shepherds until this hour; now we shall be driven from our honors, we
          shall lose all our dignity, and our authority." Consequently, they
          always shot at him. As for the people, they were a fickle herd; I
          believe that many of them respected and admired Christ, though,
          doubtless, the vast majority hated him, for wherever he went he was a
          popular preacher; the multitude always thronged him and crowded round
          him, crying, "Hosanna." I think, if you had walked up to the top of
          that hill of Calvary, and asked one of those men who cried out,
          "Crucify him, crucify him," "What do you say that for? Is he a bad
          man?" "No," he would have said, "he went about doing good." "Then why
          do you say crucify him?'" "Because Rabbi Simeon gave me a shekel to
          help the clamor." So the multitude were much won by the money and
          influence of the priests. But they were glad to hear Christ after all.
          It was the shepherds that hated him, because he took away their
          traffic, because he turned the buyers and sellers out of the temple,
          diminished their dignity and ignored their pretensions; therefore,
          they could not endure him. But the Shepherd of Israel mounted higher
          and higher; he gathered his sheep, carried the lambs in his bosom; and
          he now stands acknowledged as the great shepherd of the sheep, who
          shall gather them into one flock and lead them to heaven. Rowland Hill
          tells a curious tale, in his "Village Dialogues," about a certain Mr.
          Tiplash, a very fine intellectual preacher, who, in one of his flights
          of oratory, said, "O Virtue, thou art so fair and lovely, if thou wert
          to come down upon earth, all men would love thee," with a few more
          pretty, beautiful things. Mr. Blunt, and honest preacher, who was in
          the neighborhood, was asked to preach in the afternoon, and he
          supplemented the worthy gentleman's remarks, by saying, "O Virtue,
          thou didst come on earth, in all thy purity and loveliness; but
          instead of being beloved and admired, the archers sorely shot at thee
          and grieved thee; they took thee, Virtue, and hung thy quivering limbs
          upon a cross; when thou didst hang there dying they hissed at thee,
          they mocked thee, they scorned thee; when thou didst ask for water
          they gave thee vinegar to drink, mingled with gall; yea, when thou
          diedst thou hadst a tomb from charity, and that tomb, sealed by enmity
          and hatred." The Shepherd of Israel was despised, incarnate virtue was
          hated and abhorred; therefore fear not, Christians, take courage; for
          if your Master passed through it, surely you must.
        </p>
        <p>
          To conclude: the text calls Christ the stone of Israel. I have heard a
          story -- I cannot tell whether it is true or not -- out of some of the
          Jewish rabbis; it is a tale, concerning the text, "The stone which the
          builders refused, the same is become the headstone of the corner." It
          is said that when Solomon's temple was building, all the stones were
          brought from the quarry ready cut and fashioned, and there were to be
          put. Amongst the stones was a very curious one; it seemed of no
          describable shape, it appeared unfit for any portion of the building.
          They tried it at this wall, but it would not fit; they tried it in
          another, but it could not be accommodated; so, vexed and angry, they
          threw it away. The temple was so many years building, that this stone
          became covered with moss, and grass grew around it. Everybody passing
          by laughed at the stone; they said Solomon was wise, and doubtless all
          the other stones were right; but as for that block, they might as well
          send it back to the quarry, for they were quite sure it was meant for
          nothing. Year after year rolled on, and the poor stone was still
          despised, the builders constantly refused it. The eventful day came
          when the temple was to be finished and opened, and the multitude was
          assembled to see the grand sight. The builders said, "Where is the
          top-stone? Where is the pinnacle?" They little thought where the
          crowning marble was, until some one said, "Perhaps that stone which
          the builders refused is meant to be the top-stone." They then took it,
          and hoisted it to the top of the house; and as it reached the summit
          they found it well adapted to the place. Loud hosannas made the welkin
          ring, as the stone which the builders refused, thus became the
          headstone of the corner. So is it with Christ Jesus. The builders cast
          him away. He was a plebeian; he was of poor extraction; he was a man
          acquainted with sinners, who walked in poverty and meanness; hence the
          worldly-wise despised him. But when God shall gather together, in one,
          all things that are in heaven and that are in earth, then Christ shall
          be the glorious consummation of all things.
        </p>
        <p>"Christ reigns in heaven the topmost stone,</p>
        <p>And well deserves the praise."</p>
        <p>
          He shall be exalted; he shall be honored; his name shall endure as
          long as the sun, and all nations shall be blessed in him, yea, all
          generations shall call him blessed.<br />
