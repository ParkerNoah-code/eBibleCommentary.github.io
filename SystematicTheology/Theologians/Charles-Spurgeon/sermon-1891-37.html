          1. The Bythus, therefore, whom they conceive of with his Pleroma, and
          the God of Marcion, are inconsistent. If indeed, as they affirm, he
          has something subjacent and beyond himself, which they style vacuity
          and shadow, this vacuum is then proved to be greater than their
          Pleroma. But it is inconsistent even to make this statement, that
          while he contains all things within himself, the creation was formed
          by some other. For it is absolutely necessary that they acknowledge a
          certain void and chaotic kind of existence (below the spiritual
          Pleroma) in which this universe was formed, and that the Propator
          purposely left this chaos as it was, either knowing beforehand what
          things were to happen in it, or being ignorant of them. If he was
          really ignorant, then God will not be prescient of all things. But
          they will not even [in that case] be able to assign a reason on what
          account He thus left this place void during so long a period of time.
          If, again, He is prescient, and contemplated mentally that creation
          which was about to have a being in that place, then He Himself created
          it who also formed it beforehand [ideally] in Himself.

          2. Let them cease, therefore, to affirm that the world was made by any
          other; for as soon as God formed a conception in His mind, that was
          also done which He had thus mentally conceived. For it was not
          possible that one Being should mentally form the conception, and
          another actually produce the things which had been conceived by Him in
          His mind. But God, according to these heretics, mentally conceived
          either an eternal world or a temporal one, both of which suppositions
          cannot be true. Yet if He had mentally conceived of it as eternal,
          spiritual, and visible, it would also have been formed such. But if it
          was formed such as it really is, then He made it such who had mentally
          conceived of it as such; or He willed it to exist in the ideality of
          the Father, according to the conception of His mind, such as it now
          is, compound, mutable, and transient. Since, then, it is just such as
          the Father had [ideally] formed in counsel with Himself, it must be
          worthy of the Father. But to affirm that what was mentally conceived
          and pre-created by the Father of all, just as it has been actually
          formed, is the fruit of defect, and the production of ignorance, is to
          be guilty of great blasphemy. For, according to them, the Father of
          all will thus be [regarded as] generating in His breast, according to
          His own mental conception, the emanations of defect and the fruits of
          ignorance, since the things which He had conceived in His mind have
          actually been produced.<br />
