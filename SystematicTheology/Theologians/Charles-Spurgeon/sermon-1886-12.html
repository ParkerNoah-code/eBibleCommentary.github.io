        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1926)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, October 24th, 1886, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy
          first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and
          repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly,
          and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent|
          -- Rev 2:4,5.
        </p>
        <p>
          IT WAS the work of the priest to go into the holy place and to trim
          the seven-branched lamp of gold: see how our Great High Priest walketh
          in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks: his work is not
          occasional, but constant. Wearing robes which are at once royal and
          priestly, he is seen lighting the holy lamps, pouring in the sacred
          oil, and removing impurities which would dim the light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence our Lord's fitness to deal with the churches, which are these
          golden lamp-stands, for no one knows so much about the lamps as the
          person whose constant work it is to watch them and trim them. No one
          knows the churches as Jesus does, for the care of all the churches
          daily comes upon him, he continually walks among them, and holds their
          ministers as stars in his right hand. His eyes are perpetually upon
          the churches, so that he knows their works, their sufferings, and
          their sins; and those eyes are as a flame of fire, so that he sees
          with a penetration, discernment, and accuracy to which no other can
          attain. We sometimes judge the condition of religion too leniently, or
          else we err on the other side, and judge too severely. Our eyes are
          dim with the word's smoke; but his eyes are as a flame of fire. He
          sees the churches through and through, and knows their true condition
          much better than they know themselves. The Lord Jesus Christ is a most
          careful observer of churches and of individuals; nothing is hid from
          his observant eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he is the most careful observer, so he is the most candid. He is
          ever |the faithful and true witness.| He loves much, and therefore he
          never judges harshly. He loves much, and therefore he always judges
          jealously. Jealousy is the sure attendant of such love as his. He will
          neither speak smooth words nor bitter words; but he will speak the
          truth -- the truth in love, the truth as he himself perceives it, and
          as he would have us perceive it. Well may he say, |He that hath an
          ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches,| since his
          sayings are so true, so just, so weighty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certainly no observer can be so tender as the Son of God. Those lamps
          are very precious to him: it cost him his life to light them. |Christ
          loved the church, and gave himself for it.| Every church is to our
          Lord a more sublime thing than a constellation in the heavens; as he
          is precious to his saints, so are they precious to him. He careth
          little for empires, kingdoms, or republics; but his heart is set on
          the kingdom of righteousness, of which his cross is the royal
          standard. He must reign until his foes are vanquished, and this is the
          great thought of his mind at this present, |From henceforth expecting
          till his enemies be made his footstool.| He ceases not to watch over
          his church: his sacrifice is ended, but not his service in caring for
          the golden lamps. He has completed the redemption of his bride, but he
          continues her preservation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I therefore feel at this time that we may well join in a prayer to our
          Lord Jesus to come into our midst and put our light in order. Oh for a
          visit from himself such as he paid in vision to the seven churches of
          Asia! With him is the oil to feed the living flame, and he knows how
          to pour it in according to due measure; with him are those golden
          snuffers with which to remove every superfluity of naughtiness, that
          our lights may so shine before men, that they may see our good works,
          and glorify our Father which is in heaven. Oh for his presence now, to
          search us and to sanctify us; to cause us to shine forth to his
          Father's praise! We would be judged of the Lord, that we may not be
          condemned with the world. We would pray this morning, |Search me, O
          God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts; and see if there
          be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.| All
          things are naked and open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do;
          and we delight to have it so. We invite thee, O great High Priest, to
          come into this sanctuary, and look to this thy lamp this morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the text, as it is addressed to the church at Ephesus and to us, we
          note three things. First, we note that Christ perceives: |I know thy
          works . . . nevertheless I have somewhat against thee.| Secondly,
          Christ prescribes: |Remember, therefore, from whence thou art fallen,
          and repent,| and so forth. Thirdly, Christ persuades -- persuades with
          a threatening: |I will remove thy candlestick out of his place;|
          persuades, also, with a promise: |To him that overcometh will I give
          to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of
          God.| If the Lord himself be here at this time, our plan of discourse
          will be a river of life; but if he be not among us by his Holy Spirit,
          it will be as the dry bed of a torrent which bears the name of
          |river,| but lacks the living stream. We expect our Lord's presence;
          he will come to the lamps which his office calls upon him to trim; it
          has been his wont to be with us; some of us have met him this morning
          already, and we have constrained him to tarry with us.
        </p>
        <p>I. First, then, we notice that HE PERCEIVES.</p>
        <p>
          Our Lord sorrowfully perceives the faults of his church --
          |Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee;| but he does not so
          perceive those faults as to be forgetful of that which he can admire
          and accept; for he begins his letter with commendations, |I know thy
          works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear
          them which are evil.| Do not think, my brethren, that our Beloved is
          blind to the beauties of his church. On the contrary, he delights to
          observe them. He can see beauties where she herself cannot see them.
          Where we observe much to deplore, his loving eyes see much to admire.
          The graces which he himself creates he can always perceive. When we in
          the earnestness of self-examination overlook them, and write bitter
          things against ourselves, the Lord Jesus sees even in those bitter
          self-condemnations a life and earnestness and sincerity which he
          loves. Our Lord has a keen eye for all that is good. When he searches
          our hearts he never passes by the faintest longing, or desire, or
          faith, or love, of any of his people. He says, |I know thy works.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But this is our point at this time, that while Jesus can see all that
          is good, yet in very faithfulness he sees all that is evil. His love
          is not blind. He does not say, |As many as I love I commend;| but, |As
          many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.| It is more necessary for us
          that we should make a discovery of our faults than of our virtues. So
          notice in this text that Christ perceiveth the flaw in his church,
          even in the midst of her earnest service. The church at Ephesus was
          full of work. |I know thy works and thy labour, and for my name's sake
          thou hast laboured, and hast not fainted.| It was such a laborious
          church that it pushed on and on with diligent perseverance, and never
          seemed to flag in its divine mission. Oh that we could say as much of
          all our churches! I have lived to see many brilliant projects lighted
          and left to die out in smoke. I have heard of schemes which were to
          illuminate the world; but not a spark remains. Holy perseverance is a
          great desideratum. In these three and thirty years we thank God he has
          enabled us to labour and not to faint. There has been a continuance of
          everything attempted, and no drawing back from anything. |This is the
          work, this is the labour,| to hold out even to the end. Oh how I have
          dreaded lest we should have to give up any holy enterprise or cut
          short any gracious effort! Hitherto the Lord has helped us. With men
          and means, liberality and zeal, he has supplied us. In this case the
          angel of the church has been very little of an angel from heaven, but
          very much of a human angel; for in the weakness of my flesh and in the
          heaviness of my spirit have I pursued my calling; but I have pursued
          it. By the help of God I continue to this day, and this church with
          equal footsteps is at my side; for which the whole praise is due to
          the Lord, who fainteth not, neither is weary. Having put my hand to
          the plough I have not looked back, but have steadily pressed forward,
          making straight furrows; but it has been by the grace of God alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas! under all the labouring the Lord Jesus perceived that the
          Ephesians had left their first love; and this was a grievous fault. So
          it may be in this church; every wheel may continue to revolve, and the
          whole machinery of ministry may be kept going at its normal rate, and
          yet there may be a great secret evil which Jesus perceives, and this
          may be marring all.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this church at Ephesus was not only laborious, it was patient in
          suffering great persecution. He says of it: |I know thy works and thy
          patience, and how thou hast borne, and hast patience, and hast not
          fainted.| Persecution upon persecution visited the faithful, but they
          bore it all with holy courage and constancy, and continued still
          confessing their Lord. This was good, and the Lord highly approved it;
          but yet underneath it he saw the tokens of decline; they had left
          their first love. So there may seem to be all the patient endurance
          and dauntless courage that there should be, and yet as a fair apple
          may have a worm at its core, so may it be with the church when it
          looks best to the eye of friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ephesian church excelled in something else, namely, in its
          discipline, its soundness in the faith, and fidelity towards heretics;
          for the Lord says of it, |how thou canst not bear them which are
          evil.| They would not have it; they would not tolerate false doctrine,
          they would not put up with unclean living. They fought against evil,
          not only in the common people, but in prominent individuals. |Thou has
          tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found
          them liars.| They had dealt with the great ones; they had not flinched
          from the unmasking of falsehood. Those who seemed to be apostles they
          had dragged to the light and discovered to be deceivers. This church
          was not honeycombed with doubt; it laid no claim to breadth of thought
          and liberality of view; it was honest to its Lord. He says of it,
          |This thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which
          I also hate.| This was grand of them: it showed a backbone of truth. I
          wish some of the churches of this age had a little of this holy
          decision about them; for nowadays, if a man be clever, he may preach
          the vilest lie that was ever vomited from the mouth of hell, and it
          will go down with some. He may assail every doctrine of the gospel, he
          may blaspheme the Holy Trinity, he may trample on the blood of the Son
          of God, and yet nothing shall be said about it if he be held in repute
          as a man of advanced thought and liberal ideas. The church at Ephesus
          was not of this mind. She was strong in her convictions; she could not
          yield the faith, nor play the traitor to her Lord. For this her Lord
          commended her: and yet he says, |I have somewhat against thee, because
          thou hast left thy first love.| When love dies orthodox doctrine
          becomes a corpse, a powerless formalism. Adhesion to the truth sours
          into bigotry when the sweetness and light of love to Jesus depart.
          Love Jesus, and then it is well to hate the deeds of the Nicolaitanes;
          but mere hate of evil will tend to evil if love of Jesus be not there
          to sanctify it. I need not make a personal application; but that which
          is spoken to Ephesus may be spoken at this hour to ourselves. As we
          hope that we may appropriate the commendation, so let us see whether
          the expostulation may not also apply to us. |I have somewhat against
          thee, because thou hast left thy first love.| Thus I have shown you
          that Jesus sees the evil beneath all the good; he does not ignore the
          good, but he will not pass over the ill.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, next, this evil was a very serious one; it was love declining:
          |Thou hast left thy first love.| |Is that serious?| saith one. It is
          the most serious ill of all; for the church is the bride of Christ,
          and for a bride to fail in love is to fail in all things. It is idle
          for the wife to say that she is obedient, and so forth: if love to her
          husband has evaporated, her wifely duty cannot be fulfilled, she has
          lost the very life and soul of the marriage state. So, my brethren,
          this is a most important matter, our love to Christ, because it
          touches the very heart of that communion with him which is the crown
          and essence of our spiritual life. As a church we must love Jesus, or
          else we have lost our reason for existence. A church has no reason for
          being a church when she has no love within her heart, or when that
          love grows cold. Have I not often reminded you that almost any disease
          may be hopefully endured except disease of the heart? But when our
          sickness is a disease of the heart, it is full of danger; and it was
          so in this case; |Thou hast left thy first love.| It is a disease of
          the heart, a central, fatal disease, unless the great Physician shall
          interpose to stay its progress, and to deliver us from it. Oh, in any
          man, in any woman, any child of God here, let alone in the church as a
          whole, if there be a leaving of the first love, it is a woeful thing!
          Lord have mercy upon us; Christ have mercy upon us: this should be our
          solemn litany at once. No peril can be greater than this. Lose love,
          lose all. Leave our first love, we have left strength, and peace, and
          joy, and holiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I call your attention, however, to this point, that it was he that
          found it out. |I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left
          thy first love.| Jesus himself found it out! I do not know how it
          strikes you; but as I thought it over, this fact brought the tears to
          my eyes. When I begin to leave off loving Christ, or love him less
          than I do, I would like to find it out myself; and if I did so, there
          would soon be a cure for it. But for him to find it out, oh, it seems
          so hard, so sad a thing! That we should keep on growing cold, and
          cold, and cold, and never care about it till the Beloved points it out
          to us. Why even the angel of the church did not find it out; the
          minister did not know it; but He saw it who loves us so well, that he
          delights in our love, and pines when it begins to fail. To him we are
          unutterably dear; he loved us up out of the pit into his bosom, loved
          us up from the dunghill among beggars to sit at his right hand upon
          his throne; and it is sorrowful that he should have to complain of our
          cooling love while we are utterly indifferent to the matter. Does
          Jesus care more about our love than we do? He loves us better than we
          love ourselves. How good of him to care one jot about our love! This
          is no complaint of an enemy, but of a dear wounded friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          I notice that Jesus found it out with great pain. I can hardly
          conceive a greater grief to him as the husband of his church than to
          look her in the face and say, |Thou hast left thy first love.| What
          can she give him but love? Will she deny him this? A poor thing is the
          church of herself: her Lord married her when she was in beggary; and
          if she does not give him love, what has she to give him? If she begins
          to be unfaithful in heart to him, what is she worth? Why, any unloving
          wife is a foul fountain of discomfort and dishonour to her husband. O
          beloved, shall it be so with thee? Wilt thou grieve Emmanuel? Wilt
          thou would thy Well-beloved? Church of God, wilt thou grieve him whose
          heart was pierced for thy redemption? Brother, sister, can you and I
          let Jesus find out that our love is departing, that we are ceasing to
          be zealous for his name? Can we wound him so? Is not this to crucify
          the Lord afresh? Might he not hold up his hands this morning with
          fresh blood upon them, and say, |These are the wounds which I received
          in the house of my friends. It was nothing that I died for them, but
          ill it is that, after having died for them, they have failed to give
          me their hearts?| Jesus is not so sick of our sin as of our
          lukewarmness. It is a sad business to my heart; I hope it will be sad
          to all whom it concerns, that our Lord should be the first to spy out
          our declines in love.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Saviour, having thus seen this with pain, now points it out. As I
          read this passage over to myself, I noticed that the Saviour had
          nothing to say about the sins of the heathen among whom the Ephesians
          dwelt: they are alluded to because it must have been the heathen who
          persecuted the church, and caused it to endure, and exhibit patience.
          The Saviour, however, has nothing to say against the heathen; and he
          does not say much more than a word about those who were evil. These
          had been cast out, and he merely says: |Thou canst not bear them which
          are evil.| He denounced no judgment upon the Nicolaitanes, except that
          he hated them; and even the apostles which were found to be liars the
          Master dismisses with that word. He leaves the ungodly in their own
          condemnation. But what he has to say is against his own beloved: |I
          have somewhat against thee.| It seems as if the Master might pass over
          sin in a thousand others, but he cannot wink at failure of love in his
          own espoused one. |The Lord thy God is a jealous God.| The Saviour
          loves, so that his love is cruel as the grave against
          cold-heartedness. He said of the church of Laodicea, |I will spue thee
          out of my mouth.| This was one of his own churches, too, and yet she
          made him sick with her lukewarmness. God grant that we may not be
          guilty of such a crime as that!
        </p>
        <p>
          The Saviour pointed out the failure of love; and when he pointed it
          out he called it by a lamentable name. |Remember therefore from whence
          thou art fallen.| He calls it a fall to leave our first love.
          Brothers, sisters, this church had not been licentious, it had not
          gone aside to false doctrine, it had not become idle, it had not been
          cowardly in the hour of persecution; but this one sin summed up the
          whole -- she did not love Christ as she once loved him, and he calls
          this a fall. A fall indeed it is. |Oh, I thought,| saith one, |that if
          a member of the church got drunk that was a fall.| That is a grievous
          fall, but it is a fall if we become intoxicated with the world, and
          lose the freshness of our devotion to Jesus. It is a fall from a high
          estate of fellowship to the dust of worldliness. |Thou art fallen.|
          The word sounds very harshly in my ears -- no, not harshly, for his
          love speaks it in so pathetic a manner; but it thunders in my soul
          deep down. I cannot bear it. It is so sadly true. |Thou art fallen.|
          |Remember from whence thou art fallen.| Indeed, O Lord, we have fallen
          when we have left our first love for thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Master evidently counts this decline of love to be a personal
          wrong done to himself. |I have somewhat against thee.| It is not an
          offence against the king, nor against the judge, but against the Lord
          Jesus as the husband of the church: an offence against the very heart
          of Christ himself. |I have somewhat against thee.| He does not say,
          |Thy neighbour has somewhat against thee, thy child has somewhat
          against thee, thy God has somewhat against thee,| but, |I, I thy hope,
          thy joy, thy delight, thy Saviour, I have this against thee.| The word
          somewhat is an intruder here. Our translators put it in italics, and
          well they might, for it is a bad word, since it seems to make a small
          thing of a very grave change. The Lord has this against us, and it is
          no mere |somewhat.| Come, brothers and sisters, if we have not broken
          any law, nor offended in any way so as to grieve anybody else, this is
          sorrow enough, if our love has grown in the least degree chill towards
          him; for we have done a terrible wrong to our best friend. This is the
          bitterness of our offence; Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and
          done this evil in thy sight, that I have left my first love. The
          Saviour tells us this most lovingly. I wish I knew how to speak as
          tenderly as he does; and yet I feel at this moment that I can and must
          be tender in this matter, for I am speaking about myself as much as
          about anybody else. I am grieving, grieving over some here present,
          grieving for all of us, but grieving most of all for myself, that our
          Well-beloved should have cause to say, |I have somewhat against thee,
          because thou hast left thy first love.|
        </p>
        <p>So much for what our Lord perceives. Holy Spirit, bless it to us!</p>
        <p>
          II. And now, secondly, let us note what THE SAVIOUR PRESCRIBES. The
          Saviour's prescription is couched in these three words: |Remember,|
          |Repent,| |Return.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The first word is Remember. |Thou hast left thy first love.| Remember,
          then, what thy first love was, and compare thy present condition with
          it. At first nothing diverted thee from thy Lord. He was thy life, thy
          love, thy joy. Now thou lookest for recreation somewhere else, and
          other charms and other beauties win thy heart. Art thou not ashamed of
          this? Once thou wast never wearied with hearing of him and serving
          him. Never wert thou overdone with Christ and his gospel: many
          sermons, many prayer-meetings, many Bible readings, and yet none too
          many. Now sermons are long, and services are dull, and thou must have
          thy jaded appetite exited with novelties. How is this? Once thou wast
          never displeased with Jesus whatever he did with thee. If thou hadst
          been sick, or poor, or dying, thou wouldst still have loved and
          blessed his name for all things. He remembers this fondness, and
          regrets its departure. He says to thee to-day, |I remember thee, the
          kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest
          after me in the wilderness.| Thou wouldst have gone after thy Lord
          anywhere in those days: across the sea, or through the fire, thou
          wouldst have pursued him; nothing would have been too hot or too heavy
          for thee then. Is it so now? Remember! Remember from whence thou art
          fallen. Remember the vows, the tears, the communings, the happy
          raptures of those days; remember and compare with them thy present
          state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember and consider, that when thou wast in thy first love, that
          love was none too warm. Even then, when thou didst live to him, and
          for him, and with him, thou wast none too holy, none too consecrated,
          none too zealous. If thou wast not too forward then, what art thou now
          -- now that thou hast come down even from that poor attainment?
          Remember the past with sad forebodings of the future. If thou hast
          come down from where thou wast, who is to tell thee where thou wilt
          cease thy declining? He who has sunk so far may fall much farther. Is
          it not so? Though thou sayest in thy heart like Hazael, |Is thy
          servant a dog?| thou mayest turn out worse than a dog yet, yea, prove
          a very wolf. Who knows? thou mayest even now be a devil! Thou mayest
          turn out a Judas, a son of perdition, and deny thy Master, selling him
          for thirty pieces of silver. When a stone begins to fall it falls with
          an ever-increasing rate; and when a soul begins to leave its first
          love, it quits it more and more, and more and more, til at last it
          falleth terribly. Remember!
        </p>
        <p>
          The next word of the prescription is |Repent.| Repent as thou didst at
          first. The word so suitable to sinners is suitable to thee, for thou
          hast grievously sinned. Repent of the wrong thou hast done thy Lord by
          leaving thy first love of him. Couldst thou have lived a seraphic
          life, only breathing his love, only existing for him, thou hadst done
          little enough; but to quit thy first love, how grievously hast thou
          wronged him! That love was well deserved, was it not? Why, then, hast
          thou left it? Is Jesus less fair than he was? Does he love thee less
          than he did? Has he been less kind and tender to thee than he used to
          be? Say, hast thou outgrown him? Canst thou do without him? Hast thou
          a hope of salvation apart from him? I charge thee, repent of this
          thine ill-doing towards one who has a greater claim upon thy love than
          ever he had. He ought to be to-day loved more than thou didst love him
          at thy very best! O my heart, is not all this most surely true? How
          ill art thou behaving! What an ingrate art thou! Repent! Repent!
        </p>
        <p>
          Repent of much good that thou hast left undone through want of love.
          Oh, if thou hadst always loved thy Lord at thy best, what mightest
          thou not have known of him by this time! What good deeds thou mightest
          have done by force of his love! How many hearts mightest thou have won
          for thy Lord if thine own heart had been fuller of love, if thine own
          soul had been more on fire! Thou hast lived a poor beggarly life
          because thou hast allowed such poverty of love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Repent! Repent! To my mind, as I thought over this text, the call for
          repentance grew louder and louder, because of the occasion of its
          utterance. Here is the glorious Lord, coming to his church and
          speaking to her angel in tones of tender kindness. He condescends to
          visit his people in all his majesty and glory, intending nothing but
          to manifest himself in love to his own elect as he doth not to the
          world. And yet he is compelled even then to take to chiding, and to
          say, |I have this against thee, because thou hast left thy first
          love.| Here is a love- visit clouded with upbraiding -- necessary
          upbraiding. What mischief sin has done! It is a dreadful thing that
          when Jesus comes to his own dear bride he should have to speak in
          grief, and not in joy. Must holy communion, which is the wine of
          heaven, be embittered with the tonic of expostulation? I see the upper
          springs of nearest fellowship, where the waters of life leap from
          their first source in the heart of God. Are not these streams most
          pure and precious? If a man drink thereof he liveth for ever. Shall it
          be that even at the fountain-head they shall be dashed with
          bitterness? Even when Christ communes personally with us must he say,
          |I have somewhat against thee?| Break, my heart, that it should be so!
          Well may we repent with a deep repentance when our choicest joys are
          flavoured with the bitter herbs of regret, that our best Beloved
          should have somewhat against us.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then he says in effect, Return. The third word is this -- |Repent,
          and do the first works.| Notice, that he does not say, |Repent, and
          get back thy first love.| This seems rather singular; but then love is
          the chief of the first works, and, moreover, the first works can only
          come of the first love. There must be in every declining Christian a
          practical repentance. Do not be satisfied with regrets and resolves.
          Do the first works; do not strain after the first emotions, but do the
          first works. No renewal is so valuable as the practical cleansing of
          our way. If the life be made right, it will prove that the love is so.
          In doing the first works you will prove that you have come back to
          your first love. The prescription is complete, because the doing of
          the first works is meant to include the feeling of the first feelings,
          the sighing of the first sighs, the enjoying of the first joys: these
          are all supposed to accompany returning obedience and activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are to get back to these first works at once. Most men come to
          Christ with a leap; and I have observed that many who come back to him
          usually do so at a bound. The slow revival of one's love is almost an
          impossibility; as well expect the dead to rise by degrees. Love to
          Christ is often love at first sight: we see him, and are conquered by
          him. If we grow cold, the best thing we can do is to fasten our eyes
          on him till we cry, |My soul melted while my Beloved spake.| It is a
          happy circumstance if I can cry, |Or ever I was aware, my soul made me
          like the chariots of Amminadib.| How sweet for the Lord to put us back
          again at once into the old place, back again in a moment! My prayer is
          that it may be so this morning with any declining one. May you so
          repent as not merely to feel the old feelings, but instantly to do the
          first works, and be once more as eager, as zealous, as generous, as
          prayerful, as you used to be! If we should again see you breaking the
          alabaster box, we should know that the old love had returned. May the
          good Master help us to do as well as ever, yea, much better than
          before!
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice, however, that this will require much of effort and warfare;
          for the promise which is made is |to him that overcometh.| Overcoming
          implies conflict. Depend upon it, if you conquer a wandering heart,
          you will have to fight for it. |To him that overcometh,| saith he,
          |will I give to eat of the tree of life.| You must fight your way back
          to the garden of the Lord. You will have to fight against lethargy,
          against an evil heart of unbelief, against the benumbing influence of
          the world. In the name and power of him who bids you repent, you must
          wrestle and struggle till you get the mastery over self, and yield
          your whole nature to your Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I have shown you how Christ prescribes, and I greatly need a few
          minutes for the last part, because I wish to dwell with solemn
          earnestness upon it. I have no desire to say a word by which I may
          prove myself a true brother pleading with you in deep sympathy,
          because in all the ill which I rebuke I mourn my own personal share.
          Bless us, O Spirit of the Lord!
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now see, brethren, HE PERSUADES. This is the third point: the
          Lord Jesus persuades his erring one to repent.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, he persuades with a warning: |I will come unto thee;| |quickly|
          is not in the original: the Revised Version has left it out. Our Lord
          is generally very slow at the work of judgment: |I will come unto
          thee, and will remove thy candlestick out of its place, except thou
          repent.| This he must do: he cannot allow his light to be apart from
          love, and if the first love be left, the church shall be left in
          darkness. The truth must always shine, but not always in the same
          place. The place must be made fit by love, or the light shall be
          removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord means, first, I will take away the comfort of the Word. He
          raises up certain ministers, and makes them burning and shining lights
          in the midst of his church, and when the people gather together they
          are cheered and enlightened by their shining. A ministry blessed of
          the Lord is a singular comfort to the church of God. The Lord can
          easily take away that light which has brought comfort to so many: he
          can remove the good man to another sphere, or he can call him home to
          his rest. The extinguisher of death can put out the candle which now
          gladdens the house. The church which has lost a ministry by which the
          Lord's glory has shone forth has lost a good deal; and if this loss
          has been sent in chastisement for decline of love it is all the harder
          to bear. I can point you to places where once was a man of God, and
          all went well; but the people grew cold, and the Lord took away their
          leader, and the place is now a desolation: those who now attend those
          courts and listen to a modern ministry cry out because of the famine
          of the Word of the Lord. O friends, let us value the light while we
          have it, and prove that we do so by profiting by it; but how can we
          profit if we leave our first love? The Lord may take away our comfort
          as a church if our first zeal shall die down.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the candlestick also symbolizes usefulness: it is that by which a
          church shines. The use of a church is to preserve the truth, wherewith
          to illuminate the neighbourhood, to illuminate the world. God can soon
          cut short our usefulness, and he will do so if we cut short our love.
          If the Lord be withdrawn, we can go on with our work as we used to do,
          but nothing will come of it: we can go on with Sunday-schools,
          mission-stations, branch churches, and yet accomplish nothing.
          Brethren, we can go on with the Orphanage, the College, the
          Colportage, the Evangelistic Society, the Book Fund, and all else, and
          yet nothing will be effected if the arm of the Lord be not made bare.
        </p>
        <p>
          He can, if he wills, even take away from the church her very existence
          as a church. Ephesus is gone: nothing but ruins can be found. Rome
          once held a noble church of Christ, but has not her name become the
          symbol of antichrist? The Lord can soon take away candlesticks out of
          their places if the church uses her light for her own glory, and is
          not filled with his love. God forbid that we should fall under this
          condemnation! Of thy mercy, O Lord, forbid it! Let it not so happen to
          any one of us. Yet this may occur to us as individuals. You, dear
          brother or sister, if you lose your first love, may soon lose your
          joy, your peace, your usefulness. You, who are now so bright, may grow
          dull. You, who are now so useful, may become useless. You were once an
          instructor of the foolish, and a teacher of babes; but if the Lord be
          withdrawn you will instruct nobody, you will be in the dark yourself.
          Alas! you may come to lose the very name of Christians, as some have
          done who once seemed to be burning and shining lights. They were
          foolish virgins,and ere long they were heard to cry, |Our lamps are
          gone out!| The Lord can and will take away the candlestick out of its
          place if we put him out of his place by a failure in our love to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          How can I persuade you, then, better than with the warning words of my
          Master? My beloved, I persuade you from my very soul not to encounter
          these dangers, not to run these terrible risks; for as you would not
          wish to see either the church or your own self left without the light
          of God, to pine in darkness, it is needful that you abide in Christ,
          and go on to love him more and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Saviour holds out a promise as his other persuasive. Upon this I
          can only dwell for a minute. It seems a very wonderful promise to me:
          |To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which
          is in the midst of the paradise of God.| Observe, those who lose their
          first love fall, but those who abide in love are made to stand. In
          contrast to the fall which took place in the paradise of God, we have
          man eating of the tree of life, and so living for ever. If we, through
          grace, overcome the common tendency to decline in love, then shall we
          be confirmed and settled in the favour of the Lord. By eating of the
          tree of knowledge of good and evil we fell; by eating of the fruit of
          a better tree we live and stand fast for ever. Life proved true by
          love shall be nourished on the best of food: it shall be sustained by
          fruit from the garden of the Lord himself, gathered by the Saviour's
          own hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note again, those who lose their first love wander far, they depart
          from God. |But,| saith the Lord, |if you keep your first love you
          shall not wander, but you shall come into closer fellowship. I will
          bring you nearer to the centre. I will bring you to eat of the tree of
          life which is in the midst of the paradise of God.| The inner ring is
          for those who grow in love; the centre of all joy is only to be
          reached by much love. We know God as we love God. We enter into his
          paradise as we abide in his love. What joy is here! What a reward hath
          love!
        </p>
        <p>
          Then notice the mystical blessing which lies here, waiting for
          meditation. Do you know how we fell? The woman took of the fruit of
          the forbidden tree, and gave to Adam, and Adam ate and fell. The
          reverse is the case in the promise before us: the Second Adam takes of
          the divine fruit from the tree of promise, and hands it to his spouse;
          she eats and lives for ever. He who is the Father of the age of grace
          hands down to us immortal joys, which he has plucked from an
          unwithering tree. The reward of love is to eat the fruit of life. |We
          are getting into mysteries,| says one. Yes, I am intentionally lifting
          a corner of the veil, and no more. I only mean to give you a glimpse
          at the promised boon. Into his innermost joys our Lord will bring us
          if we keep up our first love, and go from strength to strength
          therein. Marvelous things are locked up in the caskets whereof love
          holds the key. Sin set the angel with a flaming sword between us and
          the tree of life in the midst of the garden; but love has quenched
          that sword, and now the angel beckons us to come into the innermost
          secrets of paradise. We shall know as we are known when we love as we
          are loved. We shall live the life of God when we are wholly taken up
          with the love of God. The love of Jesus answered by our love to Jesus
          makes the sweetest music the heart can know. No joy on earth is equal
          to the bliss of being all taken up with love to Christ. If I had my
          choice of all the lives that I could live, I certainly would not
          choose to be an emperor, nor to be a millionaire, nor to be a
          philosopher; for power, and wealth, and knowledge bring with them
          sorrow and travail; but I would choose to have nothing to do but to
          love my Lord Jesus -- nothing, I mean, but to do all things for his
          sake, and out of love to him. Then I know that I should be in
          paradise, yea, in the midst of the paradise of God, and I should have
          meat to eat which is all unknown to men of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heaven on earth is abounding love to Jesus. This is the first and last
          of true delight -- to love him who is the first and the last. To love
          Jesus is another name for paradise. Lord, let me know this by
          continual experience. |You are soaring aloft,| cries one. Yes, I own
          it. Oh that I could allure you to a heavenward flight upon wings of
          love! There is bitterness in declining love: it is a very consumption
          of the soul, and makes us weak, and faint, and low. But true love is
          the antepast of glory. See the heights, the glittering heights, the
          glorious heights, the everlasting hills to which the Lord of life will
          conduct all those who are faithful to him through the power of his
          Holy Spirit. See, O love, thine ultimate abode! I pray that what I
          have said may be blessed by the Holy Spirit to the bringing of us all
          nearer to the Bridegroom of our souls. Amen.
