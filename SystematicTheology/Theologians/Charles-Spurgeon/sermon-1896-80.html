          The Psalmist teaches us, in the first place, that human affairs are
          not regulated by the fickle and uncertain wheel of fortune, but that
          we must observe the judgments of God in the different vicissitudes
          which occur in the world, and which men imagine happen by chance.
          Consequently, adversity and all the ills which mankind endure, as
          shipwrecks, famines, banishments, diseases, and disasters in war, are
          to be regarded as so many tokens of God's displeasure, by which he
          summons them, on account of their sins, before his judicial throne.
          But prosperity, and the happy issue of events, ought also to be
          attributed to his grace, in order that he may always receive the
          praise which he deserves, that of being a merciful Father, and an
          impartial Judge. About the close of the psalm, he inveighs against
          those ungodly men who will not acknowledge God's hand, amid such
          palpable demonstrations of his providence. <br />
