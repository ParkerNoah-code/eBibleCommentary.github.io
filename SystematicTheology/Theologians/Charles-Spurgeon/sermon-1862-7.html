        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.460)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, July 13th, 1862, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>"Repent ye, and believe the gospel." -- Mark 1:15</p>
        <p>
          Our Lord Jesus Christ commences his ministry by announcing its leading
          commands. He cometh up from the wilderness newly anointed, like the
          bridegroom from his chamber; his love notes are repentance and faith.
          He cometh forth fully prepared for his office, having been in the
          desert, "tempted in all points as we are, yet without sin"; his loins
          are girded like a strong man to run a race. He preacheth with all the
          earnestness of a new zeal, combined with all the wisdom of a long
          preparation; in the beauty of holiness from the womb of morning he
          glittereth with the dew of his youth. Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O
          earth, for Messias speaketh in the greatness of his strength. He
          crieth unto the sons of men, "Repent ye, and believe the gospel." Let
          us give our ears to these words which, like their author, are full of
          grace and truth. Before us we have the sum and substance of Jesus
          Christ's whole teaching -- the Alpha and Omega of his entire ministry;
          and coming from the lips of such an one, at such a time, with such
          peculiar power, let us give the most earnest heed, and may God help us
          to obey them from our inmost hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I shall commence my remarking that the gospel which Christ preached
          was, very plainly, a command. "Repent ye, and believe the gospel." Our
          Lord does condescend to reason. Often his ministry graciously acted
          out the old text, "Come, now, and let us reason together; though your
          sins be as scarlet, they shall be as wool." He does persuade men by
          telling and forcible arguments, which should lead them to seek the
          salvation of their souls. He does invite men, and oh, how lovingly he
          woos them to be wise. "Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy
          laden, and I will give you rest." He does entreat men; he
          condescendeth to become, as it were, a beggar to his own sinful
          creatures, beseeching them to come to him. Indeed, he maketh this to
          be the duty of his ministers, "As though God did beseech you by us, we
          pray you, in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God." Yet, remember,
          though he condescendeth to reason, to persuade, to invite, and to
          beseech, still his gospel hath in it all the dignity and force of a
          command; and if we would preach it in these days as Christ did, we
          must proclaim it as a command from God, attended with a divine
          sanction, and not to be neglected save at the infinite peril of the
          soul. When the feast was spread upon the table for the
          marriage-supper, there was an invitation, but it had all the
          obligation of a command, since those who rejected it were utterly
          destroyed as despisers of their king. When the builders reject Christ,
          he becomes a stone of stumbling to "the disobedient"; but how could
          they disobey if there were no command? The gospel contemplates, I say,
          invitations, entreaties, and beseechings, but it also takes the higher
          ground of authority. "Repent ye" is as much a command of God as "Thou
          shalt not steal." "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ" has as fully a
          divine authority as "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
          heart, with all thy soul, with all thy strength." Think not, O men,
          that the gospel is a thing left to your option to choose it or not!
          Dream not, O sinners, that ye may despise the Word from heaven and
          incur no guilt! Think not that ye may neglect it and no ill
          consequences shall follow! It is just this neglect and despising of
          yours which shall fill up the measure of your iniquity. It is this
          concerning which we cry aloud, "How shall we escape if we neglect so
          great a salvation!" God commands you to repent. The same God before
          whom Sinai was moved and was altogether on a smoke -- that same God
          who proclaimed the law with sound of trumpet, with lightnings and with
          thunders, speaketh to us more gently, but still as divinely, through
          his only begotten Son, when he saith to us, "Repent ye, and believe
          the gospel."
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is this, dear friends; why has the Lord made it a command to us to
          believe in Christ? There is a blessed reason. Many souls would never
          venture to believe at all if it were not made penal to refuse to do
          so. For this is the difficulty with many awakened sinners: may I
          believe? Have I a right to believe? Am I permitted to trust Christ?
          Now this question is put aside, once for all, and should never
          irritate a broken heart again. You are commanded by God to do it,
          therefore you may do it. Every creature under heaven is commanded to
          believe in the Lord Jesus, and bow the knee at his name; every
          creature, wherever the gospel comes, wherever the truth is preached,
          is commanded there and then to believe the gospel; and it is put in
          that shape, I say, least any conscience-stricken sinner should
          question whether he may do it. Surely, you may do what God commands
          you to do. You may know this in the devil's teeth -- "I may do it; I
          am bidden to do it by him who hath authority, and I am threatened if I
          do not with eternal damnation from his presence, for 'he that
          believeth not shall be damned.'" This gives the sinner such a blessed
          permit, that whatever he may be or may not be, whatever he may have
          felt or may not have felt, he has a warrant which he may use whenever
          he is led to approach the cross. However benighted and darkened you
          may be, however hard-hearted and callous you may be, you have still a
          warrant to look to Jesus in the words, "Look unto me and be ye saved
          all ye ends of the earth." He that commanded thee to believe will
          justify thee in believing; he cannot condemn thee for that which he
          himself bids thee do. But while there is this blessed reason for the
          gospel's being a command, there is yet another solemn and an awful
          one. It is that men may be without excuse in the day of judgment; that
          no man may say at the last, "Lord, I did not know that I might believe
          in Christ; Lord, heaven's gate was shut in my face; I was told that I
          might not come, that I was not the man." "Nay," saith the Lord, with
          tones of thunder, "the times of man's ignorance I winked at, but in
          the gospel I commanded all men everywhere to repent; I sent my Son,
          and then I sent my apostles, and afterwards my ministers, and I bade
          them all make this the burden of their cry, 'Repent and be converted
          everyone of you'; and as Peter preached at Pentecost, so bade I them
          preach to thee. I bade them warn, exhort, and invite with all
          affection, but also to command with all authority, compelling you to
          come in, and inasmuch as you did not come at my command, you have
          added sin to sin; you have added the suicide of your own soul to all
          your other iniquities; and now, inasmuch as you did reject my Son, you
          shall have the portion of unbelievers, for 'he that believeth not
          shall be damned.'" To all the nations of the earth, then, let us sound
          forth this decree from God. O men, Jehovah that made you, he who gives
          you the breath of your nostrils, he against whom you have offended,
          commands you this day to repent and believe the gospel. He gives his
          promise -- "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved"; and he
          adds the solemn threatening -- "He that believeth not shall be
          damned." I know some brethren will not like this, but that I cannot
          help. The slave of systems I will never be, for the Lord has loosed
          this iron bondage from my neck, and now I am the joyful servant of the
          truth which maketh free. Offend or please, as God shall help me, I
          will preach every truth as I learn it from the Word; and I know if
          there be anything written in the Bible at all it is written as with a
          sunbeam, that God in Christ commandeth men to repent, and believe the
          gospel. It is one of the saddest proofs of man's utter depravity that
          he will not obey this command, but that he will despise Christ, and so
          make his doom worse than the doom of Sodom and Gomorrah. Without the
          regenerating work of God the Holy Ghost, no man ever will be obedient
          to this command, but still it must be published for a witness against
          them if they reject it; and while publishing God's command with all
          simplicity, we may expect that he will divinely enforce it in the
          souls of those whom he has ordained unto eternal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. While the gospel is a command, it is a two-fold command explaining
          itself. "Repent ye, and believe the gospel."
        </p>
        <p>
          I know some very excellent brethren -- would God there were more like
          them in zeal and love -- who, in their zeal to preach up simple faith
          in Christ have felt a little difficulty about the matter of
          repentance; and I have known some of them who have tried to get over
          the difficulty by softening down the apparent hardness of the word
          repentance, by expounding it according to its more usual Greek
          equivalent, a word which occurs in the original of my text, and
          signifies "to change one's mind." Apparently they interpret repentance
          to be a somewhat slighter thing than we usually conceive it to be, a
          mere change of mind, in fact. Now, allow me to suggest to those dear
          brethren, that the Holy Ghost never preaches repentance as a trifle;
          and the change of mind or understanding of which the gospel speaks is
          a very deep and solemn work, and must not on any account be
          depreciated. Moreover, there is another word which is also used in the
          original Greek for repentance, not so often I admit, but still is
          used, which signifies "an after-care," a word which has in it
          something more of sorrow and anxiety, than that which signifies
          changing one's mind. There must be sorrow for sin and hatred of it in
          true repentance, or else I have read my Bible to little purpose. In
          very truth, I think there is no necessity for any other definition
          than that of the children's hymn --
        </p>
        <p>"Repentance is to leave</p>
        <p>The sins we loved before,</p>
        <p>And show that we in earnest grieve,</p>
        <p>By doing so no more."</p>
        <p>
          To repent does mean a change of mind; but then it is a thorough change
          of the understanding and all that is in the mind, so that it includes
          an illumination, an illumination of the Holy Spirit; and I think it
          includes a discovery of iniquity and a hatred of it, without which
          there can hardly be a genuine repentance. We must not, I think,
          undervalue repentance. It is a blessed grace of God the Holy Spirit,
          and it is absolutely necessary unto salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The command explains itself. We will take, first of all, repentance.
          It is quite certain that whatever the repentance here mentioned may
          be, it is a repentance perfectly consistent with faith; and therefore
          we get the explanation of what repentance must be, from its being
          connected with the next command, "Believe the gospel." Then, dear
          friends, we may be sure that that unbelief which leads a man to think
          that his sin is too great for Christ to pardon it, is not the
          repentance meant here. Many who truly repent are tempted to believe
          that they are too great sinners for Christ to pardon. That, however,
          is not part of their repentance; it is a sin, a very great and
          grievous sin, for it is undervaluing the merit of Christ's blood; it
          is a denial of the truthfulness of God's promise; it is a detracting
          from the grace and favour of God who sent the gospel. Such a
          persuasion you must labour to get rid of, for it came from Satan, and
          not from the Holy Spirit. God the Holy Ghost never did teach a man
          that his sins were too great to be forgiven, for that would be to make
          God the Holy Spirit to teach a lie. If any of you have a thought of
          that kind this morning, be rid of it; it cometh from the powers of
          darkness, and not from the Holy Ghost; and if some of you are troubled
          because you never were haunted by that fear, be glad instead of being
          troubled. He can save you; be you as black as hell he can save you;
          and it is a wicked falsehood, and a high insult against the high
          majesty of divine love when you are tempted to believe that you are
          past the mercy of God. That is not repentance, but a foul sin against
          the infinite mercy of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, there is another spurious repentance which makes the sinner
          dwell upon the consequences of his sin, rather than upon the sin
          itself, and so keeps him from believing. I have known some sinners so
          distressed with fears of hell, and thoughts of death and of eternal
          judgment, that to use the words of one terrible preacher, "They have
          been shaken over the mouth of hell by their collar," and have felt the
          torments of the pit before they went thither. Dear friends, this is
          not repentance. Many a man has felt all that and has yet been lost.
          Look at many a dying man, tormented with remorse, who has had all its
          pangs and convictions, and yet has gone down to the grave without
          Christ and without hope. These things may come with repentance, but,
          they are not an essential part of it. That which is called law-work,
          in which the sinner is terrified with horrible thoughts that God's
          mercy is gone for ever, may be permitted by God for some special
          purpose, but it is not repentance; in fact, it may often be devilish
          rather than heavenly, for, as John Bunyan tells us, Diabolus doth
          often beat the great hell-drum in the ears of the men of Mansoul, to
          prevent their hearing the sweet trumpet of the gospel which
          proclaimeth pardon to them. I tell thee, sinner, any repentance that
          keeps thee from believing in Christ is a repentance that needs to be
          repented of; any repentance that makes thee think Christ will not save
          thee, goes beyond the truth and against the truth, and the sooner thou
          are rid of it the better. God deliver thee from it, for the repentance
          that will save thee is quite consistent with faith in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is, again, a false repentance which leads men to hardness of
          heart and despair. We have known some seared as with a hot iron by
          burning remorse. They have said, "I have done much evil; there is no
          hope for me; I will not hear the Word any more." If they hear it it is
          nothing to them, their hearts are hard as adamant. If they could once
          get the thought that God would forgive them, their hearts would flow
          in rivers of repentance; but no; they feel a kind of regret that they
          did wrong, but yet they go on in it all the same, feeling that there
          is no hope, and that they may as well continue to live as they were
          wont to do, and get the pleasures of sin since they cannot, as they
          think, have the pleasures of grace. Now, that is no repentance. It is
          a fire which hardens, and not the Lord's fire which melts; it may be a
          hammer, but it is a hammer used to knit the particles of your soul
          together, and not to break the heart. If, dear friends, you have never
          been the subject of these terrors do not desire them. Thank God if you
          have been brought to Jesus any how, but long not for needless horrors.
          Jesus saves you, not by what you feel, but by that finished work, that
          blood and righteousness which God accepted on your behalf. Do remember
          that no repentance is worth having which is not perfectly consistent
          with faith in Christ. An old saint, on his sick-bed, once used this
          remarkable expression; "Lord, sink me low as hell in repentance; but"
          -- and here is the beauty of it -- "lift me high as heaven in faith."
          Now, the repentance that sinks a man low as hell is of no use except
          there is faith also that lifts him as high as heaven, and the two are
          perfectly consistent one with the other. A man may loathe and detest
          himself, and all the while he may know that Christ is able to save,
          and has saved him. In fact, this is how true Christians live; they
          repent as bitterly as for sin as if they knew they should be damned
          for it; but they rejoice as much in Christ as if sin were nothing at
          all. Oh, how blessed it is to know where these two lines meet, the
          stripping of repentance, and the clothing of faith! The repentance
          that ejects sin as an evil tenant, and the faith which admits Christ
          to be the sole master of the heart; the repentance which purges the
          soul from dead works, and the faith that fills the soul with living
          works; the repentance which pulls down, and the faith which builds up;
          the repentance that scatters stones, and the faith which puts stones
          together; the repentance which ordains a time to weep, and the faith
          that gives a time to dance -- these two things together make up the
          work of grace within, whereby men's souls are saved. Be it, then laid
          down as a great truth, most plainly written in our text, that the
          repentance we ought to preach is one connected with faith, and thus we
          may preach repentance and faith together without any difficulty
          whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having shown you what this repentance is not, let us dwell for a
          moment on what it is. The repentance which is here commanded is the
          result of faith; it is born at the same time with faith -- they are
          twins, and to say which is the elder-born passes my knowledge. It is a
          great mystery; faith is before repentance in some of its acts, and
          repentance before faith in another view of it; the fact being that
          they come into the soul together. Now, a repentance which makes me
          weep and abhor my past life because of the love of Christ which has
          pardoned it, is the right repentance. When I can say, "My sin is
          washed away by Jesu's blood," and then repent because I so sinned as
          to make it necessary that Christ should die -- that dove-eyed
          repentance which looks at his bleeding wounds, and feels that her
          heart must bleed because she wounded Christ -- that broken heart that
          breaks because Christ was nailed to the cross for it -- that is the
          repentance which bringeth us salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the repentance which makes us avoid present sin because of the
          love of God who died for us, this also is saving repentance. If I
          avoid sin to-day because I am afraid of being lost if I commit it, I
          have not the repentance of a child of God; but when I avoid it and
          seek to lead a holy life because Christ loved me and gave himself up
          for me, and because I am not my own, but am bought with a price, this
          is the work of the Spirit of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And again, that change of mind, that after-carefulness which leads me
          to resolve that in future I will live like Jesus, and will not live
          unto the lusts of the flesh, because he hath redeemed me, not with
          corruptible things as silver and gold, but with his own precious blood
          -- that is the repentance which will save me, and the repentance he
          asks of me. O ye nations of the earth, he asks not the repentance of
          Mount Sinai, while ye do fear and shake because his lightnings are
          abroad; but he asks you to weep and wail because of him; to look on
          him whom you have pierced, and to mourn for him as a man mourneth for
          his only son; he bids you remember that you nailed the Saviour to the
          tree, and asks that this argument may make you hate the murderous sins
          which fastened the Saviour there, and put the Lord of glory to an
          ignominious and an accursed death. This is the only repentance we have
          to preach; not law and terrors; not despair; not driving men to
          self-murder -- this is the terror of the world which worketh death;
          but godly sorrow is a sorrow unto salvation though Jesus Christ our
          Lord.

          This brings me to the second half of the command, which is, "Believe
          the gospel." Faith means trust in Christ. Now, I must again remark
          that some have preached this trust in Christ so well and so fully,
          that I can admire their faithfulness and bless God for them; yet there
          is a difficulty and a danger; it may be that in preaching simple trust
          in Christ as being the way of salvation, that they omit to remind the
          sinner that no faith can be genuine but such as is perfectly
          consistent with repentance for past sin; for my text seems to me to
          put it thus: no repentance is true but that which consorts with faith;
          no faith is true but that which is linked with a hearty and sincere
          repentance on account of past sin. So then, dear friends, those people
          who have a faith which allows them to think lightly of past sin, have
          the faith of devils, and not the faith of God's elect. Those who say,
          "Oh, as for the past, that is nothing; Jesus Christ has washed all
          that away"; and can talk about all the crimes of their youth, and the
          iniquitous of their riper years, as if they were mere trifles, and
          never think of shedding a tear; never feel their souls ready to burst
          because they should have been such great offenders -- such men who can
          trifle with the past, and even fight their battles o'er again when
          their passions are too cold for new rebellions -- I say that such who
          think sin a trifle and have never sorrowed on account of it, may know
          that their faith is not genuine. Such men as have a faith which allows
          them to live carelessly in the present who say, "Well, I am saved by a
          simple faith"; and then sit on the ale-bench with the drunkard, or
          stand at the bar with the spirit-drinker, or go into worldly company
          and enjoy the carnal pleasures and the lusts of the flesh, such men
          are liars; they have not the faith which will save the soul. They have
          a deceitful hypocrisy; they have not the faith which will bring them
          to heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, there be some other people who have a faith which leads them
          to no hatred of sin. They do not look upon sin in others with any kind
          of shame. It is true they would not do as others do, but then they can
          laugh at what others commit. They take pleasure in the vices of
          others; laugh at their profane jests, and smile at their loose
          speeches. They do not flee from sin as from a serpent, nor detest it
          as the murderer of their best friend. No, they dally with it; they
          make excuses for it; they commit in private what in public they
          condemn. They call grave offences slight faults and little
          defalcations; and in business they wink at departures from
          uprightness, and consider them to be mere matters of trade; the fact
          being that they have a faith which will sit down arm-in-arm with sin,
          and eat and drink at the same table with unrighteousness. Oh! if any
          of you have such a faith as this, I pray God to turn it out bag and
          baggage. It is of no good to you; the sooner you are cleaned out of it
          the better for you, for when this sandy foundation shall all be washed
          away, perhaps you may then begin to build upon the rock. My dear
          friends, I would be very faithful with your souls, and would lay the
          lancet at each man's heart. What is your repentance? Have you a
          repentance that leads you to look out of self to Christ, and to Christ
          only? On the other hand, have you that faith which leads you to true
          repentance; to hate the very thought of sin; so that the dearest idol
          you have known, whatever it may be, you desire to tear from its throne
          that you may worship Christ, and Christ only? Be assured of this, that
          nothing short of this will be of any use to you at the last. A
          repentance and a faith of any other sort may do to please you now, as
          children are pleased with fancies; but when you get on a death-bed,
          and see the reality of things, you will be compelled to say that they
          are a falsehood and a refuge of lies. You will find that you have been
          daubed with untempered mortar; that you have said, "Peace, peace," to
          yourselves, when there was no peace. Again, I say, in the words of
          Christ, "Repent and believe the gospel." Trust Christ to save you, and
          lament that you need to be saved, and mourn because this need of yours
          has put the Saviour to open shame, to frightful sufferings, and to a
          terrible death.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But we must pass on to a third remark. These commands of Christ
          are of the most reasonable character.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it an unreasonable thing to demand of a man that he should repent?
          You have a person who has offended you; you are ready to forgive him;
          do you think it is at all exacting or overbearing if you ask of him an
          apology; if you merely ask him, as the very least thing he can do, to
          acknowledge that he has done wrong? "No," say you, "I should think I
          showed my kindness in accepting rather than any harshness in demanding
          an apology from him." So God, against whom we have rebelled, who is
          our liege sovereign and monarch, seeth it to be inconsistent with the
          dignity of his kingship to absolve an offender who expresseth no
          contrition; and I say again, is this a harsh, exacting, unreasonable
          command? Doth God in this mode act like Solomon, who made the taxes of
          his people heavy? Rather doth he not ask of you that which your heart,
          if it were in a right state, would be but too willing to give, only
          too thankful that the Lord in his grace has said, "He that confesseth
          his sin shall find mercy"? Why, dear friends, do you expect to be
          saved while you are in your sins? Are you to be allowed to love your
          iniquities, and yet go to heaven? What, you think to have poison in
          your veins, and yet be healthy? What, man, keep the thief in doors,
          and yet be acquitted of dishonesty? Be stained, and yet be thought
          spotless? Harbour the disease and yet be in health? Ridiculous!
          Absurd! Repentance is founded on the necessity of things. The demand
          for a change of heart is absolutely necessary; it is but a reasonable
          service. O that men were reasonable, and they would repent; it is
          because they are not reasonable that it needs the Holy Spirit to teach
          their reason right reason before they will repent and believe the
          gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, again, believing; is that an unreasonable thing to ask of
          you? For a creature to believe its Creator is but a duty; altogether
          apart from the promise of salvation, I say, God has a right to demand
          of the creature that he has made, that he should believe what he tells
          him. And what is it he asks you to believe? Anything hideous,
          contradictory, irrational? It may be above reason, but it is not
          contrary to reason. He asks you to believe that through the blood of
          Jesus Christ, he can still be just, and yet the justifier of the
          ungodly. He asks you to trust in Christ to save you. Can you expect
          that he will save you if you will not trust him? Have you really the
          hardihood to think that he will carry you to heaven while all the
          while you declare he cannot do it? Do you think it consistent with the
          dignity of a Saviour to save you while you say, "I do not believe thou
          art a Saviour, and I will not trust thee"? Is it consistent with his
          dignity for him to save you, and suffer you to remain an unbelieving
          sinner, doubting his grace, mistrusting his love, slandering his
          character, doubting the efficacy of his blood, and of his plea? Why,
          man, it is the most reasonable thing in the world that he should
          demand of thee that thou shouldst believe in Christ. And this he doth
          demand of thee this morning. "Repent and believe the gospel." O
          friends, O friends, how sad, how sad is the state of man's soul when
          he will not do this! We may preach to you, but you never will repent
          and believe the gospel. We may lay God's command, like an axe, to the
          root of the tree, but, reasonable as these commands are, you will
          still refuse to give God his due; you will go on in your sins; you
          will not come unto him that you may have life; and it is here the
          Spirit of God must come in to work in the souls of the elect to make
          them willing in the day of his power. But oh! in God's name I warn you
          that, if, after hearing this command, you do, as I know you will do,
          without his Spirit, continue to refuse obedience to so reasonable a
          gospel, you shall find at the last it shall be more tolerable for
          Sodom and Gomorrah, than for you; for had the things which are
          preached in London been proclaimed in Sodom and Gomorrah, they would
          have repented long ago in sackcloth and in ashes. Woe unto you,
          inhabitants of London! Woe unto you, subjects of the British Empire!
          for if the truths which have been declared in your streets had been
          preached to Tyre and Sidon, they would have continued even unto this
          day.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. But still, to pass on, I have yet a fourth remark to make, and
          that is, this is a command which demands immediate obedience. I do not
          know how it is, let us preach as we may, we cannot lead others to
          think that there is any great alarm, that there is any reason why they
          should think about their souls now. Last night there was a review on
          Wimbledon Common, and living not very far away from it, I could hear
          in one perpetual roll the cracks of the rifles and the thunder of
          cannon. One remarked to me, "Supposing there really were war there, we
          should not sit quite so comfortably in our room with our window open,
          listening to all this noise." No; and so when people come to chapel,
          they hear a sermon about repentance and faith; they listen to it.
          "What do you think of it?" "Oh -- very well." But suppose it were
          real; suppose they believed it to be real, would they sit quite so
          comfortably? Would they be quite so easy? Ah, no! But you do not think
          it is real. You do not think that the God who made you actually asks
          of you this day that you should repent and believe. Yes, sirs, but it
          is real, and it is your procrastination, it is your self-confidence
          that is the sham, the bubble that is soon to burst. God's demand is
          the solemn reality, and if you could but hear it as it should be heard
          you would escape from your lives and flee for refuge to the hope that
          is set before you in the gospel, and you would do this to-day. This is
          the command of Christ, I say, to-day. To-day is God's time. "To-day if
          ye will hear his voice, harden not your heart, as in the provocation."
          "To-day," the gospel always cries, for if it tolerated sin a single
          day, it were an unholy gospel. If the gospel told men to repent of sin
          to-morrow, it would give them an allowance to continue in it to-day,
          and that would indeed be to pander to men's lusts. But the gospel
          maketh a clean sweep of sin, and demandeth of man that he should throw
          down the weapons of his rebellion now. Down with them, man! every one
          of them. Down, sir, down with them, and down with them now! You must
          not keep one of them; throw them down at once! The gospel challengeth
          him that he believe in Jesus now. So long as thou continuest in
          unbelief thou continuest in sin, and art increasing thy sin; and to
          give thee leave to be an unbeliever for an hour, were to pander to thy
          lusts; therefore it demandeth of thee faith, and faith now, for this
          is God's time, and the time which holiness must demand of a sinner.
          Besides, sinner, it is thy time. This is the only time thou canst call
          thine own. To-morrow! Is there such a thing? In what calendar is it
          written save in the almanack of the fool? To-morrow! Oh, how hast thou
          ruined multitudes! "To-morrow," say men; but like the hind-wheel of a
          chariot, they are always near to the front-wheel, always near to their
          duty; they still go on, and on, but never get one whit the nearer,
          for, travel as they may, to-morrow is still a little beyond them --
          but a little, and so they never come to Christ at all. This is how
          they speak, as an ancient poet said --
        </p>
        <p>"'I will to-morrow, that I will, I will be sure to do it';</p>
        <p>To-morrow comes, to-morrow goes, And still thou art 'to do it';</p>
        <p>Thus, then, repentance is deferred from one day to another,</p>
        <p>Until the day of death is one, And judgment is the other."</p>
        <p>
          O sons of men, always to be blessed, to be obedient, but never
          obedient, when will ye learn to be wise? This is your only time; it is
          God's time, and this is the best time. You will never find it easier
          to repent than now; you will never find it easier to believe than now.
          It is impossible now except the Spirit of God be with you; it will be
          as impossible to-morrow; but if now you would believe and repent, the
          Spirit of God is in the gospel which I preach; and while I cry out to
          thee in God's name, "Repent and believe," he that bade me command you
          thus to do gives power with the command, that even as Christ spake to
          the waves and said, "Be still," and they were still, and to the winds,
          "Be calm,", and they were quiet, so when we speak to your proud heart
          it yields because of the grace that accompanies the word, and you
          repent and believe the gospel. So may it be, and may the message of
          this morning gather out the elect, and make them willing in the day of
          God's power.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, lastly, this command, while it has an immediate power, has
          also a continual force. "Repent ye, and believe the gospel," is advice
          to the young beginner, and it is advice to the old grey-headed
          Christian, for this is our life all the way through -- "Repent ye, and
          believe the gospel." St. Anselm, who was a saint -- and that is more
          than many of them were who were called so -- St. Anselm once cried out
          "Oh! sinner that I have been, I will spend all the rest of my life in
          repenting of my whole life!" And Rowland Hill, whom I think I might
          call St. Rowland, when he was near death, said he had one regret, and
          that was that a dear friend who had lived with him for sixty years
          would have to leave him at the gate of heaven. "That dear friend,"
          said he, "is repentance; repentance has been with me all my life, and
          I think I shall drop a tear," said the good man, "as I go through the
          gates, to think that I can repent no more." Repentance is the daily
          and hourly duty of a man who believes in Christ; and as we walk by
          faith from the wicket gate to the celestial city, so our right-hand
          companion all the journey through must be repentance. Why, dear
          friend, the Christian man, after he is saved, repents more than he
          ever did before, for now he repents not merely of overt deeds, but
          even of imaginations. He will take himself to task at night, and chide
          himself because he had tolerated one foul thought; because he has
          looked on vanity, though perhaps the heart had gone no further than
          the look of lust; because the thought of evil has flitted through the
          mind -- for all this he will vex himself before God; and were it not
          that he still continues to believe the gospel, one foul imagination
          would be such a plague and sting to him, that he would have no peace
          and rest. When temptation comes to him the good man finds the use of
          repentance, for having hated sin and fled from it of old, he has
          ceased to be what he once was. One of the ancient fathers, we are
          told, had, before his conversion, lived with an ill woman, and some
          little time after, she accosted him as usual. Knowing how likely he
          was to fall into sin he ran away with all his might, and she ran after
          him, crying, "Wherefore runnest thou away? It is I." He answered, "I
          run away because I am not I; I am a new man." Now, it is just that, "I
          am not I," which keeps the Christian out of sin; that hating of the
          former "I," that repenting of the old sin that maketh him run from
          evil, abhor it, and look not upon it, lest by his eyes he should be
          led into sin. Dear friend, the more the Christian man knows of
          Christ's love, the more will he hate himself to think that he has
          sinned against such love. Every doctrine of the gospel will make a
          Christian man repent. Election, for instance. "How could I sin," saith
          he. "I that was God's favourite, chosen of him from before the
          foundation of the world?" Final perseverance will make him repent.
          "How can I sin," says he, "that am loved so much and kept so surely?
          How can I be so villainous as to sin against everlasting mercy?" Take
          any doctrine you please, the Christian will make it a fount for sacred
          woe; and there are times when his faith in Christ will be so strong
          that his repentance will burst its bonds, and will cry with George
          Herbert --
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, who will give me tears?</p>
        <p>Come, all ye springs,</p>
        <p>Ye clouds and rain dwell in my eyes,</p>
        <p>My grief hath need of all the wat'ry things</p>
        <p>That nature hath produc'd. Let ev'ry vein</p>
        <p>Suck up a river to supply mine eyes,</p>
        <p>My weary weeping eyes; too dry for me,</p>
        <p>Unless they set new conduits, new supplies</p>
        <p>To bear them out, and with my state agree."</p>
        <p>
          And all this is because he murdered Christ; because his sin nailed the
          Saviour to the tree; and therefore he weepeth and mourneth even to his
          life's end. Sinning, repenting, and believing -- these are three
          things that will keep with us till we die. Sinning will stop at the
          river Jordan; repentance will die triumphing over the dead body of
          sin; and faith itself, though perhaps it may cross the stream, will
          cease to be so needful as it has been here, for there we shall see
          even as we are seen, and shall know even as we are known.
        </p>
        <p>
          I send you away when I have once again solemnly declared my Master's
          will to you this morning, "Repent ye, and believe the gospel." Here
          are some of you come from foreign countries, and many of you are from
          our provincial towns in England; you came here, perhaps, to hear the
          preacher of whom many a strange thing has been said. Well and good,
          and may stranger things still be said if they will but bring men under
          the sound of the Word that they may be blessed. Now, this I have to
          say to you this morning: In that great day when a congregation ten
          thousand times larger than this shall be assembled, and on the great
          white throne the Judge shall sit, there will be not a man, or woman,
          or child, who is here this morning, able to make excuse and say, "I
          did not hear the gospel; I did not know what I must do to be saved!"
          You have heard it: "Repent ye, and believe the gospel." That is, trust
          Christ; believe that he is able and willing to save you. But there is
          something better. In that great day, I say, there will be some of you
          present -- oh! let us hope all of us -- who will be able to say,
          "Thank God that ever I yielded up the weapons of my proud rebellion by
          repentance; thank God that I looked to Christ, and took him to be my
          Saviour from first to last; for here am I, a monument of grace, a
          sinner saved by blood, to praise him while time and eternity shall
          last!" God grant that we may meet each other at the last with joy and
          not with grief! I will be a swift witness against you to condemn you
          if you believe not this gospel; but if you repent and believe, then we
          shall praise that grace which turned our hearts, and so gave us the
          repentance which led us to trust Christ, and the faith which is the
          effectual gift of the Holy Spirit. What shall I say more unto you?
          Wherefore, wherefore will you reject this? If I have spoken to you of
          fables, of fictions, of dreams, then turn on your heel and reject my
          discourse. If I have spoken in my own name, who am I that you should
          care one whit for me? But if I have preached that which Christ
          preached, "Repent ye, and believe the gospel," I charge you by the
          living God, I charge you by the world's Redeemer, I charge you by
          cross of Calvary, and by the blood which stained the dust at Golgotha,
          obey this divine message and you shall have eternal life; but refuse
          it, and on your heads be your blood for ever and ever!<br />
