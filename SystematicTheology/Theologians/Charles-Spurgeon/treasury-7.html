          David appears before God to plead with him against the Accuser, who
          had charged him with treason and treachery. The case is here opened
          with an avowal of confidence in God. Whatever may be the emergency of
          our condition, we shall never find it amiss to retain our reliance
          upon our God.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          "O Lord my God," mine by a special covenant, sealed by Jesus' blood,
          and ratified in my own soul by a sense of union to you; "in you," and
          in you only, "do I put my trust," even now in my sore distress. I
          shake, but my rock moves not.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is never right to distrust God, and never vain to trust him. And
          now, with both divine relationship and holy trust to strengthen him,
          David utters the burden of his desire, "save me from all those who
          persecute me." His pursuers were very many, and any one of them cruel
          enough to devour him; he cries, therefore, for salvation from them
          all. We should never think our prayers complete, until we ask for
          preservation from <i>all sin</i>, and all enemies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "And deliver me," extricate me from their snares, acquit me of their
          accusations, give a true and just deliverance in this trial of my
          injured character. See how clearly his case is stated; let us see to
          it, that we know what we would have, when we are come to the throne of
          mercy. Pause a little while before you pray, that you may not offer
          the sacrifice of fools. Get a distinct idea of your need, and then you
          can pray with the more fluency of fervency.
        </p>

          ><b> <p align="justify">Verse 2.</p></b></font
        >"Lest he tear my soul." Here is the plea of <i>fear </i>co-working with
        the plea of <i>faith</i>. There was one among David's foes mightier that
        the rest, who had both dignity, strength, and ferocity, and was,
        therefore, "like a lion." From this foe he urgently seeks deliverance.
        Perhaps this was Saul, his royal enemy; but in our own case there is one
        who goes about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour,
        concerning whom we should ever cry, "Deliver us from the Evil One!"

        <p align="justify">
          Notice the vigor of the description, "rending it in pieces, while
          there is none to deliver." It is a picture from the shepherd-life of
          David. When the fierce lion had pounced upon the defenseless lamb, and
          had made it his prey, he would rend the victim in pieces, break all
          the bones, and devour all, because no shepherd was near to protect the
          lamb or rescue it from the ravenous beast.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This is a soul-moving portrait of a saint delivered over to the will
          of Satan. This will make the affections of Jehovah yearn. A father
          cannot be silent, when a child is in such peril. No, he will not
          endure the thought of his darling child in the jaws of a lion — he
          will arise and deliver his persecuted one. Our God is very pitiful,
          and he will surely rescue his people from so desperate a destruction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It will be well for us here to remember that this is a description of
          the danger to which the Psalmist was exposed from slanderous tongues.
          Truly this is not an overdrawn picture, for the wounds of a
          <i> sword </i>will heal, but the wounds of the <i>tongue </i>cut
          deeper than the flesh, and are not soon cured!
          <i>Slander leaves a slur</i>, even if it be wholly disproved. Common
          fame, although notoriously a common liar, has very many believers.
          Once let an slanderous word get into men's mouths — and it is not easy
          to get it fully out again. The Italians say that good reputation is
          like the cypress, once cut it never puts forth leaf again; this is not
          true if our character be cut by a stranger's hand, but even then it
          will not soon regain its former verdure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Oh, 'tis a baseness most detestable, to stab a good man in his
          reputation, but diabolical hatred observes no nobility in its mode of
          warfare. We must be ready for this trial, for it will surely come upon
          us. If <i>God </i>was slandered in Eden — we shall surely be maligned
          in this land of sinners. Gird up your loins, children of the
          resurrection, for this fiery trial awaits you all.

        >The second part of this wandering hymn contains a protestation of
        innocence, and an invocation of wrath upon his own head, if he were not
        clear from the evil imputed to him. So far from hiding treasonable
        intentions in his hands, or ungratefully requiting the peaceful deeds of
        a friend — he had even allowed his enemy to escape when he had him
        completely in his power. Twice had he spared Saul's life; once in the
        cave of Adullam, and again when he found him sleeping in the midst of
        his slumbering camp: he could, therefore, with a clear conscience, make
        his appeal to Heaven.<i>

        <p align="justify">
          Yet is the imprecation a most solemn one, and only justifiable through
          the extremity of the occasion, and the nature of the dispensation
          under which the Psalmist lived. We are commanded by our Lord Jesus to
          let our yes be yes, and our nay, nay: "for whatever is more than this,
          comes of evil." If we cannot be believed on our word, we are surely
          not to be trusted on our oath; for
          <i
            >to a true Christian his simple word is as binding as another man's
            oath</i
          >. Especially beware, O unconverted men! of trifling with solemn
          imprecations. Remember the woman at Devizes, who wished she might die
          if she had not paid her share in a joint purchase, and who fell dead
          there and then with the money in her hand"
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">Selah.</p></i>David enhances the solemnity of
        this appeal to the dread tribunal of God, by the use of the usual pause.
        <p align="justify">
          From these verses we may learn that no innocence can shield a man from
          the calumnies of the wicked. David had been scrupulously careful to
          avoid any appearance of rebellion against Saul, whom he constantly
          styled "the Lord's anointed;" but all this could not protect him from
          <i>lying tongues</i>. As the shadow follows the substance — so envy
          pursues goodness. It is only at the tree laden with fruit, that men
          throw stones. If we would live without being slandered, we must wait
          until we get to Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us be very heedful not to believe the <i>flying rumors </i>which
          are always harassing gracious men. If there are no believers in such
          slander, there will be but a dull market in falsehood, and good men's
          characters will be safe. Ill-will never spoke well. Sinners have an
          ill-will to saints, and therefore, be sure they will not speak well of
          them.

        made.<i>

          "Arise, O Lord, in your anger." His sorrow makes him view the Lord as
          a judge who had left the judgment-seat and retired into his rest.

          "Lift up yourself because of the rage of my enemies" — a still
          stronger figure to express his anxiety that the Lord would assume his
          authority and mount the throne. Stand up, O God, rise above them all,
          and let your justice tower above their villainies.

          "Awake for me to the judgment that you have commanded." This is a
          bolder utterance still, for it implies sleep as well as inactivity,
          and can only be applied to God in a very limited sense. He never
          slumbers, yet does he often <i>seem </i>to do so; for the wicked
          prevail, and the saints are trodden in the dust. God's silence is the
          patience of longsuffering, and if wearisome to the saints, they should
          bear it cheerfully in the hope that sinners may thereby be led to
          repentance.

        shall crowd to your tribunal with their complaints, or shall surround it
        with their solemn homage: "for their sakes therefore return on high." As
        when a judge travels at the assizes, all men take their cases to his
        court that they may be heard, so will the righteous gather to their
        Lord.
        <p align="justify">
          Here he fortifies himself in prayer by pleading that if the Lord will
          mount the throne of judgment, multitudes of the saints would be
          blessed as well as himself. If I am too base to be remembered, yet,
          "for their sakes," for the love you bear to your chosen people, come
          forth from your secret pavilion, and sit in the gate dispensing
          justice among the people. When my suit includes the desires of all the

        If I am not mistaken, David has now seen in the eye of his mind, the
        Lord ascending to his judgment-seat, and beholding him seated there in
        royal state, he draws near to him to urge his suit anew. In the last two
        verses he besought Jehovah to arise, and now that he is arisen, he
        prepares to mingle with "the congregation of the people" who compass the
        Lord about. The royal heralds proclaim the opening of the court with the
        solemn words, "The Lord shall judge the people." Our petitioner rises at
        once, and cries with earnestness and humility, "Judge me, O Lord,
        according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is
        in me." His hand is on an honest heart, and his cry is to a righteous
        Judge.

        universal longing of the whole company of the elect? When shall we be
        delivered from the filthy conversation of these Sodomites? When shall we
        escape from the filthiness of Mesech and the blackness of the tents of

          "He <i>travails </i>with iniquity." He is full of it, pained until he

          his evil intent is executed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "He has <i>conceived </i>mischief." This is the original of his base
          design. The devil has had doings with him, and the virus of evil is in
          him. And now behold the progeny of this unhallowed conception. The
          child is worthy of its father, his name of old was, "the father of
          lies," and the birth does not belie the parent, for he brought forth
          falsehood. Thus, one figure is carried out to perfection; the Psalmist
          now illustrates his meaning by another, taken from the stratagems of
          the hunter.

        industrious in his labors. He stooped to the dirty work of digging. He
        did not fear to soil his own hands, he was willing to work in a ditch,
        if others might fall therein. What base things men will do to wreak
        revenge on the godly. They hunt for good men, as if they were brute
        beasts; nay, they will not give them the fair chase afforded to the hare
        or the fox, but must secretly <i>entrap </i>them, because they can
        neither run them down nor shoot them down. Our enemies will not meet us
        to the face, for they fear us as much as they pretend to despise us. But
        let us look on to the end of the scene.
        <p align="justify">
          The verse says, he "is fallen into the ditch which he made." Ah! there

          has brought him a goodly victim. Aha, aha, so should it ever be. Come
          hither and make merry with this entrapped hunter, this
          <i>biter </i>who has bitten himself. Give him no pity, for it will be
          wasted on such a wretch. He is but rightly and richly rewarded by
          being paid in his own coin. He cast forth evil from his mouth, and it
          has fallen into his bosom. He has set his own house on fire with the
          torch which he lit to burn a neighbor's.
          <i>He sent forth a foul bird, and it has come back to its nest.</i>

        young chickens, they always come home to roost. Ashes always fly back in
        the face of him who throws them. "As he loved cursing — so let it come
        unto him." (Psalm 109:17.)

          How often has this been the case in the histories of both ancient and
          modern times. Men have burned their own fingers, when they were hoping
          to brand their neighbor. And if this does not happen now, it will
          hereafter. The Lord has caused dogs to lick the blood of Ahab, in the
          midst of the vineyard of Naboth. Sooner or later, the evil deeds of
          persecutors have always leaped back into their arms. So it will be in
          the last great day, when Satan's fiery darts shall all be quivered in
          his own heart, and all his followers shall reap the harvest which they
          themselves have sown!

        We conclude with the joyful contrast. In this all these Psalms are
        agreed; they all exhibit the blessedness of the righteous, and make its
        colors the more glowing by contrast with the miseries of the wicked. The
        bright jewel sparkles in a black foil. Praise is the occupation of the
        godly, their eternal work, and their present pleasure. Singing is the
        fitting embodiment for praise, and therefore do the saints make melody
        before the Lord Almighty. The slandered one is now a singer: his harp
        was unstrung for a very little season, and now we leave him sweeping its
        harmonious chords, and flying on their music to the third Heaven of
        adoring praise.

          "To bless God for <i>mercies</i> is the way to increase them; to bless
          him for <i>miseries</i> is the way to remove them. No good lives so
          long, as that which is thankfully improved. No evil dies so soon, as
          that which is patiently endured." William Dyer.
