        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.228)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, December 12th, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>"When I see the blood, I will pass over you." -- Exodus 12:13.</p>
        <p>
          GOD'S PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS SAFE. "All the saints are in his hand;" and
          the hand of God is a place for safety, as well as a place of honour.
          Nothing can hurt the man who has made his refuge God. "Thou hast given
          commandment to save me," said David; and every believing child of God
          may say the same. Plague, famine, war, tempest, -- all these have
          received commandment of God to save his people. Though the earth
          should rock beneath the feet of man, yet the Christian, may stand
          fast, and though the heavens should be rolled up, and the firmament
          should pass away like a scroll that is burned by fervent heat, yet
          need not a Christian fear; God's people shall be saved: if they cannot
          be saved under the heavens, they shall be saved in the heavens; if
          there be no safety for them in the time of trouble upon this solid
          earth, they shall be "caught up together with the Lord in the air, and
          so shall they be ever with the Lord," and ever safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, at the time of which this Book of Exodus speaks, Egypt was
          exposed to a terrible peril. Jehovah himself was about to march
          through the streets of all the cities of Egypt. It was not merely a
          destroying angel, but Jehovah himself; for thus it is written, "I will
          pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the
          first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast." No one less than
          I AM, the great God, had vowed to "cut Rahab" with the sword of
          vengeance. Tremble, ye inhabitants of the earth, for God has come down
          among you, provoked, incensed, and at last awakened from his seeming
          sleep of patience. He has girded on his terrible sword, and he has
          come to smite you. Quake for fear, all ye that have sin within you,
          for when God walks through the streets, sword in hand, will he not
          smite you all? But hark! the voice of covenant mercy speaks, God's
          children are safe, even though an angry God be in the streets. As they
          are safe from the rod of the wicked, so are they safe from the sword
          of justice -- always and ever safe; for there was not a hair of the
          head of an Israelite that was so much as touched; Jehovah kept them
          safe beneath his wings. While he did rend his enemies like a lion, yet
          did he protect his children, every one of them. But, beloved, while
          this is always true, that God's people are safe, there is another fact
          that is equally true, namely, that God's people are only safe through
          the blood. The reason why God spares his people in the time of
          calamity is, because he sees the blood-mark on their brow. What is the
          basis of that great truth, that all things work together for good to
          them that love God? What is the cause that all things so produce good
          to them, but this, that they are bought with the precious blood of
          Christ? Therefore it is that nothing can hurt them, because the blood
          is upon them, and every evil thing must pass them by. It was so that
          night in Egypt. God himself was abroad with his sword; but he spared
          them, because he saw the blood-mark on the lintel and on the two
          sideposts. And so it is with us. In the day when God in his fierce
          anger shall come forth from his dwelling place, to affright the earth
          with terrors and to condemn the wicked, we shall be secure, if covered
          with the Saviour's righteousness, and sprinkled with his blood, we are
          found in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do I hear some one say, that I am now coming to an old subject? This
          thought struck me when I was preparing for preaching, that I should
          have to tell you an old story over again; and just as I was thinking
          of that, happening to turn over a book, I met with an anecdote of
          Judson the missionary to Burmah. He had passed through unheard-of
          hardships, and had performed dangerous exploits for his Master. He
          returned, after thirty years' absence, to America. "Announced to
          address an assembly in a provincial town, and a vast concourse having
          gathered from great distances to hear him, he rose at the close of the
          usual service, and, as all eyes were fixed and every year attent, he
          spoke for about fifteen minutes, with much pathos, of the precious
          Saviour, of what he had done for us, and of what we owed to him; and
          he sat down, visibly affected. "The people are very much
          disappointed," said a friend to him on their way home; "they wonder
          you did not talk of something else." "Why what did they want?" he
          replied: "I presented, to the best of my ability, the most interesting
          subject in the world." "But they wanted something different -- a
          story" "Well, I am sure I gave them a story -- the most thrilling one
          that can be conceived of." "But they had beard it before. They wanted
          something new of a man who had just come from the antipodes." "Then I
          am glad they have it to say, that a man coming from the antipodes had
          nothing better to tell than the wondrous story of the dying love of
          Jesus. My business is to preach the gospel of Christ; and when I can
          speak at all, I dare not trifle with my commission. When I looked upon
          those people to-day, and remembering where I should next meet them,
          how could I stand up and furnish food to vain curiosity -- tickle
          their fancy with amusing stories, however decently strung together on
          a thread of religion? That is not what Christ meant by preaching the
          gospel. And then how could I hereafter meet the fearful charge, I gave
          you one opportunity to tell them of ME; you spent it in describing
          your own adventures!'" So I thought. Well, if Judson told the old
          story after he had been thirty years away, and could not find anything
          better, I will just go back to this old subject, which is always new
          and always fresh to us -- the precious blood of Christ, by which we
          are saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, then, the blood; secondly, its efficacy; thirdly, the one
          condition appended to it; -- "When I see the blood;" and fourthly, the
          practical lesson.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, THE BLOOD ITSELF. In the case of the Israelites it was
          the blood of the Paschal Lamb. In our case, beloved, it is the blood
          of the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The blood of which I have solemnly to speak this morning, is, first
          of all, the blood of a divinely appointed victim. Jesus Christ did not
          come into this world unappointed. He was sent here by his Father. This
          indeed is one of the underlying ground-works of the Christian's hope.
          We can rely upon Jesus Christ's acceptance by his Father, because his
          Father ordained him to be our Saviour from before the foundation of
          the world. Sinner! when I preach to thee the blood of Christ this
          morning, I am preaching something that is well pleasing to God; for
          God himself did choose Christ to be the Redeemer; he himself set him
          apart from before the foundation of the world, and he himself, even
          Jehovah the Father, did lay upon him the iniquity of us all. The
          sacrifice of Christ is not brought to you without warrant; it is not a
          something which Christ did surreptitiously and in secret; it was
          written in the great decree from all eternity, that he was the Lamb
          slain from before the foundation of the world. As he himself said, "Lo
          I come; in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do
          thy will O God." It is God's will that the blood of Jesus should be
          shed. Jesus is God's chosen Saviour for men; and here, when addressing
          the ungodly, here, I say, is one potent argument with them. Sinner!
          You may trust in Christ, that he is able to save you from the wrath of
          God, for God himself has appointed him to save.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Christ Jesus, too, like the lamb, was not only a divinely appointed
          victim, but he was spotless. Had there been one sin in Christ, he had
          not been capable of being our Saviour; but he was without spot or
          blemish -- without original sin, without any practical transgression.
          In him was no sin, though he was "tempted in all points like as we
          are." Here, again, is the reason why the blood is able to save,
          because it is the blood of an innocent victim, a victim the only
          reason for whose death lay in us, and not in himself. When the poor
          innocent lamb was put to death, by the head of the household of Egypt,
          I can imagine that thoughts like these ran through his mind. "Ah" he
          would say, as he struck the knife into the lamb, "This poor creature
          dies, not for any guilt that it has ever had, but to show me that I am
          guilty, and that I deserved to die like this." Turn, then, your eye to
          the cross, and see Jesus bleeding there and dying for you. Remember,
        </p>
        <p>"For sins not his own, he died to atone;"</p>
        <p>
          Sin had no foothold in him, never troubled him. The prince of this
          world came and looked, but he said, "I have nothing in Christ; there
          is no room for me to plant my foot -- no piece of corrupt ground,
          which I may call my own." O sinner, the blood of Jesus is able to save
          thee, because he was perfectly innocent himself, and "he died the just
          for the unjust, to bring us to God."
        </p>
        <p>
          But some will say, "Whence has the blood of Christ such power to
          save?" My reply is, not only because God appointed that blood, and
          because it was the blood of an innocent and spotless being, but
          because Christ himself was God. If Christ were a mere man, my hearers,
          you could not be exhorted to trust him; were he ever so spotless and
          holy, there would be no efficacy in his blood to save; but Christ was
          "very God of very God;" the blood that Jesus shed was Godlike blood.
          It was the blood of man, for he was man like ourselves; but the
          divinity was so allied with the manhood, that the blood derived
          efficacy from it. Can you imagine what must be the value of the blood
          of God's own dear Son? No, you cannot put an estimate upon it that
          should so much as reach to a millionth part of its preciousness. I
          know you esteem that blood as beyond all price if you have been washed
          in it; but I know also that you do not esteem it enough. It was the
          wonder of angels that God should condescend to die; it will be the
          wonder of all wonders, the unceasing wonder of eternity, that God
          should become man to die. Oh! when we think that Christ was Creator of
          the world, and that on his all-sustaining shoulders did hang the
          universe, we cannot wonder that his death is mighty to redeem, and
          that his blood should cleanse from sin. Come hither saints and
          sinners; gather in and crowd around the cross, and see this man,
          overcome with weakness, fainting, groaning, bleeding, and dying. This
          man is also "God over all, blessed for ever," Is there not power to
          save? Is there not efficacy in blood like that? Can you imagine any
          stretch of sin which shall out-measure the power of divinity -- any
          height of iniquity that shall overtop the topless steeps of the
          divine? Can I conceive a depth of sin that shall be deeper than the
          infinite? or a breadth of iniquity that shall be broader than the
          Godhead? Because he is divine, he is "able to save to the uttermost,
          them that come unto God by him." Divinity appointed, spotless, and
          divine, his blood is the blood whereby ye may escape the anger and the
          wrath of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Once more; the blood of which we speak today, is blood once shed
          for many for the remission of sin. The paschal lamb was killed every
          year; but now Christ hath appeared to take away sin by the offering up
          of himself and there is now no more mention of sin, for Christ once
          for all hath put away sin, by the offering of himself. The Jew had the
          lamb every morning and every evening, for there was a continual
          mention of sin; the blood of the lamb could not take it away. The lamb
          availed for to-day, but there was the sin of to-morrow, what was to be
          done with that? Why, a fresh victim must bleed. But oh, my hearer, our
          greatest joy is, that the blood of Jesus has been once shed, and he
          has said, "It is finished." There is no more need of the blood of
          bulls or of goats, or of any other sacrifice; that one sacrifice hath
          "perfected for ever them that are sanctified." Trembling sinner! come
          to the cross again; thy sins are heavy, and many; but the atonement
          for them is completed by the death of Christ. Look then to Jesus, and
          remember that Christ needs nothing to supplement his blood. The road
          between God and man is finished and open; the robe to cover thy
          nakedness is complete, without a rag of thine; the bath in which thou
          art to be washed is full, full to the brim, and needs nothing to be
          added thereunto. "It is finished!" Let that ring in thy ears. There is
          nothing now that can hinder thy being saved, if God hath made thee
          willing now to believe in Jesus Christ. He is a complete Saviour, full
          of grace for an empty sinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. And yet I must add one more thought, and then leave this point. The
          blood of Jesus Christ is blood that bath been accepted. Christ died --
          he was buried; but neither heaven nor earth could tell whether God had
          accepted the ransom. There was wanted God's seal upon the great Magna
          Charta of man's salvation, and that seal was put, my hearer, in that
          hour when God summoned the angel, and bade him descend from heaven and
          roll away the stone. Christ was put in durance vile in the prison
          house of the grave, as a hostage for his people. Until God had signed
          the warrant for acquittal of all his people, Christ must abide in the
          bonds of death. He did not attempt to break his prison; be did not
          come out illegally, by wrenching down the bars of his dungeon; he
          waited: he wrapt up the napkin, folding it by itself: he laid the
          grave-clothes in a separate place; he waited, waited patiently; and at
          last down from the skies, like the flash of a meteor, the angel
          descended, touched the stone and rolled it away; and when Christ came
          out, rising from the dead in the glory of his Father's power, then was
          the seal put upon the great charta of our redemption. The blood was
          accepted, and sin was forgiven. And now, soul, it is not possible for
          God to reject thee, if thou comest this day to him, pleading the blood
          of Christ. God cannot -- and here we speak with reverence too -- the
          everlasting God cannot reject a sinner who pleads the blood of Christ:
          for if he did so, it were to deny himself, and to contradict all his
          former acts. He has accepted blood, and he will accept it; he never
          can revoke that divine acceptance of the resurrection; and if thou
          goest to God, my hearer, pleading simply and only the blood of him
          that did hang upon the tree, God must un-God himself before he can
          reject thee, or reject that blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet I fear that I have not been able to make you think of the
          blood of Christ. I beseech you, then, just for a moment try to picture
          to yourself Christ on the cross. Let your imagination figure the
          motley crew assembled round about that little hill of Calvary. Lift
          now your eyes, and see the three crosses put upon that rising knoll.
          See in the centre the thorn-crowned brow of Christ. Do you see the
          hands that have always been full of blessing nailed fast to the
          accursed wood! See you his dear face, more marred than that of any
          other man? Do you see it now, as his head bows upon his bosom in the
          extreme agonies of death? He was a real man, remember. It was a real
          cross. Do not think of these things as figments, and fancies, and
          romances. There was such a being, and he died as I describe it. Let
          your imagination picture him, and then sit still a moment and think
          over this thought: "The blood of that man, whom now I behold dying in
          agony, must be my redemption; and if I would be saved, I must put my
          only trust in what he suffered for me, when he himself did bear our
          sins in his own body on the tree.'" If God the Holy Spirit should help
          you, you will then be in a right state to proceed to the second point.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. THE EFFICACY OF THIS BLOOD. "When I see the blood I will pass over
          you."
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The blood of Christ hath such a divine power to save, that nothing
          but it can ever save the soul. If some foolish Israelite had despised
          the command of God, and had said, "I will sprinkle something else upon
          the doorposts," or, "I will adorn the lintel with jewels of gold and
          silver," he must have perished; nothing could save his household but
          the sprinkled blood. And now let us all remember, that "other
          foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, Jesus Christ," for
          "there is none other name given among men whereby we must be saved."
          My works, my prayers, my tears, cannot save me; the blood, the blood
          alone, has power to redeem. Sacraments, however well they may be
          attended to, cannot save me. Nothing but thy blood, O Jesus, can
          redeem me from the guilt of sin. Though I should give rivers of oil,
          and ten thousand of the fat of fed beasts; yea, though I should give
          my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin
          of my soul, all would be useless. Nothing but the blood of Jesus has
          in it the slightest saving-power. Oh! you that are trusting in your
          infant baptism, your confirmation, and your Lord's Supper, you are
          trusting in a lie. Nothing but the blood of Jesus can save. I care not
          how right the ordinance, how true the form, how scriptural the
          practice, it is all a vanity to you if you rely in it. God forbid I
          should say a word against ordinances, or against holy things; but keep
          them in their places. If you make then the basis of your soul's
          salvation, they are lighter than a shadow, and when you need them most
          you shall find them fail you. There is not, I repeat it again, the
          slightest atom of saving-power anywhere but in the blood of Jesus.
          That blood has the only power to save, and aught else that you rely
          upon shall be a refuge of lies. This is the rock, and this is the work
          that is perfect; but all other things are day dreams; they must be
          swept away in the day when God shall come to try our work of what sort
          it is. THE BLOOD stands out in solitary majesty, the only rock of our
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This blood is not simply the only thing that can save, but it must
          save alone. Put anything with the blood of Christ, and you are lost;
          trust to anything else with this and you perish. "It is true," says
          one, that the Sacrament cannot save me, but I will trust in that, and
          in Christ too." You are a lost man, then. So jealous is Christ of his
          honour, that anything you put with him, however good it is, becomes,
          from the fact of your putting it with him, an accursed thing. And what
          is it that thou wouldst put with Christ? Thy good works? What! wilt
          thou yoke a reptile with an angel -- yoke thyself to the chariot of
          salvation with Christ? What are thy good works? Thy righteousnesses
          are "as filthy rags;" and shall filthy rags be joined to the spotless
          celestial righteousness of Christ? It must not, and it shall not be.
          Rely on Jesus only, and thou canst not perish; but rely on anything
          with him, and thou art as surely damned as if thou shouldst rely upon
          thy sins. Jesus only -- Jesus only -- Jesus only -- this is the rock
          of our salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here let me stop, and combat a few forms and shapes which our
          self-righteousness always takes. "Oh," says one, "I could trust in
          Christ if I felt my sins more." Sir, that is a damning error. Is thy
          repentance, thy sense of sin, to be a part-Saviour? Sinner! the blood
          is to save thee, not thy tears, Christ's death, not thy repentance.
          Thou art bidden this day to trust in Christ; not in thy feelings, not
          in thy pangs on account of sin. Many a man has been brought into great
          soul distress, because he has looked more at his repentance than at
          the obedience of Christ --
        </p>
        <p>"Could thy tears for ever flow,</p>
        <p>Could thy zeal no respite know;</p>
        <p>All for sin could not atone,</p>
        <p>Christ must save and Christ alone."</p>
        <p>
          "Nay," says another, "but I feel that I do not value the blood of
          Christ as I ought, and therefore I am afraid to believe." My friend,
          that is another insiduous form of the same error. God does not say,
          "When I see your estimate of the blood of Christ, I will pass over
          you; no, but when I see the blood." It is not your estimate of that
          blood, it is the blood that saves you. As I said before, that
          magnificent, solitary blood, must be alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Nay," says another, "but if I had more faith then I should have
          hope." That, too, is a very deadly shape of the same evil. You are not
          to be saved by the efficacy of your faith, but by the efficacy of the
          blood of Christ. It is not your believing, it is Christ's dying. I bid
          you believe, but I bid you not to look to your believing as the ground
          of your salvation. No man will go to heaven if he trusts to his own
          faith; you may as well trust to your own good works as trust to your
          faith. Your faith must deal with Christ not with itself. The world
          hangs on nothing; but faith cannot hang upon itself, it must hang on
          Christ. Sometimes, when my faith is vigorous, I catch myself doing
          this. There is joy flowing into my heart, and after awhile I begin to
          find that my joy suddenly departs. I ask the causes, and I find that
          the joy came because I was thinking of Christ; but when I begin to
          think about my joy, then my joy fled. You must not think of your faith
          but of Christ. Faith comes from meditation upon Christ. Turn, then,
          your eye, not upon faith but upon Jesus. It is not your hold of Christ
          that saves you; it is his hold of you. It is not the efficacy of your
          believing in him; it is the efficacy of his blood applied to you
          through the Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not know how sufficiently to follow Satan in all his windings
          into the human heart, but this, I know, he is alway strying to keep
          back this great truth -- the blood, and the blood alone has power to
          save. "Oh," says another, "if I had such-and-such an experience then I
          could trust." Friend, it is not thine experience, it is the blood. God
          did not say, "When I see your experience," but "When I see the blood
          of Christ." "Nay," says one, "but if I had such-and-such graces, I
          could hope." Nay, but he did not say, "When I see your graces," but
          "When I see the blood." Get grace, get as much as you can of faith,
          and love, and hope, but oh, do not put them where Christ's blood ought
          to be. The only pillar of your hope must be the Cross, and aught else
          that you put to buttress up the cross of Christ is obnoxious to God,
          and ceases to have any virtue in it, because it is an anti-Christ. The
          blood of Christ, then alone, saves; but anything with it, and it does
          not save.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Yet again we may say of the blood of Christ, it is all-sufficient.
          There is no case which the blood of Christ cannot met; there is no sin
          which it cannot wash away. There is no multiplicity of sin which it
          cannot cleanse, no aggravation of guilt which it cannot remove. Ye may
          be double-dyed like scarlet, ye may have lain in the lye of your sins
          these seventy years, but the blood of Christ can take out the stain.
          You may have blasphemed him almost as many times as you have breathed,
          you may have rejected him as often as you have heard his name; you may
          have broken his Sabbath, you may have denied his existence, you may
          have doubted his Godhead, you may have persecuted his servants, you
          may have trampled on his blood; but all this the blood can wash away.
          You may have committed whoredoms without number, nay, murder itself
          may have defiled your hands, but this fountain filled with blood can
          wash all the stains away. The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from
          all sin. There is no sort of a man, there is no abortion of mankind,
          no demon in human shape that this blood cannot wash. Hell may have
          sought to make a paragon of iniquity, it may have striven to put sin,
          and sin, and sin together, till it has made a monster in the shape of
          man, a monster abhorred of mankind, but the blood of Christ can
          transform that monster. Magdalen's seven devils it can cast out, the
          madness of the demoniac it can ease, the deep-seated leprosy it can
          cure, the wound of the maimed, yea, the lost limb it can restore.
          There is no spiritual disease which the great Physician cannot heal.
          This is the great Catholicon, the medicine for all diseases. No case
          can exceed its virtue, be it never so black or vile; all-sufficient,
          all-sufficient blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But go further. The blood of Christ saves surely. Many people say,
          "Well, I hope I shall be saved through the blood of Christ;" and
          perhaps, says one here, who is believing in Christ, "Well, I hope it
          will save." My dear friend, that is a slur upon the honour of God. If
          any man gives you a promise, and you say, "Well, I hope he will fulfil
          it;" is it not implied that you have at least some small doubt as to
          whether he will or not. Now, I do not hope that the blood of Christ
          will wash away my sin. I know it is washed away by his blood; and that
          is true faith which does not hope about Christ's blood, but says, "I
          know it is so; that blood does cleanse. The moment it was applied to
          my conscience it did cleanse, and it does cleanse still." The
          Israelite, if he was true to his faith, did not go inside, and say, I
          hope the destroying angel will pass by me;" but he said, "I know he
          will; I know God cannot smite me; I know he will not. There is the
          blood-mark there, I am secure beyond a doubt; there is not the shadow
          of a risk of my perishing. I am, I must be saved." And so I preach a
          sure gospel this morning: "Whosoever believeth on the Lord Jesus
          Christ shall not perish but have everlasting life." "I give unto my
          sheep eternal life," said he, "and they shall never perish, neither
          shall any pluck them out of my hand." O, sinner, I have not the shadow
          of a doubt as to whether Christ will save you if you trust in his
          blood. O no, I know he will. I am certain his blood can save; and I
          beg you, in Christ's name, believe the same; believe that that blood
          is sure to cleanse, not only that it may cleanse, but that it must
          cleanse, "whereby we must be saved," says the Scripture. If we have
          that blood upon us we must be saved, or else we are to suppose a God
          unfaithful and a God unkind; in fact, a God transformed from
          everything that is God-like into everything that is base.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. And yet again, he that hath this blood sprinkled upon him is saved
          completely. Not the hair of the head of an Israelite was disturbed by
          the destroying angel. They were completely saved; so he that believeth
          in the blood is saved from all things. I like the old translation of
          the chapter in the Romans. There was a martyr once summoned before
          Bonner; and after he had expressed his faith in Christ, Bonner said
          "You are a heretic and will be damned." "Nay" said he, quoting the old
          version, "There is therefore now no damnation to them that believe in
          Christ Jesus." And that brings a sweet thought before us; there is no
          damnation to the man who has the blood of Christ upon him; he cannot
          be condemned of God anyhow. It were impossible. There is no such a
          thing; there can be no such thing. There is no damnation. He cannot be
          damned; for there is no damnation to him that is in Christ Jesus. Let
          the blood be applied to the lintel, and to the door-post, there is no
          destruction. There is a destroying angel for Egypt, but there is none
          for Israel. There is a hell for the wicked, but none for the
          righteous. And if there is none, they cannot be put there. If there is
          no damnation they cannot suffer it. Christ saves completely; every sin
          is washed, every blessing ensured, perfection is provided, and glory
          everlasting is the sure result.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think then, I have dwelt sufficiently long upon the efficacy of his
          blood; but no tongue of seraph can ever speak its worth. I must go
          home to my chamber, and weep because I am powerless to tell this
          story, and yet I have laboured to tell it simply, so that all can
          understand; and I pray, therefore, that God the Spirit may lead some
          of you to put your trust simply, wholly, and entirely, on the blood of
          Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. This brings us to the third point, upon which I must be very
          brief, and the third point is -- THE ONE CONDITION. What says one "Do
          you preach a conditional salvation?" Yes I do, there is the one
          condition "Where I see the blood I will pass over you." What a blessed
          condition! it does not say, when you see the blood, but when I see it.
          Thine eye of faith may be so dim, that thou canst not see the blood of
          Christ. Ay, but God's eye is not dim: He can see it, yea he must see
          it; for Christ in heaven is always presenting his blood before his
          Father's face. The Israelite could not see the blood; he was inside
          the house; he could not see what was on the lintel and the doorpost;
          but God could see it; and this is the only condition of the sinner's
          salvation -- God's seeing the blood; not your seeing it. O how safe,
          then, is every one that trusts in the Lord Jesus Christ. It is not his
          faith that is the condition, not his assurance; it is the simple fact,
          that Calvary is set perpetually before the eyes of God in a risen and
          ascended Saviour. "When I see the blood, I will pass over you." Fall
          on your knees then in prayer, ye doubting souls, and let this be your
          plea: -- "Lord, have mercy upon me for the blood's sake. I cannot see
          it as I could desire, but Lord thou seest it, and thou hast said, When
          I see it, I will pass over you.' Lord, thou seest it this day, pass
          over my sin, and forgive me for its dear sake alone."
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And now, lastly, WHAT IS THE LESSON. The lesson of the text is to
          the Christian this. Christian, take care that thou dost always
          remember, that nothing but the blood of Christ can save thee. I preach
          to myself to-day what I preach to you. I often find myself like this:
          -- I have been praying that the Holy Spirit might rest in my heart and
          cleanse out an evil passion, and presently I find myself full of
          doubts and fears, and when I ask the reason, I find it is this: -- I
          have been looking to the Spirit's work until I put the Spirit's work
          where Christ's work ought to be. Now, it is a sin to put your own
          works where Christ's should be; but it is just as much a sin to put
          the Holy Spirit's work there. You must never make the Spirit of God an
          anti-Christ, and you virtually do that when you put the Spirit's work
          as the groundwork of your faith. Do you not often hear Christian men
          say, "I cannot believe in Christ to-day as I could yesterday, for
          yesterday I felt such sweet and blessed enjoyments." Now, what is that
          but putting your frames and feelings where Christ ought to be.
          Remember, Christ's blood is no more able to save you in a good frame
          than in a bad frame. Christ's blood must be your trust, as much when
          you are full of joy as when you are full of doubt. And here it is that
          your happiness will be in danger, by beginning to put your good frames
          and good feelings in the room of the blood of Christ. O, brethren, if
          we could always live with a single eye fixed on the Cross, we should
          always be happy; but when we get a little peace, and a little joy, we
          begin to prize the joy and peace so much, that we forget the source
          whence they come. As Mr. Brooks says, "A husband that loves his wife
          will, perhaps, often give her jewels and rings; but suppose she should
          sit down and begin to think of her jewels and rings so much that she
          should forget her husband, it would be a kind husband's business to
          take them away from her so that she might fix her affections entirely
          on him." And it is so with us. Jesus gives us jewels of faith and
          love, and we get trusting to them, and he takes them away in order
          that we may come again as guilty, helpless sinners, and put our trust
          in Christ. To quote a verse I often repeat -- I believe the spirit of
          a Christian should be, from his first hour to his last, the spirit of
          these two lines: --
        </p>
        <p>"Nothing in my hand I bring,</p>
        <p>Simply to thy cross I cling."</p>
        <p>That is the lesson to the saint.</p>
        <p>
          But another minute; there is a lesson here to the sinner. Poor,
          trembling, guilty self-condemned sinner, I have a word from the Lord
          for thee. "The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us," that is you and
          me, "cleanseth us from all sin." That "us" includes you, if now you
          are feeling your need of a Saviour. Now that blood is able to save
          you, and you are bidden simply to trust that blood, and you shall be
          saved. But I hear you say, "Sir," you said, "If I feel my need. Now I
          feel that I do not feel, I only wish I did feel my need enough." Well
          do not bring your feelings then, but trust only in the blood. If you
          can rely simply on the blood of Christ, whatever your feelings may be,
          or may not be, that blood is able to save. But you are saying, "How am
          I to be saved? What mush I do?" Well there is nothing that you can do.
          You must leave off doing altogether, in order to be saved. There must
          be a denial of all your doings. You must get Christ first, and then
          you may do as much as you like. But you must not trust in your doings.
          Your business is now to lift up your heart in prayer like this: --
          "Lord, thou hast shown me something of myself, show me something of my
          Saviour." See the Saviour hanging on the cross, turn your eye to him,
          and say, "Lord, I trust thee I have nothing else to trust to, but I
          rely on thee; sink or swim, my Saviour, I trust thee." And as surely
          sinner, as thou canst put thy trust in Christ, thou art as safe as an
          apostle or prophet. Not death nor hell can slay that man whose firm
          reliance is at the foot of the cross. "Believe on the Lord Jesus
          Christ and thou shalt be saved." "He that believeth and is baptized
          shall be saved; he that believeth not shall be damned." He that
          believeth shall be saved, be his sins never so many; he that believeth
          not shall be damned, be his sins never so few, and be his virtues
          never so many. Trust in Jesus now! Sinner, trust in Jesus only.
        </p>
        <p>"Not all the blood of beasts</p>
        <p>On Jewish altars slain</p>
        <p>Could give the guilty conscience peace,</p>
        <p>Or wash away the stain.</p>
        <p>But Christ, the heavenly Lamb,</p>
        <p>Takes all our sins away;</p>
        <p>A sacrifice of nobler name</p>
        <p>And richer blood than they."<br /></p>
