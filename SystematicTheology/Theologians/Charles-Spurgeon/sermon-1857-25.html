        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.131)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, May 10, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>"Salvation is of the Lord." -- Jonah 2:9.</p>
        <p>
          JONAH learned this sentence of good theology in a strange college. He
          learned it in the whale's belly, at the bottom of the mountains, with
          the weeds wrapped about his head, when he supposed that the earth with
          her bars was about him for ever. Most of the grand truths of God have
          to be learned by trouble; they must be burned into us with the hot
          iron of affliction, otherwise we shall not truly receive them. No man
          is competent to judge in matters of the kingdom, until first he has
          been tried; since there are many things to be learned in the depths
          which we can never know in the heights. We discover many secrets in
          the caverns of the ocean, which, though we had soared to heaven, we
          never could have known. He shall best meet the wants of God's people
          as a preacher who has had those wants himself; he shall best comfort
          God's Israel who has needed comfort; and he shall best preach
          salvation who has felt his own need of it. Jonah, when he was
          delivered from his great danger, when, by the command of God the fish
          had obediently left its great deeps and delivered its cargo upon dry
          land, was then capable of judging; and this was the result of his
          experience under his trouble -- "Salvation is of the Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          By salvation here we do not merely understand the special salvation
          which Jonah received from death; for according to Dr. Gill, there is
          something so special in the original, in the word salvation having one
          more letter than it usually has, when it only refers to some temporary
          deliverance, that we can only understand it here as relating to the
          great work of the salvation of the soul which endureth for ever. That
          "salvation is of the Lord," I shall this morning try to show as best I
          can. First, I shall endeavor to explain the doctrine; then I shall try
          to show you how God has guarded us from making any mistakes, and has
          hedged us up to make us believe the gospel; then I shall dwell upon
          the influence of this truth upon men; and shall close up by showing
          you the counterpart of the doctrine. Seeing every truth hath its
          obverse, so hath this.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, to begin by explanation, let us EXPOUND THIS DOCTRINE
          -- the doctrine that salvation is of the Lord, or of Jehovah. We are
          to understand by this, that the whole of the work whereby men are
          saved from their natural estate of sin and ruin, and are translated
          into the kingdom of God and made heirs of eternal happiness, is of
          God, and of him only. "Salvation is of the Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin, then, at the beginning, the plan of salvation is entirely of
          God. No human intellect and no created intelligence assisted God in
          the planning of salvation; he contrived the way, even as he himself
          carried it out. The plan of salvation was devised before the existence
          of angels. Before the day-star flung its ray across the darkness, when
          as yet the unnavigated ether had not been fanned by the wing of
          seraph, and when the solemnity of silence had never been disturbed by
          the song of angel, God had devised a way whereby he might save man,
          whom he foresaw would fall. He did not create angels to consult with
          them; no, of himself he did it. We might truly ask the question, "With
          whom took he counsel? Who instructed him, when be planned the great
          architecture of the temple of mercy? With whom took he counsel when he
          digged the deeps of love, that out of them there might well up springs
          of salvation? Who aided him?" None. He himself, alone, did it. In
          fact, if angels had then been in existence, they could not have
          assisted God; for I can well suppose that if a solemn conclave of
          those spirits had been held, if God had put to them this question,
          "Man will rebel; I declare I will punish; my justice, inflexible and
          severe, demands that I should do so; but yet I intend to have mercy;"
          if he had put the question to the celestial squadrons of mighty ones,
          "How can those things be? How can justice have its demands fulfilled,
          and how can mercy reign?" the angels would have sat in silence until
          now; they could not have dictated the plan; it would have surpassed
          angelic intellect to have conceived the way whereby righteousness and
          peace should meet together, and judgment and mercy should kiss each
          other. God devised it, because without God it could not have been
          devised. It is a plan too splendid to have been the product of any
          mind except of that mind which afterward carried it out. "Salvation"
          is older than creation; it is "of the Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          And as it was of the Lord in planning so it was of the Lord in
          execution. No one has helped to provide salvation; God has done it all
          himself. The banquet of mercy is served up by one host; that host is
          he to whom the cattle on a thousand hills belong. But none have
          contributed any dainties to that royal banquet; he bath done it all
          himself The royal bath of mercy, wherein black souls are washed, was
          filled from the veins of Jesus; not a drop was contributed by any
          other being. He died upon the cross, and as an expiator he died alone.
          No blood of martyrs mingled with that stream; no blood of noble
          confessors and of heroes of the cross entered into the river of
          atonement; that is filled from the veins of Christ, and from nowhere
          else beside. He bath done it wholly Atonement is the unaided work of
          Jesus. On yonder cross I see the man who "trod the winepress alone;"
          in yonder garden I see the solitary conqueror, who came to the fight
          single-handed, whose own arm brought salvation, and whose omnipotence
          sustained him. "Salvation is of the Lord," as to its provisions;
          Jehovah -- Father, Son, and Spirit -- hath provided everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far we are all agreed: but now we shall have to separate a bit.
          "Salvation is of the Lord" in the application of it. "No," says the
          Arminian, "it is not; salvation is of the Lord, inasmuch as he does
          all for man that he can do; but there is something that man must do,
          which if he does not do, he must perish." That is the Arminian way of
          salvation. Now last week I thought of this very theory of salvation,
          when I stood by the side of that window of Carisbrooke castle, out of
          which King Charles of unhappy and unrighteous memory, attempted to
          escape. I read in the guide book that every thing was provided for his
          escape; his followers had means at the bottom of the wall to enable
          him to fly across the country, and on the coast they had their boats
          lying ready to take him to another land; in fact every thing was ready
          for his escape. But here was the important circumstance: his friends
          had done all they could; he was to do the rest; but that doing the
          rest was just the point and brunt of the battle. It was to get out of
          the window, out of which he was not able to escape by any means, so
          that all his friends did for him went for nothing, so far as he was
          concerned. So with the sinner. If God had provided every means of
          escape, and only required him to get out of his dungeon, he would have
          remained there to all eternity. Why, is not the sinner by nature dead
          in sin? And if God requires him to make himself alive, and then
          afterward he will do the rest for him, then verily, my friends, we are
          not so much obliged to God as we had thought for; for if he require so
          much as that of us, and we can do it, we can do the rest without his
          assistance. The Romanists have an extraordinary miracle of their own
          about St. Dennis, of whom they tell the lying legend that after his
          head was off be took it up in his hands and walked with it two
          thousand miles; whereupon, said a wit, "So far as the two thousand
          miles go, it is nothing at all; it is only the first step in which
          there is any difficulty." So I believe, if that is taken, all the rest
          can be easily accomplished. And if God does require of the sinner --
          dead in sin -- that he should take the first step, then he requireth
          just that which renders salvation as impossible under the gospel as
          ever it was under the law, seeing man is as unable to believe as he is
          to obey, and is just as much without power to come to Christ as he is
          without power to go to heaven without Christ. The power must be given
          to him of the Spirit. He lieth dead in sin; the Spirit must quicken
          him. He is bound hand and foot and fettered by transgression; the
          Spirit must cut his bonds, and then he will leap to liberty. God must
          come and dash the iron bars out of their sockets, and then he can
          escape from the window, and make good his escape afterward; but unless
          the first thing be done for him, he must perish as surely under the
          gospel as he would have done under the law. I would cease to preach,
          if I believed that God, in the matter of salvation, required any thing
          whatever of man which be himself had not also engaged to furnish. For
          how many have I frequently hanging upon my lips of the worst of
          characters -- men whose lives have become so horribly bad, that the
          lip of morality would refuse to give a description of their character?
          When I enter my pulpit am I to believe that these men are to do
          something before God's Spirit will operate upon them? If so, I should
          go there with a faint heart, feeling that I never could induce them to
          do the first part. But now I come to my pulpit with a sure confidence
          -- God the Holy Spirit will meet with these men this morning. They are
          as bad as they can be; he will put a new thought into their hearts; he
          will give them new wishes; he will give them new wills, and those who
          hated Christ will desire to love him; those who once loved sin will,
          by God's divine Spirit, be made to hate it; and here is my confidence,
          that what they can not do, in that they are weak through the flesh,
          God sending his Spirit into their hearts will do for them, and in
          them, and so they shall be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well then, says one, that will make people sit still and fold their
          arms. Sir, it shill not. But if men did so I could not help it; my
          business, as I have often said in this place before, is not to prove
          to you the reasonableness of any truth, nor to defend any truth from
          its consequences; all I do here, and I mean to keep to it, is just to
          assert the truth, because it is in the Bible; then, if you do not like
          it, you must settle the quarrel with my Master, and if you think it
          unreasonable, you must quarrel with the Bible. Let others defend
          Scripture and prove it to be true; they can do their work better than
          I could; mine is just the mere work of proclaiming. I am the
          messenger; I tell the Master's message; if you do not like the
          message, quarrel with the Bible, not with me; so long as I have
          Scripture on my side I will dare and defy you to do any thing against
          me. "Salvation is of the Lord." The Lord has to apply it, to make the
          unwilling willing, to make the ungodly godly, and bring the vile rebel
          to the feet of Jesus, or else salvation will never be accomplished.
          Leave that one thing undone, and you have broken the link of the
          chain, the very link which was just necessary to its integrity. Take
          away the fact that God begins the good work, and that he sends us what
          the old divines call preventing grace -- take that away, and you have
          spoilt the whole of salvation; you have just taken the key-stone out
          of the arch, and down it tumbles. There is nothing left then.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now on the next point we shall a little disagree again, "Salvation
          is of the Lord," as to the sustaining of the work in any man's heart.
          When a man is made a child of God he does not have a stock of grace
          given to him with which to go on for ever, but be has grace for that
          day; and he must have grace for the next day, and grace for the next,
          and grace for the next, until days shall end, or else the beginning
          shall be of no avail. As a man does not make himself spiritually
          alive, so neither can he keep himself so. He can feed on spiritual
          food, and so preserve his spiritual strength; he can walk in the
          commandments of the Lord, and so enjoy rest and peace, but still the
          inner life is dependent upon the Spirit as much for its after
          existence as for its first begetting. I do verily believe that if it
          should ever be my lot to put my foot upon the golden threshold of
          Paradise, and put this thumb upon the pearly latch, I should never
          cross the threshold unless I had grace given me to take that last step
          whereby I might enter heaven. No man of himself, even when converted,
          hath any power, except as that power is daily, constantly, and
          perpetually infused into him by the Spirit. But Christians often set
          up for independent gentlemen; they get a little stock of grace in
          hand, and they say, "My mountain standeth firm, I shall never be
          moved." But ah! it is not long before the manna begins to be putrid.
          It was only meant to be the manna for the day, and we have kept it for
          the morrow, and therefore it fails us. We must have fresh grace.
        </p>
        <p>"For day by day the manna fell;</p>
        <p>O to learn that lesson well."</p>
        <p>
          So look day by day for fresh grace. Frequently too the Christian wants
          to have grace enough for a month vouchsafed to him in one moment. "O!"
          he says, "what a host of troubles I have coming -- how shall I meet
          them all? O! that I had grace enough to bear me through them all! "My
          dear friends, you will have grace enough for your troubles, as they
          come one by one. "As thy days, so shall thy strength be;" but thy
          strength shall never be as thy months, or as thy weeks. Thou shalt
          have thy strength as thou hast thy bread. "Give us this day our daily
          bread." Give us this day our daily grace. But why is it you will be
          troubling yourself about the things of to-morrow? The common people
          say, "Cross a bridge when you come to it." That is good advice. Do the
          same. When a trouble comes, attack it, and down with it, and master it
          ; but do not begin now to forestall your woes. "Ah! but I have so
          many," says one. Therefore I say, do not look further before thee than
          thou needest. "Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof." Do as the
          brave Grecian did, who, when he defended his country from Persia, did
          not go into the plains to fight, but stood in the narrow pass of
          Thermopylae; there, when the myriads came to him, they had to come one
          by one, and he felled them to the earth. Had he ventured into the
          plain he would have been soon devoured, and his handfull would have
          been melted like a drop of dew in the sea. Stand in the narrow pass of
          to-day, and fight thy troubles one by one; but do not rush into the
          plains of tomorrow, for there thou wilt be routed and killed. As the
          evil is sufficient so will the grace be. "Salvation is of the Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          But, lastly, upon this point. The ultimate perfection of salvation is
          of the Lord. Soon, soon, the saints of earth shall be saints in light;
          their hairs of snowy age shall be crowned with perpetual joy and
          everlasting youth; their eyes suffused with tears shall be made bright
          as stars, never to be clouded again by sorrow; their hearts that
          tremble now are to be made joyous and fast, and set for ever like
          pillars in the temple of God. Their follies, their burdens, their
          griefs, their woes, are soon to be over; sin is to be slain,
          corruption is to be removed, and a heaven of spotless purity and of
          unmingled peace is to be theirs for ever. But it must still be by
          grace. As was the foundation such must the top-stone be; that which
          laid on earth the first beginning must lay in heaven the top-most
          stone. As they were redeemed from their filthy conversation by grace,
          so they must be redeemed from death and the grave by grace too, and
          they must enter heaven singing
        </p>
        <p>"Salvation of the Lord alone;</p>
        <p>Grace is a shoreless sea."</p>
        <p>
          There may be Arminians here, but they will not be Arminians there;
          they may here say, "It is of the will of the flesh," but in heaven
          they shall not think so. Here they may ascribe some little to the
          creature; but there they shall cast their crowns at the Redeemer's
          feet, and acknowledge that he did it all. Here they may sometimes look
          a little at themselves, and boast somewhat of their own strength; but
          there, "Not unto us, not unto us," shall be sung with deeper sincerity
          and with more profound emphasis than they have even sung it here
          below. In heaven, when grace shall have done its work, this truth
          shall stand out in blazing letters of gold, "Salvation is of the
          Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Thus I have tried to expound the gospel. Now shall I show you How
          GOD HAS HEDGED THIS GOSPEL ABOUT.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some have said salvation in some cases is the result of natural
          temperament. Well, Sir, well; God has effectually answered your
          argument. You say that some people are saved because they are
          naturally religious and inclined to be good; unfortunately I have
          never met with any of that class of persons yet; but I will suppose
          for a moment that there are such people. God has unanswerably met your
          objection; for, strange to say, the great number of these who are
          saved are just the most unlikely people in the world to have been
          saved, while a great number of those who perish were once just the
          very people whom, if natural disposition had any thing to do with it,
          we should have expected to see in heaven. Why, there is one here who
          in his youth was a child of many follies. Often did his mother weep
          over him, and cry and groan over her son's wanderings; for what with a
          fierce high spirit that could brook neither bit nor bridle, what with
          perpetual rebellions and ebullitions of hot anger, she said, "My son,
          my son, what wilt thou be in thy riper years? Surely thou wilt dash in
          pieces law and order, and be a disgrace to thy father's name." He grew
          up; in youth he was wild and wanton, but, wonder of wonders, on a
          sudden he became a new man, changed, altogether changed; no more like
          what he was before than angels are like lost spirits. He sat at her
          feet, he cheered her heart, and the lost, fiery one became gentle,
          mild, humble as a little child, and obedient to God's commandments.
          You say, wonder of wonders! But there is another here. He was a fair
          youth: when but a child be talked of Jesus; often when his mother had
          him on her knee he asked her questions about heaven; be was a prodigy,
          a wonder of piety in his youth. As he grew up, the tear rolled down
          his cheek under any sermon; he could scarcely bear to hear of death
          without a sigh; sometimes his mother caught him, as she thought, in
          prayer alone. And what is he now? He has just this very morning come
          from sin; he has become the debauched desperate villain, has gone far
          into all manner of wicked ness and lust, and sin, and has become more
          damnably corrupt than other men could have made him only his own evil
          spirit, once confined, has now developed itself; he has learned to
          play the lion in his manhood, as once he played the fox in his youth.
          I do not know whether you have ever met with such a case; but it very
          frequently is so. I know I can say that in my congregation some
          abandoned wicked fellow has had his heart broken, and been led to
          weep, and has cried to God for mercy, and renounced his vile sin;
          whilst some fair maiden by his side hath heard the same sermon, and if
          there was a tear she brushed it away; she still continues just what
          she was, "without God and without hope in the world." God has taken
          the base things of the world, and has just picked his people out of
          the very roughest of men, in order that he may prove that it is not
          natural disposition, but that "salvation is of the Lord" alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, but some say, it is the minister they hear who converts men. Ah!
          that is a grand idea, full sure. No man but a fool would entertain it.
          I met with a man some time ago who assured me that he knew a minister
          who bad a very large amount of converting power in him. Speaking of a
          great evangelist in America, he said, "That man, sir, has got the
          greatest quantity of converting power I ever knew a man to have; and
          Mr.. So-and-so in a neighboring town I think is second to him." At
          that time this converting power was being exhibited; two hundred
          persons were converted by the converting power of this second best,
          and joined to the church in a few months. I went to the place some
          time afterwards -- it was in England -- and I said, "How do your
          converts get on?" "Well," said he, "I can not say much about them."
          "How many out of those two hundred whom you received in a year ago
          stand fast?" "Well," he said, "I am afraid not many of them; we have
          turned seventy of them out for drunkenness already." "Yes," I said, "I
          thought so: that is the end of the grand experiment of converting
          power." If I could convert you all, any one else might unconvert you;
          what any man can do another man can undo; it is only what God does
          that is abiding.
        </p>
        <p>
          No, my brethren; God has taken good care it shall never be said
          conversion is of man, for usually he blesses those who seem to be the
          most unlikely to be useful. I do not expect to see so many conversions
          in this place as I had a year ago, when I had far fewer hearers. Do
          you ask why? Why, a year ago I was abused by every body; to mention my
          name was to mention the name of the most abominable buffoon that
          lived. The mere utterance of it brought forth oaths and cursing; with
          many men it was a name of contempt, kicked about the street as a
          football; but then God gave me souls by hundreds, who were added to my
          church, and in one year it was my happiness to see not less than a
          thousand personally who had then been converted. I do not expect that
          now. My name is somewhat esteemed now, and the great ones of the earth
          think it no dishonor to sit at my feet; but this makes me fear lest my
          God should forsake me now that the world esteems me. I would rather be
          despised and slandered than aught else. This assembly that you think
          so grand and fine, I would readily part with, if by such a loss I
          could gain a greater blessing. "God has chosen the base things of the
          world;" and, therefore, I reckon that the more esteemed I may be, the
          worse is my position, so much the less expectation shall I have that
          God will bless me. He hath but his treasure in earthen vessels, that
          the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of man." A poor
          minister began to preach once, and all the world spoke ill of him; but
          God blessed him. By-and-bye they turned round and petted him. He was
          the man -- a wonder! God left him! It has often been the same. It is
          for us to recollect, in all times of popularity, that "Crucify him;
          crucify him" follows fast upon the heels of "Hosanna," and that the
          crowd to-day, if dealt faithfully with, may turn into the handful of
          to-morrow; for men love not plain speaking. We should learn to be
          despised, learn to be contemned, learn to be slandered, and then we
          shall learn to be made useful by God. Down on my knees I have often
          fallen, with the hot sweat rising from my brow, under some fresh
          slander poured upon me; in an agony of grief my heart has been
          well-nigh broken; till at last I learned the art of bearing all and
          caring for none. And how my grief runneth in another line. It is just
          the opposite. I fear lest God should forsake me, to prove that he is
          the author of salvation, that it is not in the preacher, that it is
          not in the crowd, that it is not in the attention I can attract, but
          in God, and in God alone. And this thing I hope I can say from my
          heart: if to be made as the mire of the streets again, if to be the
          laughingstock of fools and the song of the drunkard once more will
          make me more serviceable to my Master, and more useful to his cause, I
          will prefer it to all this multitude, or to all the applause that man
          could give. Pray for me, dear friends, pray for me, that God would
          still make me the means of the salvation of souls; for I fear he may
          say, "I will not help that man, lest the world should say he has done
          it," for "salvation is of the Lord," and so it must be, even to the
          world's end.

        <p>
          III. And now WHAT IS, WHAT SHOULD BE, THE INFLUENCE OF THIS DOCTRINE
          UPON MEN?
        </p>
        <p>
          Why, first, with sinners, this doctrine is a great battering ram
          against their pride. I will give you a figure The sinner in his
          natural estate reminds me of a man who has a strong and well-nigh
          impenetrable castle into which he has fled. There is the outer moat;
          there is a second moat; there are the high walls; and then afterward
          there is the dungeon and keep, into which the sinner will retire. Now,
          the first moat that goes round the sinner's trusting place is his good
          works. "Ah!" he says, "I am as good as my neighbor; twenty shillings
          in the pound down, ready money, I have always paid; I am no sinner; I
          tithe mint and cummin;' a good respectable gentleman I am indeed."
          Well, when God comes to work with him, to save him, he sends his army
          across the first moat; and as they go through it, they cry, "Salvation
          is of the Lord;" and the moat is dried up, for if it be of the Lord,
          how can it be of good works? But when that is done, he has a second
          intrenchment -- ceremonies. "Well," he says, "I will not trust in my
          good works, but I have been baptized, I have been confirmed; do not I
          take the sacrament? That shall be my trust." "Over the moat! Over the
          moat!" And the soldiers go over again, shouting, "Salvation is of the
          Lord." The second moat is dried up; it is all over with that. Now they
          come to the next strong wall; the sinner, looking over it, says, "I
          can repent, I can believe, whenever I like; I will save myself by
          repenting and believing." Up come the soldiers of God, his great army
          of conviction, and they batter this wall to the ground, crying,
          "Salvation is of the Lord.' Your faith and your repentance must all be
          given you, or else you will neither believe nor repent of sin." And
          now the castle is taken; the man's hopes are all cut off; he feels
          that it is not of self; the castle of self is overcome, and the great
          banner upon which is written "Salvation is of the Lord" is displayed
          upon the battlements. But is the battle over? O no; the sinner has
          retired to the keep, in the center of the castle; and now he changes
          his tactics. "I can not save myself," says he, "therefore I will
          despair; there is no salvation for me." Now this second castle is as
          hard to take as the first, for the sinner sits down and says, "I can't
          be saved, I must perish." But God commands the soldiers to take this
          castle too, shouting, "Salvation is of the Lord;" though it is not of
          man, it is of God; "he is able to save, even to the uttermost," though
          you can not save yourself. This sword, you see, cuts two ways; it cut
          pride down, and then it cleaves the skull of despair. If any man say
          he can save himself, it halveth his pride at once; and if another man
          say he can not be saved, it dasheth his despair to the earth; for it
          affirms that he can be saved, seeing, "Salvation is of the Lord." That
          is the effect this doctrine has upon the sinner, may it have that
          effect on you!
        </p>
        <p>
          But what influence has it upon the saint? Why, it is the keystone of
          all divinity. I will defy you to be heterodox if you believe this
          truth. You must be sound in the faith if you have learned to spell
          this sentence -- "Salvation is of the Lord;" and if you feel it in
          your soul you will not be proud; you can not be; you will cast every
          thing at his feet, confessing that you have done nothing, save what he
          has helped you to do and therefore the glory must be where the
          salvation is. If you believe this you will not be distrustful. You
          will say, "My salvation does not depend on my faith, but on the Lord;
          my keeping does not depend on myself, but on God who keepeth me; my
          being brought to heaven rests not now in my own hands, but in the
          hands of God;" you will, when doubts and fears prevail, fold your
          arms, look upward and say,
        </p>
        <p>"And now my eye of faith is dim,</p>
        <p>I trust in Jesus, sink or swim."</p>
        <p>
          If you can keep this in your mind you may always be joyful. He can
          have no cause for trouble who knows and feels that his salvation is of
          God. Come on, legions of bell; come on demons of the pit!
        </p>
        <p>"He that has helped me bears me through,</p>
        <p>And makes me more than conqueror too."</p>
        <p>
          Salvation resteth not on this poor arm, else should I despair, but on
          the arm of yon Omnipotent -- that arm on which the pillars of the
          heavens do lean. "Whom should I fear ? The Lord is my strength and my
          life; of whom shall I be afraid?"
        </p>
        <p>
          And this, may by grace, nerve you to work for God. If you had to save
          your neighbors you might sit down and do nothing; but since "salvation
          is of the Lord," go on and prosper. Go and preach the gospel; go and
          tell the gospel everywhere. Tell it in your house, tell it in the
          street, tell it in every land and every nation; for it is not of
          yourself, it is "of the Lord." Why do not our friends go to Ireland to
          preach the gospel? Ireland is a disgrace to the Protestant church. Why
          do not they go and preach there? A year or so ago a number of our
          brave ministers went over there to preach; they did right bravely;
          they went there, and they came back again, and that is about the sum
          total of the glorious expedition against Popery. But why come back
          again? Because they were stoned, good easy men! Do they not think that
          the gospel ever will spread without a few stones? But they would have
          been killed! Brave martyrs they! Let them be enrolled in the red
          chronicle. Did the martyrs of old, did the apostles shrink from going
          to any country because they would have been killed? No, they were
          ready to die: and if half a dozen ministers had been killed in
          Ireland, it would have been the finest thing in the world for liberty
          in future; for after that the people dare not have touched us; the
          strong arm of the law would have put them down; we might have gone
          through every village of Ireland afterwards, and been at peace; the
          constabulary. would soon have put an end to such infamous murder; it
          would have awakened the Protestantism of England to claim the liberty
          which is our right there as we give it elsewhere. We shall never see
          any great change till we have some men in our ranks who are willing to
          be martyrs. That deep ditch can never be crossed till the bodies of a
          few of us shall fill it up; and after that it will be easy work to
          preach the gospel there. Our brethren should go there once more. They
          can leave their white cravats at home, and the white feather too, and
          go forth with a brave heart and a bold spirit; and if the people mock
          and scoff, let them mock and scoff on. George Whitefield said, when he
          preached on Kennington Common, where they threw dead cats and rotten
          eggs at him, "This is only the manure of Methodism, the best thing in
          the world to make it grow; throw away as fast as you please." And when
          a stone cut him on the forehead, he seemed to preach the better for a
          little blood-letting. O! for such a man to dare the mob, and then the
          mob would not need to be dared. Let us go there, recollecting that
          "salvation is of the Lord," and let us in every place and at every
          time preach God's Word, believing that God's Word is more than a match
          for man's sin, and God will yet be master over all the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          My voice fails me again, and my thoughts too, I was weary this
          morning, when I came into this pulpit, and I am weary now. Sometimes I
          am joyous and glad, and feel in the pulpit as if I could preach for
          ever; at other times I feel glad to close; but yet with such a text I
          would that I could have finished up with all the might that mortal lip
          could summon. O! to let men know this, that their salvation is of God!
          Swearer, swear not against him in whose hand thy breath is! Despiser,
          despise not him who can save you or destroy you. And thou hypocrite,
          seek not to deceive him from whom salvation comes, and who therefore
          knows right well whether thy salvation come from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And now in concluding, let me just tell you WHAT IS THE OBSERVE OF
          THIS TRUTH. Salvation is of God: then damnation is of man. If any of
          you are damned, you will have no one to blame but yourselves; if any
          of you perish, the blame will not lie at God's door; if you are lost
          and cast away, you will have to bear all the blame and all the
          tortures of conscience yourself; you will lie for ever in perdition,
          and reflect, "I have destroyed myself; I have made a suicide of my
          soul; I have been my own destroyer; I can lay no blame to God."
          Remember, if saved, you must be saved by God alone, though if lost you
          have lost yourselves. "Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die, O house of
          Israel." With my last faltering sentence I bid you stop and think. Ah!
          my hearers, my hearers! it is an awful thing to preach to such a mass
          as this. But the other Sunday, as I came down stairs, I was struck
          with a memorable sentence, uttered by one who stood there. He said,
          "There are 9000 people this morning without excuse in the day of
          judgment." I should like to preach so that this always might be said;
          and if I can not, O may God have mercy on me, for his name's sake! But
          now remember! Ye have souls; those souls will be damned, or saved.
          Which will it be ? Damned they must be for ever, unless God shall save
          you; unless Christ shall have mercy upon you, there is no hope for
          you. Down on your knees I Cry to God for mercy. Now lift up your heart
          in prayer to God. May now be the very time when you shall be saved. Or
          ever the next drop of blood shall run through your veins, may you find
          peace! Remember, that peace is to be had now. If you feel now your
          need of it, it is to be had now. And how? For the mere asking for it.
          ' Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find."
        </p>
        <p>"But if your ears refuse</p>
        <p>The language of his grace,</p>
        <p>Your hearts grow hard, like stubborn Jews,</p>
        <p>That unbelieving race,</p>
        <p>The Lord with vengeance drest,</p>
        <p>Shall lift his hand and swear,</p>
        <p>You that despised my promised rest</p>
        <p>Shall have no portion there."</p>
        <p>
          O! that ye may not be despisers, lest ye "wonder and perish!" May ye
          now fly to Christ, and be accepted in the beloved. It is my last best
          prayer. May the Lord hear it. Amen.<br />
