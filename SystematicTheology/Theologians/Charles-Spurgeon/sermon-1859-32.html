        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.256)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, June 5th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that
          is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh
          intercession for us" -- Romans 8:34.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE PROTEST OF an innocent man against the charge of an accuser may
          well be strong and vehement. But here we have a more uncommon and a
          sublimer theme. It is the challenge of a justified sinner protesting
          with holy and inspired fervour that his character is clear and his
          conscience clean, even in the sight of heaven. Yet it is not the
          natural innocence of his heart, but the perfect mediation of the Lord
          Jesus Christ, which gives him this amazing confidence. May the Spirit
          of God enable me to expound to you this most blessed portion of God's
          Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have before us in the text the four marvellous pillars upon which
          the Christian rests his hope. Any one of them were all-sufficient.
          Though the sins of the whole world should press on any one of these
          sacred columns, it would never break nor bend. Yet for our strong
          consolation, that we may never tremble or fear, God hath been pleased
          to give us these four eternal rocks, these four immovable foundations
          upon which our faith may rest and stand secure. But why is this? why
          needeth the Christian to have such firm, such massive foundations? For
          this simple reason: he is himself so doubtful, so ready to distrust,
          so difficult to be persuaded of his own security. Therefore hath God,
          as it were, enlarged his arguments. One blow might, we should have
          imagined, have been enough to have smitten to death our unbelief for
          ever; the cross ought to have been enough for the crucifixion of our
          infidelity, yet God, foreseeing the strength of our unbelief, hath
          been pleased to smite it four times that it might be razed to rise no
          more. Moreover, he well knew that our faith would be sternly attacked.
          The world, our own sin, and the devil, he foresaw would be continually
          molesting us; therefore hath he entrenched us within these four walls,
          he hath engarrisoned us in four strong lines of circumvallation. We
          cannot be destroyed. We have bulwarks, none of which can possibly be
          stormed, but when combined they are so irresistible, they could not be
          carried, though earth and hell should combine to storm them. It is, I
          say, first, because of our unbelief; and secondly, because of the
          tremendous attacks our faith has to endure, that God has been pleased
          to lay down four strong consolations, with which we may fortify our
          hearts whenever the sky is overcast, or the hurricane is coming forth
          from its place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now notice these four stupendous doctrines. I repeat it again,
          any one of them is all-sufficient. It reminds me of what I have
          sometimes heard of the ropes that are used in mining. It is said that
          every strand of them would bear the entire onnage, and consequently,
          if every strand bears the full weight that will ever be put upon the
          whole, there is an absolute certainty of safety given to the whole
          when twisted together. Now each of these four articles of our faith is
          sufficient to bear the weight of the sins of the whole world. What
          must be the strength when the whole four are interlaced and
          intertwisted, and become the support of the believer? The apostle
          challenges the whole world, and heaven and hell too, in the question,
          "Who is he that condemneth?" and in order to excuse his boldness, he
          gives us four reasons why he can never be condemned. "Christ has died,
          yea, rather, is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who
          also maketh intercession for us." We shall first look over these four
          pillars of the believer's faith, and then, afterwards, we shall
          ourselves take up the apostle's challenge, and cry, "Who is he that
          condemneth?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The first reason why the Christian never can be condemned is
          because CHRIST HATH DIED. We believe that in the death of Christ there
          was a full penalty paid to divine justice for all the sins which the
          believer can possibly commit. We teach every Sabbath day, that the
          whole shower of devine wrath was poured upon Christ's head, that the
          black cloud of vengeance emptied out itself upon the cross, and that
          there is not left in the book of God a single sin against a believer,
          nor can there possibly be even a particle of punishment ever exacted
          at the hand of the man that believeth in Jesus, for this reason, --
          that Jesus has been punished to the full. In full tale hath every sin
          received sentence in his death. He hath suffered, the just for the
          unjust, to bring us to God. And now, if you and I are enabled this
          morning to go beneath the bloody tree of Calvary, and shelter
          ourselves there, how safe we are! Ah! we may look around and defy all
          our sins to destroy us. This shall be an all-sufficient argument to
          shut their clamorous mouths, "Christ hath died." Here cometh one and
          he cries, "Thou hast been a blasphemer." Yes, but Christ died a
          blasphemer's death, and he died tor blasphemers. "But thou hast
          stained thyself with lust." Yes, but Christ died for the lascivious.
          The blood of Jesus Christ, God's own Son, cleanseth us from all sin;
          so away foul fiend, that also has received its due. "But thou hast
          long resisted grace, and long stood out against the warnings of God."
          Yes, but "Jesus died;" and say what thou wilt, O conscience, remind me
          of what thou wilt; lo this shall be my sure reply -- in "Jesus died."
          Standing at the foot of the cross, and beholding the Redeemer in his
          expiring agony, the Christian may indeed gather courage. When I think
          of my sin, it seems impossible that any atonement should ever be
          adequate; but when I think of Christ's death it seems impossible that
          any sin should ever be great enough to need such an atonement as that.
          There is in the death of Christ enough and more than enough. There is
          not only a sea in which to drown our sins, but the very tops of the
          mountains of our guilt are covered. Forty cubits upwards hath this red
          sea prevailed. There is not only enough to put our sins to death, but
          enough to bury them and hide them out of sight. I say it boldly and
          without a figure, -- the eternal arm of God now nerved with strength,
          now released from the bondage in which justice held it, is able to
          save unto the uttermost them that come unto God by Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was my subject last Sabbath day, therefore I take it I shall be
          fully justified in leaving the first point -- that Christ hath died,
          while I pass on to the other three. You will bear in mind that I
          discussed the doctrine of the satisfaction of Christ's atonement by
          his death, in the sermon of last Sunday morning. I come, therefore, to
          notice the second argument. Our first reason for knowing that we
          cannot be condemned is, because Christ has died for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second reason a believer hath, is -- that CHRIST HAS RISEN
          AGAIN.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will observe that the apostle has here prefixed the words, "yea
          rather!" Do you see the force of this expression? As much as to say,
          it is a powerful argument for our salvation, that Christ died; but it
          is a still more cogent proof that every believer shall be saved, that
          Christ rose again from the dead. This does not often strike us. We
          generally receive more comfort at the cross than we do at the empty
          sepulchre. And yet this is just through our ignorance and through the
          blindness of our eyes; for verily to the enlightened believer there is
          more consolation in Jesus arising from the tomb, than there is in
          Jesus nailed to the cross. "Yea rather," said the apostle; as if he
          would have it, that this is a still more powerful argument. Now what
          has the resurrection of Christ from the dead to do with the
          justification of a believer? I take it thus: Christ by his death paid
          to his Father the full price of what we owed to him. God did as it
          were hold a bond against us which we could not pay. The alternative of
          this bond, if not paid, was, that we should be sold for ever under
          sin, and should endure the penalty of our transgressions in
          unquenchable fire. Now Jesus by his death paid all the debt; to the
          utmost farthing that was due from us to God Christ did pay by his
          death. Still the bond was not cancelled until the day when Christ rose
          from the dead; then did his Father, as it were, rend the bond in
          halves, and blot it out, so that thenceforward it ceases to have
          elfect. It is true that death was the payment of the debt, but
          resurrection was the public acknowledgment that the debt was paid.
          "Now," says Paul, "yea rather, he is risen from the dead." O
          Christian, thou canst not be condemned, for Christ has paid the debt.
          Look at his gore, as it distils from his body in Gethsemane and on the
          accursed tree. But rather, lest there should be a shadow of a doubt,
          that thou canst not be condemned, thy debts are cancelled. Here is the
          full receipt; the resurrection hath rent the bond in twain. And now at
          Gods right hand there is not left a record of thy sin; for when our
          Lord Jesus Christ quitted the tomb, he left thy sin buried in it --
          once for all cast away -- never to be recovered. To use another
          figure, -- Christ's death was as it were the digging out of the gold
          of grace out of the deep mines of Jesus' sufferings. Christ coined, so
          to speak, the gold which should be the redemption of his children, but
          the resurrection was the minting of that gold; it stamped it with the
          Father's impress, as the current coin of the realm of heaven. The gold
          itself was fused in the atoning sacrifice, but the minting of it,
          making it into that which should be the current coin of the merchant,
          was the resurrection of Christ. Then did his Father stamp the
          atonement with his own image and his own superscription. On the cross
          I see Jesus dying for my sins as an expiating sacrifice; but in the
          resurrection I see God acknowledging the death of Christ, and
          accepting what he has done for my indisputable justification. I see
          him putting his own imprimatur thereupon, stamping it with his own
          signet, dignifying it with his own seal, and again I cry, "Yea rather,
          who is risen from the dead," -- who then can condemn the believer? To
          put Christ's resurrection yet in another aspect. His death was the
          digging of the well of salvation. Stern was the labour, toilsome was
          the work; he dug on, and on, and on, through rocks of suffering, into
          the deepest caverns of misery; but the resurrection was the springing
          up of the water. Christ digged the well to its very bottom, but not a
          drop did spring up; still was the world dry and thirsty, till on the
          morning of the resurrection a voice was heard, "Spring up O well," and
          forth came Christ himself from the grave, and with him came the
          resurrection and the life; pardon and peace for all souls sprang up
          from the deep well of his misery. Oh! when I can find enough for my
          faith to be satisfied with even in the digging of the well, what shall
          be my satisfaction when I see it overflowing its brim, and springing
          up with life everlasting? Surely the apostle was right when he said,
          "Yea rather, who hath risen from the dead." And yet another picture.
          Christ was in his death the hostage of the people of God. He was the
          representative of all the elect. When Christ was bound to the tree, I
          see my own sin bound there; when he died every believer virtually died
          in him; when he was buried we were buried in him, and when he was in
          the tomb, he was, as it were, God's hostage for all his church, for
          all that ever should believe on him. Now, as long as he was in prison,
          although there might be ground of hope, it was but as light sown for
          the righteous; but when the hostage came out, behold the first fruit
          of the harvest! When God said, "Let my Anointed go free, I am
          satisfied and content in him," then every elect vessel went free in
          him; then every child of God was released from durance vile no more to
          die, not to know bondage or fetter for ever. I do see ground for hope
          when Christ is bound, for he is bound for me; I do see reason for
          rejoicing when he dies, for he dies for me, and in my room and stead;
          I do see a theme for solid satisfaction in his burial, for he is
          buried for me; but when he comes out of the grave, having swallowed up
          death in victory, my hope bursts into joyous song. He lives, and
          because he lives I shall live also. He is delivered and I am delivered
          too. Death hath no more dominion over him and no more dominion over
          me; his deliverance is mine, his freedom mine for ever. Again, I
          repeat it, the believer should take strong draughts of consolation
          here. Christ is risen from the dead, how can we be condemned? There
          are e'en stronger arguments for the non-condemnation of the believer
          in the resurrection of Christ than in his precious death and burial. I
          think I have shown this; only may God give us grace to rest upon this
          precious -- "yea, rather, who is risen from the dead."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The next clause of the sentence reads thus: "WHO IS EVEN AT THE
          RIGHT HAND OF GOD." Is there not any word of special commendation to
          this? You will remember the last one had, "Yea, rather." Is there
          nothing to commend this? Well, if not in this text, there is in
          another. If, at your leisure, you read through the fifth chapter of
          this epistle to the Romans, you will there very readily discover that
          the apostle proves, that if Christ's death be an argument for our
          salvation, his life is a still greater one. He says in the tenth verse
          of that chapter, "If, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God
          by the death of his Son, much more" -- that's the word I wanted --
          "much more we shall be saved by his life." We may look, then, at this
          third clause, as having a "much more" before it, comparing Scripture
          with Scripture. We cannot be condemned for "Christ hath died. Yea
          rather, is risen again; (much more) is even at the right hand of God."
          Here is an argument which hath much more power, much more strength,
          much more force than even Christ's death. Sometimes I have thought
          that impossible. Last Lord's day, I thought by God's good help I was
          enabled to persuade some of you that the death of Christ was an
          argument too potent to be ever denied -- an argument for the salvation
          of all for whom he died. Much more, let me now tell you, is his life,
          much more the fact that he lives, and is at the right hand of the
          Father. Now I must call your attention to this clause, remarking that
          in other passages of God's Word, Christ is said to have sat down for
          ever at the right hand of God. Do observe with care the fact that he
          is always described in heaven as sitting down. This seems to me to be
          one material argument for the salvation of the believer -- Christ sits
          in heaven. Now, he never would sit if the work were not fully done.
          Jesus when he was on earth, had a baptism to be baptised with, and how
          was he straitened until it was accomplished! He had not time so much
          as to eat bread, full often, so eager was he to accomplish all his
          work. And I do not, I cannot imagine that he would be sitting down in
          heaven in the posture of ease, unless he had accomplished all --
          unless "It is finished!" were to be understood in its broadest and
          most unlimited sense. There is one thing I have noticed, in looking
          over the old levitical law, under the description of the tabernacle.
          There were no seats whatever provided tor the priests. Every priest
          stands daily ministering and offering sacrifice for sin. They never
          had any seats to sit on. There was a table for the shew-bread, an
          altar, and a brazen lover; yet there was no seat. No priest sat down;
          he must always stand; for there was always work to be accomplished,
          always something to be done. But the great high priest of our
          profession, Jesus, the Son of God, hath taken his seat at the right
          hand of the majesty on high. Why is this? Because, now the sacrifice
          is complete for ever, and the priest hath made a full end of his
          solemn service. What would the Jew have thought if it had been
          possible for a seat to have been introduced into the sanctuary, and
          for the high priest to sit down? Why, the Jew would then have been
          compelled to believe that it was all over, the dispensation was ended;
          for a sitting priest would be the end of all. And now we may rest
          assured, since we can see a sitting Christ in heaven, that the whole
          atonement is finished, the work is over, he hath made an end of sin. I
          do consider that in this there is an argument why no believer ever can
          perish. If he could, if there were yet a chance of risk, Christ would
          not be sitting down; if the work were not so fully done, that every
          redeemed one should at last be received into heaven, he would never
          rest, nor hold his peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turning, however, more strictly to the words of the text, "Who is even
          at the right hand of God" -- what meaneth this? It means, first of
          all, that Christ is now in the honourable position of an accepted one.
          The right hand of God is the place of majesty, and the place of favour
          too. Now, Christ is his people's representative. When he died for them
          they had rest; when he rose again for them, they had liberty; when he
          was received into his Father's favour, yet again, and sat at his own
          right hand, then had they favour, and honour, and dignity. Do you not
          remember that the two sons of Zebedee asked to sit, one on the right
          hand and the other on the left? Little did they know that they had
          already what they asked for -- for all the church is now at the right
          hand of the Father; all the church is now raised up together, and made
          to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. The raising and
          elevation of Christ to that throne of dignity and favour, is the
          elevation, the acceptance, the enshrinement, the glorifying of all his
          people, for he is their common head, and stands as their
          representative. This sitting at the right hand of God, then, is to be
          viewed as the acceptance of the person of the surety, the reception of
          the representative, and therefore, the acceptance of our souls. Who is
          he that condemneth, then? Condemn a man that is at the right hand of
          God! Absurd! Impossible! Yet am I there in Christ. Condemn a man who
          sits next to his Father, the King of kings! Yet there is the church,
          and how can she in the slightest degree incur condemnation, when she
          is already at the right hand of the Father with her covenant head. And
          let me further remark, that the right hand is the place of power.
          Christ at the right hand of God signifies that all power is given unto
          him in heaven and in earth. Now, who is he that condemns the people
          that have such a head as this? O my soul! what can destroy thee if
          omnipotence is thy helper? If the aegis of the Almighty covers thee,
          what sword can smite thee? If the wings of the Eternal are thy
          shelter, what plague can attack thee? Rest thou secure. It Jesus is
          thine all-prevailing king, and hath trodden thine enemies beneath his
          feet, if sin, death, and hell, are now only parts of his empire, for
          he is Lord of all, and if thou art represented in him, and he is thy
          guarantee, thy sworn surety, it cannot be by any possibility that thou
          canst be condemned. While we have an Almighty Saviour, the redeemed
          must be saved; until omnipotence can fail, and the Almighty can be
          overcome, every blood-bought redeemed child of God is safe and secure
          for ever. Well did the apostle say of this -- "much more -- much more
          than dying and rising again from the dead, he lives at the right hand
          of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And now I come to the fourth; and this also hath an encomium
          passed upon it -- "WHO ALSO MAKETH INTERCESSION FOR US." Our apostle,
          in the epistle to the Hebrews, puts a very strong encomium upon this
          sentence. What does he say upon it? A little more than he said about
          the others. The first one is, "Yea rather;" the second one is, "Much
          more." And what is the third? Remember the passage -- "He is able also
          to save them unto the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he
          ever liveth to make intercession for them." Lo! this is -- "to the
          uttermost;" what we thought, perhaps, to be the very smallest matter
          in the recital, is just the greatest. "To the very uttermost" he is
          able to save, seeing he ever lives to intercede -- the strongest
          argument of the whole four. Let us try to meet this question, "Why
          does Christ intercede to day in heaven?" A quaint old divine says,
          that "When God in his justice rose from his throne to smite the
          surety, he would make no concession whatever. The surety paid the
          debt." "Yet," said the Judge, "I will not come down to earth to
          receive the payment; bring it to me." And therefore the surety first
          groped through death to fight his way up to the eternal throne, and
          then mounting aloft by a glorious ascension, dragged his conquered
          foes behind him, and scattering mercies with both his hands, like
          Roman conquerors who scattered gold and silver coins in their triumph,
          entered heaven. And he came before his Father's throne and said,
          "There it is; the full price: I have brought it all." God would not go
          down to the earth for payment; it must be brought to him. This was
          pictured by the high priest of old. The high priest first took the
          blood, but that was not accepted. He did not bring the mercy-seat
          outside the veil, to carry the mercy-seat to the blood. No; the blood
          must he taken to the mercy-seat, God will not stoop when he is just;
          it must be brought to him. So the high priest takes off his royal
          robes, and puts on the garments of the minor priest, and goes within
          the veil, and sprinkles the blood upon the mercy-seat. Even so did our
          Lord Jesus Christ. He took the payment and bore it to God, -- took his
          wounds, his rent body, his flowing blood, up to his Father's very
          eyes, and there he spread his wounded hands and pleaded tor his
          people. Now here is a proof that the Christian cannot be condemned,
          because the blood is on the mercy-seat. It is not poured out on the
          ground; it is on the mercy-seat, it is on the throne; it speaks in the
          very ears of God, and it must of a surety prevail.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, perhaps, the sweetest proof that the Christian cannot be
          condemned, is derived from the intercession of Christ, if we view it
          thus. Who is Christ, and who is it with whom he intercedes. My soul
          was in raptures when I mused yesterday upon two sweet thoughts; they
          are but simple and plain, but they were very interesting to me. I
          thought that had I to intercede for anybody, and do a mediating part,
          if I had to intercede for my brother with my father, I should feel I
          had got a safe case in hand. This is just what Jesus has to do. He has
          to intercede with his Father, and mark, with our Father too. There is
          a double precedent to strengthen our confidence that he must prevail.
          When Christ pleads, he does not plead with one who is stronger than
          him or inimical to him, but with his own Father. "My Father," saith he
          "it is my delight to do thy will and it is thy delight to do my will,
          I will then that they, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I
          am." And then he adds this blessed argument, "Father those for whom I
          plead are thine own children, and thou lovest them as much as I do,"
          yea, "thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me." Oh, it is no hard
          task to plead, when you are pleading with a Father for a brother, and
          when the advocate can say, "I go to my Father and to your Father, to
          my God and to your God." Suppose, my dear friends, that any of you
          were about to be tried for your life, do you think you could trust
          your advocacy with any man you know? I do really think I should be
          impatient to speak for myself. But my counsel would say, "Now just be
          quiet, my dear sir, you perhaps may plead more earnestly than I can,
          because it is for your own life, but then you do not understand the
          law, you will make some blunder or other, and commit yourself and
          spoil your own cause." But still I think if my life were in hazard,
          and I stood in the dock, and my counsel were pleading for me, my
          tongue would be itching to plead for myself, and I should want to get
          up and just say, "My lord, I am innocent, innocent as the babe newly
          born, of the crime laid to my charge. My hands have never been stained
          with the blood of any man." Oh! I think I could indeed plead if I were
          pleading for myself. But, do you know, I have never felt that with
          regard to Christ. I can sit down and let him plead, and I do not want
          to get up and conduct the pleading myself. I do feel that he loves me
          better than I love myself. My cause is quite safe in his hands,
          especially when I remember again that he pleads with my father, and
          that he is his own Father's beloved Son, and that he is my brother --
          and such a brother -- a brother born for adversity.
        </p>
        <p>"Give him, my soul, thy cause to plead,</p>
        <p>Nor doubt the Father's grace."</p>
        <p>
          It is enough; he has the cause, nor would we take it from his hand
          even if we could --
        </p>
        <p>"I know that safe with him remains,</p>
        <p>Protected by his power --</p>
        <p>What I've committed to his hands</p>
        <p>Till the decisive hour."</p>
        <p>
          Well did the apostle say, "To the very uttermost he is able to save
          them that come unto God by him, because he ever lives to make
          intercession for them."
        </p>
        <p>
          I have thus given you the four props and pillars of the believer's
          faith. And now my hearers, let me just utter this personal appeal to
          you. What would you give, some of you, if you could have such a hope
          as this? Here are four pillars. Oh unhappy souls, that cannot call one
          of these your own! The mass of men are all in uncertainty; they do not
          know what will become of them at last. They are discontented enough
          with life and yet they are afraid to die. God is angry with them, and
          they know it. Death is terrible to them; the tomb affrights them, they
          can scarcely understand the possibility of having any confidence this
          side of the grave. Ah, my hearers, what would you give if you could
          obtain this confidence? And yet it is within reach of every truly
          penitent sinner. If you are now led to repent of sin; if you will now
          cast yourself on the blood and righteousness of Christ, your eternal
          salvation shall be as sure as your present existence. He cannot perish
          who relies on Christ, and he who hath faith in Jesus may see the
          heavens pass away, but not God's Word. He may see the earth burned,
          but into the fire of hell he can never go. He is safe, and he must be
          saved, though all things pass away.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now this brings me to the challenge. Fain would I picture the
          apostle as he appeared when he was uttering it. Hark! I hear a brave,
          strong voice, crying, "Who shall lay anything to my charge?" "Who is
          that? -- Paul. What! Paul, a Christian! I thought Christians were a
          humble, timid people." "They are so; but not when they are arrayed in
          the robes, and invested with the credentials of their Sovereign. They
          are lambs in the harmlessness of their dispositions, but they have the
          courage of lions when they defend the honours of their King. Again, I
          hear him cry, "Who shall lay anything to my charge?" -- and he casts
          his eyes to heaven. Is not the wretch smitten dead? Will not such
          presumption as this be avenged? Does he challenge purity to convict
          him of guilt? O Paul, the thunderbolt of God will smite thee! "No,"
          says he, "it is God that justifieth, I am not afraid to face the
          highest heaven, since God has said that I am just. I can look upward
          without distressing fear." "But hush! repeat not that challenge."
          "Yes," saith he, "I will. Who is he that condemneth." And I see him
          look downwards; there lies the old dragon, bound in chains, the
          accuser of the brethren; and the apostle stares him in the face, and
          says, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?" Why,
          Paul, Satan will bring thundering accusations against thee; art thou
          not afraid? "No," says he, "I can stop his mouth with this cry, It is
          Christ that died;' -- that will make him tremble, for he crushed the
          serpent's head in that victorious hour. And I can shut his mouth again
          -- 'yea rather, that is risen again,' for he took him captive on that
          day; -- I will add, who sitteth at the right hand of God.' I can foil
          him with that, for he sits there to judge him and to condemn him for
          ever. Once more I will appeal to his advocacy Who maketh intercession
          for us.' I can stop his accusation with this perpetual care of Jesus
          for his people." Again, cries Paul, "Who shall lay anything to my
          charge?" There lie the bodies of the saints he has martyred, and they
          cry from under the altar -- "O Lord! how long wilt thou not avenge
          thine own elect?" Paul says, -- "Who can lay anything to my charge?"
          And they speak not; "because," says Paul, "I have obtained mercy --
          who was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and injurious, that in me
          first he might show forth all longsuffering." "Christ hath died, yea
          rather, hath risen again." And now standing in the midst of men who
          mock, and boast, and jeer, he cries -- "Who can lay anything to my
          charge?" and no one dares to speak, for man himself cannot accuse;
          with all his malevolence, and acrimony, and malice, he can bring
          nothing against him; no charge can stand at the bar of God against the
          man whom he hath absolved through the merits of the death of Christ,
          and the power of his resurrection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it not a noble thing for a Christian to be able to go where he may,
          and feel that he cannot meet his accuser; that wherever he may be,
          whether he walketh within himself in the chambers of conscience, or
          out of himself amongst his fellow men, or above himself into heaven,
          or beneath himself into hell, yet is he a justified one, and nothing
          can be laid to his charge. Who can condemn? Who can condemn? Yea, echo
          O ye skies; reverberate, ye caverns of the deep. Who can condemn when
          Christ hath died, hath risen from the dead, is enthroned on high, and
          intercedes?
        </p>
        <p>
          But all things pass away. I see the heavens on fire, rolling up like a
          scroll -- I see sun, moon, and stars pale now their feeble light --
          the earth is tottering; the pillars of heaven are rocking; the grand
          assize is commenced -- the herald angels descend, not to sing this
          time, but with thundering trumpets to proclaim, "He comes, he comes to
          judge the earth in righteousness, and the people in equity." What says
          the believer now? He says, "I fear not that assize, for who can
          condemn?" The great white throne is set, the books are opened, men are
          trembling, fiends are yelling, sinners are shrieking -- "Rocks hide
          us, mountains on us fall;" these make up an awful chorus of dismay.
          There stands the believer, and looking round on the assembled universe
          of men and angels, he cries, "Who shall lay anything to my charge?"
          and silence reigns through earth and heaven. Again he speaks, and
          fixing his eyes full on the Judge himself, he cries, "Who is he that
          condemneth?" And lo, there upon the throne of judgment sits the only
          one who can condemn; and who is that? It is Christ that died, yea
          rather, that is risen again, who sitteth on the right hand of God, who
          maketh intercession for him. Can those lips say, "Depart, ye cursed,"
          to the man for whom they once did intercede? Can those eyes flash
          lightnings on the man whom once they saw in sin, and thence with rays
          of love they did lift him up to joy, and peace, and purity? No! Christ
          will not belie himself. He cannot reverse his grace; it cannot be that
          the throne of condemnation shall be exalted on the ruins of the cross.
          It cannot be that Christ should transform himself at last; but till he
          can do so, none can condemn. None but he hath a right to condemn, for
          he is the sole judge of right and wrong, and if he hath died shall he
          put us to death, and if he hath risen for us, shall he thrust us
          downwards to the pit, and if he hath reigned for us and hath been
          accepted for us, shall he cast us away, and if he hath pleaded for us,
          shall he curse us at the last? No! Come life, come death, my soul can
          rest on this. He died for me. I cannot be punished for my sin. He rose
          again, I must rise, and though I die yet shall I live again. He sits
          at the right hand of God, and so must I. I must be crowned and reign
          with him for ever. He intercedes, and he must be heard. He beckons me,
          and I must be brought at length to see his face, and to be with him
          where he is.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will say no more; only may God give us all an interest in these four
          precious things. An angel's tongue might fail to sing their sweetness,
          or tell their brightness and their majesty; mine has failed -- but
          this is well. The excellency of the power is in the doctrine, and not
          in my preaching. Amen.<br />
