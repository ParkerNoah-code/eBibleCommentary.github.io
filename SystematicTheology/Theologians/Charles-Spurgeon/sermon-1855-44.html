        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.47)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, October 21, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that
          thou shouldest keep them from the evil." -- John 17:15.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS PRAYER of Christ is an ever precious portion to all true
          believers, from the fact that each of them has an inalienable interest
          in it. Every one of us, beloved, when we listen to the words of Christ
          should recollect that he is praying for us; that while it is for the
          great body of his elect he intercedes in this chapter and the one
          preceding it, yet it is also for each believer in particular that he
          offers intercession. However weak we are, however poor; however little
          our faith, or however small our grace may be, our names are still
          written on his heart; nor shall we lose our share in Jesus' love.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will proceed at once to the discussion of the text as my time is
          limited. First, there is a negative prayer: "I pray not that thou
          shouldst take them out of the world;" second, here is a positive
          prayer; but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil."
        </p>
        <p>
          We have then a negative prayer in this verse. "I pray not that thou
          shouldst take them out of the world. "Now, beloved, when we see
          persons converted to God, when men are turned front iniquity unto
          righteousness, from sinners into saints, the thought sometimes strikes
          us -- would it not be good to take them at once to heaven, would it
          not be an excellent thing to translate them speedily from the realms
          of sin to the breast of the Lord who loved them with an everlasting
          love? Would it not be wiser to take the young plants out of the chilly
          air of this world, where they may possibly be injured and weakened,
          and transplant them at once to the land where they may bloom in peace
          and tranquility for ever? Not so, however, does Jesus pray. When the
          man had the devils cast out of him, he said to Jesus, "Lord, I would
          follow thee whithersoever thou goest. "But Jesus said to him, "Go to
          thy friends and relations, and tell them how great things the Lord
          hath done for thee." Some men when they are converted are all for
          going speedily to heaven; but they have not done with earth yet. They
          would like to wear the crown without bearing the cross, they desire to
          win without running, and conquer without a battle, but their whim has
          no countenance from Jesus, for he exclaims, "I pray not that thou
          shouldest take them out of the world."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall first of all speak of the meanings of this prayer; secondly,
          the reasons of this prayer; thirdly, the doctrinal inferences that we
          may derive from it; and fourthly, the practical lessons it teaches.
          Briefly on each point.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First. THE MEANINGS OF THIS PRAYER. "I pray not that thou shouldest
          take them out of the world. "Now, there are two senses in which this
          prayer may be understood. One is, -- he prays not that they should, by
          retirement and solitude, be kept entirely separate from the world; and
          the second, -- he asks not that they should be taken away by death.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, as regards retirement from the World and solitude. Some hermits
          and others have fancied that if we were to shut ourselves from the
          world and live alone, we should then be more devoted to God and serve
          him better. Many men of old lived in deserts, never coming into the
          cities, wandering about alone, praying in caves and forests, and
          thinking they were contaminated, and rendered impure if once they
          mingled with mankind. So have we among the Roman Catholics, persons
          who act the part of hermits, living far from the common haunts of men,
          and conceiving that by so doing they shall abundantly serve God. There
          are also certain orders of monks and nuns who live almost alone,
          seeing only their fellows, and fancying that by seclusion they are
          putting honor upon God, and winning salvation for themselves. Now it
          is too late in the day for any of as to speak against monasticism. It
          has demonstrated its own fallacy. It was found that some of those men
          who had separated from society were guilty of more vile and vicious
          practices, and sinned more grossly than men who were in the world.
          There are not many who can depart from the customs of social life, and
          in solitude maintain their spirit pure and unsullied. Why, brethren,
          common sense tells us at once that living alone is not the way to
          serve God. It may be the way to serve self, and wrap ourselves in a
          garment of self-complacency; but it cannot be the way to worship God
          truly. If it be possible, by this means, to fulfil one part of the
          great law of God, we cannot, possibly carry out the other portion --
          to love our neighbour as ourselves, for we thus become unable to bind
          up the broken-hearted, to bring the wanderer back, or to win souls
          from death and sin. Out of the heart proceedeth all evil, and if we
          were in retirement we should sin, because we should carry our hearts
          with us into whatever solitude we entered. If we could but once get
          rid of our hearts, if there were some means of rendering our natures
          perfect, then we might be able to live alone; but, as we now are, that
          door must be well listed that would keep out the devil; that cell must
          be much secluded that sin cannot enter. I have heard of a man who
          thought he could live without sin if he were to dwell alone; so he
          took a pitcher of water and a store of bread, and provided some wood,
          and shut himself up in a solitary cell saying, " Now I shall live in
          peace." But in a moment or two he chanced to kick the pitcher over,
          and he thereupon used an angry expression. Then he said, "I see it is
          possible to lose one's temper even when alone;" and he at once
          returned to live among men.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it may be understood in a second sense. "I pray not that thou
          shouldest take them out of this world" -- by death. That is a sweet
          and blessed mode of taking us out of the world, which will happen to
          us all by-and-by. In a few more years the chariot of fire and the
          horses of fire will take away the Lord's soldiers. But Jesus does not
          pray that one of his chosen people should be too soon removed, he does
          not desire to see his newly begotten souls plume their wings and fly
          aloft to heaven until their time shall come. How frequently does the
          wearied pilgrim put up the prayer, "O that I had wings like a dove,
          for then would I fly away and be at rest. "But Christ does not pray
          like that; he leaves it to his Father, until, like shocks of corn
          fully ripe, we shall each of us be gathered into our Master's garner.
          Jesus does not plead for our immediate removal by death. He asks that
          we may do well in the world, but he never asks for us to be gathered
          in before we are ripe. Thus I have explained the two meanings of the
          words, "I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world" --
          either by living retired from men, or being taken away by death.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now the second point WAS THE REASON FOR THIS PETITION. These
          reasons are threefold, Christ does not pray that we should be taken
          out of the world, because our abode here is for our own good, for the
          world's benefit, and for his glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, it would not be for our own good to be taken out of this
          world. I leave out the first idea of the text, and only speak of it
          concerning death. We conceive that the greatest blessing we shall ever
          receive of God is to die; but doubtless it would not be for our good
          to withdraw from this world as soon as we had escaped from sin. It is
          better for us to tarry a little while; far better. And the reasons for
          this are -- first, because a little stay on earth will make heaven all
          the sweeter. Nothing makes rest so sweet as toil; nothing can render
          security so pleasant as a long exposure to alarms, and fears, and
          battles. No heaven will be so sweet as a heaven, which has been
          preceded by torments and pains. Methinks the deeper draughts of woe we
          drink here below, the sweeter will be those draughts of eternal glory
          which we shall receive from the golden bowls of bliss; the more we are
          battered and scarred on earth the more glorious will be our victory
          above, when the shouts of a thousand times ten thousand angels welcome
          us to our Father's palace. The more trials the more bliss, the more
          sufferings the more ecstasies, the more depression the higher the
          exaltation. Thus we shall gain more of heaven by the sufferings we
          shall pass through here below. Let us not then, my brethren, fear to
          advance through our trials: they are for our good; to stop here awhile
          is for our benefit. Why! we should not know how to converse in heaven
          if we had not a few trials and hardships to tell of, and some tales of
          delivering grace to repeat with joy. An old sailor likes to have
          passed through a few shipwrecks and storms, however hazardous they may
          have been, for he anchors in Greenwich Hospital, he will there tell,
          with great pleasure, to his companions, of his hair-breadth escapes.
          There will be some old soldiers in heaven, too, who will recount their
          fights, how their Master delivered them, and how he won the victory
          and kept off all their foes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, we should not have fellowship with Christ if we did not stop
          here. Fellowship with Christ is so honorable a thing that it is worth
          while to suffer, that we may thereby enjoy it. You have sometimes
          heard me express a desire that I might be in the number of those who
          shall be alive and remain, and so shall escape death, but a dear
          friend of mine says, he had rather die, in order that he might thus
          have fellowship with Christ in his sufferings, and methinks the
          thought finds an echo in my own breast. To die with Jesus makes death
          a perfect treasure, to be a follower in the grave with him makes death
          a pleasure. Moreover, you and I might be taken for cowards, although
          we may have fellowship with him in his glory, if we had no scars to
          prove the sufferings we had passed through, and the wounds we had
          received for his name. Thus, again you see it is for our good to be
          here; we should not have known fellowship with the Saviour, if we had
          not tarried here a little while. I should never have known the
          Saviour's love half so much if I had not been in the storms of
          affliction. How sweet it is to learn the Saviour's love when nobody
          else loves us! When friends flee away, what a blessed thing it is to
          see that the Saviour does not forsake us but still keeps us, and holds
          fast by us, and clings to us, and will not let us go! O beloved
          brother and sister, believe that your remaining here on earth is for
          your eternal benefit, and therefore Jesus said. "I pray not that thou
          shouldest take them out of the world."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. And again, it is for the good of other people. Methinks we should
          all be willing to remain on earth for the good of others. Why may not
          saints die as soon as they are converted? For this reason: because God
          meant that they should be the means of the salvation of their
          brethren. You would not, surely, wish to go out of the world if there
          were a soul to be saved by you. Methinks if I could go to glory before
          I had converted all the souls allotted to me, I should not be happy;
          but that would be impossible, for God will not shut his saints in till
          they have been spiritual fathers to those appointed. We do not wish to
          enter heaven till our work is done, for it would make us uneasy on our
          beds if there were one single soul left to be saved by our means.
          Tarry, then, Christian; there is a brand to be plucked out of the
          fire, a sinner to be saved from his sins, a rebel to be turned from
          the error of his ways, and may hap that sinner is one of thy
          relatives. May hap, poor widow, that art spared in this world, because
          there is a wayward son of thine not yet saved, and God hath designed
          to make thee the favored instrument of bringing him to glory. And thou
          hoary-headed Christian, it may be that though "the grasshopper is a
          burden to thee," and thou longest to go, thou art kept here because
          one of thy offspring, by thy instrumentality, is yet to be saved.
          Tarry, then, for thy son's sake, who came from thy loins. I know how
          deeply thou dost love him, and for his sake surly thou art content to
          be left here a little, counting it for the best that thou mayest bring
          in thy son to glory with thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But the third reason is because it is for God's glory. A tried
          saint brings more glory to God than an untried one. I do verily think
          in my own soul that a believer in a dungeon reflects more glory on his
          Master than a believer in paradise, that a child of God in the burning
          fiery furnace, whose hair is yet unscorched, and upon whom the smell
          of the fire has not passed, displays more the glory of Godhead than
          even he who stands with a crown upon his head, perpetually singing
          praises before the Father's throne. Nothing reflects so much honor on
          a workman as a trial of his work, and its endurance of it. So with
          God. It honors him when his saints preserve their integrity. Peter
          honored Christ more when he walked upon the water, than when he stood
          upon the land. There was no glory given to God by his walking on the
          solid shore, but there was glory reflected when he trod upon the
          water. Peter saw the Lord coming on the water, and he said to him,
          "Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. And he said,
          come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the
          water to go to Jesus." What may we not go through, Christians, at his
          command? O methinks we could rise and cut Agag to pieces, and hew the
          devil himself and break his head, through the power of Jesus. It is
          then for the glory of Jesus that we yet tarry. If my lying in the dust
          would elevate Christ one inch higher, I would say, "O let me remain,
          for it is sweet! to be here for the Lord." And if to live here for
          ever would make Christ more glorious, I would prefer to live here
          eternally. If we could but add more jewels to the crown of Christ by
          remaining here, why should we wish to be taken out of the world? We
          should say, "It is blessed to be anywhere, where we can glorify him."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The third point is THE DOCTRINAL INFERENCE WE MAY DERIVE FROM
          THIS PRAYER.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first inference -- Death is God taking the people out of the
          world; and when we die we are removed by God. Death is not an
          independent being, who comes at his own will, to carry us away when he
          pleases. In fact, it is not true that death does take away the
          Christian at all: God alone can remove his children from this world.
          Whether the humble peasant, or the reigning monarch, one hand lifts
          them to the sky. You will see this by referring to the Revelation
          where the vintage of the wicked is gathered by an angel, but the
          harvest of the righteous is reaped by Christ himself. "And another
          angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a
          sharp sickle. And another angel came out from the altar, which had
          power over the fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the
          sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the
          clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. And
          the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine
          of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of
          God." These were the wicked. But, if you go to the preceding passage,
          it says, "And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud
          one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown,
          and in his hand a sharp sickle. And another angel came out of the
          temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust
          in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is Come for thee to reap; for
          the harvest of the earth is ripe. And he that sat on the cloud thrust
          in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped." Christ is the
          reaper who cuts his own corn. He will not trust an angel to do it. God
          alone has the issues of life in his hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next thing is that dying is not of one-half so much importance as
          living to Christ." I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the
          world." He does not make their dying an object of prayer, "but that
          thou shouldest keep them from the evil." He prays that they should be
          preserved in life, knowing that their death would assuredly follow
          rightly, as a matter of course. Many say one to the other, "Have you
          heard that so-and-so is dead?" "How did he die?" They should rather
          say, "How did he live?" It may be an important question,-how does a
          man die; but the most important question is, "How does a man live?"
          What a curious notion people get about death! The question they ask is
          not whether a man dies in the Lord Jesus, but, "Has he had a very easy
          death? Did he die gently?" If so, they conclude that all is well. If I
          ask, "Had he any affection to trust in Christ?" the reply probably
          will be, "Well, at all events, I thought he had; he had a very easy
          death." People think so much of an easy death. If there are no pains
          in death, if they are not in trouble, and not plagued like others,
          they falsely conclude all to be well. But though like sheep they are
          laid in the grave, they may awaken to destruction in the morning. It
          is not a sign of grace that our dying is easy. It is natural for
          persons in the decay of strength to die easily. Many of the most
          vicious men, who have destroyed the power of their bodies, have an
          easy, painless death, from the fact that there is nothing to struggle
          against death; but, then, though they die like lambs, they wake up in
          sorrow. Do not put any confidence in death-beds, my dear friends; do
          not look on them as evidences of Christianity. The greatest evidence
          is not how a man dies, but how he lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The practical lesson we learn from this part of the text -- "I
          pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world" -- Is this,
          that we never have any encouragement peevishly to ask God to let us
          die. Christians are always wanting to die when they have any trouble
          or trial. You ask them why? "Because we would be with the Lord." O
          yes, they want to be with the Lord, when trouble and temptations come
          upon them. But it is not because they are "panting to be with the
          Lord," it is because they desire to get rid of their troubles -- else
          they would not want to die at all times when a little vexation is upon
          them. They want to get home, not so much for the Saviour's company, as
          to get out of the little hard work. They did not wish to go away when
          they were in quiet and prosperity. Like lazy fellows, as most of us
          are, when we get into a little labour we beg to go home. It is quite
          right sometimes that you should desire to depart, because you would
          not prove yourself to be a true Israelite if you did not want to go to
          Jerusalem. You may pray to be taken home out of the world, but Christ
          will not take up the petition. When your prayers come to the Lord,
          this little one may try to got amongst them, but Christ will say, "I
          do not know anything about you, I pray not that thou shouldest take
          them out of the world."' You may wish it sincerely, and really desire
          it, but you will not at present get your Master to pray with you.
          Instead, then, of crying, or wishing to be away from the battle, brace
          yourself up in the name of the Lord. Think every wish to escape the
          fight, is but a desertion of your Master. Do not so much as think of
          rest, but remember, that though you may cry, "Let me retire into the
          tent," you will not be admitted until you return a victor. Therefore,
          stop here, and work and labour.

          My dear friends, I had intended to preach from the other half of the
          verse, but that is quite impossible, the time is so far gone, and I
          can only manage the first part thereof. So I must depart from my
          original intention; and I will restrict myself to some thoughts which
          occur to me upon the first portion of our text.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world." Perhaps,
          to-morrow you will be saying, "I am very sorry Sabbath-day is over. I
          am obliged to go to business again. I wish it were always Sunday, that
          I attend to my preaching, or to the schools, or to the prayer-meeting,
          or to the tract-distributing. No obstructions of the world afflict me
          there, no vexatious of the spirit occur there. I am sick of the world.
          Oh! if I could never go into it again." Let me jog thy elbow a bit.
          Does Jesus think so? Hear him! "I pray not that thou shouldest take
          them out of the world." There is no remedy for the ill, if it be an
          ill, therefore endure it with becoming fortitude; yea, rather seek to
          improve the opportunity thus afforded you, of conferring a blessing
          upon your race, and of gaining advantages for yourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pious mind will know how to improve the very sight of sin to its
          own sanctification. It will learn humility when it remembers that
          restraining grace alone prevents a similar fault in itself. It will
          gather subjects for gratitude and admiration from the fact, that grace
          alone has made it to differ. Never shall we value grace so much as
          when we see the evil front which it delivers us, never shall we more
          abhor sin than when we discern its visible deformity. Bad society is
          in itself like the poisonous cassava, but if baked in the fire of
          grace it may even be rendered useful. True grace casts salt into the
          poisonous stream, and then when forced to ford it, the filth thereof
          is destroyed. Abide, then, O soldier, in the trenches of labour and
          battle, for the hardness of service is beneficial to thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          But remember while here that thou losest no opportunity of attacking
          the foe. Never miss an opportunity of having a shot at the devil. Be
          ready on all occasion to do mischief to the enemy. In business, drop a
          word of savour and unction; in company, turn the conversation
          heavenward; in private, wrestle at the throne. I do not advise you to
          intrude religion at unseasonable hours. I do not conceive it to be
          your duty when a customer calls to pay a bill to ask him into your
          office and spend half an hour in prayer with him, nor would I think it
          needful to sanctify your ribbons and shawls by exhorting the
          purchasers across the counter. Some have not been quite innocent of
          the charge of cant who make as much use of religion to attract
          customers, as they do of their plate glass window. Do not talk of
          religion to be heard of men, but when a fair opportunity offers, out
          with your rifle and take a steady aim. Cromwell's singular advice to
          his soldiers was, "Trust in God, my friends, and keep your powder
          dry." In a better sense this is mine. More than all keep up a
          continual fire on the emeny by a holy life. Nothing will more reprove
          sin than your holiness. If you cannot tell the stick it Is crooked,
          you can prove it to be so, by laying a straight one side by side with
          it. So put your purity before the impure, and they will be effectually
          reproved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well then, again, do not be afraid to go out into the world to do
          good. Christ is keeping you in the world for the advantage of your
          fellow-men. I am sometimes wicked enough to think that I would rather
          go anywhere than stand up again and preach my Master's gospel. Like
          Jonah, I have thought I would really pay my fare to be carried away to
          Tarshish, instead of coming back to Nineveh. So would some of you who
          have tried to preach, and found you could not succeed as you desired.
          But do not be down-hearted, my brother; a Christian should never get
          so. If you have but one listener to-day, perhaps the next time the
          number will be doubled, and so on, till they cannot be counted. Never
          say, "I wish to go out of this world:" do not murmur, "My life Is
          prolonged beyond my joys." Do what you can. Do not go amongst people
          with fear; do not be ashamed to look duty in the face. If you are not
          successful at first, do not he cowards and run away from your guns. We
          should do all we can to bring our guns into line with our brothers,
          and take good aim at our foes. Never desert your work, though you come
          home distressed in spirit, though you see no gleam of success, and
          nothing is gained. Recollect, you cannot run out of the battle, but
          you must go on; and you cannot escape the service. On then, and glory
          shall be yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my brethren, what bearing has this text upon the ungodly? There
          are some here, my dear friends, of whom I have sometimes thought that
          I could almost pray that God should take them out of the world. I can
          tell you why; they are so wicked -- so dreadfully wicked, such
          hardened reprobates, with such iron souls, that they seem as if they
          never would be turned to God, and whose portion it would appear to be
          damned themselves, and to lead others to the same condition. I know a
          village where there is a man so vicious, so abandoned, that I could
          almost pray for him to be removed out of the world; he is so awfully
          wicked that many of those I thought hopeful Christians have been
          poisoned by his example. Indeed he seemed to be depraving the entire
          population. He stands like a deadly Upas tree, with outspread
          branches, overshadowing the whole place. He is consuming all around
          him; and instead of it being a mercy for him to be here, it would be
          like a mercy if he were gone. Are not some of you like that man? Are
          you not so bad that you are doing all the mischief in the world you
          can? You never do anything for the cause of Christ, You are always
          trying to do your utmost against it. You never sow a little blade of
          God's grass where none grew before. You are of no service, and yet you
          are spared, because Jesus says, " I pray not that thou shouldest take
          them out of the world." He prays that you may be in the world a little
          longer. And what has he preserved you from? First, fever comes and
          bows thee down; but Christ says, "Let him not depart yet. O spare him
          now." And thou art spared. The second time, disease comes near unto
          thee, and great pains bow thee down. Again he prays, "Spare him!" and
          thou art yet safe. The third time thou art fast approaching thy end.
          Now the angel of death is lifting up the glittering steel, and his axe
          is almost fallen on thee. Yet Christ says, "Spare him, angel! Spare
          him -- peradventure he may yet turn to me with full purpose of heart."
          He whom thou hatest loved thee so much that he interceded for thee,
          and therefore thou wert spared till now. Remember, however, that this
          reprieve will not continue for ever. At last Justice will cry; "Cut
          him down, he cumbers the ground." Some of you have been cumbering the
          ground for sixty or seventy years-old sinners; of no use in this
          world. Is it so? There you are occupying the ground, keeping other
          trees from growing, and of no use! Your family is being damned by your
          example; the whole neighbourhood is tainted by you. Do not tell me I
          should not speak so roughly. I tell you, as long as I have a tongue in
          my head you shall have no mincemeat from me. If you are lost, it shall
          not be for want of plain speaking and honest warning. Oh, ye
          cumber-grounds! how much digging and dunging have ye received at the
          Lord's hand, and yet ye are fruitless. The axe will soon be at your
          root, and oh, the fire into which ye shall be cast! Ungodly man, thou
          art spared until thine overflowing cup of sin is dropping like oil
          upon the flame of vengeance, and the increasing fire will presently
          reach thee. The longer the archer draweth the bow the more mighty is
          the force of the arrow. What though vengeance tarrieth, it is that its
          sword may be sharpened and its arm nerved for direr execution. Oh, ye
          grey-heads! a little more delay and the stroke shall fall; tremble and
          kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, when his
          wrath is kindled but a little.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet, methinks, some of you who have cumbered the ground do most
          heartily desire to serve God. Poor sinner! I rejoice that thou feelest
          that thou hast been a cumber-ground. Dost thou confess that thou hast
          been a poor thorn and briar until now. Dost thou acknowledge that the
          Lord has been just to thee if he had damned thee? Then come as thou
          art and cast thyself on Jesus, without works, without merit. Wilt thou
          ask the Lord to turn thee into a good fig tree? If thou wilt, he will
          do it; for be declares, that he heareth prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was once a poor man in a small country town who had not all the
          sense people usually have, but he had sense enough to be a great
          drunkard and swearer as God would have it, he once listened to a poor
          woman, who was singing --
        </p>
        <p>"I'm a poor sinner and nothing at all</p>
        <p>But Jesus Christ is my all in all"</p>
        <p>
          Home he went, repeating these words, he put his trust in a crucified
          Saviour, and was really converted. Well, he soon came to the church,
          and although he was a pedlar, and always travelling about, he said, "I
          want to join your church." They, remembering his sinful way of life,
          required some great evidence of a change before they received him,
          "O!" says he, "I must come in," "But you have been such a great
          sinner, and you are unconverted," added the elders. "Well," said poor
          Jack, "I don't know if I'm unconverted, and I confess I am a great
          sinner -- but
        </p>
        <p>"I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all;</p>
        <p>But Jesus Christ is my all in all."</p>
        <p>
          They could not get from him any other testimony save this. He would
          only say --
        </p>
        <p>"I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all;</p>
        <p>But Jesus Christ is my all in all."</p>
        <p>
          They could not refuse him, and therefore accepted him for fellowship.
          After this he was always happy. When a Christian man said to him "But
          you always seem so happy and pleased, John; how is it?" "Well" said
          he, " I ought to be happy, for --
        </p>
        <p>"I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all;</p>
        <p>But Jesus Christ is my all in all."</p>
        <p>
          "Well but," said the gentleman, "I can't see how you can be always so
          happy and sure. I sometimes lose my evidences." "I don't," said Jack,
        </p>
        <p>" I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all;</p>
        <p>But Jesus Christ is my all in all."</p>
        <p>
          "Ah," said a friend, "I am at times miserable because I remember my
          sad sinfulness even since conversion." "Ah!" said Jack, "you have not
          begun to sing,
        </p>
        <p>"I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all.</p>
        <p>But Jesus Christ is my all in all."</p>
        <p>
          "Oh!" said the friend, "how do you get rid of your doubts and fears?
          My faith frequently fails, and I miss my sure hope in Christ. My
          frames are so variable and feelings so contrary, what do you think of
          that?" "Think," said poor Jack, " why master I have no good things to
          care about --
        </p>
        <p>"I'm a poor sinner and nothing at all,</p>
        <p>But Jesus Christ is my all in all.'"</p>
        <p>
          Well, then, if there is any one here who is "a poor sinner, find
          nothing at all," -- where is he? in the gallery" or sitting down
          below? If he cannot say all that poor man said; if he can say the
          first line, he need not fear to say the second. Never mind if he can't
          say,
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus Christ is my all in all."</p>
        <p>If he can say,</p>
        <p>"I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all,'</p>
        <p>he is most assuredly on the right road.</p>
        <p>
          "Oh! but," says one, "I am sinful, vile, worthless." All right! you're
          "a Poor sinner and nothing at all," and Jesus Christ is willing to be
          your "all in all." "But I have blasphemed God, departed from his ways,
          and greviously transgressed." Well, I believe that, and a great deal
          more, and am very glad to hear it; for thus I see you are
        </p>
        <p>"A poor sinner, and nothing at all."</p>
        <p>
          I am very glad if you will hold that opinion of yourself. "Ah! but I
          am afraid I have sinned too much. When I try I cannot do anything.
          When I try to mend my ways; when I try to believe in Christ, I
          cannot." We are glad, very glad of it brother, that you are
        </p>
        <p>"A poor sinner, and nothing at all."</p>
        <p>
          If you had a single particle of goodness; if you had a little bit not
          big enough to cover the top of your little finger, we should not be
          glad. But if thou art
        </p>
        <p>"A poor sinner, and nothing at all,</p>
        <p>Jesus Christ is thy all in all."</p>
        <p>
          Come! wilt thou have him? Thou art "nothing at all." Wilt thou have
          Christ? There he stands. Ask: it is all he wants, for thou art the
          object of his regard. There are only three steps. One is to step out
          of self, the second is to step upon Jesus, the third is to step into
          heaven. You have taken one step. I am sure you will take the others.
          God never makes you feel you are
        </p>
        <p>"A poor sinner, and nothing at all;"</p>
        <p>but, sooner or later, he gives</p>
        <p>"Jesus Christ as your all in all.'</p>
        <p>
          O poor sinner, do not be doubtful of my Master's power. Do but touch
          the hem of his garment, and thou shalt be made whole. Like the poor
          woman in the crowd, do but get at it and touch it, and he will surely
          say unto thee, "Thou art saved." If thou wilt go to him with this cry,
        </p>
        <p>I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all,</p>
        <p>And Jesus Christ is my all in all,"</p>
        <p>
          Then you will see the blessed reason why Jesus interceded thus; "I
          pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world."
