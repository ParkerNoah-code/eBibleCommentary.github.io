        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.120)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, March 8, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At The Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens</p>
        <p>
          |There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.| -- Proverbs
          18:24.
        </p>
        <p>
          CICERO has well said, |Friendship is the only thing in the world
          concerning the usefulness of which all mankind are agreed.| Friendship
          seems as necessary an element of a comfortable existence in this world
          as fire or water, or even air itself. A man may drag along a miserable
          existence in proud solitary dignity, but his life is scarce life, it
          is nothing but an existence, the tree of life being stripped of the
          leaves of hope and the fruits of joy. He who would be happy here must
          have friends; and he who would be happy hereafter, must, above all
          things, find a friend in the world to come, in the person of God, the
          Father of his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Friendship, however, though very pleasing and exceedingly blessed, has
          been the cause of the greatest misery to men when it has been unworthy
          and unfaithful; for just in proportion as a good friend is sweet, a
          false friend is full of bitterness. |A faithless friend is sharper
          than an adder's tooth.| It is sweet to repose in some one; but O! how
          bitter to have that support snapped, and to receive a grievous fall as
          the effect of your confidence. Fidelity is an absolute necessary in a
          true friend; we can not rejoice in men unless they will stand faithful
          to us. Solomon declares that |there is a friend that sticketh closer
          than a brother.| That friend, I suppose, he never found in the pomps
          and vanities of the world. He had tried them all, but he found them
          empty; he passed through all their joys, but he found them |vanity of
          vanities.| Poor Savage spoke from sad experience when he said --
        </p>
        <p>|You'll find the friendship of the world a show!</p>
        <p>Mere outward show! Tis like the harlot's tears,</p>
        <p>The statesman's promise, or false patriot's zeal,</p>
        <p>Full of fair seeming, but delusion all.|</p>
        <p>
          And so for the most part they are. The world's friendship is ever
          brittle. Trust to it, and you have trusted a robber; rely upon it, and
          you have leaned upon a thorn; ay, worse than that, upon a spear which
          shall pierce you to the soul with agony. Yet Solomon says he had found
          |a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.| Not in the haunts of
          his unbridled pleasures, nor in the wanderings of his unlimited
          resources, but in the pavilion of the Most High, the secret
          dwelling-place of God, in the person of Jesus, the Son of God, the
          Friend of sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is saying a great thing to affirm that |there is a friend that
          sticketh closer than a brother;| for the love of brotherhood has
          produced most valiant deeds. We have read stories of what brotherhood
          could do, which, we think, could hardly be excelled in the annals of
          friendship. Timoleon, with his shield, stood over the body of his
          slain brother, to defend him from the insults of the foe. It was
          reckoned a brave deed of brotherhood that he should dare the spears of
          an army in defense of his brother's corpse. And many such instances
          have there been, in ancient and modern warfare, of the attachment of
          brethren. There is a story told of a Highland regiment, who, while
          marching through the Highlands, lost their way; they were overtaken by
          one of the terrible storms which will sometimes come upon travelers
          unawares, and blinded by the snow, they lost their way upon the
          mountains. Well nigh frozen to death, it was with difficulty they
          could continue their march. One man after another dropped into the
          snow and disappeared. There were two brothers, however, of the name of
          Forsythe; one of them fell prostrate on the earth, and would have lain
          there to die, but his brother, though barely able to drag his own
          limbs across the white desert, took him on his back, and carried him
          along, and as others fell one by one, this brave, true-hearted brother
          carried his loved one on his back, until at last he himself fell down
          overcome with fatigue, and died. His brother, however, had received
          such warmth from his body that he was enabled to reach the end of his
          journey in safety, and so lived. Here we have an instance of one
          brother sacrificing his life for another. I hope there are some
          brothers here who would be prepared to do the same if they should ever
          be brought into the same difficulty. It is saying a great thing, to
          declare that |there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.|
          It is putting that friend first of all in the list of loving ones;
          for, surely, next to a mother's love, there is, and there ought to be,
          no higher affection in the world than the love of a brother to one
          begotten of the same father, and dandled on the same knee. Those who
          have |grown in beauty side by side, and filled one house with glee,|
          ought to love one another. And we think there have been many glorious
          instances and mighty proofs of the love of brethren. Yet, says
          Solomon, |there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.|
        </p>
        <p>
          To repeat our assertion, we believe that this friend is the blessed
          Redeemer, Jesus Christ. It shall be ours, first, to prove, this
          morning, the fact that he sticks closer than a brother; then, as
          briefly as we can, to show you why he sticks closer than a brother;
          and then to finish up by giving you some lessons which may be drawn
          from the doctrine, that Jesus Christ is a faithful Friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, beloved, we assert that CHRIST IS |A FRIEND THAT
          STICKETH CLOSER THAN A BROTHER.| And in order to prove this from
          facts, we appeal to such of you as have had him for a friend. Will you
          not, each of you, at once give your verdict, that this is neither more
          nor less than an unexaggerated truth? He loved you before all worlds;
          long ere the day star flung his ray across the darkness, before the
          wing of angel had flapped the unnavigated ether, before aught of
          creation had struggled from the womb of nothingness, God, even our
          God, had set his heart upon all his children. Since that time, has he
          once swerved, has he once turned aside, once changed? No; ye who have
          tasted of his love and know his grace, will bear me witness, that he
          has been a certain friend in uncertain circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>|He, near your side hath always stood.</p>
        <p>His loving-kindness. O! how good.|</p>
        <p>
          You fell in Adam; did he cease to love you? No; he became the second
          Adam to redeem you. You sinned in practice, and brought upon your head
          the condemnation of God; you deserved his wrath and his utter anger;
          did he then forsake you? No!
        </p>
        <p>|He saw you ruined in the fall,</p>
        <p>Yet loved you notwithstanding all.|</p>
        <p>
          He sent his minister after you; you despised him; he preached the
          gospel in your ears; you laughed at him; you broke God's Sabbath, you
          despised his Word. Did he then forsake you? No!
        </p>
        <p>|Determined to save, he watched o'er your path,</p>
        <p>Whilst, Satan's blind slave, you sported with death.|</p>
        <p>
          And at last he arrested you by his grace, he humbled you, he made you
          penitent, he brought you to his feet, and he forgave you all your
          sins. Since then, has he left you? You have often left him; has he
          ever left you? You have had many trials and troubles; has he ever
          deserted you? Has he ever turned away his heart, and shut up his
          bowels of compassion? No, children of God, it is your solemn duty to
          say |No,| and bear witness to his faithfulness. You have been in
          severe afflictions and in dangerous circumstances; did your friend
          desert you then? Others have been faithless to you; he that eat bread
          with you has lifted up his heel against you; but has Christ ever
          forsaken you? Has there ever been a moment when you could go to him,
          and say, |Master, thou hast betrayed me?| Could you once, in the
          blackest hour of your grief, dare to impugn his fidelity? Could you
          dare to say of him, |Lord, thou hast promised what thou didst not
          perform?| Will you not bear witness now, |Not one good thing hath
          failed of all that the Lord God hath promised; all hath come to pass?|
          And do you fear he will yet forsake you? Ask, then, the bright ones
          before the throne -- |Ye glorified spirits! did Christ forsake you? Ye
          have passed through Jordan's stream; did he leave you there? Ye have
          been baptized in the black flood of death; did he there forsake you?
          Ye have stood before the throne of God; did he then deny you?| And
          they answered, |No; through all the troubles of our life, in all the
          bitterness of death, in all the agonies of our expiring moments, and
          in all the terrors of God's judgment, he hath been with us, a friend
          that sticketh closer than a brother.'| Out of all the millions of
          God's redeemed, there is not one he hath forsaken. Poor they have
          been, mean and distressed, but he hath never abhorred their prayer,
          never turned aside from doing them good. He hath been ever with them.
        </p>
        <p>|For his mercy shall endure,</p>
        <p>Ever faithful, ever sure.|</p>
        <p>
          But I shall not longer stay, since I can not prove this to the
          ungodly, and to the godly it is already proven, for they know it by
          experience; therefore it is but little necessary that I should do more
          than just certify the fact that Christ is a faithful friend -- a
          friend in every hour of need and every time of distress.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now I have to tell you THE REASONS WHY WE MAY DEPEND UPON
          CHRIST AS BEING A FAITHFUL FRIEND.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some things in himself which render it certain that he will
          stick close to his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. True friendship can only be made between true men. Hearts are the
          soul of honor. There can be no lasting friendship between bad men. Bad
          men may pretend to love each other, but their friendship is a rope of
          sand, which shall be broken at any convenient season; but if a man
          have a sincere heart within him, and be true and noble, then we may
          confide in him. Spenser sings in fine old English verse --
        </p>
        <p>|No, certes can that friendship long endure,</p>
        <p>However gay and goodly be the style,</p>
        <p>That doth ill cause or evil end enure,</p>
        <p>For Vertue is the band that bindeth Harts most sure.|</p>
        <p>
          But who can find a stain in the character of Jesus, or who can tarnish
          his honor? Has there ever been a spot on his escutcheon? Has his flag
          ever been trampled in the dust? Does he not stand the true witness in
          heaven, the faithful and just? Is it not declared of him that he is
          God who can not lie? Have we not found him so up to this moment; and
          may we not, knowing that he is |Holy, holy, holy Lord,| confide in
          him, that he will stick closer to us than a brother? His goodness is
          the guaranty of his fidelity; he can not fail us.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Faithfulness to us in our faults is a certain sign of fidelity in a
          friend. You may depend upon that man who will tell you of your faults
          in a kind and considerate manner. Fawning hypocrites, insidious
          flatterers, are the sweepings and offal of friendship. They are but
          the parasites upon that noble tree. But true friends put enough trust
          in you to tell you openly of your faults. Give me for a friend the man
          who will speak honestly of me before my face; who will not tell first
          one neighbor, and then another, but who will come straight to my
          house, and say, |Sir, I feel there is such-and-such a thing in you,
          which, as my brother, I must tell you of.| That man is a true friend;
          he has proved himself to be so; for we never get any praise for
          telling people of their faults; we rather hazard their dislike; a man
          will sometimes thank you for it, but he does not often like you any
          the better. Praise is a thing we all love. I met with a man the other
          day who said he was impervious to flattery; I was walking with him at
          the time, and turning round rather sharply, I said, |At any rate, sir,
          you seem to have a high gift in flattering yourself, for you are
          really doing so, in saying you are impervious to flattery.| |You can
          not flatter me,| he said. I replied, |I can, if I like to try; and
          perhaps may do so before the day is out.| I found I could not flatter
          him directly, so I began by saying what a fine child that was of his;
          and he drank it in as a precious draught; and when I praised this
          thing and that thing belonging to him, I could see that he was very
          easily flattered; not directly, but indirectly. We are all pervious to
          flattery; we like the soothing cordial, only it must not be labeled
          flattery; for we have a religious abhorrence of flattery if it be so
          called; call it by any other name, and we drink it in, even as the ox
          drinketh in water. Now, child of God, has Christ every flattered you?
          Has he not told you of your faults right truly? Has he not pricked
          your conscience even upon what you thought to gloss over -- your
          little secret sins? Has he not provoked conscience to thunder in your
          ears notes of terror, because of your misdeeds? Well, then, you may
          trust him, for he shows that faithfulness which renders a man right
          trustworthy. Thus I have pointed out to you that there are reasons in
          himself for which we may trust him.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In the next place, there are some things in his friendship which
          render us sure of not being deceived, when we put our confidence in
          him. True friendship must not be of hasty growth. As quaint old Master
          Fuller says: |Let friendship creep gently to a height; if it rush to
          it, it may soon run itself out of breath.| It is even so. I think it
          was Joanna Baillie said --
        </p>
        <p>|Friendship is no plant of hasty growth.</p>
        <p>Though planted in esteem's deep fixed soil,</p>
        <p>The gradual culture of kind intercourse</p>
        <p>Must bring it to perfection.|</p>
        <p>
          In vain thou trustest the gourd over thy head, O Jonah; it will not be
          of much use to thee; it came up in a night, it may wither in a night.
          It is the strong stiff oak, of ages' growth, which shall abide the
          tempest; which shall alike put out its wings to shield thee from the
          sun, and shall afterward find thee a hovel in its heart, if necessary,
          in its gray old age, when its branches tremble in the blast.
          Friendship is true when it begins; but we must have a man's friendship
          long before we can say of him, that he will stick closer than a
          brother. And how long has Christ loved you? That you can not tell.
          When the ages were not born he loved you; when this world was an
          infant, wrapped in the swaddling clothes of mist, he loved you; when
          the old pyramids had not begun to be builded, his heart was set upon
          you; and ever since you have been born he has had a strong affection
          for you. He looked on you in your cradle, and he loved you then; he
          was affianced to you when you were an infant of a span long, and he
          has loved you ever since. Some of you I see with gray hairs, some with
          heads all bald with age; he has loved you up till now, and will he now
          forsake you? O! no, his friendship is so old that it must last; it has
          been matured by so many tempests, it has been rooted by so many winds
          of trouble, that it can not but endure; it must stand. Even as the
          granite peak of the mountain shall not be melted, because, unlike the
          snow, it has braved the blast, and borne the heat of the burning sun;
          it has stood out always, catching in its face every blow from the face
          of nature, and yet been unmoved and uninjured. It shall last, for it
          has lasted. But when the elements shall melt, and in a stream of
          dissolving fire shall run away, then shall Christ's friendship still
          exist, for it is of older growth than they. He must be |a friend that
          sticketh closer than a brother;| for his friendship is a hoary
          friendship -- hoary as his own head, of which it is said, |His head
          and his hair are white like snow, as white as wool.|
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But note, further, the friendship which lasts does not take it rise
          in the chambers of mirth, nor is it fed and fattened there. Young
          lady, you speak of a dear friend whom you acquired last night in a
          ball-room. Do not, I beseech you, misuse the word; he is not a friend
          if he was acquired merely there; friends are better things than those
          which grow in the hot-house of pleasure. Friendship is a more lasting
          plant than those. You have a friend, have you? Yes; and he keeps a
          pair of horses, and has a good establishment. Ah! but your best way to
          prove your friend is to know that he will be your friend when you have
          not so much as a mean cottage, and when, houseless and without
          clothing, you are driven to beg your bread. Thus you would make true
          proof of a friend. Give me a friend who was born in the winter time,
          whose cradle was rocked in the storm; he will last. Our fair weather
          friends shall flee away from us. I had rather have a robin for a
          friend than a swallow; for a swallow abides with us only in the summer
          time, but a robin cometh to us in the winter. Those are tight friends
          that will come the nearest to us when we are in the most distress; but
          those are not friends who speed themselves away when ill times come.
          Believer, hast thou reason to fear that Christ will leave you now? Has
          he not been with you in the house of mourning? You found your friend
          where men find pearls, |in caverns deep, where darkness dwells;| you
          found Jesus in your hour of trouble. It was on the bed of sickness
          that you first learned the value of his name; it was in the hour of
          mental anguish that you first did lay hold of the hem of his garment;
          and since then, your nearest and sweetest intercourse has been held
          with him in the hours of darkness. Well, then, such a friend, proved
          in the house of sorrow -- a friend who gave his heart's blood for you,
          and let his soul run out in one great river of gore -- such a friend
          never can and never will forsake you; he sticketh closer than a
          brother.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Again, a friend who is acquired by folly is never a lasting friend.
          Do a foolish thing, and make a man your friend; tis but a confederacy
          in vice, and you will soon discover that his friendship is worthless;
          the friendship you acquire by doing wrong, you had better be without.
          O! how many silly friendships there are springing up, the mere fruit
          of a sentimentalism, having no root whatever, but like the plant of
          which our Saviour tells us, |It sprang up because it had no depth of
          earth.| Jesus Christ's friendship is not like that; there is no
          ingredient of folly in it; he loves us discreetly, not winking or
          conniving at our follies, but instilling into us his wisdom. His love
          is wise; he hath chosen us according to the counsel of his wisdom; not
          blindly and rashly, but with all judgment and prudence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under this head I may like wise observe, that the friendship of
          ignorance is not a very desirable one. I desire no man to call himself
          my friend, if he doth not know me. Let him love me in proportion to
          his knowledge of me. If he loves me for the little he knows, when he
          knoweth more he may cast me aside. |That man,| says one, |seems to be
          a very amiable man.| |I am sure I can love him,| says another, as he
          scans his features. Ay, but do not write |friend| yet; wait a wee bit,
          until you know more of him; just see him, examine him, try him, test
          him, and not till then enter him on the sacred list of friends. Be
          friendly to all, but make none your friends until they know you, and
          you know them. Many a friendship born in the darkness of ignorance,
          hath died suddenly in the light of a better acquaintance with each
          other. You supposed men to be different from what they were, and when
          you discovered their real character you disregarded them. I remember
          one saying to me, |I have great affection for you, sir,| and he
          mentioned a certain reason. I replied, |My dear fellow, your reason is
          absolutely false; the very thing you love me for, I am not, and hope I
          never shall be.| And so I said, |I really can not accept your
          friendship, if it be founded upon a misunderstanding of what I may
          have said.| But our Lord Jesus never can forsake those whom once he
          loves, because he can discover nothing in us worse than he knew, for
          he knew all about us beforehand. He saw our leprosy, and yet he loved
          us; he knew our deceitfulness and unbelief, and yet he did press us to
          his bosom; he knew what poor fools we were, and yet he said he would
          never leave us nor forsake us. He knew that we should rebel against
          him and despise his counsel often times; he knew that even when we
          loved him our love would be cold and languid, but he loved for his own
          sake. Surely, then, he will stick closer than a brother.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Yet again, friendship and love, to be real, must not lie in words,
          but in deeds. The friendship of bare compliment is the fashion of this
          age, because this age is the age of deceit. The world is the great
          house of sham. Go where you may in London, sham is staring you in the
          face; there are very few real things to be discovered. I allude not
          merely to tricks in business, adulterations in food, and such like.
          Deception is not confined to the tradesman's shop. It prevails
          throughout society; the sanctuary is not exempt. The preacher adopts a
          sham voice. You hardly ever hear a man speak in the pulpit in the same
          way he would speak in the parlor. Why, I hear my brethren, sometimes,
          when they are at tea or dinner, speak in a very comfortable decent
          sort of English voice, but when they get into their pulpits they adopt
          a sanctimonious tone, and fill their mouths with inflated utterance,
          or else whine most pitifully. They degrade the pulpit by pretending to
          honor it; speaking in a voice which God never intended any mortal to
          have. This is the great house of sham; and such little things show
          which way the wind blows. You leave your card at a friend's house;
          that is an act of friendship -- the card! I wonder whether, if he were
          hard up for cash, you would leave your banker's book! You write |My
          dear sir,| |Yours very truly;| it is a sham; you do not mean it.
          |Dear!| that is a sacred word; it ought to be used to none but those
          you regard with affection; but we tolerate falsehoods now, as if they
          were truths; and we call them courtesies. Courtesies they may be; but
          untruths they are in many cases. Now, Christ's love lieth not in
          words, but in deeds. He saith not, |My dear people;| but he let his
          heart out, and we could see what that was. He doth not come to us, and
          say, |Dearly beloved| simply; but he hangs upon the cross, and there
          we read |Dearly beloved| in red letters. He does not come to us with
          the kisses of his lips first -- he giveth us blessings with both his
          hands; he giveth himself for us, and then he giveth himself to us.
          Trust no complimentary friend; rely upon the man who giveth you real
          tokens worth your having, who does for you deeds to show the
          truthfulness of his heart. Such a friend -- and such is Jesus --
          |sticketh closer than a brother.|
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Once more, and I shall not weary you, I trust. A purchased friend
          will never last long. Give to a man nineteen times, and deny him the
          twentieth, and he shall hate you; for his love sprang only from your
          gifts. The love which I could buy for gold I would sell for dross; the
          friendship that I could buy for pearls I would dispense with for
          pebbles; it were of no value, and therefore the sooner lost the
          better. But O believer, Christ's love was unpurchased love. Thou
          broughtest him no present. Jacob said, when his sons went to Egypt,
          |Take the man a present, a little oil, a little balm, a few nuts and
          almonds;| but you took Christ no presents. When you came to him you
          said,
        </p>
        <p>|Nothing in my hands I bring,</p>
        <p>Simply to thy cross I cling.|</p>
        <p>
          You did not even promise that you would love him; for you had such a
          faithless heart, you durst not say so. You asked him to make you love
          him; that was the most you could do. He loved you for nothing at all
          -- simply because he would love you. Well, that love which so lived on
          nothing but its own resources, will not starve through the scantiness
          of your returns; the love which grew in such a rocky heart as this,
          will not die for want of soil. That love which sprang up in the barren
          desert, in your unirrigated soul, will never, never die for want of
          moisture; it must live, it can not expire. Jesus must be |a friend
          that sticketh closer than a brother.|
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Shall I stay to urge more reasons? I may but mention one other,
          namely, this -- that there can not, by any possibility, arise any
          cause which could make Christ love us less. You say, how is this? One
          man loves his friend, but he on a sudden grows rich, and now he says I
          am a greater man than I used to be, I forget my old acquaintances. But
          Christ can grow no richer; he is as rich as he can be, infinitely so.
          He loves you now; then it can not be possible that he will by reason
          of an increase in his own personal glory forsake you, for everlasting
          glories now crown his head; he can never be more glorious and great,
          and therefore he will love you still. Sometimes, on the other hand,
          one friend grows poorer, and then the other forsakes him; but you
          never can grow poorer than you are, for you are |a poor sinner and
          nothing at all| now; you have nothing of your own; all you have is
          borrowed, all given you by him. He can not love you, then, less,
          because you grow poorer; for poverty that hath nothing is at least as
          poor as it can be, and can never sink lower in the scale. Christ,
          therefore, must love thee for all thy nakedness and all thy poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
          |But I may prove sinful,| sayest thou. Yes, but thou canst not be more
          so than he foreknew thou wouldst be; and yet he loved thee with the
          foreknowledge of all thy sins. Surely, then, when it happens it will
          occasion no surprise to him; he knew it all beforehand, and he can not
          swerve from his love; no circumstance can possibly arise that ever
          will divide the Saviour from his love to his people, and the saint
          from his love to his Saviour. He is |a friend that sticketh closer
          than a brother.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now, then, AN INFERENCE TO BE DERIVED FROM THIS. Lavater says,
          |The qualities of your friends will be those of your enemies; cold
          friends, cold enemies, half friends, half enemies, fervid enemies,
          warm friends.| Knowing this to be a truth, I have often congratulated
          myself, when my enemies have spoken fiercely against me. Well, I have
          thought, |My friends love me hard and fast; let my enemies be as hot
          as they please; it only indicates that the friends are proportionately
          firm in affection. Then we draw this inference, that if Christ sticks
          close, and he is our friend, then our enemies will stick close, and
          never leave us till we die. O, Christian, because Christ sticks close,
          the devil will stick close too; he will be at you and with you; the
          dog of hell will never cease his howlings, till you reach the other
          side of Jordan; no place in this world is out of bow-shot of that
          great enemy; till you have crossed the stream his arrows can reach
          you, and they will. If Christ gave himself for you, the devil will do
          all he can to destroy you; if Christ has been long-suffering to you,
          Satan will be persevering, in hopes that Christ may forget you; he
          will strive after you, and strive until he shall see you safely landed
          in heaven. But be not disappointed: the louder Satan roars, the more
          proof you shall have of Christ's love. |Give me,| said old Rutherford,
          |give me a roaring devil rather than a sleeping one; for sleeping
          devils make me slumber, but roaring ones provoke me to run to my
          Master.| O! be glad, then, if the world rant at thee, if thy foes
          attack thee fiercely. Christ is just as full of love to thee as they
          are of hatred. Therefore,
        </p>
        <p>|Be firm and strong;</p>
        <p>Be grace thy shield and Christ thy song.|</p>
        <p>
          And now I have a question to ask: that question I ask of every man and
          every woman in this place, and of every child too -- Is Jesus Christ
          your friend? Have you a friend at court -- at heaven's court? Is the
          judge of quick and dead your friend? Can you say that you love him,
          and has he ever revealed himself in the way of love to you? Dear
          hearer, do not answer that question for thy neighbor; answer it for
          thyself. Peer or peasant, rich or poor, learned or illiterate, this
          question is for each of you; therefore, ask it: Is Christ my friend?
          Did you ever consider that question? Have you ever asked it? O! to be
          able to say |Christ is my friend,| is one of the sweetest things in
          the world. A man who had lived much in sin, one day casually entered a
          place of worship. Before the sermon, this hymn was sung --
        </p>
        <p>|Jesus, lover of my soul.|</p>
        <p>
          The next day the man was met by an acquaintance who asked him how he
          liked the sermon. Said he, |I do not know, but there were two or three
          words that took such a hold of me that I did not know what to do with
          myself. The minister read that hymn, Jesus, lover of my soul.' Ah!'
          said he, though he was by no means a religious man, |to be able to say
          that, I would give up all I have got! But do you think,| he asked
          |that Jesus ever will be the lover of such a man as I am? Jesus, lover
          of my soul!' O! could I say it.| And then he buried his head in his
          hands and wept. I have every reason to fear that he went back to his
          sin, and was the same afterwards as before. But, you see, he had
          conscience enough to let him know how valuable it was to have Christ
          for his lover and his friend. Ah! rich man, thou hast many friends.
          There be some here who have toiled for their country's good, and
          deserve a meed of honor at their country's hands, who, for one mistake
          -- or what, perhaps, was a mistake -- have been neglected by too many
          who once appeared to be their most trusty adherents. O! put no
          confidence, ye great men and ye rich, in the adherence of your
          friends. David said in his hast,| All men are liars;| you may one day
          have to say it at your leisure. And O! ye kind and affectionate
          hearts, who are not rich in wealth, but who are rich in love -- and
          that is the world's best wealth -- put this golden coin among your
          silver ones, and it will sanctify them all. Get Christ's love shed
          abroad in your hearts, and your mother's love, your daughter's love,
          your husband's love, your wife's love, will become more sweet than
          ever. The love of Christ cast not out the love of relatives, but it
          sanctifies our loves, and makes them sweeter far. Remember, dear
          hearer, the love of men and women is very sweet; but all must pass
          away; and what will you do, if you have no wealth but the wealth that
          fadeth, and no love but the love which dies, when death shall come? O!
          to have the love of Christ! You can take that across the river of
          death with you; you can wear it as your bracelet in heaven, and set it
          up as a seal upon your hand; for his love is |strong as death and
          mightier than the grave.| Good old Bishop Beveridge, I think it was,
          when dying, did not know his best friends. Said one, |Bishop
          Beveridge, do you know me?| Said he, |Who are you?| and when the name
          was mentioned, he said, |No.| |But don't you know your wife, Bishop?|
          |What is her name?| said he. Said she, |I am your wife.| |I did not
          know I had got one,| said he. Poor old man! his faculties all failed
          him. At last one stooped down and whispered, |Do you know the Lord
          Jesus Christ?| |Yes,| said he, making an effort to speak, |I have
          known him these forty years, and I never can forget him.| It is
          marvelous how memory will hold the place with Jesus, when it will with
          no one else; and it is equally marvelous, that,
        </p>
        <p>|When all created things are dry, Christ's fullness is the same.|</p>
        <p>
          My dear hearers, do think of this matter. O that you might get Christ
          for your friend; he will never be your friend while you are
          self-righteous; he will never be your friend while you live in sin.
          But do you believe yourselves guilty? Do you desire to leave off sin?
          Do you want to be saved? Do you desire to be renewed? Then let me tell
          you, my Master loves you! Poor, weak, and helpless worms, my Master's
          heart if full of love to you; his eyes at this moment are looking down
          with pity on you. |O! Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jerusalem!| He now bids me
          tell you that he died for all of you who confess yourselves to be
          sinners, and feel it. He bids me say to you, |Believe on the Lord
          Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved.| He tells me to proclaim
          salvation full and free; full, needing nothing of yours to help it;
          free, needing nothing of yours to buy it.
        </p>
        <p>|Come ye thirsty, come and welcome;</p>
        <p>God's free bounty glorify:</p>
        <p>True belief and true repentance,</p>
        <p>Every grace that brings us nigh --</p>
        <p>Without money,</p>
        <p>Come to Jesus Christ, and buy.|</p>
        <p>
          There is nothing I feel that I fail so much in as addressing sinners.
          O! I wish I could cry my heart out, and preach my heart out, to you
          and at you.
        </p>
        <p>|Dear Saviour, draw reluctant hearts,</p>
        <p>To thee let sinners fly,</p>
        <p>And take the bliss thy love imparts;</p>
        <p>And drink, and never die.|</p>
        <p>
          Farewell, with this one thought -- we shall never all of us meet
          together here again. It is a very solemn thought, but according to the
          course of nature and the number of deaths, if all of you were willing
          to come here next Sabbath morning, it is not at all likely that all of
          you would be alive; one out of this congregation will be sure to have
          gone the way of all flesh. Farewell, thou that are appointed to death;
          I know not where thou art -- yon strong man, or yon tender maiden with
          the hectic flush of consumption on her cheek. I know not who is
          appointed to death; but I do now most solemnly take my farewell of
          such an one. Farewell, poor soul; and is it farewell for ever? Shall
          we meet in the land of the hereafter, in the home of the blessed; or
          do I bid you farewell now for ever? I do solemnly bid farewell to you
          for ever, if you live and die without Christ. But I can not bear that
          dreary thought; and I therefore say, poor sinner! stop and consider --
          consider thy ways, and now |turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die?| |Why
          will ye die?| |Why will ye die?| |Why will ye die?| Ah! ye can not
          answer that question. May God help you to answer it in a better
          fashion, by saying, |Here Lord!
        </p>
        <p>Just as I am, without one plea,</p>
        <p>But that thy blood was shed for me,</p>
        <p>O Son of God I come to thee.</p>
        <p>
          I trust my soul in thy kind hands.| The Lord bless you all for
          Christ's sake! Amen.<br />
