        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.201)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, June 20, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens</p>
        <p>
          |While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them
          which heard the Word| -- Acts 10:44.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE BIBLE IS A BOOK of the Revelation of God. The God after whom the
          heathen blindly searched, and for whom reason gropes in darkness, is
          here plainly revealed to us in the pages of divine authorship, so that
          he who is willing to understand as much of Godhead as man can know,
          may here learn it if he be not willingly ignorant and wilfully
          obstinate. The doctrine of the Trinity is specially taught in Holy
          Scripture. The word certainly does not occur, but the three divine
          persons of the One God are frequently and constantly mentioned, and
          Holy Scripture is exceedingly careful that we should all receive and
          believe that great truth of the Christian religion, that the Father is
          God, that the Son is God, that the Spirit is God, and yet there are
          not three Gods but one God: though they be each of them very God of
          very God, yet three in one and one in three is the Jehovah whom we
          worship. You will notice in the works of Creation how carefully the
          Scriptures assure us that all the three divine persons took their
          share. |In the beginning Jehovah created the heavens and the earth;|
          and in another place we are told that God said |Let us make man| --
          not one person, but all three taking counsel with each other with
          regard to the making of mankind. We know that the Father hath laid the
          foundations and fixed those solid beams of light on which the blue
          arches of the sky are sustained; but we know with equal certainty that
          Jesus Christ, the eternal Logos, was with the Father in the beginning,
          and |without him was not anything made that was made:| moreover we
          have equal certainty that the Holy Spirit had a hand in Creation, for
          we are told that |the earth was without form and void, and darkness
          was upon the face of the earth; and the spirit of the Lord moved upon
          the face of the waters;| and brooding with his dove-like wing, he
          brought out of the egg of chaos this mighty thing, the fair round
          world. We have the like proof of the three persons in the Godhead in
          the matter of Salvation. We know that God the, Father gave his Son; we
          have abundant proof that God the Father chose his people from before
          the foundations of the world, that he did invent the plan of
          salvation, and hath always given his free, willing, and joyous consent
          to the salvation of his people. With regard to the share that the Son
          had in salvation, that is apparent enough to all. For us men and for
          our salvation he came down from heaven; he was incarnate in a mortal
          body; he was crucified, dead, and buried; he descended into hades; the
          third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven; he
          sitteth at the right hand of God, where also he maketh intercession
          for us. As to the Holy Spirit, we have equally sure proof that the
          Spirit of God worketh in conversion; for everywhere we are said to be
          begotten of the Holy Spirit; continually it is declared, that unless a
          man be born again from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God; while
          all the virtues and the graces of Christianity are described as being
          the fruits of the Spirit, because the Holy Spirit doth from first to
          last work in us and carry out that which Jesus Christ hath beforehand
          worked for us in his great redemption, which also God the Father hath
          designed for us in his great predestinating scheme of salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, it is to the work of the Holy Spirit that I shall this morning
          specially direct your attention; and I may as well mention the reason
          why I do so. It is this. We have received continually fresh
          confirmations of the good news from a far country, which has already
          made glad the hearts of many of God's people. In the United States of
          America there is certainly a great awakening. No sane man living there
          could think of denying it. There may be something of spurious
          excitement mixed up with it, but that good, lasting good, has been
          accomplished, no rational man can deny. Two hundred and fifty thousand
          persons -- that is a quarter of a million -- profess to have been
          regenerated since December last, have made a profession of their
          faith, and have united themselves with different sections of God's
          church. The work still progresses, if anything, at a more rapid rate
          than before, and that which makes me believe the work to be genuine is
          just this -- that the enemies of Christ's holy gospel are exceedingly
          wroth at it. When the devil roars at anything, you may rest assured
          there is some good in it. The devil is not like some dogs we know of;
          he never barks unless there is something to bark at. When Satan howls
          we may rest assured he is afraid his kingdom is in danger. Now this
          great work in America has been manifestly caused by the outpouring of
          the Spirit, for no one minister has been a leader in it. All the
          ministers of the gospel have co-operated in it, but none of them have
          stood in the van. God himself has been the leader of his own hosts. It
          began with a desire for prayer. God's people began to pray; the
          prayer-meetings were better attended than before. it was then proposed
          to hold meetings at times that had never been set apart for prayer;
          these also were well attended; and now, in the city of Philadelphia,
          at the hour of noon, every day in the week, three thousand persons can
          always be seen assembled together for prayer in one place. Men of
          business, in the midst of their toil and labor, find an opportunity of
          running in there and offering a word of prayer, and then return to
          their occupations. And so, throughout all the States, prayer-meetings,
          larger or smaller in number, have been convened. And there has been
          real prayer. Sinners beyond all count, have risen up in the
          prayer-meeting, and have requested the people of God to pray for them;
          thus making public to the world that they had a desire after Christ;
          they have been prayed for, and the church has seen that God verily
          doth hear and answer prayer. I find that the Unitarian ministers for a
          little while took no notice of it. Theodore Parker snarls and raves
          tremendously at it, but he is evidently in a maze; he does not
          understand the mystery, and acts with regard to it as swine are said
          to do with pearls. While the church was found asleep, and doing very
          little, the Socinian could afford to stand in his pulpit and sneer at
          anything like evangelical religion, but now that there has been an
          awakening, he looks like a man that has just awakened out of sleep. He
          sees something; he does not know what it is. The power of religion is
          just that which will always puzzle the Unitarian, for he knows but
          little about that. At the form of religion he is not much amazed, for
          he can to an extent endorse that himself, but the supernaturalism of
          the gospel -- the mystery -- the miracle -- the power -- the
          demonstration of the Spirit that comes with the preaching, is what
          such men cannot comprehend, and they gaze and wonder, and then become
          filled with wrath, but still they have to confess there is something
          there they cannot understand, a mental phenomenon that is far beyond
          their philosophy -- a thing which they cannot reach by all their
          science nor understand by all their reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if we have the like effect produced in this land, the one thing
          we must seek is the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and I thought,
          perhaps, this morning in preaching upon the work of the Holy Spirit,
          that text might be fulfilled -- |Him that honoureth me I will honor.|
          My sincere desire is to honor the Holy Spirit this morning, and if he
          will be pleased to honor his church in return, unto him shall be the
          glory for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          |While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them
          which heard the word.| In the first place, I shall endeavor to
          describe the method of the Spirit's operation, secondly, the absolute
          necessity of the Holy Spirit's influence, if we could see men
          converted, and then, in the third place, I shall suggest the ways and
          means by which under divine grace we may obtain a like falling down of
          the Spirit upon our churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In the first place, then, I will endeavor to explain THE METHOD OF
          THE HOLY SPIRIT'S OPERATIONS. But let me guard myself against being
          misunderstood. We can explain what the Spirit does, but how he does
          it, no man must pretend to know. The work of the Holy Spirit is the
          peculiar mystery of the Christian religion. Almost any other thing is
          plain, but this must remain an inscrutable secret into which it were
          wrong for us to attempt to pry. Who knoweth where the winds are
          begotten? Who knoweth, therefore, how the Spirit worketh, for he is
          like the wind? |The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest
          the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it
          goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.| In Holy Scripture
          certain great secrets of nature are mentioned as being parallel with
          the secret working of the Spirit. The procreation of children is
          instanced as a parallel wonder, for we know not the mystery thereof;
          how much less, therefore, shall we expect to know that more secret and
          hidden mystery of the new birth and new creation of man in Christ
          Jesus. But let no man be staggered at this, for they are mysteries in
          nature: the wisest man will tell you there are depths in nature into
          which he cannot dive, and heights into which he cannot soar. He who
          pretends to have unravelled the knot of creation hath made a mistake,
          he may have cut the knot by his rough ignorance, and by his foolish
          conjectures, but the knot itself must remain beyond the power of man's
          unravelling, until God himself shall explain the secret. There are
          marvellous things, that, as yet, men have sought to know in vain. They
          may, perhaps, discover many of them, but how the Spirit works, no man
          can know. But now I wish to explain what the Holy Spirit does,
          although we cannot tell how he does it. I take it that the Holy
          Spirit's work in conversion is two-fold. First it is an awakening of
          the powers that man already has, and secondly, it is an implantation
          of powers which he never had at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the great work of the new birth, the Holy Spirit first of all
          awakens the mental powers; for be it remembered that, the Holy Spirit
          never gives any man new mental powers. Take for instance reason -- the
          Holy Spirit does not give men reason, for they have reason prior to
          their conversion. What the Holy Spirit does is to teach our reason,
          right reason -- to set our reason in the right track, so that he can
          use it for the high purpose of discerning between good and evil;
          between the precious and vile. The Holy Spirit does not give man a
          will, for man has a will before; but he makes the will that was in
          bondage to Satan free to the service of God. The Holy Spirit gives no
          man the power to think, or the organ of belief -- for man has power to
          believe or think as far as the mental act is concerned; but he gives
          that belief which is already there a tendency to believe the right
          thing, and he gives to the power of thought the propensity to think in
          the right way so that instead of thinking irregularly, we begin to
          think as God would have us think, and our mind desireth to walk in the
          steps of God's revealed truth There may be here, this morning, a man
          of enlarged understanding in things political -- but his understanding
          is darkened with regard to spiritual things -- he sees no beauty in
          the person of Christ -- he sees nothing desirable in the way of
          holiness -- he chooses the evil and forsakes the good. Now the Holy
          Spirit will not give him a new understanding, but he will cleanse his
          old understanding so that he will discern between things that differ,
          and shall discover that it is but a poor thing to enjoy |the pleasures
          of sin for a season,| and let go an |eternal weight of glory.| There
          shall be a man here too who is desperately set against religion, and
          willeth not to come to God, and do what we will, we are not able to
          persuade him to change his mind and turn to God. The Holy Spirit will
          not make a new will in that man, but he will turn his old will, and
          instead of willing to do evil he will make him will to do right -- he
          will make him will to be saved by Christ -- he will make him |willing
          in the day of his power.| Remember, there is no power in man so fallen
          but that the Holy Spirit can raise it up. However debased a man may
          be, in one instant, by the miraculous power of the Spirit, all his
          faculties may be cleansed and purged. Ill-judging reason may be made
          to judge rightly; stout, obstinate wills may be made to run willingly
          in the ways of God's commandments; evil and depraved affections may in
          an instant be turned to Christ, and old desires that are tainted with
          vice, may be replaced by heavenly aspirations. The work of the Spirit
          on the mind is the re-modelling of it; the new forming of it. He doth
          not bring new material to the mind -- it is in another part of the man
          that he puts up a new structure -- but he puts the mind that had
          fallen out of order into its proper shape. He builds up pillars that
          had fallen down, and erects the palaces that had crumbled to the
          earth. This is the first work of the Holy Spirit upon the mind of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides this, the Holy Spirit gives to men powers which they never had
          before. According to Scripture, I believe man is constituted in a
          three-fold manner. He has a body; by the Holy Spirit that body is made
          the temple of the Lord. He has a mind; by the Holy Spirit that mind is
          made like an altar in the temple. But man by nature is nothing higher
          than that; he is mere body and soul. When the Spirit comes, he
          breathes into him a third higher principle which we call the spirit.
          The apostle describes man as man, |body, soul and spirit.| Now if you
          search all the mental writers through, you will find they all declare
          there are only two parts -- body and mind; and they are quite right,
          for they deal with unregenerate man; but in regenerate man there is a
          third principle as much superior to mere mind as mind is superior to
          dead animal matter -- that third principle is that with which a man
          prays; it is that with which he lovingly believes; or rather it is
          that which compels the mind to perform their acts. It is that which,
          operating upon the mind, makes the same use of the mind as the mind
          does of the body. When, after desiring to walk I make my legs move, it
          is my mind that compels them; and so my Spirit, when I desire to pray,
          compels my mind to think the thought of prayer and compels my soul
          also, if I desire to praise, to think the thought of praise, and lift
          itself upward towards God. As the body without the soul is dead, so
          the soul without the Spirit is dead, and one work of the Spirit is to
          quicken the dead soul by breathing into it the firing Spirit; as it is
          written, |The first man, Adam, was made a living soul, but the second
          Adam was made a quickening Spirit| -- and, |as we have borne the image
          of the earthy, so must we bear the image of the heavenly;| that is, we
          must have in us, if we would be converted, the quickening Spirit,
          which is put into us by God the Holy Ghost. I say again, the spirit
          has powers which the mind never has. It has the power of communion
          with Christ, which to a degree is a mental act, but it can no more be
          performed by man without the Spirit, than the act of walking could be
          performed by man, if he were destitute of a soul to suggest the idea
          of walking. The Spirit suggests the thoughts of communion which the
          mind obeys and carries out. Nay, there are times, I think, when the
          spirit leaves the mind altogether, times when we forget everything of
          earth and one almost ceases to think, to reason, to judge, to weigh,
          or to will. Our souls are like the chariots of Amminadib, drawn
          swiftly onwards without any powers of volition. We lean upon the
          breast of Jesus, and in rhapsody divine, and in ecstasy celestial, we
          enjoy the fruits of the land of the blessed, and pluck the clusters of
          Eschol before entering into the land of promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I have clearly put these two points before you. The work of
          the Spirit consists, first, in awakening powers already possessed by
          man, but which were asleep and out of order; and in the next place in
          putting into man powers which he had not before. And to make this
          simple to the humblest mind, let me suppose man to be something like a
          machine; all the wheels are out of order, the cogs do not strike upon
          each other, the wheels do not turn regularly, the rods will not act,
          the order is gone. Now, the first work of the Spirit is to put these
          wheels in the right place, to fit the wheels upon the axles, to put
          the right axle to the right wheel, then to put wheel to wheel, so that
          they may act upon each other. But that is not all his work. The next
          thing is to put fire and steam so that these things shall go to work.
          He does not put fresh wheels, he puts old wheels into order, and then
          he puts the motive power which is to move the whole. First he puts our
          mental powers into their proper order and condition, and then he puts
          a living quickening spirit, so that all these shall move according to
          the holy will and law of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, mark you, this is not all the Holy Spirit does. For if he were to
          do this, and then leave us, none of us would get to heaven. If any of
          you should be so near to heaven that you could hear the angels singing
          over the walls -- if you could almost see within the pearly gates
          still, if the Holy Spirit did not help you the last step, you would
          never enter there. All the work is through his divine operation. Hence
          it is the Spirit who keeps the wheels in motion, and who tales away
          that defilement which, naturally engendered by our original sin, falls
          upon the machine and puts it out of order. He takes this away, and
          keeps the machine constantly going without injury, until at last he
          removes man from the place of defilement to the land of the blessed, a
          perfect creature, as perfect as he was when he came from the mould of
          his Maker.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I must say, before I leave this point, that all the former part of
          what I have mentioned is done instantaneously. When a man is converted
          to God, it is done in a moment. Regeneration is an instantaneous work.
          Conversion to God, the fruit of regeneration, occupies all our life,
          but regeneration itself is effected in an instant. A man hates God;
          the Holy Spirit makes him love God. A man is opposed to Christ, he
          hates his gospel, does not understand it and will not receive it: the
          Holy Spirit comes, puts light into his darkened understanding, takes
          the chain from his bandaged will, gives liberty to his conscience,
          gives life to his dead soul, so that the voice of conscience is heard,
          and the man becomes a new creature in Christ Jesus. And all this is
          done, mark you, by the instantaneous supernatural influence of God the
          Holy Ghost working as he willeth among the sons of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Having thus dwelt upon the method of the Holy Spirit's work, I
          shall now turn to the second point, THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF THE
          SPIRIT'S WORK IN ORDER TO CONVERSION. In our text we are told that
          |while Peter spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which
          heard the word.| Beloved, the Holy Ghost fell on Peter first, or else
          it would not have fallen on his hearers. There is a necessity that the
          preacher himself, if we are to have souls saved, should be under the
          influence of the Spirit. I have constantly made it my prayer that I
          might be guided by the Spirit even in the smallest and least important
          parts of the service; for you cannot tell but that the salvation of a
          soul may depend upon the reading of a hymn, or upon the selection of a
          chapter. Two persons have joined our church and made a profession of
          being converted simply through my reading a hymn --
        </p>
        <p>|Jesus, lover of my soul|</p>
        <p>
          They did not remember anything else in the hymn, but those words made
          such a deep impression upon their mind, that they could not help
          repeating them for days afterwards, and then the thought arose, |Do I
          love Jesus?| And then they considered what strange ingratitude it was
          that he should be the lover of their souls, and yet they should not
          love him. Now I believe the Holy Spirit led me to read that hymn. And
          many persons have been converted by some striking saying of the
          preacher. But why was it the preacher uttered that saying? Simply
          because he was led thereunto by the Holy Spirit. Rest assured,
          beloved, that when any part of the sermon is blessed to your heart,
          the minister said it because he was ordered to say it by his Master. I
          might preach to-day a sermon which I preached on Friday, and which was
          useful then, and there might be no good whatever come from it now,
          because it might not be the sermon which the Holy Ghost would have
          delivered to-day. But if with sincerity of heart I have sought God's
          guidance in selecting the topic, and he rests upon me in the preaching
          of the Word, there is no fear but that it shall be found adapted to
          your immediate wants. The Holy Spirit must rest upon your preachers.
          Let them have all the learning of the wisest men, and all the
          eloquence of such men as Desmosthenes and Cicero, still the Word
          cannot be blessed to you, unless first of all the Spirit of God hath
          guided the minister's mind in the selection of his subject, and in the
          discussion of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if Peter himself were under the hand of the Spirit, that would
          fail unless the Spirit of God, then, did fall upon our hearers; and I
          shall endeavor now to show the absolute necessity of the Spirit's work
          in the conversion of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us remember what kind of thing the work is, and we shall see that
          other means are altogether out of the question. It is quite certain
          that men cannot be converted by physical means. The Church of Rome
          thought that she could convert men by means of armies; so she invaded
          countries, and threatened them with war and bloodshed unless they
          would repent and embrace her religion. However, it availed but little,
          and men were prepared to die rather than leave their faith; she
          therefore tried those beautiful things -- stakes, racks, dungeons,
          axes, swords, fire; and by these things she hoped to convert men. You
          have heard of the man who tried to wind up his watch with a pick-axe.
          That man was extremely wise, compared with the man who thought to
          touch mind through matter. All the machines you like to invent cannot
          touch mind. Talk about tying angel's wings with green withes, or
          manacling the cherubim with iron chains, and then talk about meddling
          with the minds of men through physical means. Why, the things don't
          set; they cannot act. All the king's armies that ever were, and all
          the warriors clothed with mail, with all their ammunition, could never
          touch the mind of man. That is an impregnable castle which is not to
          be reached by physical agency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor, again, can man be converted by moral argument. |Well,| says one,
          |I think he may. Let a minister preach earnestly, and he may persuade
          men to be converted.| Ah! beloved, it is for want of knowing better
          that you say so. Melancthon thought so, but you know what he said
          after he tried it -- |Old Adam is too strong for young Melancthon.| So
          will every preacher find it, if he thinks his arguments can ever
          convert man. Let me give you a parallel case. Where is the logic that
          can persuade an Ethiopian to change his skin? By what argument can you
          induce a leopard to renounce his spots? Even so may he that is
          accustomed to do evil learn to do well. But if the Ethiopian's skin be
          changed it must be by a supernatural process. and if the leopard's
          spots be removed, he that made the leopard must do it. Even so is it
          with the heart of man. If sin were a thing ab extra and external, we
          could induce man to change it. For instance, you may induce a man to
          leave off drunkenness or swearing, because those things are not a part
          of his nature -- he has added that vice to his original depravity. But
          the hidden evil at the heart is beyond all moralsuasion. I dare say a
          man might have enough argument to induce him to hang himself, but I am
          certain no argument will ever induce him to hang his sins, to hang his
          self-righteousness, and to come and humble himself at the foot of the
          cross; for the religion of Christ is so contrary to all the
          propensities of man, that it is like swimming against the stream to
          approach it, for the stream of man's will and man's desire is exactly
          the opposite of the religion of Jesus Christ. If you wanted a proof of
          that, at the lifting of my finger, there are thousands in this hall
          who would rise to prove it, for they would say, |I have found it so
          sir, in my experience; I hated religion as much as any men; I despised
          Christ, and his people, and I know not to this day how it is that I am
          what I am, unless it be the work of God.| I have seen the tears run
          down a man's cheeks when he has come to me in order to be united to
          the church of Christ, and he has said, |Sir, I wonder how it is I am
          here to-day, if anyone had told me a year ago that I should think as I
          now think, and feel as I now feel, I should have called him a born
          fool for his pains; I used to say I never would be one of those
          canting Methodists, I liked to spend my Sunday in pleasure, and I did
          not see why I was to be cooping myself up in the house of God
          listening to a man talk. I pray, sir? No, not I. I said the best
          providence in all the world was a good strong pair of hands, and to
          take care of what you got. If any man talked to me about religion, why
          I would slam the door in his face, and pretty soon put him out; but
          the things that I loved then, I now hate, and the things that then I
          hated, now I love, I cannot do or say enough to show how total is the
          change that has been wrought in me. It must have been the work of God;
          it could not have been wrought by me, I feel assured; it must be some
          one greater than myself, who could thus turn my heart.| I think these
          two things are proofs that we want something more than nature, and
          since physical agency will not do, and mere moral suasion will never
          accomplish it, that there must be an absolute necessity for the Holy
          Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          But again, if you will just think a minute what the work is, you will
          soon see that none but God can accomplish it. In the Holy Scripture,
          conversion is often spoken of as being a new creation. If you talk
          about creating yourselves, I should feel obliged if you would create a
          fly first. Create a gnat. create a grain of sand, and when you have
          created that, you may talk about creating a new heart. Both are alike,
          impossible, for creation is the work of God. But still, if you could
          create a grain of dust, or create even a world, it would not be half
          the miracle, for you must first find a thing which has created itself.
          Could that be? Suppose you had no existence, how could you create
          yourself? Nothing cannot produce anything. Now, how can man re-create
          himself. A man cannot create himself into a new condition, when he has
          no being in that condition, but is, as yet, a thing that is not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, again, the work of creation is said to be like the resurrection.
          |We are alive from the dead.| Now, can the dead in the grave raise
          themselves. Let any minister who thinks he can convert souls, go and
          raise a corpse let him go and stand in one of the cemeteries, and bid
          the tombs open wide their mouths, and make room for those once buried
          there to awaken, and he will have to preach in vain. But if he could
          do it, that is not the miracle: it is for the dead to raise
          themselves, for an inaminate corpse to kindle in its own breast the
          spark of life anew. If the work be a resurrection, a creation, does it
          not strike you that it must be beyond the power of man? It must be
          wrought in him by no one less than God himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          And there is yet one more consideration, and I shall have concluded
          this point. Beloved, even if man could save himself, I would have you
          recollect how averse he is to it? If we could make our hearers all
          willing, the battle would be accomplished. |Well,| says one, |If I am
          willing to be saved, can I not be saved?| Assuredly you can, but the
          difficulty is, we cannot bring men to be willing. That shows,
          therefore, that there must be a constraint put upon their will. There
          must be an influence exerted upon them, which they have not in
          themselves, in order to make them willing in the day of God's power.
          And this is the glory of the Christian religion. The Christian
          religion has within its own bowels power to spread itself. We do not
          ask you to be willing first. We come and tell you the news, and we
          believe that the Spirit of God working with us, will make you willing.
          If the progress of the Christian religion depended upon the voluntary
          assent of mankind it would never go an inch further but because the
          Christian religion has within an omnipotent influence, constraining
          men to believe it, it is therefore that it is and must be triumphant,
          |till like a sea of glory it spreads from shore to shore.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now I shall conclude by bringing one or two thoughts forward,
          with regard to WHAT MUST BE DONE AT THIS TIME IN ORDER TO BRING DOWN
          THE HOLY SPIRIT. It is quite certain, beloved, if the Holy Spirit
          willed to do it, that every man, woman, and child in this place might
          be converted now. If God, the Sovereign Judge of all, would be pleased
          now to send out his Spirit, every inhabitant of this million-peopled
          city might be brought at once to turn unto the living God. Without
          instrumentality, without the preacher, without books, without
          anything, God has it in his power to convert men. We have known
          persons about their business, not thinking about religion at all, who
          have had a thought injected into their heart, and that thought has
          been the prolific mother of a thousand meditations. and through these
          meditations they have been brought to Christ. Without the aid of the
          minister, the Holy Spirit has thus worked, and to-day he is not
          restrained. There may be some men, great in infidelity, staunch in
          opposition to the cross of Christ, but, without asking their consent,
          the Holy Spirit can pull down the strong man, and make the mighty man
          bow himself. For when we talk of the Omnipotent God, there is nothing
          too great for him to do. But, beloved, God has been pleased to put
          great honor upon instrumentality; he could work without it if he
          pleased but he does not do so. However, this is the first thought I
          want to give you; if you would have the Holy Spirit exert himself in
          our midst, you must first of all look to him and not to
          instrumentality. When Jesus Christ preached, there were very few
          converted under him, and the reason was, because the Holy Spirit was
          not abundantly poured forth. He had the Holy Spirit without measure
          himself, but on others the Holy Spirit was not as yet poured out.
          Jesus Christ said, |Greater works than these shall ye do because I go
          to my Father, in order to send the Holy Spirit;| and recollect that
          those few who were converted under Christ's ministry, were not
          converted by him, but by the Holy Spirit that rested upon him at that
          time. Jesus of Nazareth was anointed of the Holy Spirit. Now then, if
          Jesus Christ, the great founder of our religion, needed to be anointed
          of the Holy Spirit, how much more our ministers? And if God would
          always make the distinction even between his own Son as an instrument,
          and the Holy Spirit as the agent, how much more ought we to be careful
          to do that between poor puny men and the Holy Spirit? Never let us
          hear you say again, |So many persons were converted by So-and so.|
          They were not. If converted they were not converted by man.
          Instrumentality is to be used, but the Spirit is to have the honor of
          it. Pay no more a superstitious reverence to man, think no more that
          God is tied to your plans, and to your agencies. Do not imagine that
          so many city missionaries, so much good will be done. Do not say, |So
          many preachers; so many sermons, so many souls saved.| Do not say, |So
          many Bibles, so many tracts; so much good done.| Not so, use these,
          but remember it is not in that proportion the blessing comes; it is,
          so much Holy Spirit, so many souls in-gathered.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now another thought. If we would have the Spirit, beloved, we must
          each of us try to honor him. There are some chapels into which if you
          were to enter, you would never know there was a Holy Spirit. Mary
          Magdalen said of old, |They have taken away my Lord, and I know not
          where they have laid him,| and the Christian might often say so, for
          there is nothing said about the Lord until they come to the end, and
          then there is just the benediction, or else you would not know that
          there were three persons in one God at all. Until our churches honor
          the Holy Spirit, we shall never see it abundantly manifested in our
          midst. Let the preacher always confess before he preaches that he
          relies upon the Holy Spirit. Let him burn his manuscript and depend
          upon the Holy Spirit. If the Spirit does not come to help him, let him
          be still and let the people go home and pray that the Spirit will help
          him next Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>
          And do you also, in the use of all your agencies, always honor the
          Spirit? We often begin our religious meetings without prayer; it is
          all wrong. We must honor the Spirit; unless we put him first, he will
          never make crowns for us to wear. He will get victories, but he will
          have the honor of them, and if we do not give to him the honor, he
          will never give to us the privilege and success. And best of all, if
          you would have the Holy Spirit, let us meet together earnestly to pray
          for him. Remember, the Holy Spirit will not come to us as a church,
          unless we seek him. |For this thing will I be enquired of by the house
          of Israel to do it for them.| We purpose during the coming week to
          hold meetings of special prayer, to supplicate for a revival of
          religion. On the Friday morning I opened the first prayer meeting at
          Trinity Chapel, Brixton; and, I think, at seven o'clock, we had as
          many as two hundred and fifty persons gathered together. It was a
          pleasant sight. During the hour, nine brethren prayed, one after the
          other; and I am sure there was the spirit of prayer there. Some
          persons present sent up their names, asking that we would offer
          special petitions for them; and I doubt not the prayers will be
          answered; At Park Street, on Monday morning, we shall have a prayer.
          meeting from eight to nine; then during the rest of the week there
          will be a prayer-meeting in the morning from seven to eight. On Monday
          evening we shall have the usual prayer-meeting at seven, when I hope
          there will be a large number attending. I find that my brother,
          Baptist Noel, has commenced morning and evening prayer-meetings, and
          they have done the same thing in Norwich and many provincial towns,
          where, without any pressure, the people are found willing to come. I
          certainly did not expect to see so many as two hundred and fifty
          persons at an early hour in the morning meet together for prayer. I
          believe it was a good sign The Lord hath put prayer into their hearts
          and therefore they were willing to come, |Prove me now here, saith the
          Lord of host., and see if I do not pour you out a blessing so that
          there shall not be room enough to receive it.| Let us meet and pray,
          and if God doth not hear us, it will be the first time he has broken
          his promise. Come, let us go up to the sanctuary; let us meet together
          in the house of the Lord, and offer solemn supplication; and I say
          again, if the Lord doth not make bare his arm in the sight of all the
          people, it will be the reverse of all his previous actions, it will be
          the contrary of all his promises, and contradictory to himself. We
          have only to try him, and the result is certain. In dependence on his
          Spirit, if we only meet for prayer, the Lord shall bless us, and all
          the ends of the earth shall fear him. O Lord, lift up thyself because
          of thine enemies; pluck thy right hand out of thy bosom, O Lord our
          God, for Christ's sake, Amen.
