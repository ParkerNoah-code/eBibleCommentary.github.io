        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.974)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, February 5th, 1871 by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "She went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it
          were a bowshot; for she said, Let me not see the death of the child.
          And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept." --
          Genesis 21:16.
        </p>
        <p>
          BRIEFLY LET US REHEARSE the circumstances. The child Isaac was,
          according to God's word, to be the heir of Abraham. Ishmael, the elder
          son of Abraham, by the bondwoman Hagar, resided at home with his
          father till he was about eighteen years of age; but when he began to
          mock and scoff at the younger child whom God had ordained to be the
          heir, it became needful that he and his mother should be sent away
          from Abraham's encampment. It might have seemed unkind and heartless
          to have sent them forth, but God having arranged to provide for them
          sent a divine command which at once rendered their expulsion
          necessary, and certified its success. We may rest assured that
          whatever God commands he will be quite certain to justify. He knew it
          would be no cruelty to Hagar or Ishmael to be driven into
          independence, and he gave a promise which secured them everything
          which they desired. "Also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a
          great nation;" and again, "I have blessed him, and will make him
          fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he
          beget, and I will make him a great nation." Had they both been able to
          go forth from Abraham's tent in faith they might have trodden the
          desert with a joyous footstep, fully assured that he who bade them go,
          and he who promised that he would bless them, would be certain to
          provide all things needful for them. Early in the morning they were
          sent forth on their journey, with as much provision as they could
          carry, and probably they intended to make their way to Egypt, from
          which Hagar had come. They may have lost their way; at any rate, they
          are spoken of as wandering. Their store of food became exhausted, the
          water in the skin bottle was all spent; both of them felt the fatigue
          of the wilderness, and the heat of the pitiless sand; they were both
          faint and weary, and the younger utterly failed. As long as the mother
          could sustain the tottering, fainting footsteps of her boy, she did
          so; when she could do so no longer, he swooned with weakness, and she
          laid him down beneath the slight shade of the desert tamarisk, that he
          might be as far as possible screened from the excessive heat of the
          sun. Looking into his face and seeing the pallor of coming death
          gathering upon it, knowing her inability to do anything whatever to
          revive him, or even to preserve his life, she could not bear to sit
          and gaze upon his face, but withdrew just far enough to be able still
          to watch with all a mother's care. She sat down in the brokenness of
          her spirit, her tears gushed forth in torrents, and heartrending cries
          of agony startled the rocks around. It was needful that the high
          spirit of the mother and her son should be broken down before they
          received prosperity: the mother had been on a former occasion
          graciously humbled by being placed in much the same condition, but she
          had probably relapsed into a haughty spirit, and had encouraged her
          boy in his insolence to Sarah's son, and therefore she must be
          chastened yet again; and it was equally needful that the high-spirited
          lad should for little bear the yoke in his youth, and that he who
          would grow up to be the wild man, the father of the unconquerable
          Arab, should feel the power of God ere he received the fulfillment of
          the promise given to him in answer to Abraham's prayer. If I read the
          text aright while the mother was thus weeping, the child, almost lost
          to all around, was nevertheless conscious enough of his own helpless
          condition, and sufficiently mindful of his father's God to cry in his
          soul to heaven for help; and the Lord heard not so much the mother's
          weeping (for the feebleness of her faith, which ought to have been
          stronger in memory of a former deliverance, hindered her prayer), but
          the silent, unuttered prayers of the fainting lad went up into the
          ears of Elohim, and the angel of Elohim appeared, and pointed to the
          well. The child received the needed draught of water, was soon
          restored, and in him and his posterity the promise of God received and
          continues to receive a large fulfillment. I am not about to speak upon
          that narrative except as it serves me with an illustration for the
          subject which I would now press upon you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behold the compassion of a mother for her child expiring with thirst,
          and remember that such a compassion ought all Christians to feel
          towards souls that are perishing for lack of Christ, perishing
          eternally, perishing without hope of salvation. If the mother lifted
          up her voice arid wept, so also should we; and if the contemplation of
          her dying, child was all too painful for her, so may the contemplation
          of the wrath to come, which is to pass upon every soul that dies
          impenitent, become too painful for us, but yet it the same time it
          should stimulate us to earnest prayer and ardent effort for the
          salvation of our fellow men.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall speak, this morning, upon compassion for souls, the reasons
          which justify it, the sight it dreads, the temptation it must fight
          against, the paths it should pursue, the encouragement it may receive.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. COMPASSION FOR SOULS -- THE REASONS WHICH JUSTIFY IT, NAY, COMPEL
          IT.
        </p>
        <p>
          It scarce needs that I do more than rehearse in bare outline the
          reasons why we should tenderly compassionate the perishing sons of
          men. For first, observe, the dreadful nature of the calamity which
          will overwhelm them. Calamities occurring to our fellow men naturally
          awaken in us a feeling of commiseration; but what calamity under
          heaven can be equal to the ruin of a soul? What misery can be equal to
          that of a man cast away from God, and subject to his wrath world
          without end! To-day your hearts are moved as you hear the harrowing
          details of war. They have been dreadful indeed; houses burnt, happy
          families driven as vagabonds upon the face of the earth, domestic
          circles and quiet households broken up, men wounded, mangled,
          massacred by thousands, and starved, I was about to say, by millions;
          but the miseries of war, if they were confined to this world alone,
          were nothing compared with the enormous catastrophe of tens of
          thousands of spirits accursed by sin, and driven by justice into the
          place where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched. The
          edge of the sword grows blunt at last, the flame of war dies out for
          want of fuel, but, lo! I see before me a sword which is never quiet, a
          fire unquenchable. Alas! that the souls of men should fall beneath the
          infinite ire of justice. All your hearts have been moved of late with
          the thought of famine, famine in a great city. The dogs of war, and
          this the fiercest mastiff of them all, have laid hold upon the fair
          throat of the beautiful city which thought to sit as a lady for ever
          and see no sorrow; you are hastening with your gifts, if possible to
          remove her urgent want and to avert her starvation; but what is a
          famine of bread compared with that famine of the soul which our Lord
          describes when he represents it as pleading in vain for a drop of
          water to cool its tongue tormented in the flame? To be without bread
          for the body is terrible, but to be without the bread of life eternal,
          none of us can tell the weight of horror which lies there! When Robert
          Hall in one of the grand flights of his eloquence pictured the funeral
          of a lost soul, he made the sun to veil his light, and the moon her
          brightness; he covered the ocean with mourning and the heavens with
          sackcloth, and declared that if the whole fabric of nature could
          become animated and vocal, it would not be possible for her to utter a
          groan too deep, or a cry too piercing to express the magnitude and
          extent of the catastrophe. Time is not long enough for the sore
          lamentation which should attend the obsequies of a lost soul. Eternity
          must be charged with that boundless woe, and must utter it in weeping
          and wailing and gnashing of teeth. Not the tongues of prophets, nor of
          seraphs, could se forth all the sorrow of what it is to be condemned
          from the mouth of mercy, damned by the Savior who died to save,
          pronounced accursed by rejected love. The evil is so immense that
          imagination finds no place, and understanding utterly fails. Brethren,
          if our bowels do not yearn for men who are daily hastening towards
          destruction, are we men at all?
        </p>
        <p>
          I could abundantly justify compassion for perishing men, even on the
          ground of natural feelings. A mother who did not, like Hagar, weep for
          her dying child -- call her not "mother," call her "monster." A man
          who passes through the scenes of misery which even this city presents
          in its more squalid quarters, and yet is never disturbed by them, I
          venture to say he is unworthy of the name of man. Even the common
          sorrows of our race may well suffuse our eyes with tears, but the
          eternal sorrow, the infinite lake of misery -- he who grieves not for
          this, write him down a demon, though he wear the image and semblance
          of a man. Do not think the less of this argument because I base it
          upon feelings common to all of woman born, for remember that grace
          does not destroy our manhood when it elevates it to a higher
          condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this instance what nature suggests grace enforces. The more we
          become what we shall be, the more will compassion rule our hearts. The
          Lord Jesus Christ, who is the pattern and mirror of perfect manhood,
          what said he concerning the sins and the woes of Jerusalem? He knew
          Jerusalem must perish; did he bury his pity beneath the fact of the
          divine decree, and steel his heart by the thought of the sovereignty
          or the justice that would be resplendent in the city's destruction?
          Nay, not he, but with eyes gushing like founts, he cried, "O
          Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thy children
          together as a teen gathereth her chickens under her wings! and ye
          would not." If you would be like Jesus, you must be tender and very
          pitiful. Ye would be as unlike him as possible if we could sit down in
          grim content, and, with a Stoic's philosophy, turn all the flesh
          within you into stone. If it be natural, then, and above all, if it be
          natural to the higher gracegiven nature, I beseech you, let your
          hearts be moved with pity, do not endure to see the spiritual death of
          mankind. Be in agony as often as you contemplate the ruin of any soul
          of the seed of Adam.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, the whole ruin and current, and tenour and spirit of the
          gospel influences us to compassion. Ye are debtors, for what were ye
          if compassion had not come to your rescue? Divine compassion, all
          undeserved and free, has redeemed you from your vain conversation.
          Surely those who receive mercy should show mercy; those who owe all
          they have to the pity of God, should not be pitiless to their
          brethren. The Savior never for a moment tolerates the self-righteous
          isolation which would make you despise the prodigal, and cavil at his
          restoration, much less the Cainite spirit which cries, "Am I my
          brother's keeper?" No doctrine is rightly received by you if it
          freezes the genial current of your Christian compassion. You may know
          the truth of the doctrine, but you do not know the doctrine in truth
          if it makes you gaze on the wrath to come without emotions of pity for
          immortal souls. You shall find everywhere throughout the gospel that
          it rings of brotherly love, tender mercy, and weeping pity. If you
          have indeed received it in its power, the love of Christ will melt
          your spirit to compassion for those who are despising Christ, and
          sealing their own destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me beseech you to believe that it is needful as well as
          justifiable that you should feel compassion for the sons of men. You
          all desire to glorify Christ by becoming soul-winners -- I hope you do
          -- and be it remembered that, other things being equal, he is the
          fittest in God's hand to win souls who pities souls most. I believe he
          preaches best who loves best, and in the Sunday-school and in private
          life each soul-seeker shall have the blessing very much in proportion
          to his yearning for it. Paul becomes a saviour of many because his
          heart's desire and prayer to God is that they may be saved. If you can
          live without souls being converted, you shall live without their being
          converted; but if your soul breaketh for the longing that it hath
          towards Christ's glory and the conversion of the ungodly, if like her
          of old you say, "Give me children, or I die," your insatiable hunger
          shall be satisfied, the craving of your spirit shall be gratified. Oh!
          I would to God there should come upon us a divine hunger which cannot
          stay itself except men yield themselves to Jesus; an intense, earnest,
          longing, panting desire that men should submit themselves to the
          gospel of Jesus. This will teach you better than the best college
          training how to deal with human hearts. This will give the stammering
          tongue the ready word; the hot heart shall burn the cords which held
          fast the tongue. You shall become wise to win souls, even though you
          never exhibit the brilliance of eloquence or the force of logic. Men
          shall wonder at your power -- the secret shall be hidden from them,
          the fact being that the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you, and your
          heart shall teach you wisdom, God teaching your heart. Deep feeling on
          your part for others shall make others feel for themselves, and God
          shall bless you, and that right early.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I stand not here any longer to justify what I would far rather
          commend and personally feel.
        </p>
        <p>"Did Christ o'er sinners weep,</p>
        <p>And shall our cheeks be dry?</p>
        <p>Let floods of consecrated grief</p>
        <p>Stream forth from every eye,"</p>
        <p>
          Is God all love, and shall God's children be hard and cold? Shall
          heaven compassionate and shall not earth that has received hearer's
          mercy send back the echo of compassion? O God, make us imitators of
          thee in thy pity towards erring men.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We shall pass on to notice THE SIGHT WHICH TRUE COMPASSION DREADS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like Hagar, the compassionate spirit says, "Let me not see the death
          of the child," or as some have read it, "How can I see the death of
          the child?" To contemplate a soul passing away without hope is too
          terrible a task! I do not wonder that ingenious persons have invented
          theories which aim at mitigating the terrors of the world to come to
          the impenitent. It is natural they should do so, for the facts are so
          alarming as they are truthfully given us in God's word, that if we
          desire to preach comfortable doctrine and such as will quiet the
          consciences of idle professors, we must dilute the awful truth. The
          revelation of God concerning the doom of the wicked is so overwhelming
          as to make it penal, nay, I was about to say damnable, to be
          indifferent and careless in the work of evangelising the world. I do
          not wonder that this error in doctrine springs up just now when
          abounding callousness of heart needs an excuse for itself. What better
          pillow for idle heads than the doctrine that the finally impenitent
          become extinct? The logical reasoning of the sinner is, "Let us eat
          and drink, for to-morrow we die," and the professing Christian is not
          slow to feel an ease of heart from pressing responsibilities when he
          accepts so consolatory an opinion. Forbear this sleeping draught, I
          pray you, for in very deed the sharp stimulant of the truth itself is
          abundantly needful; even when thus bestirred to duty we are sluggish
          enough, and need not that these sweet but sleep-producing theories
          should operate upon us.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a moment, I beseech you, contemplate that which causes horror to
          every tender heart; behold, I pray you, a soul lost, lost beyond all
          hope of restitution. Heaven's gates have shut upon the sanctified, and
          the myriads of the redeemed are there, but that soul is not among
          them, for it passed out of this world without having washed its robes
          in Jesus' blood. For it there are no harps of gold, no thrones of
          glory, no exultation with Christ; from all the bliss of heaven it is
          for ever excluded. This punishment of loss were a heavy enough theme
          for contemplation. The old divines used to speak much of the poena
          damni, or the punishment of loss; there were enough in that phase of
          the future to make us mourn bitterly, as David did for Absalom. My
          child shut out of heaven! My husband absent from the seats of the
          blessed! My sister, my brother not in glory! When the Lord counts up
          his chosen, my dear companion outside the gates of pearl, outside the
          jewelled battlements of the New Jerusalem! O God, tis a heartbreaking
          sorrow to think of this. But then comes the punishment added to the
          loss. What saith the Savior? "Where their worm dieth not, and the fire
          is not quenched." "These shall go away into everlasting punishment."
          And yet again, "And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion
          with the hypocrites." And yet again, "Into outer darkness: there shall
          be weeping and gnashing of teeth." "Metaphors," say you. It is true,
          but not meaningless metaphors. There is a meaning in each expression
          -- and rest assured though man's metaphors sometimes exaggerate, God's
          never do; his symbols everywhere are true; never is there an
          exaggeration in the language of inspiration. Extravagances of
          utterance! He uses them not; his figures are substantial truth.
          Terrible as the scriptural emblems of punishment are, they set forth
          matters of undoubted fact, which if a man could look upon this day,
          the sight might blanch his hair, and quench his eye. If we could hear
          the wailings of the pit for a moment, we should earnestly entreat that
          we might never hear them again. We have to thank God that we are not
          allowed to hear the dolorous cries of the lost, for if we did they
          would make our life bitter as gall. I cast a veil over that which I
          cannot paint; like Hagar I cannot bear to look at the dread reality
          which it breaks my heart to think upon.
        </p>
        <p>
          How all this gathers intensity, when it comes to be our own child, our
          own friend! Hagar might perhaps have looked upon a dying child, but
          not upon her dying Ishmael. Can you bear now to think for a moment of
          the perdition of your own flesh and blood? Does not your spirit flinch
          and draw back with horror instinctively at the idea of one of your own
          family being lost? Yet, as a matter of stern fact, you know that some
          of them will be lost if they die as they are now living? At God's
          right hand they cannot stand unless they be made new creatures in
          Christ Jesus. You know that, do not try to forget it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will greatly add to your feeling of sorrow if you are forced to
          feel that the ruin of your child or of any other person may have been
          partly caused by your example. It must be a dreadful thing for a
          father to feel, "My boy learned to drink from me; my child heard the
          first blasphemous word from his father's lips." Or mother, if your
          dying daughter should say, "I was led into temptation by my mother's
          example," what a grief will this be! O parents, converted late in
          life, you cannot undo the evil which you have already done; God has
          forgiven you, but the mischief wrought in your children's characters
          is indelible, unless the grace of God step in. I want you to seek
          after that grace with great earnestness. As you must confess that you
          have helped to train your child as a servant of sin, will you not long
          to see your evil work undone before it ends in your child's eternal
          destruction?
        </p>
        <p>
          If we shall have to feel that the ruin of any of our friends or
          relations is partly occasioned by our own personal neglect of
          religion, it will cause us bitter pangs. If our example has been
          excellent and admirable in all respects, but that we have forgotten
          the Lord and his Christ, it will have been none the less injurious to
          men's souls. I sometimes think that these examples are the very worst
          in their effect. Immoral, ungodly men can hardly work the same measure
          of mischief as moral but unchristian men. I will tell you why. The
          ungodly quote the orderly life of the moralist as an argument that
          there can be goodness apart from Christianity, and this often helps
          men to rest satisfied apart from Christ Jesus. And what, O moralist,
          though you never taught your child a vice, if you taught it unbelief,
          and if your example helped to harm its heart in bold rebellion against
          God! Ah! then, how will you blame yourself when you are converted, or
          curse yourself if both you and your child perish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear friends, it makes a terrible addition to the sight of a soul
          being lost if we have to feel we were under responsibility concerning
          it, and have been in any measure unfaithful. I cannot bear the idea of
          any of my congregation perishing, for in addition to the compassion I
          hope I feel, I am influenced by a further additional consideration,
          for I am set as a watchman to your souls. When any die, I ask myself,
          "Was I faithful? Did I speak all the truth? And did I speak it from my
          very soul every time I preached?" John Walsh, the famous Scotch
          preacher, was often out of bed in the coldest night, by the hour
          together, in supplication; and when some one wondered that he spent so
          many hours upon his knees, he said, "Ah, man, I have three thousand
          souls to give account of in the day of judgment, and I do not know but
          what it is going very ill with some of them." Alas! I have more than
          that to give account of, and well may I cry to God that I may not see
          you perish. O may it never be that you shall go from these pews to the
          lowest hell. You, too, my fellow Christian, have your own
          responsibilities, each one in your measure -- your children, your
          school classes, your servants, ay, and your neighbors, for if you are
          not doing any good and do not assume any responsibility towards the
          regions in which you dwell, that responsibility rests upon you none
          the less. You cannot live in a district without being responsible to
          God for doing something towards the bettering of the people among whom
          you reside. Can you endure it then, that your neighbors should sink
          into hell? Do not your hearts long for their salvation?
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it not an awful thing that a soul should perish with the gospel so
          near? If Ishmael had died, and the water had been within bow-shot, and
          yet unseen till too late, it had been a dreadful reflection for the
          mother. Would she not have torn her hair with double sorrow? And yet
          many of you are being lost with the gospel ringing in your ears; you
          are perishing while Christ is lifted up before you; you are dying in
          the camp through the serpent's bite, though the brazen serpent is
          yonder before your eyes, and with many tears we cry to you, "Look unto
          Jesus Christ, and live!" Ah, woe is me, woe is me, if you perish when
          salvation is brought so close home to you. Some of you are very near
          the kingdom of God; you are very anxious, very concerned, but you have
          not believed in Jesus; you have much that is good, but one thing you
          lack. Will you perish for lack of only one thing? A thousand pities
          will it be if you make shipwreck in the harbour's mouth and go to hell
          from the gates of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must add to all this, the remembrance that it is not one soul which
          is lost, but tens of thousands are going down to the pit. Mr. Beecher
          said in one of his sermons, "If there were a great bell hung high in
          heaven which the angels swung every time a soul was lost, how
          constantly would its solemn toll be heard!" A soul lost! The thunder
          would not suffice to make a knell for a lost spirit. Each time the
          clock ticks a soul departs out of this world, perhaps oftener than
          that, and out of those who make the last journey how few mount to the
          skies; what multitudes descend to endless woe! O Christians, pull up
          the sluices of your souls, and let your hearts pour out themselves in
          rivers of compassion.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. In the third place, I said I would speak upon COMPASSION FOR THE
          SOULS OF MEN -- THE TEMPTATION IT MUST RESIST.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must not fall into the temptation to imitate the example of Hagar
          too closely. She put the child under the shrubs and turned away her
          gaze from the all too mournful spectacle. She could not endure to
          look, but she sat where she could watch in despair. There is a
          temptation with each one of us to try to forget that souls are being
          lost. I can go home to my house along respectable streets, and
          naturally should choose that way, for then I need not see the poverty
          of the lowest quarters of the city, but am I right if I try to forget
          that there are Bethnal Greens and Kent Streets, and such like abodes
          of poverty? The close courts, the cellars, the crowded garrets, the
          lodging-houses -- am I to forget that these exist? Surely the only way
          for a charitable mind to sleep comfortably in London is to forget how
          one half of the population lives; but is it our object to live
          comfortably? Are we such brute beasts that comfort is all we care for;
          like swine in their stye? Nay, brethren, let us recall to our memories
          the sins of our great city, its sorrows and griefs, and let us
          remember also the sins and sorrows of the wide, wide world, and the
          tens of thousands of our race who are passing constantly into
          eternity. Nay, look at them! Do not close those eyes! Does the horror
          of the vision make your eyeballs ache? Then look until your heart
          aches too, and your spirit breaks forth in vehement agony before the
          Lord. Look down into hell a moment; open wide the door; listen, and
          listen yet again. You say you cannot, it sickens your soul; let it be
          sickened, and in its swooning let it fall back into the arms of Christ
          the Savior, and breathe out a cry that he would hasten to save men
          from the wrath to come. Do not ignore, I pray you, what does exist. It
          is a matter of fact that in this congregation many are going down to
          hell, that in this city there are multitudes who are hastening as
          certainly to perdition as time is hastening to eternity. It is no
          dream, no fiction of a fevered brain that there is a hell. If you
          think so, then why dare you call yourselves Christians? Renounce your
          Bible, renounce your baptism, renounce your profession if one spark of
          honesty remains in you. Call not yourselves Christians when you deny
          the teaching of your Master. Since assuredly there is a dreadful hell,
          shut not your eyes to it, put not the souls of your fellows away among
          the shrubs, and sit not down in supineness. Come and look, come and
          look, I say, till your hearts break at the sight. Hear the cries of
          dying men whose consciences are awakened too late. Hear the groans of
          spirits who are feeling the sure consequences of sin, where sin's cure
          will never avail them. Let this stir you, my brethren, to action -- to
          action immediate and intense. You tell me I preach dreadful things;
          ay, and they are wanted, they are wanted. Was there ever such a happy
          age as this? Were there ever such sleepy persons as ourselves? Take
          heed lest you take sad precedence of all others in the accusations of
          conscience, because knowing the gospel, and enjoying it, you
          nevertheless use so little exertion in spreading it abroad among the
          human race. Let us shun the temptation which Hagar's example might
          suggest.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. I will now speak upon THE PATH WHICH TRUE COMPASSION WILL BE SURE
          TO FOLLOW; and what is that?
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, true pity does all it can. Before Hagar sat down and
          wept, she had done her utmost for her boy; she had given him the last
          drop from the bottle; she had supported his tottering footsteps, she
          had sought out the place under the shrubs where he might be a little
          sheltered she had laid him down gently with soothing words, and then,
          but not till then, she sat herself down. Have we done all that it is
          possible for us to do for the unconverted around us? There are
          preventible causes of men's ruin. Some causes you and I cannot touch,
          but there are some we ought at once to remove. For instance, it is
          certain that many perish through ignorance. It ought never to be that
          a soul should perish of ignorance within a mile of where a Christian
          lives. I would even allot a wider area in regions where the people
          dwell not so thickly. It should at least be the resolve of each
          Christian, "Within this district where I live, so far as my ability
          goes, everybody shall know the gospel by some means or other. If I
          cannot speak to each one will send something for him to read; it shall
          not be said that a man lost his way for ever because he had no Bible.
          The Holy Ghost alone can lead men into the truth, but it is our part
          to put the letter of the word before all men's eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prejudice, too, is another preventible cause of unbelief. Some will
          not hear the gospel, or listen to it, because of their notions of its
          sternness, or of the moroseness of its professors. Such a prejudice
          may effectually close their hearts; be it yours to remove it. Be kind
          to the ungodly; be loving, be tender, be affable, be generous to them,
          so that you may remove all unnecessary antipathy to the gospel of
          Jesus. Do them all the good you can for their bodies, that they may be
          the more likely to believe in your love towards their souls. Let it be
          said by each one here, "If a soul perishes, I, at least, will have
          done all in my power to reclaim it."
        </p>
        <p>
          But what next does compassion do? Having done all it can, it sits down
          and weeps over its own feebleness. I have not the pathos wherewith to
          describe to you the mother sitting there and pouring out her tears,
          and lifting up her plaintive voice over her child. The voice of a
          broken heart cannot be described, it must be heard. But, ah! there is
          wonderful power with God in the strong crying and tears of his people.
          If you know how to weep before the Lord, he will yield to tears what
          he will not yield to anything besides. O ye saints, compassionate
          sinners; sigh and cry for them; be able to say, as Whitfield could to
          his congregation, "Sirs, if ye are lost, it is not for want of my
          weeping for you, for I pour out my soul day and night in petitions
          unto God that ye may live." When Hagar's compassion had wailed itself
          out, she looked unto God, and God heard her. Take care that your
          prayers be abundant and continuous for those who are dying without
          hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then what else doth Hagar teach us? She stood there ready to do
          anything that was needful after the Lord had interposed. The angel
          opened her eyes; until then she was powerless, and sat and wept, and
          prayed, but when he pointed to the well, did she linger for a minute?
          Was she unprepared with the bottle wherewith to draw water? Did she
          delay to put it to her child's lips? Was she slack in the blessed
          task? Oh, no! with what alacrity did she spring to the well; with what
          speed did she fill the bottle; with what motherly joy did she hasten
          to her child, and gave him the saving draught! And so I want every
          member here to stand ready to mark the faintest indication of grace in
          any soul. Watch always for the beginning of their conversion, be ready
          with the bottle of promise to carry a little comfort to their parched
          lips; watch with a mother's earnestness, watch for the opportunity of
          doing good to souls; yearn over them, so that when God shall work you
          shall work with him instanter, and Jesus shall not be hindered because
          of your carelessness and want of faith. This is the path which the
          true Christian should pursue. He is earnest for souls, and therefore
          he lays himself out for them. If we did really know what souls are,
          and what it is for them to be cast away, those of us who have done
          very little or nothing would begin to work for Christ directly. It is
          said in old classic story, that a certain king of Lydia had a son who
          had been dumb from his birth, but when Lydia was captured, a soldier
          was about to kill the king, when the young man suddenly found a
          tongue, and cried out, "Soldier, would you kill the king?" He had
          never spoken a word before, but his astonishment and fear gave him
          speech. And methinks if ye had been dumb to that moment, if ye indeed
          saw your own children and neighbors going down into the pit, you would
          cry out, "Though I never spoke before I will speak now. Poor souls,
          believe in Christ, and ye shall be saved." You do not know how such an
          utterance as that, however simple, might be blessed. A very little
          child once found herself in company with an old man of eighty, a fine
          old man who loved little children, and who took the child upon his
          knee to fondle it. The little one turning round to him said, "Sir, I
          got a grandpa just like you, and my grandpa love Jesus Christ, does
          you?" He said, "I was eighty-four years of age and had lived always
          among Christian people, but nobody ever thought it worth his while to
          say as much as that to me." That little child was the instrument of
          the old man's conversion. So have I heard the story. He knew he had
          not loved the Savior, and he began to seek him, and in his old age he
          found salvation. If as much as that is possible to a child it is
          possible to you. O dear brother, if you love Jesus, burst the bonds of
          timidity, or it may be of supineness; snap all fetters, and from this
          day feel that you cannot bear to think of the ruin of a soul, and must
          seek its salvation if there be in earth or heaven ways and means by
          which you can bring a blessing to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. But I must close, and the last point shall be THE ENCOURAGEMENT
          WITH TRUE COMPASSION FOR SOULS WILL ALWAYS RECEIVE.
        </p>
        <p>
          First take the case in hand. The mother compassionated, God
          compassionated too. You pity, God pities. The motions of God's Spirit
          in the souls of his people are the footfalls of God's eternal purposes
          about to be fulfilled. It is always a hopeful sign for a man that
          another man prays for him. There is a difficulty in getting a man to
          hell whom a child of God is drawing towards heaven by his
          intercessions. Satan is often defeated in his temptations by the
          intercession of the saints. Have hope then that your personal sense of
          compassion for souls is an indication that such souls God will bless.
          Ishmael, whom Hagar pitied, was a lad about whom promises had been
          made large and broad; he could not die; she had forgotten that, but
          God had not. No thirst could possibly destroy him, for God had said he
          would make of him a great nation. Let us hope that those for whom you
          and I are praying and laboring are in God's eternal purpose secured
          from hell, because the blood of Christ has bought them, and they must
          be the Lord's. Our prayers are ensigns of the will of God. The Holy
          Ghost leads us to pray for those whom he intends effectually to call.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, those we pray for, we may not know it, but there may be in
          their souls at this time a stirring of divine life. Hagar did not know
          that her son was praying, but God did. The lad did not speak, but God
          heard his heart cry. Children are often very reticent to their
          parents. Often and often have I talked with young lads about their
          souls, who have told me that they could not talk to their fathers upon
          such matters. I know it was so with me. When I was under concern of
          soul the last persons I should have elected to speak to upon religion
          would have been my parents, not out of want of love to them, nor
          absence of love on their part; but so it was. A strange feeling of
          diffidence pervades a seeking soul, and drives it from its friends.
          Those whom you are praying for may be praying too, and you do not know
          it; but the time of love will come when their secret yearnings will be
          revealed to your earnest endeavors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lad was preserved after all, the well of waters was revealed, and
          the bottle put to his lips. It will be a great comfort to you to
          believe that God will hear importunate prayers. Your child will be
          saved, your husband will be brought in yet, good woman, only pray on.
          Your neighbor shall be brought to hear the truth and be converted,
          only be earnest about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not know how to preach, this morning; the tongue cannot readily
          speak when the heart feels too much. I pray that we may have a great
          revival of religion in our midst as a church; my spirit longs and
          pants for it. I see a great engine of enormous strength, and a
          well-fashioned machine: the machine cannot work of itself, it has no
          power in it, but if I could get the band to unite the machine with the
          engine, what might be done! Behold, I see the omnipotence of God, and
          the organisation of this church. O that I could get the band to bind
          the two together! The band is living faith. Do you possess it?
          Brethren, help me to pass it round the fly wheel, and oh, how God will
          work, and we will work through his power, and what glorious things
          shall be done for Christ! We must receive power from on high, and
          faith is the belt that shall convey that power to us. The divine
          strength shall be manifest through our weakness. Cease not to pray.
          More than you ever have done, intercede for a blessing, and the Lord
          will bless us: he will bless us, and all the ends of the earth shall
          fear him. Amen.
