          1. Come, let us rejoice before Jehovah; let us make a joyful noise to
          the Rock of our salvation. 2. Let us come before his face with praise,
          In psalms let us shout for joy unto him.3. For Jehovah is a great God,
          And a great King, above all gods.4. For in his hand are the deep
          places of the earth, And the heights of the mountains are his.5. For
          his is the sea, and he made it; And the dry land his hands formed.

          1. Come, let us rejoice before Jehovah. This psalm is suited for the
          Sabbath, when we know that the religious assemblies were more
          particularly convened for the worship of God. It is not individuals
          among the godly whom he exhorts to celebrate the divine praises in
          private; he enjoins these to be offered up in the public meeting. By
          this he showed that the outward worship of God principally consisted
          in the sacrifice of praise, and not in dead ceremonies. He enjoins
          haste upon them; by which they might testify their alacrity in this
          service. For the Hebrew word qdm, kadam, in the second verse, which I
          have rendered, let us come before, etc., means to make haste. He calls
          upon them to speed into the presence of God; and such an admonition
          was needed, considering how naturally backward we are when called by
          God to the exercise of thanksgiving. This indirect charge of indolence
          in the exercise, the Psalmist saw it necessary to prefer against God's
          ancient people; and we should be made aware that there is just as much
          need of a stimulus in our own case, filled as our hearts are with
          similar ingratitude. In calling them to come before God's face, he
          uses language which was also well fitted to increase the ardor of the
          worshippers; nothing being more agreeable than to offer in God's own
          presence such a sacrifice as he declares that he will accept. He
          virtually thus says, in order to prevent their supposing the service
          vain, that God was present to witness it. I have shown elsewhere in
          what sense God was present in the sanctuary.

          3. For Jehovah is a great God. By these words the Psalmist reminds us
          what abundant grounds we have for praising God, and how far we are
          from needing to employ the lying panegyric with which rhetoricians
          flatter earthly princes. First, he extols the greatness of God,
          drawing a tacit contrast between him and such false gods as men have
          invented for themselves. We know that there has always been a host of
          gods in the world, as Paul says,
        </p>
        <p>
          |There are many on the earth who are called gods,|<br />(1 Corinthians
          8:5.)
        </p>
        <p>
          We are to notice the opposition stated between the God of Israel and
          all others which man has formed in the exercise of an unlicensed
          imagination. Should any object, that |an idol is nothing in the
          world,| (1 Corinthians 8:4,) it is enough to reply, that the Psalmist
          aims at denouncing the vain delusions of men who have framed gods
          after their own foolish device. I admit, however, that under this term
          he may have comprehended the angels, asserting God to be possessed of
          such excellence as exalted him far above all heavenly glory, and
          whatever might be considered Divine, as well as above the feigned
          deities of earth. Angels are not indeed gods, but the name admits of
          an improper application to them on account of their being next to God,
          and still more, on account of their being accounted no less than gods
          by men who inordinately and superstitiously extol them. If the
          heavenly angels themselves must yield before the majesty of the one
          God, it were the height of indignity to compare him with gods who are
          the mere fictions of the brain. In proof of his greatness, he bids us
          look to his formation of the world, which he declares to be the work
          of God's hands, and subject to his power. This is one general ground
          why God is to be praised, that he has clearly shown forth his glory in
          the creation of the world, and will have us daily recognize him in the
          government of it. When it is said, that the depths of the earth are in
          his hand, the meaning is, that it is ruled by his providence, and
          subject to his power. Some read, the bounds of the earth, but the word
          means abysses or depths, as opposed to the heights of the mountains.
          The Hebrew word properly signifies searching.<br />
