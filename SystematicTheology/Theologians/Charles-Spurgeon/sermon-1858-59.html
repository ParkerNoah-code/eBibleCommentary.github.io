        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.222)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, November 7th, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>

          "Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye
          are in heaviness through manifold temptations." -- 1 Peter 1:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS VERSE TO A WORLDLY MAN looks amazingly like a contradiction; and
          even to a Christian man, when he understands it best, it will still be
          a paradox. "Ye greatly rejoice," and yet "ye are in heaviness." Is
          that possible? Can there be in the same heart great rejoicing, and yet
          a temporary heaviness? Most assuredly. This paradox has been known and
          felt by many of the Lord's children, and it is far from being the
          greatest paradox of the Christian life. Men who live within
          themselves, and mark their own feelings as Christians, will often
          stand and wonder at themselves. Of all riddles, the greatest riddle is
          a Christian man. As to his pedigree, what a riddle he is! He is a
          child of the first Adam, "an heir of wrath, even as others." He is a
          child of the second Adam: he was born free; there is therefore now no
          condemnation unto him. He is a riddle in his own existence. "As dying,
          and behold we live; as chastened, and not killed." He is a riddle as
          to the component parts of his own spiritual frame. He finds that which
          makes him akin to the devil -- depravity, corruption, binding him
          still to the earth, and causing him to cry out, "O wretched man that I
          am;" and yet he finds that he has within himself that which exalts
          him, not merely to the rank of an angel, but higher still -- a
          something which raises him up together, and makes him "sit together
          with Christ Jesus in heavenly places." He finds that he has that
          within him which must ripen into heaven, and yet that about him which
          would inevitably ripen into hell, if grace did not forbid. What
          wonder, then, beloved, if the Christian man be a paradox himself, that
          his condition should be a paradox too? Why marvel ye, when ye see a
          creature corrupt and yet purified, mortal and yet immortal, fallen but
          yet exalted far above principalities and powers -- why marvel ye, that
          ye should find that creature also possessed of mingled experience,
          greatly rejoicing, and yet at the same time, "in heaviness through
          manifold temptations."
        </p>
        <p>
          I would have you this morning, look first of all at the Christian's
          heaviness: he is "in heaviness through manifold temptations;" and
          then, in the next place, at the Christian's great rejoicing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In the first place, HIS HEAVINESS. This is one of the most
          unfortunate texts in the Bible. I have heard it quoted ten thousand
          times for my own comfort, but I never understood it till a day or two
          ago. On referring to most of the commentaries in my possession, I
          cannot find that they have a right idea of the meaning of this text.
          You will notice that your friends often say to you when you are in
          trouble, "There is a needs be for this affliction;" there is a needs
          be, say they, "for all these trials and troubles that befall you."
          That is a very correct and scriptural sentiment; but that sentiment is
          not in the text at all. And yet, whenever this text is quoted in my
          hearing, this is what I am always told, or what I conceive I am always
          told to be the meaning, -- that the great temptations, the great
          trials which befal us, have a needs be for them. But it does not say
          so here: it says something better; not only that there is a needs be
          for our temptations, but that there is a needs be for our heaviness
          under the temptation. Now, let me show you the difference. There is a
          man of God, full of faith -- strong; he is about to do his Master's
          work, and he does it. God is with him, and gives him great success.
          The enemy begins to slander him; all manner of evil is spoken against
          him falsely for Christ's name sake. You say, there is a needs be for
          that, and you are quite correct: but look at the man. How gallantly he
          behaves himself! He lifts his head above his accusers, and unmoved
          amidst them all, he stands like a rock in the midst of a roaring
          tempest, never moved from the firm basis on which it rests. The scene
          changes, and instead of calamity, perhaps he is called to endure
          absolute persecution, as in apostolic times. We imagine the man driven
          out from house and home, separated from all his kindred, made to
          wander in the pathless snows of the mountains; and what a brave and
          mighty man he appears, when you see him enduring all this! His spirits
          never sink. "All this can I do," says he, "and I can greatly rejoice
          in it, for Christ's name's sake; for I can practice the text which
          says, Rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy;'" and you will tell
          that man there is a needs be for his persecution; he says, "Yes, I
          know it, and I fear not all I have to endure; I am not cowed by it."
          At last imagine the man taken before the Inquisition and condemned to
          die. You still comfort him with the fact, that there is a needs be
          that he shall die -- that the blood of the martyrs must be the seed of
          the church -- that the world can never be overcome by Christ's gospel,
          except through the sufferings and death of his followers -- that
          Christ stooped to conquer, and the church must do the same -- that
          through death and blood must be the road to the church's victory. And
          what a noble sight it is, to see that man going to the stake, and
          kissing it -- looking upon his iron chains with as much esteem as if
          they had been chains of gold. Now tell him there is a needs be for all
          this, and he will thank you for the promise; and you admire the man;
          you wonder at him. Ah! but there is another class of persons that get
          no such honour as this. There is another sort of Christians for whom
          this promise really was intended, who do not get the comfort of it. I
          do admire the man I have pictured to you: may God long preserve such
          men in the midst of the church; I would stimulate every one of you to
          imitate him. Seek for great faith and great love to your Master, that
          you may be able to endure, being "stedfast, immovable, always
          abounding in the work of the Lord." But remember, that this text has
          not in it comfort for such persons; there are other texts for them;
          this text has been perverted for such a use as that. This is meant for
          another and a feebler grade of Christians, who are often overlooked
          and sometimes despised.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was lying upon my couch during this last week, and my spirits were
          sunken so low that I could weep by the hour like a child, and yet I
          knew not what I wept for -- but a very slight thing will move me to
          tears just now -- and a kind friend was telling me of some poor old
          soul living near, who was suffering very great pain, and yet she was
          full of joy and rejoicing. I was so distressed by the hearing of that
          story, and felt so ashamed of myself, that I did not know what to do;
          wondering why I should be in such a state as this; while this poor
          woman, who had a terrible cancer, and was in the most frightful agony,
          could nevertheless "rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory."
          And in a moment this text flashed upon my mind, with its real meaning.
          I am sure it is its real meaning. Read it over and over again, and you
          will see I am not wrong. "Though now for a season, if need be, ye are
          in heaviness." It does not say, "Though now for a season ye are
          suffering pain, though now for a season you are poor; but you are in
          heaviness;'" your spirits are taken away from you; you are made to
          weep; you cannot bear your pain; you are brought to the very dust of
          death, and wish that you might die. Your faith itself seems as if it
          would fail you. That is the thing for which there is a needs be. That
          is what my text declares, that there is an absolute needs be that
          sometimes the Christian should not endure his sufferings with a
          gallant and a joyous heart; there is a needs be that sometimes his
          spirits should sink within him, and that he should become even as a
          little child smitten beneath the hand of God. Ah! beloved, we
          sometimes talk about the rod, but it is one thing to see the rod, and
          it is another thing to feel it; and many a time have we said within
          ourselves, "If I did not feel so low spirited as I now do, I should
          not mind this affliction;" and what is that but saying, "If I did not
          feel the rod I should not mind it?" It is just how you feel, that is,
          after all, the pith and marrow of your affliction. It is that breaking
          down of the spirit, that pulling down of the strong man, that is the
          very fester of the soreness of God's scourging -- "the blueness of the
          wound, whereby the soul is made better." I think this one idea has
          been enough to be food for me many a day; and there may be some child
          of God here to whom it may bring some slight portion of comfort. We
          will yet again dwell upon it. "Though now for a season, if need be, ye
          are in heaviness through manifold temptations."
        </p>
        <p>
          And here let me for a moment or two try to explain why it is that
          there is an absolute needs be, not merely for temptations and
          troubles, but likewise for our being in heaviness under them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, if we were not in heaviness during our troubles we
          should not be like our Covenant Head -- Christ Jesus. It is a rule of
          the kingdom that all the members must be like the head. They are to be
          like the head in that day when he shall appear. "We shall be like him,
          for we shall see him as he is." But we must be like the head also in
          his humiliation, or else we cannot be like him in his glory. Now, you
          will observe that our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ very often passed
          through much of trouble, without any heaviness. When he said, "Foxes
          have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man
          hath not where to lay his head," I observe no heaviness. I do not
          think he sighed over that. And when athirst he sat upon the well, and
          said, "Give me to drink," there was no heaviness in all his thirst. I
          believe that through the first years of his ministry, although he
          might have suffered some heaviness, he usually passed over his
          troubles like a ship floating over the waves of the sea. But you will
          remember that at last the waves of swelling grief came into the
          vessel; at last the Saviour himself, though full of patience, was
          obliged to say "My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death;" and
          one of the evangelists tells us that the Saviour "began to be very
          heavy." What means that, but that his spirits began to sink? There is
          a more terrible meaning yet, which I cannot enter into this morning;
          but still I may say that the surface meaning of it is that all his
          spirits sank within him. He had no longer his wonted courage, and
          though he had strength to say, "Nevertheless, not my will, but thine
          be done;" still the weakness did prevail, when he said, "If it be
          possible let this cup pass from me." The Saviour passed through the
          brook, but he "drank of the brook by the way;" and we who pass through
          the brook of suffering must drink of it too. He had to bear the
          burden, not with his shoulders omnipotent, but with shoulders that
          were bending to the earth beneath a load. And you and I must not
          always expect a giant faith that can remove mountains: sometimes even
          to us the grasshopper must be a burden, that we may in all things be
          like unto our head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet again; if the Christian did not sometimes suffer heaviness he
          would begin to grow too proud, and think too much of himself, and
          become too great in his own esteem. Those of us who are of elastic
          spirit, and who in our health are full of everything that can make
          life happy, are too apt to forget the Most High God. Lest we should be
          satisfied from ourselves, and forget that all our own springs must be
          in him, the Lord sometimes seems to sap the springs of life, to drain
          the heart of all its spirits, and to leave us without soul or strength
          for mirth, so that the noise of tabret and of viol would be unto us as
          but the funeral dirge, without joy or gladness. Then it is that we
          discover what we are made of, and out of the depths we cry unto God,
          humbled by our adversities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another reason for this discipline is, I think, that in heaviness we
          often learn lessons that we never could attain elsewhere. Do you know
          that God has beauties for every part of the world; and he has beauties
          for every place of experience? There are views to be seen from the
          tops of the Alps that you can never see elsewhere. Ay, but there are
          beauties to be seen in the depths of the dell that ye could never see
          on the tops of the mountains; there are glories to be seen on Pisgah,
          wondrous sights to be beheld when by faith we stand on Tabor; but
          there are also beauties to be seen in our Gethsemanes, and some
          marvellously sweet flowers are to be culled by the edge of the dens of
          the leopards. Men will never become great in divinity until they
          become great in suffering. "Ah!" said Luther, "affliction is the best
          book in my library;" and let me add, the best leaf in the book of
          affliction is that blackest of all the leaves, the leaf called
          heaviness, when the spirit sinks within us, and we cannot endure as we
          could wish.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet again; this heaviness is of essential use to a Christian, if
          he would do good to others. Ah! there are a great many Christian
          people that I was going to say I should like to see afflicted -- but I
          will not say so much as that; I should like to see them heavy in
          spirit; if it were the Lord's will that they should be bowed down
          greatly, I would not express a word of regret; for a little more
          sympathy would do them good; a little more power to sympathize would
          be a precious boon to them, and even if it were purchased by a short
          journey through a burning, fiery furnace, they might not rue the day
          afterwards in which they had been called to pass through the flame.
          There are none so tender as those who have been skinned themselves.
          Those who have been in the chamber of affliction know how to comfort
          those who are there. Do not believe that any man will become a
          physician unless he walks the hospitals; and I am sure that no one
          will become a divine, or become a comforter, unless he lies in the
          hospital as well as walks through it, and has to suffer himself. God
          cannot make ministers -- and I speak with reverence of his Holy Name
          -- he cannot make a Barnabas except in the fire. It is there, and
          there alone, that he can make his sons of consolation; he may make his
          sons of thunder anywhere; but his sons of consolation he must make in
          the fire, and there alone. Who shall speak to those whose hearts are
          broken, who shall bind up their wounds, but those whose hearts have
          been broken also, and whose wounds have long run with the sore of
          grief? "If need be," then, "ye are in heaviness through manifold
          temptations."
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I have said enough about this heaviness, except that I must
          add it is but for a season. A little time, a few hours, a few days, a
          few months at most, it shall all have passed away; and then comes the
          "eternal weight of glory, wherein ye greatly rejoice."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now to the second part of the text. Here we have something far
          more joyous and comfortable than the first. "WHEREIN YE GREATLY
          REJOICE." And can a Christian greatly rejoice while he is in
          heaviness? Yes, most assuredly he can. Mariners tell us that there are
          some parts of the sea where there is a strong current upon the surface
          going one way, but that down in the depths there is a strong current
          running the other way. Two seas do not meet and interfere with one
          another; but one stream of water on the surface is running in one
          direction, and another below in an opposite direction. Now, the
          Christian is like that. On the surface there is a stream of heaviness
          rolling with dark waves; but down in the depths there is a strong
          under-current of great rejoicing that is always flowing there. Do you
          ask me what is the cause of this great rejoicing? The apostle tells
          us, "Wherein ye greatly rejoice." What does he mean? You must refer to
          his own writings, and then you will see. He is writing "to the
          strangers scattered throughout Pontus," and so forth. The first thing
          that he say's to them is, that they are "elect according to the
          foreknowledge of God;" "wherein we greatly rejoice." Ah! even when the
          Christian is most "in heaviness through manifold temptations," what a
          mercy it is that he can know that he is still elect of God! Any man
          who is assured that God has "chosen him from before the foundation of
          the world," may well say, "Wherein we greatly rejoice." Let me be
          lying upon a bed of sickness, and just revel in that one thought.
          Before God made the heavens and the earth, and laid the pillars of the
          firmament in their golden sockets, he set his love upon me; upon the
          breast of the great high priest he wrote my name, and in his
          everlasting book it stands, never to be erased -- "elect according to
          the foreknowledge of God." Why, this may make a man's soul leap within
          him, and all the heaviness that the infirmities of the flesh may lay
          upon him shall he but as nothing; for this tremendous current of his
          overflowing joy shall sweep away the mill-dam of his grief. Bursting
          and overleaping every obstacle, it shall overflood all his sorrows
          till they are drowned and covered up, and shall not be mentioned any
          more for ever. "Wherein we greatly rejoice." Come, thou Christian!
          thou art depressed and cast down. Think for a moment. Thou art chosen
          of God and precious. Let the bell of election ring in thine ear --
          that ancient Sabbath bell of the covenant; and let thy name be heard
          in its notes and say, I beseech thee, say, "Doth not this make thee
          greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, thou art in
          heaviness through manifold temptations?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, you will see another reason. The apostle says that we are
          "elect through sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and
          sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ," -- "wherein we greatly
          rejoice." Is the obedience of the Lord Jesus Christ girt about my
          loins, to be my beauty and my glorious dress; and is the blood of
          Jesus sprinkled upon me, to take away all my guilt and all my sin and
          shall I not in this greatly rejoice? What shall there be in all the
          depressions of spirits that can possibly come upon me that shall make
          me break my harp, even though I should for a moment hang it upon the
          willows? Do I not expect that yet again my songs shall mount to
          heaven; and even now through the thick darkness do not the sparks of
          my joy appear, when I remember that I have still upon me the blood of
          Jesus, and still about me the glorious righteousness of the Messiah?
        </p>
        <p>
          But the great and cheering comfort of the apostle is, that we are
          elect unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that
          fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for us. And here, brethren, is the
          grand comfort of the Christian. When the child of God is sore-stricken
          and much depressed, the sweet hope, that living or dying, there is an
          inheritance incorruptible, reserved in heaven for him, may indeed make
          him greatly rejoice. He is drawing near the gates of death, and his
          spirit is in heaviness, for he has to leave behind him all his family
          and all that life holds dear. Besides, his sickness brings upon him
          naturally a depression of spirit. But you sit by his bedside, and you
          begin to talk to him of the
        </p>
        <p>"Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,</p>
        <p>Arrayed in living green."</p>
        <p>
          You tell him of Canaan on the other side the Jordan -- of the land
          that floweth with milk and honey -- of the Lamb in the midst of the
          throne, and of all the glories which God hath prepared for them that
          love him; and you see his dull leaden eye light up with seraphic
          brightness, he shakes off his heaviness, and he begins to sing,
        </p>
        <p>"On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,</p>
        <p>And cast a wishful eye,</p>
        <p>To Canaan's fair and happy land,</p>
        <p>Where my possessions lie"</p>
        <p>
          This makes him greatly rejoice; and if to that you add that possibly
          before he has passed the gates of death his Master may appear -- if
          you tell him that the Lord Jesus Christ is coming in the clouds of
          heaven, and though we have not seen him yet believing in him we
          rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory, expecting the second
          advent -- if he has grace to believe in that sublime doctrine, he will
          be ready to clap his hands upon his bed of weariness and cry, "Even
          so, Lord Jesus, come quickly! come quickly!"
        </p>
        <p>
          And in drawing to a close, I may notice, there is one more doctrine
          that will always cheer a Christian, and I think that this perhaps is
          the one chiefly intended here in the text. Look at the end of the 15th
          verse; "Reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God
          through faith unto salvation;" This perhaps will be one of the
          greatest cordials to a Christian in heaviness, that he is not kept by
          his own power, but by the power of God, and that he is not left in his
          own keeping, but he is kept by the Most High. Ah! what should you and
          I do in the day when darkness gathers round our faith, if we had to
          keep ourselves! I can never understand what an Arminian does, when he
          gets into sickness, sorrow, and affliction; from what well he draws
          his comfort, I know not; but I know whence I draw mine. It is this.
          "When flesh and heart faileth, God is the strength of my life, and my
          portion for ever." "I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded
          that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against
          that day." But take away that doctrine of the Saviour's keeping his
          people, and where is my hope? What is there in the gospel worth my
          preaching, or worth your receiving? I know that he hath said, "I give
          unto my sheep eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall
          any man pluck them out of my hand." What, Lord, but suppose they
          should grow faint -- that they should begin to murmur in their
          affliction. Shall they not perish then? No, they shall never perish.
          But suppose the pain should grow so hot that their faith should fail:
          shall they not perish then? No, "they shall not perish, neither shall
          any man pluck them out of my hand." But suppose their sense should
          seem to wander, and some should try to pervert them from the faith:
          shall they not be perverted? No; "they shall never perish," But
          suppose in some hour of their extremity hell and the world and their
          own fears should all beset them, and they should have no power to
          stand -- no power whatever to resist the fierce onslaughts of the
          enemy, shall they not perish then? No, they are "kept by the power of
          God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed," and they
          shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand."
          Ah! this is the doctrine, the cheering assurance "wherein we greatly
          rejoice, though now for a season, if needs be, we are in heaviness
          through manifold temptations."
        </p>
        <p>
          One word before I send you away. There are some of you here to whom
          this precious passage has not a word to say. Our heaviness, O
          worldling, "our heaviness is but for a season." Your heaviness is to
          come; and it shall be a heaviness intolerable, because hopelessly
          everlasting. Our temptations, though they be manifold, are but light
          afflictions and are but for a moment," and they "work out for us a far
          more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;" but your joys that you
          now have are evanescent as a bubble, and they are passing away, and
          they are working out for you a far more exceeding and eternal weight
          of misery. I beseech you, look at this matter. Search and see whether
          all be right with your spirits -- whether it be well for you to
          venture into an eternal state as you are; and may God give you grace,
          that you may feel your need of a Saviour, that you may seek Christ,
          lay hold upon him, and so may come into a gracious state, wherein ye
          shall greatly rejoice, even though for a season, if needs be, ye
          should be in heaviness through manifold temptations!<br />
