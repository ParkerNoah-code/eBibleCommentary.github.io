          28 And they joined themselves to Baal-peor The prophet tells us that
          the Jews, after they had been threatened with very awful punishment,
          very soon fell into a new species of apostasy. Some think, that they
          are indirectly accused of falling away to the superstitions of the
          Midianites, in consequence of having been imposed upon by female
          intrigue. This, it is well known, was the design of Balaam, as soon as
          he knew that he was forbidden by God to curse the people. His counsel
          to king Balak was to set the daughters of Moab before the people, to
          entice them by their allurements to the practice of idolatry,
        </p>
        <p>
          "Behold, these women caused the children of Israel, through the
          counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter
          of Peor." Numbers 31:16
        </p>
        <p>
          And as the idolatry here mentioned originated from carnal intrigues,
          some expositors are of opinion, that on this account the prophet
          charges the people with the commission of a twofold trespass, in their
          not only being inveigled by the Midianitish women, but also in binding
          themselves by another bond to Baal-peor, (Numbers 25) Be that as it
          may, the prophet exclaims against the perfidy of his own nation,
          because in forsaking the true worship of God, they had broken that
          holy union by which they had been betrothed to him. For we know, that
          as God adopts the Church as his spouse, when she gives herself up to
          idolatry, she no less shamefully violates her fidelity, than when a
          wife leaves her husband, and becomes an adulteress. It is well known,
          that Baal-peor was the idol of the Midianites; but it is not so well
          known how he received this appellation. The word vl, Baal, has a
          signification equivalent to lord, master, or patron. And since phr,
          paar, signifies to open, some render it the God of opening, and assign
          as a reason, which, however, I dare not affirm, their shamefully
          exposing themselves in his presence. Perhaps it is the name of some
          place, for we know that the heathens often gave to their idols the
          names of the countries where they were worshipped. We now perceive the
          prophet's meaning, That the Jews had wickedly revolted from God, and
          defiled themselves in joining themselves to Baal-peor. In saying that
          they ate the sacrifices of the dead, he points out the greater
          baseness of their offense. By the sacrifices of idols, he means that
          they ate things that were offered to idols, as they had been wont to
          partake of those sacrifices which bound them to the true God, the
          inexhaustible fountain of life. Hence their conduct was the more
          detestable, when they wilfully gave themselves over to death by
          perpetrating such a heinous crime. And we know, that banqueting was to
          some extent connected with their worship. The result of this was,
          that, renouncing the true God, they joined themselves in marriage with
          the dead; and thus the prophet charges them with acting a very
          disgraceful part, in not only bowing the knee to Baal, and offering
          sacrifices to him, but also in feasting upon these sacrifices.
        </p>
        <p>
          29. And they provoked God to anger. The prophet once more informs us,
          that they had been put upon their guard by another plague, in order
          that it might appear that God had always a strict regard for his own
          glory, in chastising the people; but as they were not bettered by
          these plagues, these chastisements were fruitless. Having formerly
          stated, that God's wrath had been appeased by the prayers of Moses, he
          now says, that the plague had been arrested or ceased by means of the
          kind interposition of Phinehas. Some render the word phll, pillel, to
          pray; but the other rendering, to execute justice, is more in
          accordance with the context; namely, that by his zeal in executing
          justice upon the profligates, he turned away God's vengeance from the
          Israelites. He stood up therefore, that is, he rose up or interposed,
          when all others maintained a careless indifference. As the Jews were
          sensible that it was by the kind intervention of one man that the
          plague was now healed, their obstinacy was the less excusable in not
          even then ceasing to sin. We must not forget that all these things are
          addressed to us. For when God from time to time chastises us, and
          calls upon us to repent by setting before us the example of others,
          how few profit by his corrections! Moreover, it deserves to be
          noticed, that the plague ceased at the very time when Phinehas
          executed justice. From this we may learn, that the most effectual way
          to quench the fire of God's anger, is when the sinner willingly sits
          in judgment upon himself for the punishment of his own transgressions;
          as Paul says, 1 Corinthians 11:31,
        </p>
        <p>
          "If we would judge ourselves, verily we would not be judged of the
          Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          And surely God confers no small honor upon us, in placing the
          punishment of our sins within our reach. At the same time, it must be
          observed, that on that occasion the plague ceased in consequence of
          the punishment of a single person, because the people then shrunk from
          the abominable wickedness to which they had been addicted.
        </p>
        <p>
          31. And that deed was imputed The prophet, in thus praising one
          individual, heaps reproach upon the whole body of the people. For we
          infer from this token of approbation with which the Holy Spirit
          condescended to stamp the excellent action of Phinehas, how very base
          their conduct must have been. Neither was this honor reserved for him
          alone, but his posterity were to enjoy it throughout their succeeding
          generations. In order, therefore, to cast the greater reproach upon
          the people, Phinehas alone is contrasted with them. Some may be
          disposed to inquire, how the zeal of a single individual, overstepping
          the boundaries of his calling, taking a sword and executing justice,
          could be approved of God? For it would seem, as if he had ventured
          upon this action without due consideration. I answer, that the saints
          have sometimes been under peculiar and extraordinary impulses, which
          ought not to be estimated by the ordinary standard of actions. When
          Moses slew the Egyptian, (Exodus 2:12) though not yet called by God to
          be the deliverer of Israel, and while he was not yet invested with the
          power of the sword, it is certain, that he was moved by the invisible
          and internal impulse of God to undertake that deed. Phinehas was moved
          by a similar impulse. No one indeed imagined that he was armed with
          the sword of God, yet he was conscious to himself of being moved by a
          heavenly influence in this matter. And hence it is to be observed,
          that the common mode and order of calling which God adopts, does not
          prevent him, whenever it seems proper, to stir up his elect by the
          secret influence of the Spirit to the performance of praiseworthy
          deeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          But a more difficult question still remains, How that one action could
          be imputed to Phinehas for righteousness? Paul proves that men are
          justified by faith alone, because it is written,
        </p>
        <p>
          "Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness,"
          Romans 4:3
        </p>
        <p>
          In Genesis 15:6, Moses employs the same word. If the same thing may be
          said respecting works, the reasoning of Paul will be not only feeble,
          but frivolous. First of all, let us examine, whether or not Phinehas
          was justified on account of this deed alone. Verily the law, though it
          could justify, by no means promises salvation to any one work, but
          makes justification to consist in the perfect observance of all the
          commandments. It remains, therefore, that we affirm, that the work of
          Phinehas was imputed to him for righteousness, in the same way as God
          imputes the works of the faithful to them for righteousness, not in
          consequence of any intrinsic merit which they possess, but of his own
          free and unmerited grace. And as it thus appears, that the perfect
          observance of the law alone (which is done no where) constitutes
          righteousness, all men must prostrate themselves with confusion of
          face before God's judgment-seat. Besides, were our works strictly
          examined, they would be found to be mingled with much imperfection. We
          have, therefore, no other source than to flee for refuge to the free
          unmerited mercy of God. And not only do we receive righteousness by
          grace through faith, but as the moon borrows her light from the sun,
          so does the same faith render our works righteous, because our
          corruptions being mortified, they are reckoned to us for
          righteousness. In short, faith alone, and not human merit, procures
          both for persons and for works the character of righteousness. I now
          return to Paul. And it is not from a single expression, that he argues
          that we are justified freely, and by faith only, but he assumes higher
          principles, to which I lately referred, that all men are destitute of
          righteousness, until God reconcile them to himself by the blood of
          Christ; and that faith is the means by which pardon and reconciliation
          are obtained, because justification by works is no where to be
          obtained. Hence he very properly concludes, that we are justified by
          faith alone. But righteousness by works is as it were subordinate (as
          they say) to the righteousness just mentioned, while works possess no
          value in themselves, excepting, and as far as, out of pure
          benevolence, God imputes them to us for righteousness.<br />
