          17. As he loved cursing, so let it come upon him: as he did not take
          delight in blessing, so let it be far from him.18. And let him be
          clothed with cursing as with a garment, and let it come as water into
          his bowels, and as oil into his bones. 19. Let it be to him as a
          mantle to cover him, and a girdle to gird himself with continually.20.
          Let this be the work from Jehovah of those who are hostile to me, and
          of those who speak evil against my soul.

          17 As he loved cursing David still continues to enumerate the sins of
          his adversaries, and is thus severe in his treatment of them, in order
          to render it more apparent, that he is strictly conforming to the
          judgment of God. For as often as we draw near to the tribunal of God,
          we must take care that the equity of our cause may be so sure and
          evident as to secure for it and us a favorable reception from him.
          Fortified by the testimony of an approving conscience, David here
          declares his readiness to commit the matter between him and his
          enemies to the judgment of God. The words, which are expressive of
          cursing and blessing, are in the past tense, cursing came upon him,
          and blessing was far from him, but it is necessary to translate them
          as expressive of a wish or desire; for David continues to pray that
          his enemy may be visited with the same unparalleled ills which he had
          inflicted upon others. A stranger to every act of kindness, and taking
          pleasure in doing evil, it is the wish of the Psalmist that he may now
          be subjected to every species of calamity. Some take malediction to
          mean cursing and imprecation, thereby intimating that this man was so
          addicted to execration, that mischief and malevolence were constantly
          in his heart, and proceeding from his lips. While I do not reject this
          opinion, I am yet disposed to take a more extended view of the
          passage, That by injury and abuse, he aimed at the suppression and
          abolition of every mark of kindness, and that he took delight in the
          calamities which he beheld coming upon the unsuspecting and the good.

          Not a few interpreters translate the next two verses in the past form,
          he clothed himself with cursing, etc., which would be tantamount to
          saying that the enemy was as fond of cursing as of costly apparel, or
          that he clothed himself with it as with a garment, and that, like an
          inveterate disease, it was deeply seated in the marrow of his bones.
          The other interpretation is more simple, That cursing should cleave to
          the wicked, that it should envelop him like a cloak, gird him about as
          his girdle, and should even penetrate to his bones. And that no one
          may rashly take for an example what David here spoke by the special
          influence of the Holy Spirit, let him keep in mind that the Psalmist
          is not pleading here in reference to any personal interest, and that
          it is no ordinary character to whom he refers. Belonging to the number
          of the faithful, he would not omit the law of charity, in desiring the
          salvation of all men. But in this instance God elevated his spirit
          above all earthly considerations, stript him of all malice, and
          delivered him from the influence of turbulent passion, so that he
          might, with holy calmness and spiritual wisdom, doom the reprobate and
          castaway to destruction. Others, would have the phrase, he loved
          cursing, to mean that he purposely drew down the vengeance of God upon
          himself, as it were procuring destruction for himself by his open
          hostility to him; but this is an unnatural construction of the
          passage. The interpretation which I have given is preferable, That he
          was so addicted to mischief and wrong, that no act of justice or
          kindness was to be expected from him. In the meantime, let it be
          observed, that all the machinations of the wicked will eventually
          recoil upon their own heads, and that when they are raging more
          violently against others, then it is that the mischief, which they so
          eagerly desire may come upon them, falls upon themselves, even as the
          wind called Cecias by blowing attracts the clouds unto him.

          20 Let this be the work from Jehovah. That is, let the gain or reward
          of the work be from God. In pointing out the work as proceeding
          immediately from God, he intends to show that, though deprived of all
          human aid, he yet entertained the hope that God would grant him
          deliverance, and avenge the injuries of his servant. From this verse
          we learn that David did not rashly, or unadvisedly, utter curses
          against his enemies, but strictly adhered to what the Spirit dictated.
          I acknowledge, indeed, that not a few, while they pretend a similar
          confidence and hope, nevertheless, recklessly rush beyond the bounds
          of temperance and moderation. But that which David beheld by the
          unclouded eye of faith, he also uttered with a zeal becoming a sound
          mind; for having devoted himself to the cultivation of piety, and
          being protected by the hand of God, he was aware that the day was
          approaching when his enemies would meet with merited punishment. From
          which we also learn, that his trust was placed in God alone, and that
          he did not regard the persons of men so as to direct his course
          according as the world smiled or frowned upon him. And, assuredly,
          whosoever places his dependence on men, shall find that the most
          trifling incident will annoy him. Therefore, should the whole world
          abandon us, it becomes us, in imitation of this holy man, to lift up
          our heads to heaven, and thence look for our defender and deliverer.
          If it be his intention to employ human instrumentality for our
          deliverance, he will soon raise up those who will accomplish his
          purpose. Should he, for the trial of our faith, deprive us of all
          earthly assistance, instead of regarding that as any reflection upon
          the glory of his name, we ought to wait until the proper time arrive
          when he will fully display that decision in which we can calmly
          acquiesce.<br />
