Â </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">I am finally able to present the Christian public with 
    another part of The Treasury of David. It has demanded more labor than its 
    predecessors, but that labor has been freely given. <i>To the best of my 
    ability, I have kept this volume up to the same level of quality as the 
    earlier ones</i>. In producing this exposition, I would rather be long than 
    lax. I know from experience the disappointment that comes to readers when, 
    after a promising beginning, they see a serious decline toward the end. </p>
<p align="justify">The acceptance given this commentary has placed me under 
    a heavy obligation to do my best; and toward that end I am continuing with 
    all possible diligence. It is with great pleasure that I look forward to 
    publishing the seventh and last volume of this work. Many labors distract me 
    from this favorite employment, but I hope to press on with more speed if God 
    spares my life. It would be foolhardy to make a guarantee, for the most 
    fragile Venice glass is less brittle than life:</p>
<p align="justify">The spider's most attenuated thread<br/>
    Is cord, is cable, to the tender film<br/>
    Which holds our soul in life.</p>
<p align="justify">I have been longer on this portion of my task because I 
    have been bewildered at the expanse of Psalm 119, which makes up the bulk of 
    this particular volume. Its dimensions and depth overcame me. It spread out 
    before me like a vast, rolling prairie in which I could see no boundary, and 
    this alone created a feeling of dismay. Its expanse was unbroken by hill or 
    shore line, and so it threatened to be a monotonous task, although that fear 
    has not been realized. </p>
<p align="justify">This marvelous poem seemed like a great sea of holy 
    teaching; it moved its many verses wave upon wave without an island of 
    special and remarkable statement to break it up. I hesitated to launch on 
    it. </p>
<p align="justify">Other Psalms have been mere lakes, but this is the 
    largest ocean. It is a continent of sacred thought. Every inch is as fertile 
    as the garden of the Lord. It is an amazing level of abundance, a mighty 
    stretch of harvest fields. I have now crossed the great plain, not without 
    both persevering and pleasurable toil. </p>
<p align="justify">Several great authors have traveled this region, justify 
    their tracks, and made the journey easier for me. Yet to me and my helpers, 
    it has been no small feat of patient authorship and research. </p>
<p align="justify">This great Psalm is a book in itself. Instead of one 
    among many Psalms, it is worthy to be published alone as <i>a Poem of 
    unsurpassed excellence</i>. Those who have never studied it may pronounce it 
    commonplace and complain of its repetitions. But to the thoughtful student, 
    it is a great deep, too full to be measured and so varied as to never weary 
    the eye. Its depth is as great as its length. Its mystery is concealed 
    beneath the simplest statements. May I say that it is experience allowed to 
    prattle, to preach, to praise, and to pray like a child-prophet in his 
    father's house?</p>
<p align="justify">My venerable friend, Mr. Rogers, has been spared to help 
    me with his admirable suggestions. But Mr. Gibson, who so industriously 
    translated from the Latin authors, has fallen asleep leaving copious notes. 
    Aid in the homiletic department has been given by several ministers who were 
    educated at the Pastor's College. Their names are appended to the hints and 
    skeletons that they have supplied. In this department, the present volume is 
    superior to the previous ones; if it proves to be really useful, my desire 
    is fulfilled. I know so well the use of a homiletic hint when searching 
    subject, so I have felt a special pleasure in supplying my readers with a 
    full measure of these <i>helps</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">In hunting rare authors and in making extracts, Mr. Keys 
    has given me great assistance. I am also a debtor to others who have 
    cheerfully given me service when I have sought it. Burdened with the care of 
    many institutions and the oversight of a large church, I cannot do justice 
    to my theme. <i>Learned leisure </i>would be far more accurate than my busy 
    pen can ever hope to be. If I had nothing else to think of, I would have 
    thought of nothing else, and undivided energies could have accomplished at 
    spare strength can never perform. Therefore, I am glad for the help, so glad 
    that I am happy to acknowledge it. Not only in this but also in all other 
    labors, I first owe all to God and, second, very, very much to those 
    generous friends who are happy in making my efforts successful.</p>
<p align="justify">Above all, I trust that the Holy Spirit has been with me 
    in writing and compiling these volumes. I expect that He will bless them in 
    a way that the unrenewed will be converted and believers edified. This 
    writing has been a means of grace to my heart. I have enjoyed what I have 
    prepared for my readers. The Book of Psalms has been a royal banquet. 
    Feasting on its contents, I have seemed to eat the food of angels. </p>
<p align="justify">It is no wonder that old writers called it by many names, 
    such as: the school of patience, the soul's soliloquies, the little Bible, 
    the anatomy of conscience, the rose garden and the pearl island. It is the 
    Paradise of devotion, the Holy Land of poetry, the heart of Scripture, the 
    map of experience, and the tongue of saints. </p>
<p align="justify">It speaks feelings that otherwise find no expression. 
    Does it not say just what we wished to say? Are not its prayers and praises 
    exactly what our hearts delight in? </p>
<p align="justify">No one needs better company than the Psalms. There, you 
    may read and commune with friends human and divine with friends who know the 
    heart of man toward God and the heart of God toward man, with friends who 
    perfectly sympathize with us and our sorrows, with friends who never betray 
    or forsake. Oh, to be shut up in a cave with David, with no other occupation 
    but to hear him sing and to sing with him! Well might a Christian monarch 
    lay aside his crown for such enjoyment, or a believing pauper find a crown 
    in such bliss. </p>
<p align="justify">It is feared that the Psalms today are not as prized as 
    in the early church. Time was when the Psalms were not only repeated daily 
    in all the churches but were so universally sung that the illiterate knew 
    them, even if they did not know the letters which they were written. Time 
    was when bishops would ordain no one to the ministry unless they knew 
    "David" from end to end and could correctly repeat each Psalm. Church 
    councils have decreed that no one could hold ecclesiastical office unless 
    that person had memorized the Psalter. Other practices of those ages are 
    best forgotten but this memory leaves an honorable record. </p>
<p align="justify">Jerome tells us that the labors sang Hallelujah while he 
    plowed, that the tired reaper refreshed himself with the Psalms, and that 
    the vine-dresser, while trimming the vines with his curved hook, sang 
    something of David. He tells us that in his part of the world, the Psalms 
    were the Christian's ballads. Could they have had better? They were the love 
    songs of God's people. Could any others be so pure and heavenly? These 
    sacred hymns express all moods of holy feeling. They are proper for 
    childhood and old age; they furnish maxims for entrance into life and serve 
    as watchwords at the gates of death. The battle of life, the Sabbath rest, 
    the hospital bed, the guest room of a mansion, the church, the oratory, yes, 
    even Heaven itself may be entered with Psalms.</p>
<p align="justify">My next portion will continue the <i>Pilgrim Psalms</i>, 
    of which five are in this volume. I regret having to break these golden 
    steps. My preference was to present the glittering ascent in one volume, so 
    that all might see at a glance "the stairs of the City of David at the 
    ascent of the wall." Yet the book must be divided somewhere, and as there 
    was no convenient place, I was compelled to separate these Songs of the 
    Steps, or "Songs of the High Key," as Luther calls them. It was impossible 
    to cut the great Psalm in two; it is a far lesser evil to separate the 
    members of a group. I trust the arrangement will not cause serious 
    inconvenience or prevent meditating on each Song of Degrees, not only as it 
    sparkles as a separate star, but also as it shines in its own constellation.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, when I reach the last Psalm, it is my firm 
    conviction that I will find no truer closing words than those of Bishop 
    Horne. I take the liberty of quoting him, using his words as if they were my 
    own, for they admirably express my present feelings and experiences.</p>
<p align="justify">"If the author could flatter himself that anyone would 
    take half the pleasure in reading the following exposition as he had in 
    writing it, he would not fear the loss of his labor. The work detached him 
    from the bustle and hurry of life, the din of politics, and the noise of 
    folly. Vanity and vexation flew for a season, and care and unrest did not 
    come near his dwelling. He rose as fresh as the morning to his task. The 
    silence of the night invited him to pursue it, and he can truly say that 
    food and rest were not preferred to it. Every Psalm improved infinitely on 
    his acquaintance with it, and no Psalm made him uneasy, except for the last, 
    when he grieved that his work was done. Happier hours than those that have 
    been spent on the meditations of the songs of Zion, he never expects to see 
    in this world. Pleasantly, they passed and moved smoothly and swiftly along, 
    and when so engaged, he did not count time. The meditations are gone, but 
    they have left a relish and a fragrance on the mind, and the memory of them 
    is sweet."</p>
