        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.76)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, April 27, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>On behalf of the Baptist Missionary Society.</p>
        <p>
          "And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region." --
          Acts 13:49.
        </p>
        <p>
          I SHALL not confine myself to the text. It being an old custom to take
          texts when we preach, I have taken one, but I shall address you, at
          large, upon a subject which I am sure will occupy your attention, and
          has done for many days and years past -- the subject of gospel
          missions. We feel persuaded that all of you are of one mind in this
          matter, that it is the absolute duty as well as the eminent privilege
          of the Church to proclaim the gospel to the world. We do not conceive
          that God will do his own work without instruments, but that, as he has
          always employed means in the work of the regeneration of this world,
          he will still continue to do the same, and that it becomes the Church
          to do its utmost to spread the truth wherever it can reach the ear of
          man. We have not two opinions on that point. Some churches may have,
          but we have not. Our doctrines, although they are supposed to lead to
          apathy and sloth, have always proved themselves to be eminently
          practical; the fathers of the mission were all zealous lovers of the
          doctrines of the grace of God; and we believe, the great supporters of
          missionary enterprise, if it is to be successful, must always come
          from those who hold God's truth firmly and boldly, and yet have fire
          and zeal with it, and desire to spread it everywhere. But there is a
          point on which we have great division of opinion, and that is as to
          the reason why we have had so little success in our missionary
          labours. There may be some who say the success has been proportionate
          to the agency, and that we could not have been more successful. I am
          far from being of their opinion, and I do not think they themselves
          would express it on their knees before Almighty God. We have not been
          successful to the extent we might have expected, certainly not to an
          apostolic extent, certainly with nothing like the success of Paul or
          Peter, or even of those imminent men who have preceded us in modern
          times, and who were able to evangelize whole countries, turning
          thousands to God. Now, what is the reason of this? Perhaps we may turn
          our eyes on high, and think we find that reason in the sovereignty of
          God, which hath withholden his Spirit, and hath not poured out his
          grace as aforetime. I shall be prepared to grant all men may say on
          that point, for I believe in the ordination of everything by Almighty
          God. I believe in a present God in our defeats as well as in our
          successes; a God as well in the motionless air as in the careering
          tempest; a God of ebbs as well as a God of floods. But still we must
          look at home for the cause. When Zion travails, she brings forth
          children; when Zion is in earnest, God is in earnest about his work;
          when Zion is prayerful, God blesses her. We must not, therefore,
          arbitrarily look for the cause of our failure in the will of God, but
          we must also see what is the difference between ourselves and the men
          of Apostolic times, and what it is that renders our success so
          trifling in comparison with the tremendous results of Apostolic
          preaching. I think I shall be able to show one or two reasons why our
          holy faith is not so prosperous as it was then. In the first place, we
          have not Apostolic men; in the second place, they do not set about
          their work in an Apostolic style; in the third place, we have not
          Apostolic churches to back them up; and in the fourth place, we have
          not the Apostolic influence of the Holy Ghost. in the measure which
          they had it in ancient times.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, WE HAVE FEW APOSTOLIC MEN IN THESE TIMES. I will not say we
          have none; here and there we may have one or two, but unhappily their
          names are never heard; they do not start out before the world, and are
          not noted as preachers of God's truth. We had a Williams once, a true
          apostle, who went from island to island, not counting his life dear
          unto him; but Williams is called to his reward. We had a Knibb, who
          toiled for his Master with seraphic earnestness, and was not ashamed
          to call an oppressed slave his brother; but Knibb, too, has entered
          into his rest. We have one or two still remaining, precious and
          treasured names; we love them fervently, and our prayers shall ever
          rise to heaven on their behalf. We always say, in our prayers, "God
          bless such men as Moffat! God bless those who are earnestly toiling
          and successfully labouring!" But cast your eyes around, and where can
          we find many such men? They are all good men; we find no fault with
          them; they are better than we; we, ourselves, shrink into nothingness
          compared with them; but we must still say of them that they are less
          than their fathers, they differ from the mighty Apostles in many
          respects, which we think even they would not be slow to own. I am not
          speaking of missionaries only, but of ministers too; for I take it we
          have as much to mourn over in regard to the spread of the gospel in
          England as in foreign lands, and much to regret the lack of men filled
          with the Holy Ghost and with fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, we have not men with Apostolic zeal. Converted in
          a most singular way, by a direct interposition from heaven, Paul, from
          that time forward became an earnest man. He had always been earnest,
          in his sin and in his persecutions; but after he heard that voice from
          heaven, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" and had received the
          mighty office of an apostle, and had been sent forth a chosen vessel
          to the Gentiles, you can scarce conceive the deep, the awful
          earnestness which he manifested. Whether he did eat, or drink, or
          whatsoever he did, he did all for the glory of his God; he never
          wasted an hour; he was employing his time either in ministering with
          his own hands unto his necessities, or else lifting those hands in the
          Synagogue, on Mars-hill, or anywhere where he could command the
          attention of the multitude. His zeal was so earnest, and so burning,
          that he could not (as we unfortunately do) restrain himself within a
          little sphere; but he preached the Word everywhere. It was not enough
          for him to have it handed down that he was the Apostle of Pisidia, but
          he must go also to Pamphylia; it was not enough that he should be the
          great preacher of Pamphylia and Pisidia, but he must go also to
          Attalia; and when he had preached throughout all Asia, he must needs
          take ship to Greece, and preach there also. I believe not once only
          did Paul hear in his dream the men of Macedonia saying, "Come over and
          help us," but every day and hour he heard the cry in his ears from
          multitudes of souls, "Paul, Paul, come over and help us." He could not
          restrain himself from preaching. "Woe is unto me" he said "if I preach
          not the gospel. God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of
          Christ." Oh! if you could have seen Paul preach, you would not have
          gone away as you do from some of us, with half a conviction, that we
          do not mean what we say. His eyes preached a sermon without his lips,
          and his lips preached it, not in a cold and frigid manner, but every
          word fell with an overwhelming power upon the hearts of his hearers.
          He preached with power, because he was in downright earnest. You had a
          conviction, when you saw him, that he was a man who felt he had a work
          to do and must do it, and could not contain himself unless he did do
          it. He was the kind of preacher whom you would expect to see walk down
          the pulpit stairs straight into his coffin, and then stand before his
          God, ready for his last account. Where are the men like that man? I
          confess I cannot claim that privilege, and I seldom hear a solitary
          sermon which comes up to the mark in earnest, deep, passionate longing
          for the souls of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have no eyes now like the eyes of the Saviour, which could weep
          over Jerusalem; we have few voices like that earnest impassioned voice
          which seemed perpetually to cry, "Come unto me, and I will give you
          rest." "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thee
          as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye would not." If
          ministers of the gospel were more hearty in their work of preaching;
          if, instead of giving lectures and devoting a large part of their time
          to literary and political pursuits, they would preach the Word of God,
          and preach it as if they were pleading for their own lives, ah! then,
          my brethren, we might expect great success; but we cannot expect it
          while we go about our work in a half-hearted way, and have not that
          zeal, that earnestness, that deep purpose which characterized those
          men of old.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, again, I take it we have not men in our days who can preach like
          Paul -- as to their faith. What did Paul do? He went to Philippi; did
          he know a soul there? Not one. He had his Master's truth, and he
          believed in the power of it. He was unattended and devoid of pomp, or
          show, or parade; he did not go to a pulpit with a soft cushion in it
          to address a respectable congregation, but he walked through the
          streets and began to preach to the people. He went to Corinth, to
          Athens, alone, single-handed, to tell the people the gospel of the
          blessed God. Why? Because he had faith in the gospel and believed it
          would save souls, and hurl down idols from their thrones. He had no
          doubt about the power of the gospel; but now-a-days, my brethren, we
          have not faith in the gospel we preach. How many there are who preach
          gospel, which they are afraid will not save souls; and, therefore,
          they add little bits of their own to it in order, as they think, to
          win men to Christ! We have known men who believed Calvinistic
          doctrines, but who preached Calvinism in the morning and Arminianism
          in the evening, because they were afraid God's gospel would not
          convert sinners, so they would manufacture one of their own. I hold
          that a man who does not believe his gospel to be able to save men's
          souls, does not believe it all. If God's truth will not save men's
          souls, man's lies cannot; if God's truth will not turn men to
          repentance, I am sure there is nothing in this world that can. When we
          believe the gospel to be powerful, then we shall see it is powerful.
          If I walk into this pulpit, and say, "I know what I preach is true,"
          the world says I am an egotist. "The young man is dogmatical." Ay, and
          the young man means to be; he glories in it, he keeps it to himself as
          one of his peculiar titles, for he does most firmly believe what he
          preaches. God forbid that I should ever come tottering up the pulpit
          stairs to teach anything I was not quite sure of, something which I
          hoped might save sinners, but of which I was not exactly certain. When
          I have faith in my doctrines, those doctrines will prevail, for
          confidence is the winner of the palm. He who hath courage enough to
          grasp the standard, and hold it up, will be sure enough to find
          followers. He who says, "I know," and asserts it boldly in his
          Master's name, without disputing, will not be long before he will find
          men who will listen to what he says, and who will say, "This man
          speaks with authority, and not as the Scribes and Pharisees." That is
          one reason why we do not succeed: we have not faith in the gospel. We
          send educated men to India in order to confound the learned Brahmins.
          Nonsense! Let the Brahmins say what they like, have we any business to
          dispute with them? "Oh, but they are so intellectual and so clever."
          What have we to do with that? We are not to seek to be clever in order
          to meet them. Leave the men of the world to combat their metaphysical
          errors; we have merely to say, "This is truth: he that believeth it
          shall be saved, and he that denieth it shall be damned." We have no
          right to come down from the high ground of divine authoritative
          testimony; and until we maintain that ground, and come out as we ought
          to do, girded with the belt of divinity -- preaching not what may be
          true, but asserting that which God has most certainly revealed -- we
          shall not see success. We want a deeper faith in our gospel; we want
          to be quite sure of what we preach. Brethren, I take it we have not
          the faith of our fathers. I feel myself a poor drivelling thing in
          point of faith. Why, methought sometimes I could believe anything; but
          now a little difficulty comes before me, I am timid, and I fear. It is
          when I preach with unbelief in my heart that I preach unsuccessfully;
          but when I preach with faith and can say, "I know my God has said,
          that in the self-same hour he will give me what I shall preach, and
          careless of man's esteem, I preach what I believe to be true," then it
          is that God owns faith and crowns it with his own crown.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: we have not enough self-denial, and that is one reason why we
          do not prosper. Far be it from me to say aught against the self-denial
          of those worthy brethren who have left their country to cross the
          stormy deep and preach the Word. We hold them to be men who are to be
          had in honour; but still I ask, where is the self-denial of the
          Apostles now-a-days? I think one of the greatest disgraces that ever
          was cast upon the church in these days was that last mission to
          Ireland. Men went over to Ireland, but like men who have valour's
          better part, brave bold men, they came back again, which is about all
          we can say of the matter. Why do they not go there again? Why, they
          say the Irish "hooted" at them. Now, don't you think you see Paul
          taking a microscope out of his pocket, and looking at the little man
          who should say to him, "I shall not go there to preach because the
          Irish hooted me?" "What!" he says, "is this a preacher? -- what a
          small edition of a minister he must be, to be sure!" "Oh! but they
          threw stones at us; you have no idea how badly they treated us!" Just
          tell that to the Apostle Paul. I am sure you would be ashamed to do
          so. "Oh! but in some places the police interfered, and said that we
          should only create a riot." What would Paul have said to that? The
          police interfering! I did not know that we had any right to care about
          governments. Our business is to preach the Word, and if we must be put
          in the stocks there let us lie; there would come no hurt of it at
          last. "Oh! but they might have killed some of us." That is just it.
          Where is that zeal which counted not its life dear so that it might
          win Christ? I believe that the killing of a few of our ministers would
          have prospered Christianity. However we might mourn over it, and none
          more than myself, I say the murder of a dozen of them would have been
          no greater ground for grief than the slaughter of our men by hundreds
          in a successful fight for hearths and homes. I would count my own
          blood most profitably shed in so holy a struggle. How did the gospel
          prosper aforetime? Were there not some who laid down their lives for
          it; and did not others walk to victory over their slain bodies; and
          must it not be so now? If we are to start back because we are afraid
          of being killed, heaven knows when the gospel is to spread over the
          world -- we do not. What have other missionaries done? Have they not
          braved death in its direst forms, and preached the Word amid countless
          dangers? My brethren, we say again, we find no fault, for we,
          ourselves, might err in the same manner; but we are sure we are
          therein not like Paul. He went to a place where they stoned him with
          stones, and dragged him out as dead. Did he say, "Now for the future I
          will not go where they will ill-treat me?" No, for he says, "Of the
          Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. Thrice was I beaten
          with rods, thrice I suffered shipwreck." I am sure we have not the
          self-denial of the Apostles. We are mere carpet-knights and
          Hyde-park-warriors. When I go to my own house and think how
          comfortable and happy I am, I say to myself, "How little I do for my
          Master! I am ashamed that I cannot deny myself for his truth, and go
          everywhere preaching his Word." I look with pity upon people who say
          "Do not preach so often; you will kill yourself." O my God! what would
          Paul have said to such a thing as that? "Take care of your
          constitution; you are rash; you are enthusiastic." When I compare
          myself with one of those men of old, I say, "Oh that men should be
          found calling themselves Christians, who seek to stop our work of
          faith and labour of love, for the sake of a little consideration about
          the constitution,' which gets all the stronger for the preaching of
          God's Word."
        </p>
        <p>
          But I hear some one whispering, "You ought to make a little
          allowance." My dear friend, I make all allowance. I am not finding
          fault with those brethren; they are a good sort of people; we are "all
          honorable men;" but I will only say, that in comparison with Paul, we
          are less than nothing, and vanity; little insignificant Lilliputian
          creatures, who can hardly be seen in comparison with those gigantic
          men of old.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ones of my hearers may perhaps hint that this is not the sole cause,
          and he observes, "I think you ought to make excuse, for ministers now
          cannot work miracles." Well, I have considered that too, and certainly
          it is a drawback, but, I take it, not a very great one; for if it had
          been, God would not have allowed it to exist. He gave that gift to the
          Church in its infancy, but now it needs it no longer. We mistake in
          attributing too much to miracles. What was one of them? Wherever the
          Apostles went they could speak the language of the people. Well, in
          the time it would have taken Paul to walk from here to Hindostan, we
          could learn Hindostani, and we can go over in a very little time by
          the means of travelling that are now provided: so that is no great
          gain there. Then, again, in order to make the gospel known amongst the
          people, it was necessary that miracles should be worked, so that every
          one might talk about it; but now there is a printing press to aid us.
          What I say to-day, within six months will be read across the
          Alleghanies; and so with other ministers, what they say and what they
          do can soon be printed off and distributed everywhere; so they have
          facilities for making themselves known which are not much behind the
          power of miracles. Again, we have a great advantage over the Apostles.
          Wherever they went they were persecuted, and sometimes put to death;
          but now, although occasionally we hear of the massacre of a
          missionary, the occurrence is rare enough. The slaughter of an
          Englishman anywhere would provoke a fleet of men-of-war to visit the
          offence with chastisement. The world respects an Englishman wherever
          he goes; he has the stamp of the great Caesar upon him; he is the true
          cosmopolite -- the citizen of the world. That could not be said of the
          poor despised Jews. There might be some respect paid to Paul, for he
          was a Roman citizen, but there would be none paid to the rest. We
          cannot be put to death now without a noise being made. The murder of
          two or three ministers in Ireland would provoke a tumult through the
          country; the government would have to interpose, the orderly of the
          land would be up in arms, and then we might preach with an armed
          constabulary around us, and so go through the land, provoking the
          priests, startling antichrist, and driving superstition to its dens
          for ever.

          II. In the second place, WE DO NOT GO ABOUT OUR WORK IN AN APOSTOLIC
          STYLE. How is that? Why, in the first place, there is a general
          complaint that there is not enough preaching by ministers and
          missionaries. They sit down interpreting, establishing schools, and
          doing this, that, and the other. We have nothing to find fault with in
          this; but that is not the labour to which they should devote
          themselves; their office is preaching, and if they preached more, they
          might hope for more success. The missionary Chamberlain preached once
          at a certain place, and years afterwards disciples were found there
          from that one sermon. Williams preached wherever he went, and God
          blessed him; Moffat preached wherever he went, and his labours were
          owned. Now we have our churches, our printing-presses, about which a
          great deal of money is spent. This is doing good, but it is not doing
          the good. We are not using the means which God has ordained, and we
          cannot therefore expect to prosper. Some say there is too much
          preaching now-a-days, in England. Well, it is the tendency of the
          times to decry preaching, but it is "the foolishness of preaching"
          which is to change the world. It is not for men to say, "If you
          preached less, you might study more." Study is required well enough if
          you have a settled church; but the Apostles needed no study, I
          apprehend, but they stood up and delivered out the simple cardinal
          truths of religion, not taking one text, but going through the whole
          catalogue of truth. So I think, in itinerant evangelical labours, we
          are not bound to dwell on one subject, for then we need to study, but
          we shall find it profitable to deal out the whole truth wherever we
          go. Thus we should always find words to hand, and truths ever ready to
          teach the people.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next place I conceive that a great mistake has been made in not
          affirming the divinity of our mission, and standing fast by the truth,
          as being a revelation not to be proved by men, but to be believed;
          always holding out this, "He that believeth and is baptized shall be
          saved; he that believeth not shall be damned." I am often grieved when
          I read of our missionaries holding disputes with the Brahmins, and it
          is sometimes said that the missionary has beaten the Brahmin because
          he kept his temper, and so the gospel had gained great honour by the
          dispute. I take it that the gospel was lowered by the controversy. I
          think the missionary should say, "I am come to tell you something
          which the One God of heaven and earth hath said, and I tell you before
          I announce it, that if you believe it you shall be saved, and if not,
          you shall be damned. I am come to tell you that Jesus Christ, the Son
          of God, became flesh, to die for poor unworthy man, that through his
          mediation, and death, and suffering, the people of God might be
          delivered. Now, if you will listen to me you shall hear the word of
          God: if you do not, I shake the dust of my feet against you, and go
          somewhere else." Look at the history of every imposture; it shows us
          that the claim of authority insures a degree of progress. How did
          Mahommed come to have so strong a religion in his time? He was all
          alone, and he went into the market-place and said, "I have received a
          revelation from heaven." It was a lie, but he persuaded men to believe
          it. People looked at his face; they saw that he looked upon them
          earnestly as believing what he said, and some five or six of them
          joined him. Did he prove what he said? Not he. "You must," he said,
          "believe what I say, or there is no Paradise for you." There is power
          in that kind of thing, and wherever he went his statement was
          believed, not on the ground of reasoning, but on his authority, which
          he declared to be from Allah; and in a century after he first
          proclaimed his imposture, a thousand sabres had flashed from a
          thousand sheaths, and his word had been proclaimed through Africa,
          Turkey, Asia, and even in Spain. The man claimed authority -- he
          claimed divinity; therefore he had power. Take again the increase of
          Mormonism. What has been its strength? Simply this -- the assertion of
          power from heaven. That claim is made, and the people believe it, and
          now they have missionaries in almost every country of the habitable
          globe, and the book of Mormon is translated into many languages.
          Though there never could be a delusion more transparent, or a
          counterfeit less skilful, and more lying upon the very surface, yet
          this simple pretension to power has been the means of carrying power
          with it. Now, my brethren, we have power; we are God's ministers; we
          preach God's truth; the great Judge of heaven and earth has told us
          the truth, and what have we to do to dispute with worms of the dust?
          Why should we tremble and fear them? Let us stand out and say, "We are
          the servants of the living God; we tell unto you what God has told us,
          and we warn you, if you reject our testimony, it shall be better for
          Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you." If the people
          cast that away we have done our work. We have nothing to do with
          making men believe; ours is to testify of Christ everywhere, to preach
          and to proclaim the gospel to all men.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is one passage in the Bible which seems to militate against
          what I have said, if the common translation be true -- the passage
          which says that Paul "disputed in the school of one Tyrannus." But
          this is better rendered in English, he "dialogued in the school of one
          Tyrannous." Albert Barnes says, that "disputed is not a happy
          translation," for there is no such idea conveyed by the word. Jesus,
          when he preached, "dialogued." When the man came and said to him,
          "Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" he "dialogued" with
          him. When another said unto him, "Speak, Lord, unto my brother, that
          he divide with me the inheritance," Christ did not dispute with him,
          but he "dialogued." His usual style was to address the people, and but
          rarely to dispute with men. We might give up all the books that have
          been written in defence of Christianity if we would but preach Christ,
          if, instead of defending the outposts, we were to say, "God will take
          care of them," and were at once to make a sortie on the enemy; then by
          God's Holy Spirit we should carry everything before us. O, Church of
          God! believe thyself invincible, and thou art invincible; but stay to
          tremble, and fear, and thou art undone. Lift up thy head and say, "I
          am God's daughter; I am Christ's bride." Do not stop to prove it, but
          affirm it; march through the land, and kings and princes shall bow
          down before thee, because thou hast taken thine ancient prowess and
          assumed thine ancient glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have one more remark to make here with regard to the style in which
          we go to work. I fear that we have not enough of the divine method of
          itinerancy. Paul was a great itinerant: he preached in one place, and
          there were twelve converted there; he made a church at once; he did
          not stop till he had five hundred; but when he had twelve, he went off
          to another place. A holy woman takes him in; she has a son and
          daughter; they are saved and baptized -- there is another church. Then
          he goes on; wherever he goes the people believe and are baptized,
          wherever he meets a family who believe, he or his companion baptizes
          all the house, and goes about his way still forming churches and
          appointing elders over them. We, now-a-days, go and settle in a place,
          make a station of it, and work around it by little and little, and
          think that is the way to succeed. No, no! ravage a continent; attempt
          great things and great things shall be done. But they say if you just
          pass over a place it will be forgotten like the summer shower, which
          moistens all, but satisfies none. Yes, but you do not know how many of
          God's elect may be there; you have no business to stop in one place;
          go straight on; God's elect are everywhere. I protest if I could not
          itinerate this country of England, I could not bear to preach. If I
          preached here always, many of you would become gospel hardened. I love
          to go ranging here, there, and everywhere. My highest ambition is
          this, that I may be found going through the entire land, as well as
          holding my head quarters in one position. I do hold that itinerancy is
          God's great plan. There should be fixed ministers and pastors, but
          those who are like apostles should itinerate far more than they do.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But I have a third thing to say which will strike home to some of
          us: that is, that WE HAVE NOT APOSTOLIC CHURCHES. Oh! had you seen an
          Apostolic church, what a different thing it would appear to one of our
          churches! as different, I had almost said, as light from darkness, as
          different as the shallow bed of the brook that is dried by summer is
          from the mighty rolling river, ever full, ever deep and clear, and
          ever rushing into the sea. Now, where is our prayerfulness compared
          with theirs? I trust that we know something of the power of prayer
          here, but I do not think we pray like they did. "They broke bread from
          house to house, and did eat their meat with singleness of heart,
          giving glory to God." There was not a member of the Church, as a rule,
          who was half-hearted; they gave their souls wholly to God; and when
          Anaias and Sapphira divided the price, they were smitten with death
          for their sin. Oh! if we prayed as deeply and as earnestly as they
          did, we should have as much success. Any measure of success we may
          have had here has been entirely owing under God to your prayers; and
          wherever I have gone, I have boasted that I have a praying people. Let
          other ministers have as prayerful a people; let missionaries have as
          many prayers from the Church, and, all things being equal, God will
          bless them, and there will be greater prosperity than ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have not the Apostolic mode of liberality. In the Apostles' days
          they gave all their substance. It was not demanded of them then, and
          it is not now, no one thinks of asking such a thing; still we have run
          to the other extreme, and many give nothing at all. Men who have
          thousands and tens of thousands are so eternally considerate for their
          families, albeit they are provided for, that they give nothing more
          than the servant girl who sits next to them. It is a common saying,
          that members of Christian Churches do not give in proportion to their
          wealth. We give because it is genteel and respectable. A great many of
          us give I hope, because we love the cause of God; but many of us say,
          "There is a poor bricklayer, working hard all the week and only
          earning just enough to keep his wife and family: he will give a
          shilling; now, I have so many pounds a week -- I am a rich man -- what
          shall I give? why, I will give half-a-crown." Another says, "I will
          give ten shillings this morning." Now, if they measured their wealth
          in comparison with his, they would see that he gives all he has left
          above his maintenance, while they give comparatively nothing. My
          brethren, we are not half Christians; that is the reason why we have
          not half success. We are Christianised, but I question whether we are
          thoroughly so. The Spirit of God hath not entered into us to give us
          that life, and fire, and soul, which they had in these ancient times.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. But lastly, as the result of the other things which have gone
          before, and perhaps partly as the cause of them too, WE HAVE NOT THE
          HOLY SPIRIT IN THAT MEASURE WHICH ATTENDED THE APOSTLES. I see no
          reason whatever, why, this morning, if God willed it, I should not
          stand up and preach a sermon which should be the means of converting
          every soul in the place. I see no reason why I should not, tomorrow,
          preach a sermon which should be the means of the salvation of all who
          heard it, if God the Spirit were poured out. The word is able to
          convert, just as extensively as God the Spirit pleases to apply it;
          and I can see no reason why, if converts come in by ones and twos now,
          there should not be a time when hundreds and thousands shall come to
          God. The same sermon which God blesses to ten if he pleased he could
          bless to a hundred. I know not but that in the latter days when Christ
          shall come and shall begin to take the kingdom to himself, every
          minister of God shall be as successful as Peter on the day of
          Pentecost. I am sure the Holy Spirit is able to make the word
          successful, and the reason why we do not prosper is that we have not
          the Holy Spirit attending us with might and energy as they had then.
          My brethren, if we had the Holy Spirit upon our ministry, it would
          signify very little about our talent. Men might be poor and
          uneducated; their words might be broken and ungrammatical; there might
          be no polished periods of Hall, or glorious thunders of Chalmers; but
          if there were the might of the Spirit attending them, the humblest
          evangelists would be more successful than the most pompous of divines,
          or the most eloquent of preachers. It is extraordinary grace, not
          talent, that wins the day; extraordinary spiritual power, not
          extraordinary mental power. Mental power may fill a chapel; but
          spiritual power fills the Church. Mental power may gather a
          congregation; spiritual power will save souls. We want spiritual
          power. Oh! we know some before whom we shrink into nothing as to
          talent, but who have no spiritual power, and when they speak they have
          not the Holy Spirit with them; but we know others, simple hearted
          worthy men who speak their country dialect, and who stand up to preach
          in their country place, and the Spirit of God clothes every word with
          power; hearts are broken, souls are saved, and sinners are born again.
          Spirit of the living God! we want thee. Thou art the life, the soul;
          thou art the source of thy people's success; without thee they can do
          nothing, with thee they can do everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have tried to show you what I conceive to be the causes of our
          partial non-success. And now permit me, with all earnestness, to plead
          with you on behalf of Christ and Christ's Holy Gospel, that you would
          stir yourselves up to renewed efforts for the spread of his truth, and
          to more earnest prayers, that his kingdom may come, and his will be
          done on earth even as it is in heaven. Ah! my friends, could I show
          you the tens of thousands of spirits who are now walking in outer
          darkness; could I take you to the gloomy chamber of hell, and show you
          myriads upon myriads of heathen souls in utterable torture, not having
          heard the word, but being justly condemned for their sins; methinks
          you could ask yourselves, "Did I do anything to save these unhappy
          myriads? They have been damned, and can I say I am clear of their
          blood?" Oh! God of mercy, if these skirts be clear of my fellow
          creatures' blood, I shall have eternal reason to bless thee in heaven.
          Oh! Church of Christ! thou hast great reason to ask thyself whether
          thou art quite clean in this matter. Ye say too often, ye sons of God,
          "Am I my brother's keeper?" Ye are too much like Cain; ye do not ask
          yourselves whether God will require your fellow-creatures blood at
          your hands. Oh! there is a truth which says, "If the watchman warn
          them not, they shall perish, but their blood will he require at the
          watchman's hands." Ah! there ought to be more of us who are preaching
          to the heathen, and yet, perhaps, we are indolent and doing little or
          nothing. There are many of you, yea all of you, who ought to be doing
          far more than you are for evangelical purposes and the spread of
          Christ's gospel. Oh! put this question to your hearts; shall I be able
          to say to the damned spirit if he meets me in hell, "Sinner, I did all
          I could for thee?" I am afraid some will have to say, "No, I did not;
          it is true I might have done more; I might have laboured more, even
          though I might have been unsuccessful, but I did not do it." AH, my
          dear friends, I believe there is a great reason for some of us to
          suspect whether we believe our religion at all. An infidel once met a
          Christian. "Because," said the other, "for years you have passed me on
          my way to my house of business. You believe, do you not, there is a
          hell, into which men's spirit are cast?" "Yes, I do," said the
          Christian. "And you believe that unless I believe in Christ I must be
          sent there?" "Yes." "You do not, I am sure, because if you did you
          must be a most inhuman wretch to pass me, day by day, and never tell
          me about it or warn me of it." I do hold that there are some
          Christians who are verily guilty in this matter; God will forgive
          them, the blood of Christ can even wash that out, but they are guilty.
          Did you ever think of the tremendous value of a single soul. My
          hearers, if there were but one man in Siberia unsaved, and all the
          world were saved besides, if God should move our minds, it would be
          worth while for all the people in England to go after that one soul.
          Did you ever think of the value of a soul? Ah! ye have not heart the
          howls and yells of hell; ye have not heard the mighty songs and
          hosannas of the glorified; ye have no notion of what eternity is, or
          else ye would know the value of a soul. Ye who have been broken by
          conviction, humbled by the Spirit, and led to cry for mercy through
          the covenant Jesus; ye know something of what a soul's value is, but
          many of my hearers do not. Could we preach carelessly, could we pray
          coldly, if we knew what a precious thing it is about which we are
          concerned? No, surely we should be doubly in earnest that God will
          please to save sinners. I am sure the present state of affairs cannot
          go on long; we are doing next to nothing; Christianity is at a low
          ebb. People think it will never be much better; that it is clear
          impossible to do wonders in these days. Are we in a worse condition
          than the Roman Catholic nations were when one man, a Luther, preached?
          Then God can find a Luther now. We are not in a much worse state than
          when Whitfield began to preach, and yet God can find his Whitfields
          now. It is a delusion to suppose that we cannot succeed as they did.
          God helping us we will; God helping us by his Spirit we will see
          greater things than this, at any rate, we will never let God's Church
          rest if we do not see it prosper, but we will enter our earnest hearty
          protest against the coldness and lethargy of the times, and as long as
          this our tongue shall move in our mouth, we will protest against the
          laxity and false doctrine so rampant throughout the Churches, and then
          that happy double reformation -- a reformation in doctrine and Spirit,
          will be brought about together. Then God knoweth but what we shall
          say, "Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their
          windows," and ere long the shout of Christ shall be heard. He,
          himself, shall descend from heaven; and we shall hear it said and
          sung, "Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! the Lord God Omnipotent
          reigneth."<br />
