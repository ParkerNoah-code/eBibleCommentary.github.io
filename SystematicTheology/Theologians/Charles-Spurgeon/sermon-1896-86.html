          42. The righteous shall see that, and shall rejoice: and all iniquity
          shall stop her mouth. 43. Whosoever is wise, so as to observe these
          things, even they shall understand the loving-kindness of Jehovah.

          42 The righteous shall see that, and shall rejoice The prophet now
          draws the conclusion, that so many evident tokens of God's
          superintending and overruling providence could not transpire before
          the righteous without attracting their notice, and that their vision
          being illuminated by faith, these scenes are contemplated by them with
          unfeigned delight; while the wicked remain perplexed and mute. For he
          very judiciously makes a distinction between these two classes of
          persons. In whatever manner the wicked may be constrained to recognize
          God as the supreme ruler of the universe, nevertheless, in seeing they
          see not, and derive nothing from the sight, except that their conduct
          is rendered the more inexcusable. But the righteous are not only able
          to form a good and sound judgment of these events, they also
          spontaneously open their eyes to contemplate the equity, goodness, and
          wisdom of God, the sight and knowledge of which are refreshing to
          them. For the joy which they experience in this exercise is a pledge
          that their thus observing these things was the spontaneous effusion of
          their hearts. With regard to the despisers of God, it is not meant
          that they are so deeply impressed as truly to acknowledge that the
          world is under his superintending care, but that they are merely so
          far kept in check as not to presume to deny the existence of that
          providence as their natural inclination would lead them to do; or, at
          least, that they meet with a vigorous repulse whenever they attempt to
          speak in opposition to it. Although the judgments of God are before
          their eyes, yet is their understanding so darkened, that they cannot
          perceive the clear light. And this manner of speaking is more
          energetic than if it had been said, that the wicked themselves are
          become mute. In fact, they do not cease from murmuring against God's
          dispensations of providence; for we see with what arrogance and
          contempt they set themselves in opposition to our faith, and have the
          hardihood to pour forth horrid blasphemies against God. This does not
          impeach the veracity of the prophet's statement, that the mouth of
          wickedness is stopped, because, in fact, the more proudly and
          violently they assail God, the more notorious does their impiety
          appear. Besides, the joy here mentioned arises from this, that there
          is nothing more calculated to increase our faith, than the knowledge
          of the providence of God; because, without it, we would be harassed
          with doubts and fears, being uncertain whether or not the world was
          governed by chance. For this reason, it follows that those who aim at
          the subversion of this doctrine, depriving the children of God of true
          comfort, and vexing their minds by unsettling their faith, forge for
          themselves a hell upon earth. For what can be more awfully tormenting
          than to be constantly racked with doubt and anxiety? And we will never
          be able to arrive at a calm state of mind until we are taught to
          repose with implicit confidence in the providence of God. Moreover, it
          is declared in this verse, that God manifests his goodness to all men
          without exception, and yet there are comparatively few of them who
          benefit by it. Wherefore, when he formerly called upon all to
          celebrate the goodness of God, it was in order that the ingratitude of
          the majority of them might the more plainly appear.

          43. Whosoever is wise, so as to observe these things. We are now
          informed that men begin to be wise when they turn their whole
          attention to the contemplation of the works of God, and that all
          others besides are fools. For however much they may pique themselves
          upon their superior acuteness and subtilty, all this is of no avail so
          long as they shut their eyes against the light which is presented to
          them. In employing this interrogatory form of address, he indirectly
          adverts to that false persuasion which prevails in the world, at the
          very time when the most daring heaven-despiser esteems himself to be
          the wisest of men; as if he should say, that all those who do not
          properly observe the providence of God, will be found to be nothing
          but fools. This caution is the more necessary, since we find that some
          of the greatest of philosophers were so mischievous as to devote their
          talents to obscure and conceal the providence of God, and, entirely
          overlooking his agency, ascribed all to secondary causes. At the head
          of these was Aristotle, a man of genius and learning; but being a
          heathen, whose heart was perverse and depraved, it was his constant
          aim to entangle and perplex God's overruling providence by a variety
          of wild speculations; so much so, that it may with too much truth be
          said, that he employed his naturally acute powers of mind to
          extinguish all light. Besides, the prophet not only condemns the
          insensate Epicureans, whose insensibility was of the basest character,
          but he also informs us that a blindness, still greater and more
          detestable, was to be found among these great philosophers themselves.
          By the term, observe, he informs us, that the bare apprehension of the
          works of God is not enough, -- they must be carefully considered in
          order that the knowledge of them may be deliberately and maturely
          digested. And, therefore, that it may be engraven upon our hearts, we
          must make these works the theme of our attentive and constant
          meditation. When the prophet says, Whosoever is wise, even they shall
          understand, the change of the singular into the plural number is
          beautifully appropriate. By the one he tacitly complains of the
          fewness of those who observe the judgments of God; as if he should
          say, How seldom do we meet with a person who truly and attentively
          considers the works of God! Then he adverts to the fact of their being
          so visibly before all, that it is impossible that men could overlook
          them, were it not that their minds are perverted by their own
          wickedness. And if any person be disposed to inquire how it comes to
          pass that the prophet, after treating of the judgments and severity of
          God, now makes mention of his loving-kindness, I answer, that his
          loving-kindness shines most conspicuously, and occupies a very
          prominent place in all that he does; for he is naturally prone to
          loving-kindness, by which also he draws us to himself.
