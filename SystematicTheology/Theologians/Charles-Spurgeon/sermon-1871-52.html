        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1019)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, November 5th, 1871 by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in
          his house. And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed
          their stripes, and was baptized, he and all his, straightway. And when
          he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and
          rejoiced, believing in God with all his house." -- Acts 16:32-34.
        </p>
        <p>
          IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS that a good man has to go alone to heaven: God's
          election has separated him from the midst of an ungodly family, and,
          notwithstanding his example and his prayers, and his admonitions, they
          still remain unconverted, and he himself, a solitary one, a speckled
          bird amongst them, has to pursue his lonely flight to the skies. Far
          oftener, however, it happens that the God who is the God of Abraham
          becomes the God of Sarah, and then of Isaac, and then of Jacob, and
          though grace does not run in the blood, and regeneration is not of
          blood nor of birth, yet doth it very frequently -- I was about to say
          almost always -- happen that God, by means of one of a household,
          draws the rest to himself. He calls an individual, and then uses him
          to be a sort of spiritual decoy to bring the rest of the family into
          the gospel net. John Bunyan, in the first part of his "Pilgrim's
          Progress," describes Christian as a lonely traveler, pursuing his road
          to the Celestial City alone; occasionally he is attended by Faithful,
          or he meets with a Hopeful; but these are casual acquaintances, and
          are not of his kith or kin: brother or child after the flesh he has
          none with him. The second part of Bunyan's book exhibits family piety,
          for we see Christiana, and the children, and many friends, all
          travelling in company to the better land; and, though it is often said
          that the second part of Bunyan's wondrous allegory is somewhat weaker
          than the former, and probably it is so, yet many a gentle spirit has
          found it sweeter than the former, and it has given to many a loving
          heart great delight to feel that there is a possibility, beneath the
          leadership of one of the Lord's Greathearts, to form a convoy to the
          skies, so that a sacred caravan shall traverse the desert of earth,
          and women and children shall find their way, in happy association, to
          the City of Habitations. We rejoice to think of whole families
          enclosed within the lines of electing grace, and entire households,
          redeemed by blood, devoting themselves to the service of the God of
          love. I am sure any of you, who yourselves have tasted that the Lord
          is gracious, are most anxious to bring others into reconciliation with
          God. It is an instinct with the Christian to desire that his
          fellow-men should, as he has done, both taste and see that the Lord is
          good. Judaism wraps itself up within itself, and claims a monopoly of
          blessing for the chosen nation. The heir after the flesh gnashes with
          his teeth when we declare that the true heirs of Abraham are born
          after the Spirit and are found in every land. They would reserve all
          heavenly privileges to the circumcised, and keep up the ancient middle
          wall of partition. It is the very genius of Christianity to embrace
          all mankind in its love. If there be anything true, let all believe
          it: if there be anything good, let all receive it. We desire no gates
          of brass to shut out the multitude; and if there be barriers, we would
          throw them down, and pray eternal mercy to induce the teeming millions
          to draw near to the fountain of life. It will not be wrong, but, on
          the contrary, most natural and proper, that your desire for the
          salvation of others should, first of all, rest upon your own families.
          If charity begins at home, so, assuredly, piety will. They have
          special claims upon us who gather around our table and our hearth. God
          has not reversed the laws of nature, but he has sanctified them by the
          rules of grace; it augurs nothing of selfishness that a man should
          first seek to have his own kindred saved. I will give nothing for your
          love for the wide world, if you have not a special love for your own
          household. The rule of Paul may, with a little variation, be applied
          here; we are to "do good unto all men, but specially unto such as be
          of the household of faith;" so are we to seek the good of all mankind,
          but specially of those who are of our own near kindred. Let Abraham's
          prayer be for Ishmael, let Hannah pray for Samuel, let David plead for
          Solomon, let Andrew find first his brother Simon, and Eunice train her
          Timothy: they will be none the less large or prevalent in their
          pleadings for others, because they were mindful of those allied to
          them by ties of blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          To allure and encourage you to long for family religion, I have
          selected this text this morning. God grant it may answer the purpose
          designed. May many here have a spiritual hunger and thirst, that they
          may receive the blessing which so largely rested upon the Philippian
          jailer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note in our text five things. We have a whole household hearing the
          word, a whole household believing it, a whole household baptized, a
          whole household working for God, and then, a whole household
          rejoicing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Observe, first, in the passage before us, A WHOLE HOUSEHOLD HEARING
          THE WORD. I do not know whether they had ever heard the Gospel before:
          perhaps they had. We have no certain proof that the jailer heard the
          name of Jesus Christ for the first time amidst the tumult of the
          earthquake; he may have listened to Paul in the streets, and so have
          known something of the Gospel and of the name of Jesus Christ; but
          this is hardly probable, as he would then have scarcely treated the
          apostle so harshly. Most likely the word of God sounded at midnight in
          the ears of the jailer and his household for the first time, and, on
          that remarkable occasion, they all heard it together. The father
          first, in his alarm, asked the question, "What must I do to be saved?"
          and received personally the answer, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
          and thou shalt be saved, and thy house;" and then it appears that all
          the family gathered around their parent, and the two holy men, while
          Paul and Silas spake unto him the word of the Lord, and also to all
          that were in his house. We do not know whether there were children
          there, but if so, and we will assume it for this occasion, all were
          hearers that night. There was not a solitary exception, no one was
          away from that sermon in a jail. His wife, his children, his servants,
          all that were in his house, listened to the heavenly message. It is
          true, he who preached was a prisoner, but that made the word none the
          less powerful, for he was to them an ambassador in bonds. Prisoner as
          he was, he preached to them a free gospel, and a gospel of divine
          authority. He erred not from the truth in what he taught; he preached
          unto them the "word of God." Would to God that all preachers would
          keep to the word of God, and, above all things, would exalt The
          Incarnate Word of God. This were infinitely better than to delude
          men's minds with those "germs of thought," those strikingly new ideas,
          those metaphysical subtleties, and speculations, and theories, and
          discoveries of science, falsely so called, which are now-a-days so
          fashionable. If all ministers could preach the word, the revealed mind
          and will of God, then hearers would in larger numbers become converts;
          for God will bless his own word, but he will not bless anything else.
          The jailor's household all heard God's word faithfully declared, and
          there was the main cause of blessing, for, alas! with many hearers,
          the Sabbath is utterly wasted; for, though they are attentive
          listeners, they are left without a blessing, because that which they
          hear is not the gospel of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have myself heard sermons which, I am persuaded, God Almighty
          himself could not bless to the conversion of anybody. He could not,
          because it would have been a denial of himself. The discourses were
          not true, nor according to his word; they were not such as were
          calculated to honor himself, and how can he bless that which is not to
          his own honor? and how can he set his seal to a lie? The word of God
          must be preached, and then the place, the hour, or the garb of the
          preacher will matter nothing. The minister may have been led up from a
          prison, and the smell of the dungeon may be upon him, but when he
          opens his mouth with the glad tidings, the name of Jesus will be as
          ointment poured forth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I began my remarks on this point by noting that they all heard Paul;
          and observe the need of this, as a starting-point, for "faith cometh
          by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." It is not all who hear
          theft will be saved, but the ordinary way with God is for men first to
          hear, then to believe, and so to be saved. "Being in the way, God met
          with me," said Obadiah; and the road which a soul should follow to be
          met with by God is the way of hearing. Though it may seem a very trite
          thing to say, it is nevertheless exceedingly important, if we are to
          have household conversion, that there should be a household hearing of
          the word. This is the chosen instrumentality, and we must bring all
          under the instrumentality if we wish them to obtain the blessing. Now,
          in this City, many fathers never hear the word of God, because they
          regard the Sabbath Day as a day of laziness. They work so hard all the
          week, they say, that they are not fit to rise from their beds in the
          morning, and then, after a heavy dinner, the evening must be spent in
          loitering about, and chatting away time. Brethren, if you want to see
          your fellow-workmen saved, you should earnestly endeavor to bring them
          under the sound of the gospel. Here is a very useful occupation for
          many of you. You cannot preach, but you can gather a congregation for
          those who do. A little persuasion would succeed in many cases, and
          once bring them here, we would hope to hold them. If I could not be
          the instrument of converting a soul by preaching the gospel myself, I
          would habitually addict myself to the bringing of strangers to listen
          to those whom God has owned to the conversion of souls. Why, our
          congregations need never be thin -- I speak not now for myself, for I
          have no need -- but in no place where the gospel is preached need
          there be a thin audience, if those who already appreciate the Gospel
          would feel it to be a Christian duty to bring others to hear it. Do
          this, I pray you. I believe it to be one of the most important efforts
          which a Christian man can make, to endeavor to bring the working men
          of London, and, indeed, all classes of men everywhere, to listen to
          the Gospel of Christ. The men, the fathers, the heads of households,
          we must have.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we are to have the household saved, however, the mothers must hear
          the word as well as the fathers. Many of them do, but I know cases,
          and, perhaps, there may be such present, and I wish to speak what is
          practical; where a man comes to hear the word himself, but his wife is
          detained at home with the children. Perhaps she is not converted, and
          has not much care to go to the service; perhaps she is a Christian
          woman, and though she would wish to go she must look after the
          children; in either case it is the duty of every such father, if he
          does not keep a servant to attend to the children, to take his turn
          with the wife and let her have her fair share of opportunity for
          hearing the gospel. He meanly shirks the duty of a husband, who, being
          a working man, does not take his turn at home and give his wife as
          good an opportunity of learning the way of salvation as himself. This
          may be a new suggestion to some, I only hope they will carry it out.
          It is plain that if we are to have whole households saved, we must
          have whole households hearing the word, and if the mother cannot hear
          the word, we cannot rationally expect the blessing to come to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the children also must be thought of. We desire to see them
          converted as children. There is no need that they should wait until
          they are grown up, and have run into sin as their fathers did, that
          they may be afterwards brought back; it would be infinitely better if
          they were preserved from such wanderings, and early brought into the
          fold of Jesus. The blessing which God gave to the jailor's children by
          hearing, he gives in the same way to other children. Let the little
          ones be brought to hear the Gospel. They can hear it in the Sabbath
          School, end there are special services adapted to them; but, for my
          part, I like also so to preach that boys and girls shall be
          interested, and I shall feel that I am very faulty in my style if
          children cannot understand much that I teach in the congregation.
          Bring all who have reached years of understanding with you. Suffer
          none to be at home, except for good reasons. Bring each young Samuel
          to the house of the Lord. Let it be said of you, as it is written in
          the Book of Chronicles, "And all Judah stood before the Lord, with
          their little ones, their wives, and their children." If nothing else
          shall come from children's attending our worship, the holy habit of
          going up to God's house will be a perpetual heritage to them; and who
          knows but while they are yet young their hearing the word shall be the
          means of their salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there are the servants, and by no means are they to be
          overlooked. To have all that are in the house saved, all that are in
          the house must hear the Gospel. Do you all make such opportunities for
          your servants on the Sabbath as you should? I do not know, of course,
          how you conduct your family arrangements; but I know of some who do
          not think enough of their servants' hearing the Gospel. Servants
          frequently are sent out in the afternoon, when there is no preaching
          worth the hearing. It may be unavoidable in many cases; but I would
          ask, What is the use of their going out at an hour warn no preaching
          is to be found? If we give them only opportunities of going out when
          there is nothing to hear, we certainly have not given them a fair
          portion of the Lord's-day. By some contrivance or other, perhaps with
          a little pinch and self-sacrifice, our servants might hear our own
          minister. You cannot pray God to save your household, and be honest,
          unless you give the whole household an opportunity of being saved, and
          God's way of saving souls, we repeat it, is by the preaching and the
          hearing of the word. Oh! let every one of us be able to say, as
          masters and as parents, "I cannot save my children, and I cannot save
          my servants, but this I have done, I have directed them to a man of
          God who preaches the gospel faithfully; I do not send them to a place
          merely because there is talent or fashion there, but I have selected
          for them a ministry which God blesses, and I do my best to put them
          all in the way of the blessing, praying and beseeching the Lord to
          call them all by his grace." I anticipate the many difficulties you
          will urge, but would again say, if we love souls, we should try to
          meet these difficulties, and if we cannot do all we would, we should
          at least do all we can, that we may have all our households every
          Sabbath-day hearing the glorious gospel of the blessed God.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We now turn to the next, which is a most comfortable and cheering
          sight. Here is A WHOLE HOUSEHOLD BELIEVING. We know that the whole
          household believed, for we are told so in the thirty-fourth verse;
          "Believing in God with all his house:" -- all, all, all were
          powerfully affected, savingly affected by the gospel which Paul
          preached to them. I have already remarked, that they were very
          probably new hearers. Certainly, if they had heard the word before, it
          could not have been many times; and yet they all believed. Is it not a
          most sad fact that many of my old hearers have not believed? The
          battering-ram has beaten often on their walls, but it leas not shaken
          them yet; wooing invitations of the gospel have been presented to them
          again and again, accompanied by the soul-piercing music of a Savior's
          dying cries; and yet, for all that, they remain unconverted still. Oh
          I the responsibilities that are heaped up upon gospel-hardened
          sinners! Take home to yourselves that warning word, I pray you. This
          household heard the gospel probably but once, certainly only once or
          twice, yet they believed, and here are some of us who have heard it
          from our youth up, and remain rebellious still.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of this family it may be said that as they were new hearers, so they
          were most unlikely hearers. The Romans did not select for jailers the
          most tender hearted of men. Frequently they were old legionaries who
          had seen service in bloody wars, and been inured to cruel fights; and,
          when these men settled down as, in a measure, pensioners of the
          empire, they were allotted such offices as that which the jailer held.
          In the society and associations of a jail there was very little that
          could be likely to improve the mother, to benefit the children, or
          elevate the servants. They were, then, most unpromising hearers. Yet
          how often are the most unlikely persons convinced of sin, and led to
          the Savior. How true is it still of many who are most moral and
          excellent, and even outwardly religious, that "the publicans and
          harlots enter into the kingdom of heaven before them." This is an
          encouragement to you who work in lodginghouses and in the slums of
          this vast city, to bring all kinds of people to hear the word, for if
          a jailer and his household were numbered among the first fruits unto
          God at Philippi, may we not hope that others of an unlikely class may
          be converted too? Who are you, that you should say, "It is of no use
          to invite such a man to hear, for he would not be converted?" The more
          improbable it seems to be in your judgment, perhaps the more likely it
          is that God will look upon him with an eye of love. How happy a thing
          it was for the jailer that, in the providence of God, his hardened but
          probably honest spirit was brought under the influence of the earnest
          apostle. Bring others, like him, into the place of worship, for who
          can tell?
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, that though they were thus unlikely hearers, yet they were
          immediately converted, there and then. It took but a short time. I do
          not know how long Paul's sermon was; he was a wise man, and I should
          not think he would preach a long sermon in the dead of the night, just
          after an earthquake. I have no doubt it was a simple exposition of the
          doctrine of the cross. And then Silas talked too; perhaps, when Paul
          had done, Silas gave a little exhortation, a brief address to finish
          up with, and fill up anything which Paul had left out. The teaching
          was soon over, and at its close the jailer, his wife, his children (if
          he had any), his servants, and indeed all that were in the house,
          avowed themselves to be believers. It does not take a month to convert
          a soul. Glory be to God, if he wills to do it, he can convert all here
          this morning, in a moment. Once hearing the gospel may be sufficient
          to make a man a Christian. When the eternal word of God comes forth
          with omnipotent energy, it turns lions into lambs, and that in a
          single instant of time. As the lightning flash can split the oak from
          its loftiest bough to the earth in a single second, so the ever
          blessed lightning of God's Spirit can cleave the heart of man in a
          moment. Our text shows us a whole family saved at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is said particularly of them all that "they believed." Was that the
          only thing? Could it not be said that they all prayed? I dare say it
          could, and many other good things; but then faith was at the root of
          them all. It was the sneer of an old Greek philosopher against the
          Christians his day: "Faith," he said, "is your only wisdom." Yes, and
          we rejoice in the same wisdom now -- faith; for the moment we receive
          faith we are saved. It is the one essential grace; -- "Believe on the
          Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." The moment God gives a
          man faith -- and that he can do at any time -- the instant the heart
          casts itself into the arms of Jesus crucified, and rests there,
          whoever it is, he is saved in an instant: effectually and infallibly
          saved; he is, in all respects, a new creature in Christ Jesus. Faith
          is an instantaneous act at its beginning, and then it remains as an
          abiding grace; its first act, by the power of God, puts a man into the
          present possession of immediate salvation. I wonder if we preachers
          fully believe this as a matter of fact. If I were to go into a jail
          to-morrow evening, and were to preach to the jailer and his household,
          should I expect to see all saved there and then? And if they were,
          should I believe it? Most likely I should not see it, and the reason
          would lie because I should not have faith enough to expect it. We
          preach the gospel, no doubt, but it is with the slender hope that some
          may be converted, and they are converted, here and there; but if God
          would clothe us with the faith of the apostles, we should see far
          greater things. When he works in us a larger faith, he will also
          restore to us the hundredfold harvest, which, alas! is so rare in
          these days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice very particularly, that these persons though converted thus
          suddenly, all of them were, nevertheless, very hearty converts. They
          did that night, as I shall show you soon, abundantly prove how
          thoroughly converted they were. They were quick to do all that in them
          lay for the apostle, and for the good cause. They were not half
          converted, as many people are. I like to see a man renewed all over
          from head to foot. It is delightful to meet your hearty Christian,
          who, when he gave his heart to Jesus, meant it, and devoted his whole
          body, soul, and spirit to the good Lord who had bought him with his
          blood. Some of you have only got a little finger conversion, just
          enough to wear the ring of profession, and look respectable, but oh!
          to have hand and foot, lungs, heart, voice, and soul, all saturated
          with the Spirit's influence and consecrated to the cause of God. We
          have a few such men, full of the Holy Ghost, but, alas, we have too
          many other converts, who are rather tinctured with grace, than
          saturated with it, and to whom sprinkling is a very significant
          ordinance, for it would appear that they never have received anything
          but a sprinkling of grace. Oh, for saints in whom there will be a
          thorough death and burial to the world, and a new life, in the
          resurrection image of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is the true baptism
          of the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I must return on this head to the point, that they all
          believed. What a sweet picture for you to look upon. The father is a
          believer in Jesus, but he has not to kneel down and pray, "Lord, save
          my dear wife;" for see, and rejoice as you see it, she is a believer
          too. And then there is the elder son and the daughters; we know not,
          and we must not guess, how many there might be, but there they are all
          rejoicing in their father's God. And then there are the servants, the
          old nurse who brought up the little ones, and the little maid, and the
          warders who have to look after the prisoners, they are all of them
          ready to sing the psalm of praise, and all delighted to look upon
          those who were once their prisoners as now their instructors and their
          fathers in the faith. O brethren, if some of us should ever see all
          our children and our servants saved, we would cry like Simeon of old,
          "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy
          word." Many have seen it; the jailor's case is by no means an
          exceptional one, and I hope all of us are earnestly crying to God that
          we may gain the same unspeakable privilege.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. We have, in the third place, in our text, A WHOLE HOUSEHOLD
          BAPTIZED. "He was baptized, he and all his straightway." In almost
          every case in Scripture where you read of a household baptism, you are
          distinctly informed that they were also a believing household. In the
          case of Lydia it may not be so; but then there are remarkable
          circumstances about her case which render that information needless.
          In this instance they were all believers, and, therefore, they were
          all of them baptized. First, "HE" was baptised, -- the jailor; he was
          ready first to submit himself to the ordinance in which he declared
          himself to be dead to the world, and risen anew in Christ Jesus. Then
          "all his" followed. What a glorious baptism, amidst the glare of the
          torches that night! perhaps in the prison hath, or in the impluvium
          which was usually in the center of most oriental houses, or perhaps
          the stream that watered Philippi ran by the prison wall, and was used
          for the occasion. It matters not, but into the water they descended,
          one after another, mother, children, servants; and Paul and Silas
          stood there delighted to aid them in declaring themselves to be on the
          Lord's side, "buried with him in baptism."
        </p>
        <p>
          And this was done, mark you, straightway. There was not one who wished
          to have it put off till he had tried himself a little, and seen
          whether he was really regenerated. In those days no one had any
          scruple or objection to obey; none advocated the following of some
          ancient and doubtful tradition; all were obedient to the divine will.
          No one shrank from baptism for fear that water might damage his
          health, or in some way cause him inconvenience; but he and all his,
          wishing, to follow the plain example of our Lord Jesus Christ, were
          baptized, and that straightway, -- at once, and on the spot. No
          minister has any right to refuse to baptise any person who professes
          faith in Jesus Christ, unless there be some glaring fact to cast doubt
          upon the candidate's sincerity. I, for one, would never ask from any
          person weeks and months of delay, in which the man should prove to me
          that he was a believer; but I would follow the example of the apostle.
          The gospel of Christ was preached, the people were converted, and they
          were baptized, and all perhaps in the space of an hour. The whole
          transaction may not have taken up so much time as I shall occupy in
          preaching about it this morning. How, then, is it with you, who wait
          so long? Where is the precept or example to warrant your hesitation?
          Permit me to remind you that duties delayed are sins. Will you take
          that home with you, you who have been believers for years and yet are
          not baptised? Permit me to remind you, also, that privileges postponed
          are losses. Put the two together, and where duty and privilege meet do
          not incur the sin and the loss, but, like David, "make haste and delay
          not" to keep the divine command.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why say so much about baptism?" says somebody. Much about baptism!
          Never was a remark more ungenerous, if it is made against me. I might,
          far more justly, be censured for saying so little about it. Much about
          baptism! I call you all to witness that, unless it comes across my
          path in the Scriptures, I never go away from the text to drag it in. I
          am no partisan: I never made baptism my main teaching, and God forbid
          I should; but I will not be hindered from preaching the whole truth,
          and, I dare say, no less than I am now saying. The Holy Ghost has
          recorded the baptism here: will you think little of what he chooses to
          record? Paul and Silas, an apostle and his companion, dared not
          neglect the ordinance: how dare you despise it?
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the dead of the night, it was in a prison; if it might have
          been put off, it surely might have been then: it was not a reputable
          place to dispense baptism, some would have said; it was hardly a
          seasonable hour, but they thought it so important that there and then,
          and at once, they baptised the whole household. If this be God's
          command -- and I solemnly believe it to be so -- do not despise it, I
          beseech you; as you love Christ, do not talk about its being
          non-essential. If the Lord command, shall his servant talk about its
          being non-essential? It is essential in all things to do my Master's
          will, and to preach it; for hath he not said, "He that shall break one
          of the least of these my commandments, and shall teach men so, the
          same shall be least in the kingdom of heaven"? I hope it may be our
          privilege here to see whole families baptized. Come along with you,
          beloved father, if you are a believer in Jesus: come with him, mother:
          come with him, daughters: come with your mother, ye godly sons, and
          come ye servants too. If you have come to the cross, and all your hope
          is placed there, then come and declare that you are Christ's. Touch
          not the ordinance till you believe in Jesus Christ: it may work you
          mighty mischief if you do. The sacramentarianism, which is so rampant
          in this age, is of all lies I think the most deadly, and you encourage
          sacramentarianism if you give a Christian ordinance to an unconverted
          person. Touch it not, then, until you are saved. Until you are
          believers, ordinances are not for you, and it is a sacrilege for you
          to intrude yourselves into them. How I long to see whole households
          believe, for then I may safely rejoice at seeing them baptised!
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Next, we have A WHOLE HOUSEHOLD AT WORK FOR GOD. Read the passage,
          and you will see that they all did something. The father called for a
          light, the servants bring the torches, and the lamps such as were used
          in the prisons. He took his prisoners the same hour of the night, and
          washed their stripes. Here is work for himself, and work for gentle
          hands to do, to assuage the pains of those poor bleeding backs; to
          wash out the grit that had come there through their lying on their
          backs on the dungeon floor, and to mollify and bind up their wounds.
          There was suitable occupation for the mother and for the servants, for
          they set meat before the holy men. The kitchen was sanctified to
          supply the needs of the ministers of Christ. Everything was done for
          their comfort. They were hungry, and they gave them meat; they were
          bleeding and they bathed their wounds. The whole household was astir
          that night. They had all believed and been baptised, and their very
          first enquiry is, "What can we do for Jesus?" It was clear to them
          that they could help the two men who had brought them to Christ, and
          they did so affectionately. No Martha had to complain that her sister
          left her to serve alone. I am persuaded there was not one of the
          family who shirked the pleasant duty of hospitality, though it was at
          dead of night. They soon had a meal ready; and how pleased they felt
          when they saw the two holy men reclining at their ease at the table,
          instead of lying with their feet fast in the stocks in the prison.
          They did not take the food down to the prison to them, or wash them,
          and send them back to the dungeon; but they brought them up from the
          cell into their own house, and accommodated them with the best they
          had. Now, beloved, it is a great mercy when you have a family saved
          and baptized, if the whole household sets to work to serve God, for
          there is something for all to do. Is there a lazy church member here?
          Friend, you miss a great blessing. Is there a mother here whose
          husband is very diligent in serving God, but she neglects to lead her
          children in the way of truth? Ah, dear woman, you are losing what
          would be a great comfort to your own soul. I know you are; for one of
          the best means for a soul to be built up in Christ is for it to do
          something for Christ. We cease to grow when we cease either to labor
          or to suffer for the Lord. Bringing forth fruit unto God is, unto
          ourselves, a most pleasant and profitable operation. Even our children
          when they are saved can do something for the Master. The little hand
          that drops its halfpence into the offering box, out of love to Jesus,
          is accepted of the Lord. The young child trying to tell its brother or
          sister of the dear Savior who has loved it is a true missionary of the
          cross. We should train our children as the Spartans trained their sons
          early for feats of war. We must have them first saved, but after that
          we must never think that they may be idle till they come to a certain
          period of life. I have known a little boy take his young companion
          aside, and kneel down in a field and pray with him, and I have heard
          of that young lad's being now, in the judgment of his parents, a
          believer in Christ. I have seen it, and my heart has been touched when
          I have seen it -- two or three boys gathered round another to seek
          that boy's salvation, and praying to God as heartily and earnestly as
          their parents could have done. There is room for all to work to help
          on the growing kingdom; and blessed shall that father be who shall see
          all his children enlisted in the brand army of God's elect, and all
          striving together for the promotion of the Redeemer's kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. That brings me to the fifth sight, which is A FAMILY REJOICING, for
          he rejoices in God with all his home. According to the run of the text
          the object of their joy was that they had believed. Believing obtains
          the pardon of all sin, and brings Christ's righteousness into our
          possession, it declares us to be the sons of God, gives us heirship
          with Christ, and secures us his blessing here and glory hereafter: who
          would not rejoice at this? If the family had been left a fortune they
          would have rejoiced, but they had found more than all the world's
          wealth at once in finding a Savior, therefore were they glad.
        </p>
        <p>
          But though their joy sprang mainly from their believing, it also arose
          from their being baptized, for do we not read of the Ethiopian of old
          after he was baptised that he "went on his way rejoicing." God often
          gives a clearing of the skies to those who are obedient to his
          command. I have known persons habitually the subjects of doubts and
          fears, who have suddenly leaped into joy and strength when they have
          done as their Lord commanded them. Not for keeping, but "in keeping
          his commandments there is great reward."
        </p>
        <p>
          They rejoiced, no doubt, also because they had enjoyed an opportunity
          of serving the church in waiting upon the apostle. They felt glad to
          think that Paul was at their table; very sorry that he had been
          imprisoned, but glad that they were his jailers; sorry that he had
          been beaten, but thankful that they could wash his stripes. And
          Christian people are never so happy as when they are busy for Jesus.
          When you do most for Christ you shall feel most of His love in your
          hearts. Why it makes my heart tingle with joy when I feel that I can
          honor my God. Rejoice, my brethren, that you have doors of usefulness
          set open before you, and say, now we can glorify the Savior's name;
          now we can visit the sick; now we can teach the ignorant; now we can
          bring sinners to the Savior. Why, there is no joy except the joy of
          heaven itself, which excels the bliss of serving the Savior who has
          done so much for us!
        </p>
        <p>
          I have no doubt that their joy was permanent and continued. There
          would not be any quarrelling in that house now, no disobedient
          children, no short tempered father, no fretful mother, no cruel
          brother, no exacting sister, no purloining servants, or eyeservers; no
          warders who would exceed their duty, or be capable of receiving bribes
          from the prisoners. The whole house would become a holy house, and a
          happy house hence forth. It is remarkable they should be so happy,
          because they might have thought sorrowfully of what they had been.
          They had fastened the apostle's feet in the stocks. Ah! but that was
          all gone, and they were happy to know that it was all forgiven. The
          father had beers a rough soldier, and perhaps his sons had been little
          better; but it was all blotted out, Christ's blood had covered all
          their sin, they were happy though they were penitent. It is true, they
          had a poor prospect before them, as the world would say, for they
          would be likely to be persecuted, and to suffer much. Here were two of
          the great ones of the church who had been scourged and put in prison:
          the humble members could not expect to fare better. Ah, never mind,
          they rejoiced in God. If they had known they would have to die for it,
          they would have rejoiced, for to have a Savior is such a source of
          thankfulness to believing souls, that if we had to burn to-morrow, we
          would rejoice to-day; if we had to die a thousand deaths in the course
          of the next month, yet, to find a Savior such as Jesus Christ is, is
          joy enough to make us laugh at death itself. They were a rejoicing
          family because they were a renewed family.
        </p>
        <p>
          In closing, regard these two words. That household is now in glory:
          they are all there -- the jailer, and his spouse, and his children,
          and his servants; they are all there, for is it not written, "He that
          believeth and is baptized shall be saved?" They were obedient to that
          word, and they are saved. Now, with some of you the father is in
          heaven, and the mother is on the road, but the children, ah, the
          children! With others of you, your little ones have gone before you,
          snatched away from the mother's breast; and your grandsire is also in
          glory; but, ah! husband and wife, your faces are turned towards the
          ways and wages of sin, and you will never meet your children and your
          parents. There will be broken households around the throne, and if it
          could mar their joy -- if anything could -- it would be the thought
          that there is a son in hell, or perhaps a husband in the flames, while
          the wife and mother sings the endless song. O God, grant it never may
          be so. May no child of our loins die an heir of wrath; none that have
          slept in our bosoms be banished from Jehovah's presence. By the bliss
          of a united family, I beseech you seek after it that you may have that
          united family in heaven. For this is the last question, "Will my
          family be there?" Will yours be there? Turn it over in your minds, my
          brothers and sisters, and if you can give the happy answer, and say,
          "Yes, by the blessing of God, I believe we shall all be there," then,
          I will ask you to serve God very much, for you owe him very much. You
          are deep debtors to the mercy of God, you parents who have godly
          children. You ought to do twice as much; nay, seven times as much for
          Jesus as any other Christians. But on the other hand, if you have to
          give a painful answer, then let this day be a day of prayer, and I
          would say to you, could not you, fathers, who love the Lord, call your
          children together this afternoon, and tell them what I have been
          talking about. Say to the boy, "My dear boy, our minister this morning
          has been speaking about a household in heaven, and a household being
          baptized because they believed; I pray that you may be a believer."
          Pray with the boys, pray with the girls, pray with the mother; and I
          do not know but what this very afternoon your whole household may be
          brought to the Savior. Who can tell?
        </p>
        <p>
          You, dear boys, just below me, who are a few out of my large family at
          the Orphanage, some of you have fathers in heaven, I hope you will
          follow them in the right way. The church of God tries to take care of
          you because you are orphans, and God has promised to be the father of
          the fatherless: O dear boys give him your hearts. Some of you have
          godly mothers, I know them, and I know that they pray for you. May
          their prayers be heard for you. I hope you will trust the Savior, and
          grow up to serve him. May it not be long before you profess your faith
          in baptism; and may we all of us meet in glory above, everyone without
          exception. The Lord grant it, for Christ's sake. Amen.
        </p>
        <p>PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON -- Acts 16:6-40.</p>
        <p>
          Mr. Spurgeon begs to inform his friends that the usual Almanack is now
          ready for 1872, and also a sheet for the walls, by John Ploughman.
          Both are to be had for one penny each, and it is hoped that their
          circulation will do good both spiritually and morally. Friends are
          requested to circulate them. They are both published by Messrs.
          Passmore and Alabaster, and may be had of all booksellers.
