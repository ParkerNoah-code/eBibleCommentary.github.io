          1. Now this being is the Creator (Demiurgus), who is, in respect of
          His love, the Father; but in respect of His power, He is Lord; and in
          respect of His wisdom, our Maker and Fashioner; by transgressing whose
          commandment we became His enemies. And therefore in the last times the
          Lord has restored us into friendship through His incarnation, having
          become "the Mediator between God and men;" propitiating indeed for us
          the Father against whom we had sinned, and cancelling (consolatus) our
          disobedience by His own obedience; conferring also upon us the gift of
          communion with, and subjection to, our Maker. For this reason also He
          has taught us to say in prayer, "And forgive us our debts;" since
          indeed He is our Father, whose debtors we were, having transgressed
          His commandments. But who is this Being? Is He some unknown one, and a
          Father who gives no commandment to any one? Or is He the God who is
          proclaimed in the Scriptures, to whom we were debtors, having
          transgressed His commandment? Now the commandment was given to man by
          the Word. For Adam, it is said, "heard the voice of the Lord God."
          Rightly then does His Word say to man, "Thy sins are forgiven thee;"
          He, the same against whom we had sinned in the beginning, grants
          forgiveness of sins in the end. But if indeed we had disobeyed the
          command of any other, while it was a different being who said, "Thy
          sins are forgiven thee;" such an one is neither good, nor true, nor
          just. For how can he be good, who does not give from what belongs to
          himself? Or how can he be just, who snatches away the goods of
          another? And in what way can sins be truly remitted, unless that He
          against whom we have sinned has Himself granted remission "through the
          bowels of mercy of our God," in which "He has visited us" through His
          Son?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. And therefore, when He had healed the man sick of the palsy, [the
          evangelist] says "The people upon seeing it glorified God, who gave
          such power unto men." What God, then, did the bystanders glorify? Was
          it indeed that unknown Father invented by the heretics? And how could
          they glorify him who was altogether unknown to them? It is evident,
          therefore, that the Israelites glorified Him who has been proclaimed
          as God by the law and the prophets, who is also the Father of our
          Lord; and therefore He taught men, by the evidence of their senses
          through those signs which He accomplished, to give glory to God. If,
          however, He Himself had come from another Father, and men glorified a
          different Father when they beheld His miracles, He [in that case]
          rendered them ungrateful to that Father who had sent the gift of
          healing. But as the only-begotten Son had come for man's salvation
          from Him who is God, He did both stir up the incredulous by the
          miracles which He was in the habit of working, to give glory to the
          Father; and to the Pharisees, who did not admit the advent of His Son,
          and who consequently did not believe in the remission [of sins] which
          was conferred by Him, He said, "That ye may know that the Son of man
          hath power to forgive sins." And when He had said this, He commanded
          the paralytic man to take up the pallet upon which he was lying, and
          go into his house. By this work of His He confounded the unbelievers,
          and showed that He is Himself the voice of God, by which man received
          commandments, which he broke, and became a sinner; for the paralysis
          followed as a consequence of sins.

          3. Therefore, by remitting sins, He did indeed heal man, while He also
          manifested Himself who He was. For if no one can forgive sins but God
          alone, while the Lord remitted them and healed men, it is plain that
          He was Himself the Word of God made the Son of man, receiving from the
          Father the power of remission of sins; since He was man, and since He
          was God, in order that since as man He suffered for us, so as God He
          might have compassion on us, and forgive us our debts, in which we
          were made debtors to God our Creator. And therefore David said
          beforehand, "Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose
          sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord has not imputed
          sin;" pointing out thus that remission of sins which follows upon His
          advent, by which "He has destroyed the handwriting" of our debt, and
          "fastened it to the cross;" so that as by means of a tree we were made
          debtors to God, [so also] by means of a tree we may obtain the
          remission of our debt.

          4. This fact has been strikingly set forth by many others, and
          especially through means of Elisha the prophet. For when his
          fellow-prophets were hewing wood for the construction of a tabernacle,
          and when the iron [head], shaken loose from the axe, had fallen into
          the Jordan and could not be found by them, upon Elisha's coming to the
          place, and learning what had happened, he threw some wood into the
          water. Then, when he had done this, the iron part of the axe floated
          up, and they took up from the surface of the water what they had
          previously lost. By this action the prophet pointed out that the sure
          word of God, which we had negligently lost by means of a tree, and
          were not in the way of finding again, we should receive anew by the
          dispensation of a tree, [viz., the cross of Christ]. For that the word
          of God is likened to an axe, John the Baptist declares [when he says]
          in reference to it, "But now also is the axe laid to the root of the
          trees." Jeremiah also says to the same purport: "The word of God
          cleaveth the rock as an axe." This word, then, what was hidden from
          us, did the dispensation of the tree make manifest, as I have already
          remarked. For as we lost it by means of a tree, by means of a tree
          again was it made manifest to all, showing the height, the length, the
          breadth, the depth in itself; and, as a certain man among our
          predecessors observed, "Through the extension of the hands of a divine
          person, gathering together the two peoples to one God." For these were
          two hands, because there were two peoples scattered to the ends of the
          earth; but there was one head in the middle, as there is but one God,
          who is above all, and through all, and in us all.
