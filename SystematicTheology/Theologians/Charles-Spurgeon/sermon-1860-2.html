        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.287)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, December 4th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "Thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee." -- Psalm 9:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          THERE ARE MANY MEN who are exceedingly well read in heathen
          mythologies; who can tell you the history of any one of the heathen
          gods, but who at the same time know very little of the history of
          Jehovah, and cannot rehearse his mighty acts. In our schools to this
          day there are books put into the hands of our youth that are by no
          means fit for them to read -- books which contain all kinds of filth,
          and if not always filth, yet all kinds of fables and vanities, which
          are simply put into our hands when we are lads, because they happen to
          be written in Latin and Greek; and, therefore, I suppose it is
          imagined that we shall all the better recollect the wickedness that is
          contained in them, by having the trouble of translating them into our
          own mother tongue. I would that instead of this, all our youth were
          made acquainted with the history of the Lord our God. Would that we
          could give them for classics some books which record what he hath
          done, the victories of his glorious arm, and how he hath put to nought
          the gods of the heathen and cast them down even into the depths. At
          any rate, the Christian will always find it to be useful to have at
          hand some history of what God did in the days of yore. The more you
          know of God's attributes, the more you understand of his acts; the
          more you treasure up of his promises, and the more you fully dive into
          the depths of his covenant, the more difficult will it become for
          Satan to tempt you to despondency and despair. Acquaint thyself with
          God and be at peace. Meditate on his law both day and night, and thou
          shalt be like a tree planted by the rivers of water; thy leaf shall
          not wither; thou shalt bring forth fruit in thy season, and whatsoever
          thou doest shall prosper. Ignorance of God is ignorance of bliss; but
          knowledge of God is a divine armor, by which we are able to ward off
          all the blows of the enemy. Know thyself, O man, and that will make
          thee miserable; know thy God, O Christian, and that will make thee
          rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.

          Now, this morning, in addressing you, I shall divide my text into
          three parts. First, I shall note a certain fiery dart of Satan;
          secondly, I shall point out to you heaven's divine buckler, as hinted
          at in the text -- "Thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee;"
          and then, in the third place, I shall notice man's precious privilege
          of seeking God, and so of arming himself against Satan.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, I am to dwell for a little time upon A CERTAIN FIERY
          DART OF SATAN WHICH IS CONSTANTLY SHOT AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF GOD.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many temptations, there are many suggestions and
          insinuations; and all these are arrows from the bow of the Evil one.
          But there is one temptation which exceeds all others, there is one
          suggestion which is more Satanic, more skilfully used in effecting the
          purposes of Satan than any other. That suggestion is the one referred
          to in these words of the Psalmist -- viz., this, the suggestion to
          believe that God has forsaken us. If all the other arrows of hell
          could be put into one quiver, there would not be so much deadly poison
          in the whole as in this one. When Satan has used up every other
          weapon, he always betakes himself to this last, most sharp, moat
          deadly instrument. He goes to the child of God and pours into his ear
          this dark insinuation, "Thy God has forsaken thee quite; thy Lord will
          be gracious no more."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I shall remark with regard to this arrow, that it is one that is
          very often shot from Satan's bow. Some of us have been wounded by it
          scores of times in our life. Whenever we have fallen into any sin,
          have been overtaken by some sudden wind of temptation, and have
          staggered and almost fallen, Conscience pricks us and tells us we have
          done wrong. Our heart, like David's heart, smites us. We fall upon our
          knees, and acknowledge our fault and confess our sin. Then it is that
          Satan lets fly this arrow, which comes whizzing up from hell and
          enters into the soul, and while we are making the confession, the dark
          thought crosses our soul, "God has forsaken thee; he will never accept
          thee again. Thou hast sinned so foully that he will blot thy name out
          of the covenant; thou hast stumbled so fearfully that thy feet shall
          never stand upon the rock again -- thou hast stumbled to thy fall;
          thou hast fallen to thy fell destruction." Have you not known this,
          Christian? When for a season you have been led to backslide, when you
          have lost your first love and have become degenerate, when you have
          put out your hand to touch the unlawful thing through some sudden
          surprisal -- has not this been thrown in your teeth?" Ah, wretch that
          you are, God will never forgive that sin: you have been so ungrateful,
          such a hypocrite, such a liar against the Lord your God, that now --
          now he will cast you away, throw you upon a dunghill like salt that
          has lost its savor, and as fit for nothing." Ah, friends, you and I
          know what this means. And I dare say David did too. He had to feel all
          the power of this poisoned arrow after his great sin, when he went up
          to his chamber and wept and bemoaned himself, and there cried out in
          agony, "Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my
          sin." A select opportunity this for shooting this arrow. Just where
          the sin has been Satan marks, and then he sends a suggestion. Wherever
          there is a wound of sin, it is wonderful how this arrow will work, and
          what a burning it will give to our blood till every vein becomes a
          road for the hot feet of pain to travel on, and all our flesh is made
          to tingle with this evil thought, "I have sinned, and the reprover of
          man has reproved me to my face and cast me from his presence, and he
          will be gracious to me no more." Another season when Satan usually
          shoots this arrow is the time of great trouble. There is a broad river
          across your path, and you are bidden to ford it. You go in and you
          find the water is up to your knees. Anon, as you wade on it becomes
          breast-high. But you comfort yourself with this thought, "When thou
          passest through the waters I will be with thee; and through the
          rivers, they shall not overflow thee." Cheered with this you go on;
          but you sink, and the water becomes deeper still. At last, it is
          almost gurgling in your throat! it is flowing over your very
          shoulders. Just then, when in the very deepest part of the stream,
          Satan appears on the bank, takes out his bow and shoots this fiery
          arrow. -- "Thy God has forsaken thee." "Oh," saith the Christian, "I
          feared not as long as I heard the voice saying, Fear not, for I am
          with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God.' But now," saith he, "my
          God hath forsaken me." And now the Christian begins to sink indeed,
          and if it be not for the mighty power of God, it will not be Satan's
          fault if he doth not drown thee in the midst of the flood. What a
          malicious devil is this, that must always send us a fresh trouble, and
          most grievous of all, send it when we are in our very worst distress.
          He is a coward, indeed; he always hits a man when he is down. When I
          am up and on my feet I am more than a match for Satan, but when I
          begin to stumble through great trouble, out comes the dragon from the
          pit, and begins to roar at me, and to draw his sword, and hurl his
          fiery darts; for now, says he, "man's extremity shall be my
          opportunity; now that his heart and flesh fails -- now will I make a
          full end of him." You also know, some of you, what that means. You
          could bear the trouble well, but you could not bear the dreary thought
          that God has forsaken you in your trouble. Another season, too, in
          which Satan shoots this fiery dart is before some great labor. I am
          often vexed and perplexed with this dark thought when I have to appear
          before you on the Sabbath day; I frequently come here with that
          ringing in my ears: -- "God will forsake thee; thou shalt fall before
          the congregation; the word shall not go home with power; thou shalt
          labor in vain, and spend thy strength for nought." Thousands of times
          have I preached the gospel, yet to this day does that same arrow come
          flying up, and still does it vex and perplex my heart. If there be
          anything greater for a Christian to do, than he has been accustomed to
          do in former times, it is generally then that Satan levels this
          battle, when there is a deep soil to be ploughed, and the plough it
          heavy, and the oxen are faint, and the ploughman thinks he shall not
          accomplish his weary work, then it is that up comes this dark thought
          -- "The Lord hath forsaken thee, and where art thou now?" The like
          doth he do at another season, namely, times of unanswered prayer. You
          have been up to God's throne asking for a blessing; you have been
          five, six, twelve times, and you have had no answer; you go again; and
          you are just wrestling with God and the blessing seems as if it must
          come; but no, it does not come, and you bring your burden away on your
          back once more. You have been wont to cast all your cares upon God,
          and come away rejoicing; but now you find that prayer hath no return
          of blessing; it seems to be a waste of words. Then up comes Satan,
          just at the moment, and he says, "God hath forsaken you, if you were a
          child of God, he would answer your prayer; he would not leave you
          crying so long in the dark as this, if you were one of his beloved
          children. Why, he hears his people! Look at Elijah how he heard him.
          Remember Jacob; how he wrestled with the angel and prevailed. Oh,"
          says Satan, "God has forsaken thee." Ah, Satan we have heard that
          aforetime. "Yes, but," says he, "his mercy is clean gone for ever. The
          heavens have become like brass, the Shekinah is gone up from between
          the wings of the cherubim, his house is left empty and void; Ichabod
          is written on thy closet; thou shalt never have an answer again. Go
          speak to the winds, spread your griefs to the pitiless sea, for God's
          ear is shut, and he will never move his arm to work deliverance for
          thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, am I not justified in saying that this arrow is very often shot.
          I may not have mentioned all the instances in which it has been shot
          at you, but I am certain that if you are a child of God, there have
          been times and seasons when this desperate insinuation has come up
          from hell -- "God hath forgotten thee: he hath cast thee off: thou art
          left to thyself, and thou shalt perish." At any rate, if you have
          never said it, remember it is written in God's word that Zion saith
          "My God hath forgotten me;" and call to your recollection that
          gracious answer "Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should
          not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet
          will I not forget thee." The arrow; then, is often shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then let me remark with regard to this arrow, again that it is most
          grievous. Other troubles only wound the Christian's' flesh; they do
          but pierce with skin deep wounds; but this is a shot that goes right
          deep into his heart. When Satan is shooting other arrows we can laugh
          at him, for they rattle against our buckler; but this one finds out
          the joints of the harness, and it goes right through from one side to
          the other, till we are compelled to say, "As with a sword in my bones,
          mine enemies reproach one; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy
          God?" This is hitting the target in the very center. This is skillful
          riflery, indeed, when Satan is able to send this arrow right into the
          eve of the soul. Other troubles are like surface storms. They toss the
          ocean into an apparent storm, and there are big waves on the top, but
          all is still and calm down in the caverns beneath. But this dark
          thought makes the ocean boil to its very bottom; it stirs the soul up
          until there is not one place in which there is rest; neither a cavern
          of the heart, nor a corner of the conscience in which the spirit has
          peace. This arrow, I say, is one of hell's masterpieces, there is more
          craft and skill in it than aught else Satan has ever done. It is the
          worst of his arrows because it grieves the Spirit exceedingly. And
          there is another thought I must throw out. Not only is this arrow
          grievous, but it is very dangerous. For if, my brethren, we believe
          this accusation against God, it is not long before we begin to sin.
          Let the Christian know that his God is with him, and temptation will
          have little power, but when God has forsaken us, as we think that he
          has, ah! then, when Satan offers us some back door by which to escape
          from our troubles, how very easily shall we be tempted to adopt his
          expedients. A merchant who knows that his God is with him, may see
          trade going from him, and his house verging to bankruptcy, but he will
          not do a dishonest thing. But let him imagine that God is against him,
          then Satan will say, "See, merchant, one of God's children, you have
          been deceived, he will never help you;" and then, he is tempted to do
          something which in his conscience he knows to be wrong. "God will not
          deliver me," he says; "then I will try to deliver myself." There is
          great danger in this. Take heed to yourself then that ye "take unto
          you the whole armor of God," and "above all, take the shield of faith,
          wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the
          wicked." I will make but one other observation upon this fiery dart;
          and that is, it bears the full impression of its Satanic maker. None
          but the devil could be the author of such a thought as this -- that
          God has forsaken his people. Look it in the face, Christian, and see
          if it has not got the horns of the Evil One stamped on its brow? Does
          not the cloven foot peep out? Look at it; why, it is the devil's own
          child. Why, bethink thee, Christian, this Evil One is making thee
          doubt thy own Father. He is bidding thee distrust a faithful God. He
          is calling in question the promise which says, "I will never leave
          thee, nor forsake thee." He is making you accuse God of perjury. As if
          he could break his oath, and run back from the covenant which he has
          made with Christ on thy behalf. Why, none but the devil could have the
          impudence to suggest such a thought as that. Cast it from thee,
          believer; fling it away to the very depths of the sea; it is unworthy
          of thee to harbor it for a moment. Thy God forsake thee? Impossible!
          He is too good. Thy God forsake thee? It is utterly impossible! He is
          too true. Could he forsake his children, he would have forsaken his
          integrity; he would have ceased to be God, when he ceased to succor
          and help his own. Rest thou, then, in that, and ward the fiery dart
          off; for hellish, indeed, it is, and the name of its maker is stamped
          upon it legibly.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. In the second place, let me notice THE DIVINE BUCKLER WHICH GOD
          HAS PROVIDED FOR HIS CHURCH AGAINST THIS FIERY DART. Here it is; it is
          the fact that God never has forsaken them that fear him, and that,
          moreover, he never will do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah, my brethren, if we could but once believe the doctrine that the
          child of God might fall from grace and perish everlastingly, we might,
          indeed, shut up our Bible in despair. To what purpose would my
          preaching be -- the preaching of a rickety gospel like that? To what
          purpose your faith -- a faith in a God that cannot and would not carry
          on to the end? To what use the blood of Christ, if it were shed in
          vain, and did not bring the blood-bought ones securely home? To what
          purpose the Spirit, if he were not omnipotent enough to overcome our
          wandering, to arrest our sins and make us perfect, and present us
          faultless before the throng of God at last? That doctrine of the final
          perseverance of the saints is, I believe, as thoroughly bound up with
          the standing or falling of the gospel, as is the article of
          justification by faith. Give that up and I see no gospel left. I see
          no beauty in religion that is worthy of my acceptance, or that
          deserves my admiration. An unchanging God, an everlasting covenant, a
          sure mercy, these are the things that my soul delights in, and I know
          your hearts love to feed upon them. But take these away, and what have
          we? We have a foundation of wood, hay, straw, and stubble. We have
          nothing solid. We have a fort of earth-works, a mud hovel through
          which the thief may break and steal away our treasures. Nay, this
          foundation stands sure -- "The Lord knoweth them that are his;" and he
          doth so know them that he will certainly bring them every one to his
          right hand at last in glory everlasting.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to return to our text, and to offer you some few words of comfort
          which may tend to quench the fiery dart of the wicked one. The
          psalmist says, "Thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee." I
          call up before you now, one by one as witnesses, the saints of God in
          the olden time. You are in great trouble to-day and Satan suggests
          that now God has forsaken you. Come hither, Jacob! we read thy
          testimony. Wast thou a man of trouble? "Ah," saith he, "few and evil
          were my days." Evil, man? -- what meanest thou? "I mean that they were
          full of sorrow, full of perplexity, full of fear and trouble." And
          what is thy testimony, Jacob? We have heard that thou didst seek God
          in prayer. Didst thou not wrestle with the angel at the brook Jabbok,
          and prevail? Speak, man, and tell these doubting hearts, did God
          forsake thee? Methinks I see that hoary patriarch lifting up his
          hands, and he cries, "I trembled to meet my brother, Esau. I stayed at
          the brook Jabbok, and I said, Lord, give deliverance from him whom I
          think bloodthirsty.' I crossed the brook full of fear and trembling,
          but tell it, O let it be known for the comfort of others in like
          trouble with me, I met my brother Esau, and he fell upon my neck and
          kissed me. He would not take the tribute which I offered him. He
          became my friend and we loved each other. God had turned his heart,
          and he took no vengeance upon me. But," continued the patriarch, "I
          was always a doubting man, I was always a careful man; I had so much
          cunning and craft about me that I could not trust anything in the
          hands of my Covenant God, and this always brought me into care and
          trouble. but," says he, "I bear my witness that I never had need to
          have troubled myself at all; if I had but left it all in the hand of
          God, all would have been well. I remember," saith he, "and I tell it
          to you now, when my son Joseph was sold into Egypt what sorrow I had
          in my heart, for I said, My grey hairs shall be brought with sorrow to
          the grave, for Joseph my son is, without a doubt, rent in pieces.' And
          then it happened on a day that Simeon was taken away from me; and
          there came a message out of Egypt that Benjamin must go down. And I
          remember well what I said Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and now
          they will take Benjamin away. All these things are against me.' But
          they were not against me," says the old man, "they were for me, every
          one of them. Joseph, that I said was not, was; he was sitting upon the
          throne; he had prepared for me a habitation in Egypt. As for Simeon,
          he was a hostage there; and that was not against me, for perhaps I
          should scarce have sent my sons down at all if it had not been for the
          hope that they would bring Simeon back. And now," says Jacob, "I
          retract every word I have said against the Lord my God, and I stand
          before you to bear my testimony that not one good thing hath failed of
          all that the Lord God hath promised. My shoes were iron and brass, and
          as my days so was my strength."

          I hear a mourner say, "Mine is not a case of trouble and sorrow; mine
          is a case of duty. I have a duty to perform that is too heavy for me,
          and I am afraid I shall never accomplish it." Here comes another of
          the ancients to bear his witness. It is Moses; let him speak. "I
          thought," said he, "when God called me from keeping the flocks of my
          father in the desert by the mount of Horeb, I thought I never could be
          strong enough for the office to which I had been ordained. I said unto
          my Lord, who am I, that I should go unto Pharoah? And I said unto him
          again, Lord, thou knowest I am not eloquent; the children of Israel
          will not believe me, for I shall not have skill enough in oratory to
          persuade them to follow my words. But the Lord said, Certainly I will
          be with thee. And lo," says Moses, "as my days so was my strength. I
          had strength enough to stand before Pharoah, strength enough to shake
          the whole land of Egypt, and strength enough to divide the Red Sea and
          drown all Pharoah's hosts. I had strength enough to endure with an
          evil generation forty years in the wilderness, strength enough to take
          their idol god and grind it in pieces, and make them drink the water
          upon which I had strewn the atoms. I had strength enough to lead them
          on from day to day, to command the rock and it gushed with water, to
          speak to the heavens and they sent down the manna. And when I went up
          at last to my grave, and looked from the top of Nebo, I, who had once
          been fearful, saw with transport the land to which the Lord's people
          had been brought, and my soul was taken away with a kiss, and I
          departed in peace." Hear that, then, O laboring one; the God that
          helped Moses will help thee. Moses sought God, and God did not forsake
          him; nor will he forsake thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          But saith another, "I am exposed to slander, men speak evil of me; no
          lie is too bad for them to utter against me." Ah, my friend, permit me
          to refer you to another ancient saint; it is the saint who wrote this
          psalm -- David. Let him stand up and speak. "Ah!" saith he "from the
          first day when I went forth to fight Goliath even to the end of my
          life I was the subject of shame and slander. Doeg the Edomite, Saul,
          and multitudes of men, the men of Belial, like Shimei, all accused me.
          I was the song of the drunkard; I was the harlot's jest. Nothing was
          too bad for David. All mine enemies went round about the city like
          dogs, that bay all night and rest not even at morning." And what didst
          thou do, David? "Oh," said he, "I said, My soul, wait thou only upon
          God, for my expectation is from him.'" And didst thou prove that God
          was thy deliverer? "Ah, yes -- yes," saith he, "I have pursued my
          enemies, and I have overtaken them.' Thou hast smitten all my enemies
          upon the cheek-bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.'" And
          so shall you find it, my hearers, God has not forsaken you, even
          though you be slandered. Remember it is the lot of God's greatest
          servants to bear the worst character amongst worldlings. Whose
          character is safe in these days? What man among us may not be accused
          of any indecency? Who among us can hope to stand immaculate when liars
          are so rife, and charges are so abundant? Be content and bear the
          slander. Remember, the higher the tower the longer will be the shadow;
          and often, the higher a man's character the fouler will be the slander
          that comes out against him. But remember, "no weapon that is formed
          against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against
          thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the
          servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the
          Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          If ye need any other witnesses I could bring them. Let Shadrach,
          Meshech, and Abednego come forth. Ye Hebrew children, ye stood in the
          midst of coals when the furnace was white with heat; did God forsake
          you? "No," they say, "our hair was not singed, nor had the smell of
          fire passed on our garments." Speak, O Daniel! Thou didst stand a
          night in the midst of the furious lions, who had been starved for days
          that they might devour thee in their hunger; what sayest thou? "My
          God," saith he, "hath sent his angel to shut the lions' mouths; my
          God, whom I serve, hath not forsaken me." But time would fail me if I
          should tell you of those who have "shut the mouths of lions, quenched
          the violence of fire, obtained promises, wrought victories, put to
          flight the armies of aliens; "yet we might enlarge for a moment upon
          the history of great martyrs. Has God left one of them? They have
          suffered at the stake; their limbs have been stretched on the rack;
          every nerve has been strained; every bone has been dislocated. They
          have had their eyes plucked out; they have had their flesh rent away
          piecemeal to the bone with hot pincers, they have been dragged at the
          heels of horses, burnt on gridirons, hung up before slow fires. They
          have seen their infants cut in pieces before their eyes, their wives
          and daughters ravished, their houses burned, their country laid
          desolate. But has God forsaken them? Has the world triumphed? Has God
          left his children? "Nay, in all these things we are more than
          conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither
          death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things
          present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other
          creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is
          in Christ Jesus our Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          Another question is suggested, however, for your comfort, Christian; I
          have brought many witnesses to prove that Christ does not forsake his
          children; let me ask you to step into the witness box. You say that
          God has forsaken you -- I will put a question or two to you. When your
          wife lay sick, and there were three little ones in the house and she
          approached to death, and you cried in agony to God and said, "God,
          thou hast forsaken me. My business fails me, and now my wife is to be
          taken from me! what shall I do with these little ones?" Answer this
          question; did God forsake you then? "Nay," you say, "my wife still
          lives, she was restored to me." But when one of your children lay
          a-dying and the others were seized with fever, you then said, "My wife
          again is sick; what shall I do with this house of sickness? Now, God
          has forsaken me. I shall never bear this trial." Did you bear it? "Oh,
          yes," say you, "I passed through it and I can say, Blessed be the name
          of God, the affliction was sanctified to me.'" Do you recollect the
          heavy loss you sustained in business? Not one but many; loss came
          after loss; every speculation in which you had been engaged broke down
          under you. You had many bills coming in, and you said. "Now, I shall
          not be able to meet them; and as a Christian man you shuddered to
          think of bankruptcy. You even went up with your wife into your chamber
          -- and you two went on your knees and poured out your case before God,
          and asked him to help you. Did God leave you? "No," say you, "as by a
          miracle I was delivered I cannot tell how it was, but I came out of it
          clean." And yet again, another question to another one of you. Do you
          remember when you were in sin, before you had received pardon, your
          guilt was heavy upon you, and you sought God and cried to him. Did God
          deny you? "No," you say, "blessed be his name, I can remember the
          happy day when he said your sins which are many are all forgiven.'"
          Well, you have often sinned since then. But let me ask you, when you
          have made confession of sin, have you not been restored? has he not
          lifted up upon you once more the light of his countenance? "Well," you
          say, "I must say he has." Then, I ask you in the name of everything
          that is true and holy, nay, in the name of everything that is
          reasonable, how dare you say that God has forsaken you now? Retract
          the word! Slay the thought! It cannot, must not be --
        </p>
        <p>"Each sweet Ebenezer you have in review,</p>
        <p>Confirms his good pleasure to help you quite through."</p>
        <p>
          He would not have done this much for you, if he meant to leave you.
          Thus, it cannot be, that he who has been with you in six troubles will
          leave you in the seventh. He has not brought you through so many fires
          to let you be burned at last. Nay, take heart --
        </p>
        <p>"His grace shall to the end</p>
        <p>Stronger and brighter shine,</p>
        <p>Not present things, nor things to come,</p>
        <p>Shall quench the spark divine "</p>
        <p>
          within thy heart; much less quench the fire even which still burns in
          his infinite breast. God hath not forsaken thee as yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still further to drive the thought away, I will very rapidly run
          through a few precious things. Were you not cold on your way hither
          this morning. Did you not see the snow upon the ground, and do you
          dare to doubt God? He hath said, "While the earth remaineth, seed time
          and harvest, summer and winter, cold and heat shall never cease;" and
          he keeps his word. And yet you think, though he keeps that word he
          will forget the word that he has spoken concerning you. You come here
          in trouble this morning. Do you not see that God is true? that your
          very trouble is a proof that he has not forsaken you? If you never had
          any trouble, then God would have broken his promise, for did not Jesus
          Christ leave you it as a legacy? "In the world ye shall have
          tribulation." There, you have got it. That proves that God is true.
          Now, you have a part of the legacy, you shall have the rest: -- "In
          the world ye shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer; I have
          overcome the world." So that the very weather without, and your
          troubles within, ought to forbid your doubting the faithfulness of
          your God. But look here. Has not God made you a promise, saying, "I
          will never leave thee nor forsake thee?" Would you like to be called a
          promise-breaker? Shall I point my finger at you, and say, "There's a
          man whose word is not to be relied on?" Will you point that same
          finger to God, and say, "His word is not to be taken, he is not to be
          trusted?" What! do you think your God is dishonorable? that he will
          give a promise and break it? not keep it? forget it? fail to remember
          it? What! God, the God of glory, prove dishonorable? It must not,
          cannot be. Recollect, again, he has given you his oath. Can you think
          that he will break that? Because he could swear by no greater he sware
          by himself. Shall God be perjured? You would not think that of your
          meanest fellow-creature; will you think that of your greatest and best
          friend? Again, would you leave your child? would you forsake it
          utterly? You might hide your face from it for awhile to do it good,
          because it had been disobedient. but will you chasten your child
          always? never kiss it, never caress it, never call it your loved one?
          It is not in a father's heart to be always angry with his child. And
          will God forsake you? Will he cast you out into this wide, desolate
          world and let you die and become the prey of his great enemy? Oh,
          think not so hardly of your Father. If any man should come to me, and
          tell me that my father had said such-and-such things about me unkind
          and disrespectful, I would show him the door, and say, "Get thee gone!
          my father would never do that: he loves me too much to do that." And
          when the devil comes and says, "Your Father has forgotten you," tell
          him to begone -- you know too much of your Father ever to believe
          that. Say to him, "Get thee gone! it cannot be; get thee gone, Satan!
          Tell it to thy own companions, but tell it not to the heir of heaven."
          Then again, Christian, Thou believest that God has loved thee from
          before the foundation of the world; and yet after having loved you so
          long he has left off loving you now. Strange thing! Love without a
          beginning, yet such love to have an end. Singular thing! Eternal at
          one end and temporal at the other. Strange supposition! Put it away
          from thee. Besides, again, can Christ forget thee! Art thou not a
          member of his body, of his flesh and his bones? Has the Head forgotten
          a finger? Has he, who did hang upon the tree and who wrote thy name in
          wounds upon his hand and on his side, has he forgotten? What! Jesus
          thy own brother, thy husband, thy head, thy all, what! he forget? he
          forsake? Down blaspheming thought! Back to the hell from which thou
          dost spring! Down! down! down! My soul lifts up her head triumphantly,
          and cries, "Thou Lord hast not forsaken them that seek thee," nor wilt
          thou do so, world without end.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I now come to the third and last point, and on this I shall dwell
          very briefly -- MAN'S PRECIOUS PRIVILEGE TO SEEK GOD IN HIS DAY OF
          TROUBLE.
        </p>
        <p>
          To what use, to what purpose is the buckler if we wear it not? Of what
          service the shield if it be permitted to rust in the house? We must
          take hold upon the promise of a faithful God; we must seize the
          comfort which he offers; but how is it to be done? Why, in prayer.
          Seek ye the Lord ye tried and troubled ones, and ye shall soon find
          your troubles stayed, your trials sweetly alleviated. We go rambling
          round, and round, and round, to find peace. Would that we could stay
          at home in our closets with our God; we should find peace much better
          there. We go to our neighbors, we call our friends, we tell them our
          woes and ask their sympathy
        </p>
        <p>"Were half the breath that's vainly spent,</p>
        <p>To heaven in supplication sent,</p>
        <p>Our cheerful song would oftener be,</p>
        <p>Hear what the Lord hath done for me."</p>
        <p>
          Go Christian brother in your troubles and seek God. It is not possible
          that you can perish praying. If you could perish singing, you could
          not perish praying on your knees. Think ye that while you can plead a
          Father's love, and cry with the Spirit of adoption to him, that you
          can be forsaken? If you forsake the throne, then may you indeed have a
          fear that you are forsaken. But when the Spirit draws you to the
          mercy-seat, such a fear must vanish, for if thou art at the
          mercy-seat, God is there too. God loves the mercy-seat better than
          thou dost. He dwelleth between the cherubim; thou only goest there
          sometimes. But that is his abiding-place, his mercy-seat, where he
          always sits. Go thou, then, I tell thee, and thou canst not be
          destroyed; thy ruin is impossible, whilst thou dost cry, "Let us
          pray!"
        </p>
        <p>
          And have I here this morning some that are oppressed with guilt? Dear
          hearer, however great your sins may have been, if thou dost seek God,
          thou canst not perish, for "thou Lord, hast not forsaken them that
          seek thee." Methinks, I hear some one say, "Oh, that just suits me. I
          fear I have no faith; I am afraid I don't repent as I ought. But I
          know I seek Christ; I am sure I am seeking him." Ah! so then this
          promise is thine. Take it home with thee. Suck it; get at its juice.
          Here, indeed, is a cluster full of new wine for thee. Take it home
          with thee: -- "Thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee."
          Seek, and ye shall find, knock, and the door shall surely be opened to
          you.
        </p>
        <p>May God now grant his blessing, for Jesu's sake. Amen.</p>
