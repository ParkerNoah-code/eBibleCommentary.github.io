        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.219)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Evening, September 14th, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>DEARLY BELOVED,</p>
        <p>
          It hath pleased the Lord by a painful illness to interrupt for a
          little while my usual labors. As I was unable to preach last Lord's
          day, accept this week the issue of an old sermon. Though it has been
          buried in my publisher's warehouse for two years, I pray God it may
          bud afresh and bring forth fruit, even as old corn after having been
          entombed in Egyptian sepulchres for centuries will often germinate
          again and yield an abundant crop. Ye have prayed for me. The Lord hath
          visited me in the chamber of affliction. I am recovering; and God
          knoweth "I long to see you, and impart unto you some spiritual gift;"
          and I trust that ere long "through your prayers I shall be given unto
          you."
        </p>
        <p>Yours in much affection,</p>
        <p>C. H. S.</p>
        <p>"This man receiveth sinners." -- Luke 15:2.</p>
        <p>
          IT WAS A SINGULAR GROUP which had gathered round our Saviour, when
          these words were uttered; for we are told by the evangelist -- "Then
          drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him." The
          publicans -- the very lowest grade, the public oppressors, scorned and
          hated by the meanest Jew -- these, together with the worst of
          characters, the scum of the streets and the very riff-raff of the
          society of Jerusalem, came around this mighty preacher, Jesus Christ,
          in order to listen to his words. On the outside of the throng there
          stood a few respectable people, who in those days were called
          Pharisees and Scribes -- men who were highly esteemed in the
          synagogues as rulers, and governors, and teachers. These looked with
          scorn upon the Preacher; and watched him with invidious eyes, to find
          some fault. If they could find none in him personally, yet they could
          easily find it in his congregation; his deportment towards them
          shocked their false notion of propriety, and when they observed that
          he was affable with the very worst of characters, that he spoke loving
          words to the most fallen of mankind, they said of him what they
          intended for a disgrace, albeit it was highly to his honour: "This man
          receiveth sinners." I believe that our Saviour could not have wished
          to have had a sentence uttered concerning him, more evidently true or
          more thoroughly consistent with his sacred commission. It is the exact
          portrait of his character; the hand of a master seems to have limned
          him to the very life. He is the man who "receiveth sinners." Many a
          true word has been spoken in jest, and many a true word has been
          spoken in slander. Men have said sometimes in jest, "There goes a
          saint;" but it has been true. They have said, "There goes one of your
          chosen ones, one of your elect," they meant it as a slander, but the
          doctrine they scandalized was to the person who received it a comfort;
          it was his glory and his honour. Now the Scribes and Pharisees wished
          to slander Christ; but in so doing they outstripped their intentions,
          and bestowed upon him a title of renown. "This man receiveth sinners,
          and eateth with them."
        </p>
        <p>
          This evening I shall divide my observations to you into three parts.
          First, the doctrine, that Christ receiveth sinners, which is a
          doctrine of holy writ. Secondly, the encouragement it affords the
          sinner; and thirdly, the exhortation naturally springing from it, to
          the same character.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, THE DOCTRINE. The doctrine is, not that Christ
          receiveth everybody, but that he "receiveth sinners." By that term we,
          in common parlance, understand everybody. It is in the present day
          quite fashionable for everybody to lie against what he believes, and
          to say he is a sinner, even when he believes himself to be a very
          respectable, well-to-do man, and does not conceive that he ever did
          anything very amiss in his life. It is a sort of orthodox confession
          for men to make, when they say that they are sinners; though they
          might just as well use one formula as another, or repeat words in a
          foreign tongue; for they mean no deep and heartfelt contrition. They
          have no true apprehension that they are sinners at all. These Scribes
          and Pharisees did virtually assert, that they were not sinners; they
          marked out the Publicans and the harlots, and the worthless, and they
          said, "These are sinners, we are not." "Very well," said Christ, "I
          endorse the distinction you have made. In your own opinion, you are
          not sinners; well, you shall stand exempt for the time from being
          called sinners -- I endorse your distinction. But I beg to inform you,
          that I came to save those very persons who, in their own estimation
          and in yours, are reckoned to be sinners." It is my belief that the
          doctrine of the text is this -- that Christ receives not the
          self-righteous, not the good, not the whole-hearted, not those who
          dream that they do not need a Saviour; but the broken in spirit, the
          contrite in heart -- those who are ready to confess that they have
          broken God's laws, and have merited his displeasure. These and these
          alone, Christ came to save; and I reassert the subject of last Sabbath
          evening -- that Jesus has died for such, and for none other; that he
          has shed his blood for those who are ready to confess their sins, and
          who do seek mercy through the open veins of his wounded body, but for
          none other did he designedly offer up himself upon the cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let us remark, beloved, that there is a very wise distinction on
          the part of God, that he hath been pleased thus to choose and call
          sinners to repentance, and not others. For this reason, none but these
          ever do come to him. There has never been such a miracle as a
          self-righteous man coming to Christ for mercy; none but those who want
          a Saviour ever did come. It stands to reason, that when men do not
          consider themselves in need of a Saviour, they never will approach his
          throne; and surely it is satisfactory enough for all purposes, that
          Christ should say he receiveth sinners, seeing that sinners are the
          only persons who will ever come to him for mercy, and therefore it
          would be useless for him to say that he would receive any but those
          who most assuredly will come.
        </p>
        <p>
          And mark, again, none but those can come; no man can come to Christ
          until he truly knows himself to be a sinner. The self-righteous man
          cannot come to Christ; for what is implied in coming to Christ?
          Repentance, trust in his mercy, and the denial of all confidence in
          one's self. Now, a self-righteous man cannot repent, and yet be
          self-righteous. He conceives that he has no sin; why, then, should he
          repent? Tell him to come to Christ with humble penitence, and he
          exclaims -- "Ay! you insult my dignity. Why should I approach to God?
          Wherein have I sinned? My knee shall not bend to seek for pardon,
          wherein I have not offended; this lip shall not seek forgiveness when
          I do not believe myself to have transgressed against God; I shall not
          ask for mercy." The self-righteous man cannot come to God; for his
          coming to God implies that he ceases to be self-righteous. Nor can a
          self-righteous man put his trust in Christ; why should he? Shall I
          trust in a Christ whom I do not require? It I be self-righteous, I
          need no Christ to save me in my own opinion. How, then, can I come
          with such a confession as this,
        </p>
        <p>"Nothing in my hands I bring,"</p>
        <p>
          when I have got my hands full. How can I say, "Wash me," when I
          believe myself white? How can I say "Heal me," when I think that I
          never was sick? How can I cry, "Give me freedom, give me liberty,"
          when I believe I never was a slave, and "never in bondage to any man?"
          It is only the man who knows his slavery by reason of the bondage of
          sin, and the man who knows himself to be sick even unto death by
          reason of the sense of guilt: it is only the man who feels he cannot
          save himself, who can with faith rely upon the Saviour. Nor can the
          self-righteous man renounce himself, and lay hold of Christ; because
          in the renunciation of himself he would at once become the very
          character whom Christ says he will receive. He would then put himself
          in the place of the sinner, when he cast away his own righteousness.
          Why, sirs, coming to Christ implies the taking off the polluted robe
          of our own righteousness, and putting on Christ's. How can I do that,
          if I wittingly wrap my own garment about me? and if in order to come
          to Christ I must forsake my own refuge and all my own hope, how can I
          do it, if I believe my hope to be good, and my refuge to be secure;
          and if I suppose that already I am clothed sufficiently to enter into
          the marriage supper of the Lamb? Nay, beloved, it is the sinner, and
          the sinner only, who can come to Christ; the self-righteous man cannot
          do it; it is quite out of his way -- he would not do it if he could.
          His very self-righteousness fetters his foot, so that he cannot come;
          palsies his arm, so that he cannot take hold of Christ; and blinds his
          eye, so that be cannot see the Saviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet another reason: if these people, who are not sinners, would come
          to Christ, Christ would get no glory from them. When the physician
          openeth his door for those who are sick, let me go there full of
          health; he can win no honour from me, because he cannot exert his
          skill upon me. The benevolent man may distribute all his wealth to the
          poor; but let some one go to him who has abundance, and he shall win
          no esteem from him for feeding the hungry, or for clothing the naked;
          since the applicant is neither hungry nor naked. If Jesus Christ
          proclaims that he giveth his grace unto all who come for it, surely it
          is sufficient, seeing that none will or can come for it, but those
          whose pressing necessities prompt them. Ay! sufficient; it is quite
          sufficient for his honour. A great sinner brings great glory to Christ
          when he is saved. A man who is no sinner, if he could attain to heaven
          would glorify himself, but he would not glorify Christ. The man who
          has no stains may plunge into the fountain; but he cannot magnify its
          cleansing power for he hath no stains to wash away. He that hath no
          guilt can never magnify the word "forgiveness." It is the sinner then,
          and the sinner only, who can glorify Christ; and hence "this man
          receiveth sinners," but it is not said that he receiveth any else. "He
          came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." This is
          the doctrine of the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          But allow us just to amplify that word: "this man receiveth sinners."
          Now, by that we understand that he receives sinners to all the
          benefits which he has purchased for them. If there be a fountain, he
          receives sinners to wash them in it; if there be medicine for the
          soul, he receives sinners to heal their diseases; if there be a house
          for the sick, an hospital, a lazar-house for the dying, he receives
          such into that retreat of mercy. All that he hath of love, all that he
          hath of mercy, all that he hath of atonement, all that he hath of
          sanctification, all that he bath of righteousness -- to all these he
          receives the sinner. Yea, more; not content with taking him to his
          house, he receives him to his heart. He takes the black and filthy
          sinner, and having washed him -- "There," he says, "thou art my
          beloved; my desire is towards thee." And to consummate the whole, at
          last he receives the saints to heaven. Saints, I said, but I meant
          those who were sinners, for none can be saints truly, but those who
          once were sinners, and have been washed in the blood of Christ, and
          made white through the sacrifice of the lamb.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe it then, beloved, that in receiving sinners we mean the whole
          of salvation; and this word in my text, "Christ receiveth sinners,"
          graspeth in the whole of the covenant. He receives them to the joys of
          paradise, to the bliss of the beatified, to the songs of the
          glorified, to an eternity of happiness for ever. "This man receiveth
          sinners;" and I dwell with special emphasis on this point, -- he
          receives none else. He will have none else to be saved but those who
          know themselves to be sinners. Full, free salvation is preached to
          every sinner in the universe; but I have no salvation to preach to
          those who will not acknowledge themselves to be sinners. To them I
          must preach the law, telling them that their righteousness is but as
          filthy rags, that their goodness shall pass away as the spider's web,
          and shall be broken in pieces, even as the egg of the ostrich is
          broken by the foot of the horse. "This man receiveth sinners," and
          receiveth none else.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, then, THE ENCOURAGEMENT. If this man receiveth sinners, poor
          sin-sick sinner, what a sweet word this is for thee! Sure, then, he
          will not reject thee. Come, let me encourage thee this night to come
          to my Master, to receive his great atonement, and to be clothed with
          all his righteousness. Mark: those whom I address, are the bona fide,
          real, actual sinners; not the complimentary sinners; not those who say
          they are sinners by way of pacifying, as they suppose, the
          religionists of the day; but I speak to those who feel their lost,
          ruined, hopeless condition. All these are now frankly and freely
          invited to come to Jesus Christ, and to be saved by him. Come, poor
          sinner, come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, because he has said he will receive you; I know your fears; we
          all felt them once, when we were coming to Christ. I know thou sayest
          in thy heart, "He will reject me. If I present my prayer, he will not
          hear me; if I cry unto him, yet peradventure the heavens will he as
          brass; I have been so great a sinner, that he will never take me into
          his house to dwell with him." Poor sinner! say not so; he hath
          published the decree. It is enough between man and man usually, if we
          count our fellow creatures honest, to obtain a promise. Sinner! is
          this not enough between thyself and the Son of God? He has said, "Him
          that cometh I will in nowise cast out." Durst thou not venture on that
          promise? Wilt thou not go to sea in a ship as staunch as this; he hath
          said it? It has been often and again the only comfort of the saints;
          on this they have lived, on this they have died: he hath said it.
          What! dost thou think Christ will lie unto thee? Would he tell thee he
          will receive thee, and yet not do so? Would he say, "My fatlings are
          killed, come ye to the supper," and yet shut the door in your face?
          No, if be has said he will cast out none that come to him; rest
          assured he cannot, he will not cast you out. Come, then, try his love
          on this ground, that he has said it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, and fear not, because remember, if thou feelest thyself to be a
          sinner, that feeling is God's gift; and therefore thou mayest very
          safely come to one who has already done so much to draw thee. A
          stranger calls at my house, he asks for alms, and he tells me at first
          very plainly, that he never saw me before, that he has no claim upon
          my generosity, but he throws himself entirely upon any benevolent
          feeling that I may chance to have in my breast. But if I had done
          anything for him before, he might say, supposing I were a rich man,
          "Sir, you have done so much for me, I think you will not give me up at
          last; I believe you will not let me starve, after so much love." Poor
          sinner! if thou feelest thy need of a Saviour, Christ made thee feel
          it; if thou hast a wish to come after Christ, Christ gave thee that
          wish; if thou hast any desire after God, God gave thee that desire; if
          thou canst sigh after Christ, Christ made thee sigh; if thou canst
          weep after Christ, Christ made thee weep. Ay, if thou canst only wish
          for him with the strong wish of one that fears he never can find, yet
          hopes he may -- if thou canst but hope for him, he has given thee that
          hope. And oh! wilt not thou come to him? Thou hast some of the king's
          bounties about thee now; come and plead what he hath done, there is no
          suit that can ever fail with God, when ye plead this. Tell him his
          past mercies urge you to try him in the future. Down on your knees,
          sinner, down on your knees; tell him this -- "Lord, I thank thee that
          I know myself to be a sinner; thou hast taught me that; I bless thee
          that I do not wrap up my sin, that I know it, that I feel it; that it
          is ever before me. Lord, wouldst thou make me see my sin, and not let
          me see my Saviour? What! wilt thou open the wound, and put in the
          lancet, and yet not heal me? What, Lord! hast thou said, I kill?' And
          hast thou not said in the same breath, I make alive.' Hast thou killed
          me, and wilt thou not make me alive?" Plead that, poor sinner, and
          thou wilt find it true, that "this man receiveth sinners."
        </p>
        <p>
          Doth not this suffice thee? Then here is another reason. I am sure
          "this man receiveth sinners," because he has received many, many,
          before you. See, there is Mercy's door; mark how many have been to it;
          you can almost hear the knocks upon the door now, like echoes of the
          past. You may remember how many way-worn travellers have called there
          for rest, how many famished souls have applied there for bread. Go,
          knock at Mercy's door, and ask the porter this question, "Was there
          ever one applied to the door that was refused?" I can assure you of
          the answer: "No, not one."
        </p>
        <p>"No sinner was ever empty sent back,</p>
        <p>Who came seeking mercy for Jesus's sake."</p>
        <p>
          And shalt thou be the first? Dost thou think God will forfeit his good
          name, by turning thee away? Mercy's gate has been open night and day,
          ever since man sinned; dost thou think it will be shut in thy face for
          the first time? Nay, man, go and try it; and if thou findest it is,
          come back and say, "Thou hast not read the Bible as thou oughtest to
          have done;" or else say thou hast found one promise there which has
          not been fulfilled -- for he said, "Him that cometh I will in nowise
          cast out." I do not believe there ever was in this world one who was
          suffered by God to say that he sought mercy of him sincerely, and did
          not find it. Nay more, I believe that such a being never shall exist,
          but whosoever cometh unto Christ shall most assuredly find mercy. What
          greater encouragement do you want? Do you want a salvation for those
          that will not come to be saved? Do you want blood sprinkled on those
          that will not come to Christ? You must want it, then; I will not
          preach it to you. I find it not in God's Word, and therefore I dare
          not.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, sinner, I have yet another plea to urge with thee why thou
          shouldst believe that Christ will receive all sinners who come to him.
          It is this, that he calls all such. Now if Christ calls us and bids us
          come, we may be sure he will not turn us away when we do come. Once on
          a time a blind man sat by the wayside begging. He heard -- for he
          could not see -- he heard the trampling of the many feet that were
          passing by him. He asked what all this meant: they said that Jesus of
          Nazareth passed by. Loudly did he cry, "Jesus, thou son of David, have
          mercy on me!" The ear of mercy was apparently deaf, and the Saviour
          walked on and heeded not the prayer. The poor man sat still then, but
          cried aloud, though he did not move. Yet when the Saviour said, "Come
          hither," ah! then he did not delay an instant. They said, "Arise, he
          calleth thee;" and, pushing them all aside, he made his way through
          the crowd, and offered the prayer, "Lord, let me receive my sight."
          Well, then, thou who feelest thyself to be lost and ruined, arise and
          speak; he calleth for thee. Convinced sinner, Christ says, "Come;" and
          that thou mayest be sure he says it, let us quote that Scripture
          again, "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
          Thou art called, man; then come. If Her Majesty were riding by, thou
          mightest scarcely presume to speak to her; but if thy name were
          called, and by her own lips, wouldst thou not go to her carriage, and
          what she had to say to thee wouldst not thou listen to? Now, the King
          of heaven says, "Come." Yes, the same lips that will one day say,
          "Come, ye blessed," say this night, "Come, ye poor distressed sinners,
          come to me, and I will save you." There is not a distressed soul in
          this hall, if his distress be the work of God's Holy Spirit, that
          shall not find salvation in the wounds of Christ. Believe then,
          sinner, believe in Jesus, that he is able to save even thee unto the
          very uttermost.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now just one point more, to commend this encouragement to you.
          Indeed, poor souls, I know when ye are under a sense of sin it is very
          hard to believe. We sometimes say, "Only believe;" but believing is
          just the hardest thing in the world when sin lies heavy on your
          shoulders. We say, "Sinner, only trust in Christ." Ah, ye do not know
          what a great "only" that is. It is a work so great, that no man can do
          it unaided by God; for faith is the gift of God, and he gives it only
          to his children. But if anything can call faith into exercise, it is
          this last thing I shall mention. Sinner, remember that Christ is
          willing to receive thee, for he came all the way from heaven to seek
          thee and find thee out in thy wanderings, and to save thee and rescue
          thee from thy miseries; he hath given proof of his hearty interest in
          thy welfare, in that he hath shed his very heart's blood to redeem thy
          soul from death and hell. If he had wanted the companionship of
          saints, he might have stopped in heaven, for there were many there.
          Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob were with him there in glory; but he
          wanted sinners. He had a thirst after perishing sinners. He wanted to
          make them trophies of his grace. He wanted black souls, to wash them
          white. He wanted dead souls, to make them alive. His benevolence
          wanted objects on which to exert itself; and therefore
        </p>
        <p>"Down from the shining seats above,</p>
        <p>With joyful haste he fled,</p>
        <p>Entered the grave in mortal flesh,</p>
        <p>And dwelt among the dead."</p>
        <p>
          Oh, sinner, look there, and see that cross. Mark yonder man upon it!
        </p>
        <p>"See from his head, his hands, his feet,</p>
        <p>Sorrow and love flow mingled down!</p>
        <p>Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,</p>
        <p>Or thorns compose so rich a crown?"</p>
        <p>
          Dost thou note that eye? Canst thou see languid pity for thy soul
          floating in it? Dost thou mark that side? It is opened that thou
          mayest hide thy sins therein. See those drops of crimson blood; every
          drop is trickling down for thee. Hearest thou that death-shriek,
          "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" That shriek in all its deep-toned
          solemnity is for thee. Yes, for thee, if thou art a sinner; if thou
          dost this night say unto God, "Lord, I know I have offended thee; have
          mercy upon me for Jesus' sake." If now, taught by the Spirit, thou art
          led to abhor thyself in dust and ashes, because thou hast sinned,
          verily, before God -- I tell thee in his sight, as his servant, thou
          shalt be saved; for Jesus would not die for thee and yet let thee
          perish.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now the last point is AN EXHORTATION. If it be true that Christ
          came only to save sinners, my beloved hearers, labour, strive,
          agonize, to get a sense in your souls of your own sinnership. One of
          the most distressing things in the world is to feel yourself a sinner;
          but that is no reason why I should not exhort you to seek it, for
          while distressing, it is only the distress of the bitter medicine
          which will effectually work the cure. Do not seek to get high ideas of
          yourself. Seek to get a low opinion of yourself; do not try to deck
          yourself with ornaments; let it not be your endeavour to array
          yourself in gold and silver; do not seek to be made good in yourself,
          but seek to strip yourself; seek to humble yourself. Do not soar high,
          but sink low. Do not go up, but go down. Ask God to let thee see that
          thou art nothing at all. Ask him to bring thee to this, that thou
          mayest have nothing to say but
        </p>
        <p>"I the chief of sinners am;"</p>
        <p>
          and if God hear your prayer, very likely Satan will tell you that you
          cannot be saved because you are a sinner. But as Martin Luther said,
          "Once, when I was racked with pain and sin, Satan said, Luther, thou
          canst not be saved, for thou art a sinner. Nay,' said Martin Luther, I
          will cut thine head off with thine own sword. Thou sayest I am a
          sinner; I thank thee for it. Thou art a holy Satan,' (he says it in
          mockery no doubt,) when thou sayest I am a sinner. Well, then, Satan,
          Christ died for sinners, therefore he died for me. Ah,' said he, if
          thou canst but prove that to me, Satan, I will thank thee for it; and
          so far from groaning, I will begin to sing, for all we want is to know
          and feel that we are sinners." Let us feel that; let us know that, and
          we may receive this as an undoubted fact of revelation, that we have a
          right to come unto Christ, and to believe on him, and receive him as
          all our salvation, and all our desire. No doubt Conscience will come
          and stop you; but do not try to stop the mouth of Conscience, but tell
          Conscience you are much obliged to him for all that he says Oh, you
          have been a desperate fellow; you sinned when you were young; you have
          sinned even until now. How many sermons have been wasted on you! How
          many Sabbaths you have broken! How many warnings you have despised!
          Oh, you are a desperate sinner.' Tell Conscience that you thank him,
          for the more you can prove yourself to be a sinner, not by outward
          acts, but in your inmost heart, the more you know yourself to be
          really guilty, the more reason have you to come to Christ and say,
          "Lord, I believe thou hast died for the guilty; I believe thou
          intendest to save the worthless. I Cast myself on thee; Lord, save
          me!" That does not suit some of you, does it? It is not the kind of
          doctrine that flatters man much. No; ye would like to be good people,
          and help Christ a little, ye like that theory which some ministers are
          always proclaiming. "God has done a great deal for you; you do the
          rest, and then you will be saved." That is a very popular kind of
          doctrine; you do one part, and God will do the other part; but that is
          not God's truth, it is only a delirious dream; God says, "I will do
          the whole; come and prostrate thyself at my feet; give up thy doings;
          let me undertake for thee; afterwards, I will make thee live to my
          glory. Only in order that thou mayest be holy, I desire thee to
          confess that thou art unholy; in order that thou mayest be sanctified,
          thou must confess that thou art as yet unsanctified. Oh, do that my
          hearers. Fall down before the Lord; cast yourselves down. Do not stand
          up with pride; but fall down before God in humility; tell him you are
          undone without his sovereign grace; tell him you have nothing, you are
          nothing, you never will be anything more than nothing, but that you
          know Christ does not want anything of you, for he will take you just
          as you are. Do not seek to come to Christ with anything, besides your
          sin; do not seek to come to Christ with your prayers for a
          recommendation; do not come to him even with professions of your
          faith; come to him with your sin, he will give you faith. If you stop
          away from Christ, and think that you will have faith apart from him,
          you have made an error. It is Christ that saves us; we must come to
          Christ for all we want.
        </p>
        <p>"Thou, O Christ, art all I want;</p>
        <p>All in All in thee I find:</p>
        <p>Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,</p>
        <p>Heal the sick, and lead the blind."</p>
        <p>
          Jesus will do so and more also; but you must come as blind, you most
          come as sick, you must come as lost, or else you cannot and must not
          come at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come then, to Jesus, I beseech you, whatever may up to this time have
          kept you away. Your doubts would keep you away, but say, "Stand back,
          Unbelief; Christ says he died for sinners: and I know I am a sinner."
        </p>
        <p>"My faith will on that promise live,</p>
        <p>Will on that promise die."</p>
        <p>
          And there is one thing I want to say, before I have done. Do not stop
          away from Christ, when you know yourself to be a sinner, because you
          think you do not understand every point of theology. Very often I get
          young converts with me, and they say, "I do not understand this or
          that doctrine." Well, I am very glad, so far as I am able, to explain
          it to them. But sometimes I get, not young converts, but young
          convicts, those who are under Conviction of sin; and when I am trying
          to bring them to this, that if they are but sinners they may believe
          in Christ, they begin with this knotty point, and that knotty point --
          and they seem to imagine that they cannot be saved till they are
          thorough theologians. Now, if you expect to understand all theology
          before you put your faith in Christ, I can only tell you you never
          will; for live as long as ever you may, there will be some depths you
          cannot explore. There are certain unquestionable facts which you must
          hold; but there will always be some difficulties through which you
          will not be able to see. The most favoured saint on earth does not
          understand everything; but you want to understand all things before
          you come to Christ. One man asks me how sin came into the world, and
          he will not come unto Christ till he knows that. Why, he will be lost
          beyond hope of recovery, if he waits till he knows it; for nobody will
          ever know it. I have no reason to believe that it is even revealed to
          those who are in heaven. Another wants to know how it is that men are
          bidden to come, -- and yet we are taught in Scripture that no man can
          come, -- and he must have that cleared up; just as if the poor man who
          had a withered arm, when Christ said, "Stretch out thine arm," had
          replied, "Lord, I have got a difficulty in my mind; I want to know how
          you can tell me to stretch out my arm when it is withered." Suppose
          when Christ had said to Lazarus, "Come forth," Lazarus could have
          said, "I have a difficulty in my mind; how can a dead man come forth?"
          Why, know this, vain man! when Christ says "Stretch out thine arm," he
          gives you power to stretch out your arm with the command, and the
          difficulty is solved in practice; though I believe it never will be
          solved in theory. If men want to have theology mapped out to them, as
          they would have a map of England; if they want to have every little
          village and every hedgerow in the gospel kingdom mapped out to them,
          they will not find it anywhere but in the Bible; and they will find it
          so mapped out there that the years of a Methuselah would not suffice
          to find out every little thing in it. We must come to Christ and
          learn, not learn and then come to Christ. "Ah! but," saith another,
          "that is not the ground of my misgivings; I do not perplex myself much
          about theological points; I have got a worse anxiety than that: I feel
          I am too bad to be saved." Well, I believe you are wrong then; that is
          all I can say in reply to you; for I will believe Christ before I will
          believe you. You say you are too bad to be saved; Christ says, "Him
          that cometh he will in no wise cast out." Now, which shall be right?
          Christ saith he will receive the very worst; you say he will not. What
          then? "Let God be true, and every man a liar." But there is one matter
          of counsel I wish you would accept; I desire of God that he may bring
          you to come and try the Lord Jesus Christ, and see whether he will
          turn you away. What concern is it to me, that I am so often reproached
          for making my appeals to the worst of Sinners? It is said that I
          direct my ministry to drunkards, harlots, blasphemers, and sinners of
          the grosser sort. And what if the finger of scorn he pointed at me, or
          if I shall be accounted as a fool before the public; do you think I
          shall be deterred by their irony? Do you think I shall stand abashed
          at their ungenerous ridicule? Oh, no: like David, when he danced
          before the ark of the Lord, and Michal, Saul's daughter, jeered at him
          and taunted him as a shameless fellow, I shall only reply, if this be
          vile, I purpose to be more vile yet. While I see the foot-tracks of my
          Master before me, and while I see still more his gracious sanctions
          following my labours; while I behold his name magnified, his glory
          increased, and perishing souls saved, (as thanks be to God we have
          witness everyday;) while this gospel warrants me, while the Spirit of
          God moves me, and while signs following do multiply the seals of my
          commission, -- who am I that I should stay myself for man, or resist
          the Holy Ghost for any flesh that breatheth? Oh, then, ye chief of
          sinners, ye vilest of the vile, ye who are the scum of the city, the
          refuse of the earth, the dregs of creation, whom no man seeketh after,
          ye whose characters are destroyed, and whose inmost souls are
          polluted, so black that no fuller on earth can whiten you, so debased
          that ye have sunk beyond the hope of any moralist to reclaim you! come
          ye -- come ye to Christ. Come ye at his own invitation. Come, and you
          shall be surely received with a hearty welcome. My Master said that he
          received sinners. His enemies said it of him, "This man receiveth
          sinners." In deed and in truth we know of a surety that he does
          receive sinners, the enemies themselves being witnesses. Come now, and
          yield the fullest credit to his word, his invitation, his promise. Do
          you object that it was only during a few days' grace in the time of
          his sojourn on earth that he received sinners? No, not so; it is
          confirmed by all subsequent experience. The apostles of Jesus echoed
          it after he had ascended into heaven, in terms as unqualified as he
          himself expressed it when on earth. Will ye not believe this: "This is
          a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus
          came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief?" Ye
          despisers, go away and laugh at this; go away, and scorn the preached
          gospel if you will, but one day we shall meet each other, face to
          face, before our Maker, and it may, perhaps, go hard then with all
          those who have despised Christ, and laughed at his gracious words. Is
          there an infidel here who says he shall be well enough off if he shall
          die the death of annihilation, and shall not live in a future world?
          Well, my friend, suppose all men die like dogs, I shall be as well off
          as you are, and I think a little better off, even as to happiness and
          peace in this world. But if; (and mark you I do not put it so, because
          I doubt it) -- if it be true that there is a world to come. I would
          not like to stand in your place in the next world. Be it so that there
          is a judgment-seat; let there be a hell -- (l put it hypothetically,
          not because I have a doubt about it, but because you tell me you doubt
          it; though I do not think you really do) -- if there be such a place,
          what will ye do then? Why, even now ye shake if a leaf falls in the
          night; ye are terrified if the cholera is in the street; ye are
          alarmed if ye are a little sick, and ye rush to the physician, and
          anyone can impose upon you with his physic, because you are afraid of
          death. What will you do in the swellings of Jordan, when death gets
          hold on you? If a little pain affrights you now, what will you do when
          your body shall shake, and your knees shall knock together before your
          Maker? What wilt thou do, my hearer, when his burning eyes shall eat
          into thy very soul? What wilt thou do, when, amid ten thousand
          thunders, he shall say, "Depart, depart?" I cannot tell thee what thou
          wilt do; but I will tell thee one thing that thou durst not do; that
          is, thou durst not say, that I have not as simply as ever I could
          tried to preach the gospel to the very chief of sinners. Hear it again
          -- "He that believeth on the Lord Jesus Christ shall be saved." To
          believe is to trust in Christ; to drop into those blessed arms that
          can catch the heaviest laden sinner that ever breathed; to fall flat
          on the promise; to let him do all for you, until he has quickened you,
          and enabled you to work out what he has before worked in you, "your
          own salvation;" and even this must be "with fear and trembling." God
          almighty grant, that some poor soul may he blessed to-night! You that
          are on shore, I do not expect to do you any good. If I have a rocket
          to send abroad into the sea, it is only the stranded vessel, the
          shipwrecked mariner that will rejoice at the rope. You that think
          yourselves safe, I have no necessity to preach to you; you are all so
          perilously good in your own sight, it is no use trying to make you
          better; you are all so awfully righteous, you can go on your way well
          enough, without warning from me. You must excuse me, therefore, if I
          have nothing to say to you except this, "Woe unto you Scribes and
          Pharisees, hypocrites!" and allow me to turn myself to another class
          of people, the vilest of the vile. I should not care if I gained the
          cognomen of the preacher to the basest and the vilest; I should not
          blush to be reviled like Rowland Hill, as the preacher to the lowest
          orders; for they want the gospel as much as any creatures under
          heaven; and if nobody will preach it to them, God helping me, I will
          endeavour to preach it to them in words that they can understand. And
          if genteel people do not like preaching in that style, they have the
          option of leaving it. If they want to hear men preach in intellectual
          strains, above the capacity of common sinners, let them go and hear
          them; I must content myself with following my Lord, who "made himself
          of no reputation," -- to go after out-of-the-way sinners, in an
          out-of-the-way fashion. I would sooner do violence to pulpit decorum,
          and break through pulpit decency, than not break through hard hearts.
          I count that sort of preaching to be the right sort, that does reach
          the heart somehow or other, and I am not particular how I do it. I
          confess, if I could not preach in one way, I would in another; if
          nobody would come to hear me in a black coat, they should be attracted
          by my wearing a red one. Somehow or other, I would make them hear the
          gospel if I could; and I would labour so to preach, that the meanest
          understanding should be able to get hold of this one fact: "This man
          receiveth sinners," God bless you all, for Christ's sake!<br />
