          1. For as the flesh is capable of corruption, so is it also of
          incorruption; and as it is of death, so is it also of life. These two
          do mutually give way to each other; and both cannot remain in the same
          place, but one is driven out by the other, and the presence of the one
          destroys that of the other. If, then, when death takes possession of a
          man, it drives life away from him, and proves him to be dead, much
          more does life, when it has obtained power over the man, drive out
          death, and restore him as living unto God. For if death brings
          mortality, why should not life, when it comes, vivify man? Just as
          Esaias the prophet says, "Death devoured when it had prevailed." And
          again, "God has wiped away every tear from every face." Thus that
          former life is expelled, because it was not given by the Spirit, but
          by the breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. For the breath of life, which also rendered man an animated being,
          is one thing, and the vivifying Spirit another, which also caused him
          to become spiritual. And for this reason Isaiah said, "Thus saith the
          Lord, who made heaven and established it, who founded the earth and
          the things therein, and gave breath to the people upon it, and Spirit
          to those walking upon it;" thus telling us that breath is indeed given
          in common to all people upon earth, but that the Spirit is theirs
          alone who tread down earthly desires. And therefore Isaiah himself,
          distinguishing the things already mentioned, again exclaims, "For the
          Spirit shall go forth from Me, and I have made every breath." Thus
          does he attribute the Spirit as peculiar to God which in the last
          times He pours forth upon the human race by the adoption of sons; but
          [he shows] that breath was common throughout the creation, and points
          it out as something created. Now what has been made is a different
          thing from him who makes it. The breath, then, is temporal, but the
          Spirit eternal. The breath, too, increases [in strength] for a short
          period, and continues for a certain time; after that it takes its
          departure, leaving its former abode destitute of breath. But when the
          Spirit pervades the man within and without, inasmuch as it continues
          there, it never leaves him. "But that is not first which is
          spiritual," says the apostle, speaking this as if with reference to us
          human beings; "but that is first which is animal, afterwards that
          which is spiritual," in accordance with reason. For there had been a
          necessity that, in the first place, a human being should be fashioned,
          and that what was fashioned should receive the soul; afterwards that
          it should thus receive the communion of the Spirit. Wherefore also
          "the first Adam was made" by the Lord "a living soul, the second Adam
          a quickening spirit." As, then, he who was made a living soul
          forfeited life when he turned aside to what was evil, so, on the other
          hand, the same individual, when he reverts to what is good, and
          receives the quickening Spirit, shall find life.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. For it is not one thing which dies and another which is quickened,
          as neither is it one thing which is lost and another which is found,
          but the Lord came seeking for that same sheep which had been lost.
          What was it, then, which was dead? Undoubtedly it was the substance of
          the flesh; the same, too, which had lost the breath of life, and had
          become breathless and dead. This same, therefore, was what the Lord
          came to quicken, that as in Adam we do all die, as being of an animal
          nature, in Christ we may all live, as being spiritual, not laying
          aside God's handiwork, but the lusts of the flesh, and receiving the
          Holy Spirit; as the apostle says in the Epistle to the Colossians:
          "Mortify, therefore, your members which are upon the earth." And what
          these are he himself explains: "Fornication, uncleanness, inordinate
          affection, evil concupiscence; and covetousness, which is idolatry."
          The laying aside of these is what the apostle preaches; and he
          declares that those who do such things, as being merely flesh and
          blood, cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven. For their soul, tending
          towards what is worse, and descending to earthly lusts, has become a
          partaker in the same designation which belongs to these [lusts, viz.,
          "earthly"], which, when the apostle commands us to lay aside, he says
          in the same Epistle, "Cast ye off the old man with his deeds." But
          when he said this, he does not remove away the ancient formation [of
          man]; for in that case it would be incumbent on us to rid ourselves of
          its company by committing suicide.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But the apostle himself also, being one who had been formed in a
          womb, and had issued thence, wrote to us, and confessed in his Epistle
          to the Philippians that "to live in the flesh was the fruit of [his]
          work;" thus expressing himself. Now the final result of the work of
          the Spirit is the salvation of the flesh. For what other visible fruit
          is there of the invisible Spirit, than the rendering of the flesh
          mature and capable of incorruption? If then [he says], "To live in the
          flesh, this is the result of labour to me," he did not surely contemn
          the substance of flesh in that passage where he said, "Put ye off the
          old man with his works;" but he points out that we should lay aside
          our former conversation, that which waxes old and becomes corrupt; and
          for this reason he goes on to say, "And put ye on the new man, that
          which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of Him who created
          him." In this, therefore, that he says, "which is renewed in
          knowledge," he demonstrates that he, the selfsame man who was in
          ignorance in times past, that is, in ignorance of God, is renewed by
          that knowledge which has respect to Him. For the knowledge of God
          renews man. And when he says, "after the image of the Creator," he
          sets forth the recapitulation of the same man, who was at the
          beginning made after the likeness of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. And that he, the apostle, was the very same person who had been
          born from the womb, that is, of the ancient substance of flesh, he
          does himself declare in the Epistle to the Galatians: "But when it
          pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by
          His grace, to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the
          Gentiles," it was not, as I have already observed, one person who had
          been born from the womb, and another who preached the Gospel of the
          Son of God; but that same individual who formerly was ignorant, and
          used to persecute the Church, when the revelation was made to him from
          heaven, and the Lord conferred with him, as I have pointed out in the
          third book, preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God, who
          was crucified under Pontius Pilate, his former ignorance being driven
          out by his subsequent knowledge: just as the blind men whom the Lord
          healed did certainly lose their blindness, but received the substance
          of their eyes perfect, and obtained the power of vision in the very
          same eyes with which they formerly did not see; the darkness being
          merely driven away by the power of vision, while the substance of the
          eyes was retained, in order that, by means of those eyes through which
          they had not seen, exercising again the visual power, they might give
          thanks to Him who had restored them again to sight. And thus, also, he
          whose withered hand was healed, and all who were healed generally, did
          not change those parts of their bodies which had at their birth come
          forth from the womb, but simply obtained these anew in a healthy
          condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. For the Maker of all things, the Word of God, who did also from the
          beginning form man, when He found His handiwork impaired by
          wickedness, performed upon it all kinds of healing. At one time [He
          did so], as regards each separate member, as it is found in His own
          handiwork; and at another time He did once for all restore man sound
          and whole in all points, preparing him perfect for Himself unto the
          resurrection. For what was His object in healing [different] portions
          of the flesh, and restoring them to their original condition, if those
          parts which had been healed by Him were not in a position to obtain
          salvation? For if it was [merely] a temporary benefit which He
          conferred, He granted nothing of importance to those who were the
          subjects of His healing. Or how can they maintain that the flesh is
          incapable of receiving the life which flows from Him, when it received
          healing from Him? For life is brought about through healing, and
          incorruption through life. He, therefore, who confers healing, the
          same does also confer life; and He [who gives] life, also surrounds
          His own handiwork with incorruption.
