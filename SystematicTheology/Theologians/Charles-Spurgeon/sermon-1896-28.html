          1. Jehovah reigns; let the people tremble: he dwells between the
          cherubim; let the earth be moved.2. Jehovah is great in Zion; and he
          is high above all nations.3. They shall acknowledge thy great and
          terrible name; it is holy.4. The king's strength also loves judgment;
          thou hast established equity, thou hast done judgment and
          righteousness in Jacob.

          1 Jehovah reigns The people, who were formerly called upon to rejoice,
          are now commanded to tremble. For as the Jews were encompassed by
          enemies, it was of the utmost importance that God's power should be
          magnified among them, that they might know that, while under his
          guardianship, they would be constantly and completely safe from the
          hatred and fury of every foe. The Hebrew word rgz, ragaz, as we have
          elsewhere seen, sometimes signifies to tremble, at other times, to be
          angry, and, in short, denotes any strong emotion arising either from
          anger or fear. Accordingly, the prophet here intends that God, in the
          emancipation of his chosen people, should give such a palpable display
          of his power, as would strike all the nations with dismay, and make
          them feel how madly they had rushed upon their own destruction. For it
          is with regard to men that God is said to reign, when he exalts
          himself by the magnificent displays which he gives of his power;
          because, while the aid which he gives to them remains invisible,
          unbelievers act a more presumptuous part, just as if there were no
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 Jehovah in Zion It is proper that we should not forget the
          antithesis I formerly mentioned, namely, that God is great in Zion to
          destroy and annihilate all the enemies of his Church; and that, when
          the Psalmist goes on to say, he is high above all nations, his meaning
          is, not that he presides over them to promote their welfare, but to
          disconcert their counsels, to baffle their designs, and to subvert all
          their power. That which immediately follows about the praising of
          God's name, refers not to the nations at large, but in my opinion to
          the faithful, from whom alone the prophet demands a tribute of
          gratitude. For although God compels his vanquished enemies to
          acknowledge him, yet as they do not cease from speaking against his
          glory, and blaspheming his holy name, it cannot be to them that the
          exhortation is addressed, Praise the name of God, for it is holy; but
          to the faithful, who, from their knowledge of God's holy name, very
          cordially engage in the celebration of its praises.
        </p>
        <p>
          4 The king's strength also loves judgment This may be viewed as a
          threatening designed to fill his enemies with dismay; as if he should
          say, such is God's regard for righteousness and equity, that he hath
          clothed himself with power to avenge the injuries which his enemies
          have done to him. I think it preferable, however, to apply it to the
          Church, because she is under the government of God for the express
          purpose of practicing righteousness and holiness. There is another
          interpretation which is by no means objectionable, namely, that which
          does not associate ideas of tyranny with the government of God,
          because there is constant concord between his power and justice. But
          when I consider the whole context, I have no doubt, that the prophet,
          after having introduced God as established upon his royal throne, now
          speaks of the manner in which he governs his kingdom; for he adds,
          thou hast established equity and righteousness. This clause is
          susceptible of two interpretations; either that God in his law has
          commanded his people to practice perfect equity, or that, in
          supporting and defending them, he has uniformly testified his great
          regard for his justice and equity. It is most true that the highest
          equity has always characterized the works and judgments of God, yet it
          appears more probable that it refers to that system, that form of
          government which God, who loves justice, appointed among the people of
          Israel, and which was the best rule for leading a life of honesty and
          integrity. And hence the word to do is improperly taken to signify to
          order or command. Should any one choose to consider this last clause
          as relating to God's government, I am by no means disposed to disagree
          with him. For there is nothing that more animates and encourages the
          faithful to render obedience to God, or inspires them with greater
          zeal to observe his law, than to find in this course of action that
          they are the objects of his paternal care, and that the righteousness,
          which he requires from his own people in words, is on his part
          reciprocated by kind deeds.<br />
