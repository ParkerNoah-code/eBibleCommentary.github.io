          1. As it has been clearly demonstrated that the Word, who existed in
          the beginning with God, by whom all things were made, who was also
          always present with mankind, was in these last days, according to the
          time appointed by the Father, united to His own workmanship, inasmuch
          as He became a man liable to suffering, [it follows] that every
          objection is set aside of those who say, "If our Lord was born at that
          time, Christ had therefore no previous existence." For I have shown
          that the Son of God did not then begin to exist, being with the Father
          from the beginning; but when He became incarnate, and was made man, He
          commenced afresh the long line of human beings, and furnished us, in a
          brief, comprehensive manner, with salvation; so that what we had lost
          in Adam -- namely, to be according to the image and likeness of God --
          that we might recover in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. For as it was not possible that the man who had once for all been
          conquered, and who had been destroyed through disobedience, could
          reform himself, and obtain the prize of victory; and as it was also
          impossible that he could attain to salvation who had fallen under the
          power of sin, -- the Son effected both these things, being the Word of
          God, descending from the Father, becoming incarnate, stooping low,
          even to death, and consummating the arranged plan of our salvation,
          upon whom [Paul], exhorting us unhesitatingly to believe, again says,
          "Who shall ascend into heaven? that is, to bring down Christ; or who
          shall descend into the deep? that is, to liberate Christ again from
          the dead." Then he continues, "If thou shall confess with thy mouth
          the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised
          Him from the dead, thou shall be saved." And he renders the reason why
          the Son of God did these things, saying, "For to this end Christ both
          lived, and died, and revived, that He might rule over the living and
          the dead." And again, writing to the Corinthians, he declares, "But we
          preach Christ Jesus crucified;" and adds, "The cup of blessing which
          we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?"
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But who is it that has had fellowship with us in the matter of
          food? Whether is it he who is conceived of by them as the Christ
          above, who extended himself through Horos, and imparted a form to
          their mother; or is it He who is from the Virgin, Emmanuel, who did
          eat butter and honey, of whom the prophet declared, "He is also a man,
          and who shall know him?" He was likewise preached by Paul: "For I
          delivered," he says, "unto you first of all, that Christ died for our
          sins, according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and rose
          again the third day, according to the Scriptures." It is plain, then,
          that Paul knew no other Christ besides Him alone, who both suffered,
          and was buried, and rose gain, who was also born, and whom he speaks
          of as man. For after remarking, "But if Christ be preached, that He
          rose from the dead," he continues, rendering the reason of His
          incarnation, "For since by man came death, by man [came] also the
          resurrection of the dead." And everywhere, when [referring to] the
          passion of our Lord, and to His human nature, and His subjection to
          death, he employs the name of Christ, as in that passage: "Destroy not
          him with thy meat for whom Christ died." And again: "But now, in
          Christ, ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of
          Christ." And again: "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law,
          being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that
          hangeth upon a tree." And again: "And through thy knowledge shall the
          weak brother perish, for whom Christ died;" indicating that the
          impassible Christ did not descend upon Jesus, but that He Himself,
          because He was Jesus Christ, suffered for us; He, who lay in the tomb,
          and rose again, who descended and ascended, -- the Son of God having
          been made the Son of man, as the very name itself doth declare. For in
          the name of Christ is implied, He that anoints, He that is anointed,
          and the unction itself with which He is anointed. And it is the Father
          who anoints, but the Son who is anointed by the Spirit, who is the
          unction, as the Word declares by Isaiah, "The Spirit of the Lord is
          upon me, because He hath anointed me," -- pointing out both the
          anointing Father, the anointed Son, and the unction, which is the
          Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The Lord Himself, too, makes it evident who it was that suffered;
          for when He asked the disciples, "Who do men say that I, the Son of
          man, am?" and when Peter had replied, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of
          the living God;" and when he had been commended by Him [in these
          words], "That flesh and blood had not revealed it to him, but the
          Father who is in heaven," He made it clear that He, the Son of man, is
          Christ the Son of the living God. "For from that time forth," it is
          said, "He began to show to His disciples, how that He must go unto
          Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the priests, and be rejected, and
          crucified, and rise again the third day." He who was acknowledged by
          Peter as Christ, who pronounced him blessed because the Father had
          revealed the Son of the living God to him, said that He must Himself
          suffer many things, and be crucified; and then He rebuked Peter, who
          imagined that He was the Christ as the generality of men supposed
          [that the Christ should be], and was averse to the idea of His
          suffering, [and] said to the disciples, "If any man will come after
          Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. For
          whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose
          it for My sake shall save it." For these things Christ spoke openly,
          He being Himself the Saviour of those who should be delivered over to
          death for their confession of Him, and lose their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. If, however, He was Himself not to suffer, but should fly away from
          Jesus, why did He exhort His disciples to take up the cross and follow
          Him, -- that cross which these men represent Him as not having taken
          up, but [speak of Him] as having relinquished the dispensation of
          suffering? For that He did not say this with reference to the
          acknowledging of the Stauros (cross) above, as some among them venture
          to expound, but with respect to the suffering which He should Himself
          undergo, and that His disciples should endure, He implies when He
          says, "For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever
          will lose, shall find it." And that His disciples must suffer for His
          sake, He [implied when He] said to the Jews, "Behold, I send you
          prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill
          and crucify." And to the disciples He was wont to say, "And ye shall
          stand before governors and kings for My sake; and they shall scourge
          some of you, and slay you, and persecute you from city to city." He
          knew, therefore, both those who should suffer persecution, and He knew
          those who should have to be scourged and slain because of Him; and He
          did not speak of any other cross, but of the suffering which He should
          Himself undergo first, and His disciples afterwards. For this purpose
          did He give them this exhortation: "Fear not them which kill the body,
          but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to
          send both soul and body into hell;" [thus exhorting them] to hold fast
          those professions of faith which they had made in reference to Him.
          For He promised to confess before His Father those who should confess
          His name before men; but declared that He would deny those who should
          deny Him, and would be ashamed of those who should be ashamed to
          confess Him. And although these things are so, some of these men have
          proceeded to such a degree of temerity, that they even pour contempt
          upon the martyrs, and vituperate those who are slain on account of the
          confession of the Lord, and who suffer all things predicted by the
          Lord, and who in this respect strive to follow the footprints of the
          Lord's passion, having become martyrs of the suffering One; these we
          do also enrol with the martyrs themselves. For, when inquisition shall
          be made for their blood, and they shall attain to glory, then all
          shall be confounded by Christ, who have cast a slur upon their
          martyrdom. And from this fact, that He exclaimed upon the cross,
          "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do," the
          long-suffering, patience, compassion, and goodness of Christ are
          exhibited, since He both suffered, and did Himself exculpate those who
          had maltreated Him. For the Word of God, who said to us, "Love your
          enemies, and pray for those that hate you," Himself did this very
          thing upon the cross; loving the human race to such a degree, that He
          even prayed for those putting Him to death. If, however, any one,
          going upon the supposition that there are two [Christs], forms a
          judgment in regard to them, that [Christ] shall be found much the
          better one, and more patient, and the truly good one, who, in the
          midst of His own wounds and stripes, and the other [cruelties]
          inflicted upon Him, was beneficent, and unmindful of the wrongs
          perpetrated upon Him, than he who flew away, and sustained neither
          injury nor insult.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. This also does likewise meet [the case] of those who maintain that
          He suffered only in appearance. For if He did not truly suffer, no
          thanks to Him, since there was no suffering at all; and when we shall
          actually begin to suffer, He will seem as leading us astray, exhorting
          us to endure buffering, and to turn the other cheek, if He did not
          Himself before us in reality suffer the same; and as He misled them by
          seeming to them what He was not, so does He also mislead us, by
          exhorting us to endure what He did not endure Himself. [In that case]
          we shall be even above the Master, because we suffer and sustain what
          our Master never bore or endured. But as our Lord is alone truly
          Master, so the Son of God is truly good and patient, the Word of God
          the Father having been made the Son of man. For He fought and
          conquered; for He was man contending for the fathers, and through
          obedience doing away with disobedience completely: for He bound the
          strong man, and set free the weak, and endowed His own handiwork with
          salvation, by destroying sin. For He is a most holy and merciful Lord,
          and loves the human race.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Therefore, as I have already said, He caused man (human nature) to
          cleave to and to become, one with God. For unless man had overcome the
          enemy of man, the enemy would not have been legitimately vanquished.
          And again: unless it had been God who had freely given salvation, we
          could never have possessed it securely. And unless man had been joined
          to God, he could never have become a partaker of incorruptibility. For
          it was incumbent upon the Mediator between God and men, by His
          relationship to both, to bring both to friendship and concord, and
          present man to God, while He revealed God to man. For, in what way
          could we be partaken of the adoption of sons, unless we had received
          from Him through the Son that fellowship which refers to Himself,
          unless His Word, having been made flesh, had entered into communion
          with us? Wherefore also He passed through every stage of life,
          restoring to all communion with God. Those, therefore, who assert that
          He appeared putatively, and was neither born in the flesh nor truly
          made man, are as yet under the old condemnation, holding out patronage
          to sin; for, by their showing, death has not been vanquished, which
          "reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after
          the similitude of Adam's transgression." But the law coming, which was
          given by Moses, and testifying of sin that it is a sinner, did truly
          take away his (death's) kingdom, showing that he was no king, but a
          robber; and it revealed him as a murderer. It laid, however, a weighty
          burden upon man, who had sin in himself, showing that he was liable to
          death. For as the law was spiritual, it merely made sin to stand out
          in relief, but did not destroy it. For sin had no dominion over the
          spirit, but over man. For it behoved Him who was to destroy sin, and
          redeem man under the power of death, that He should Himself be made
          that very same thing which he was, that is, man; who had been drawn by
          sin into bondage, but was held by death, so that sin should be
          destroyed by man, and man should go forth from death. For as by the
          disobedience of the one man who was originally moulded from virgin
          soil, the many were made sinners, and forfeited life; so was it
          necessary that, by the obedience of one man, who was originally born
          from a virgin, many should be justified and receive salvation. Thus,
          then, was the Word of God made man, as also Moses says: "God, true are
          His works." But if, not having been made flesh, He did appear as if
          flesh, His work was not a true one. But what He did appear, that He
          also was: God recapitulated in Himself the ancient formation of man,
          that He might kill sin, deprive death of its power, and vivify man;
          and therefore His works are true.<br />
