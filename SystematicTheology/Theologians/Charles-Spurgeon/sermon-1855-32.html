        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.33)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, July 8, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>"He shall choose our inheritance for us." -- Psalm 47:4.</p>
        <p>
          THE CHRISTIAN IS ALWAYS pleased and delighted when he can see Christ
          in the Scriptures. If he can but detect the footstep of his lord, and
          discover that the sacred writers are making some reference to him,
          however indistinct or dark he will rejoice there at: for all the
          Scriptures are nothing except as we find Christ in them. St. Austin
          says, "The Scriptures are the swaddling bands of the man-child --
          Christ Jesus, and were all intended to be hallowed garments in which
          to wrap him "So they are; and it is our pleasant duty to lift the
          veil, or remove the garment of Jesus and so behold him in his person,
          in his nature, or his offices. Now, this text is concerning Jesus
          Christ -- he it is who is to "choose our inheritance for us," he in
          whom dwelleth all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge is the great
          Being who is selected as the head of predestination -- to choose our
          lot and our portion, and fix our destiny. Verily, beloved brethren,
          you and I can rejoice in this great fact, that our Saviour chooses for
          us. For were we all to be assembled together in some great plain, as
          Israel was of old, to elect for ourselves a king, we should not
          propose a second candidate. There would be one who stands like Saul,
          the son of Kish, head and shoulders taller than all the rest, whom we
          should at once select to be our king and ruler of Providence for us.
          We would not ask for some prudent sage or deeply taught philosopher;
          we would not choose the most experienced senior; but, without a single
          moment's hesitation, directly we saw Jesus Christ, in the majesty of
          his person, we should say, in the words of the Psalmist, He who
          redeemed us, he who ransomed us, he who loved us -- "He shall choose
          our inheritance for us."
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember once going to a chapel where this happened to be the text,
          and the good man who occupied the pulpit was more than a little of an
          Arminian. Therefore, when he commenced, he said, "This passage refers
          entirely to our temporal inheritance. It has nothing whatever to do
          with our everlasting destiny: for," said he, "We do not want Christ to
          choose for us in the matter of heaven or hell. It is so plain and easy
          that every man who has a grain of common sense will choose heaven; and
          any person would know better than to choose hell. We have no need of
          any superior intelligence, or any greater being, to choose heaven or
          hell for us. It is left to our own free will, and we have enough
          wisdom given us, sufficiently correct means to judge for ourselves,
          and therefore, as he very logically inferred, there was no necessity
          for Jesus Christ, or any one, to make a choice for us. We could choose
          the inheritance for ourselves without any assistance." Ah! but my good
          brother, it may be very true that we could, but I think we should want
          something more than common sense before we should choose aright. For
          you must recollect that it is not simply the choosing of heaven or
          hell; it is the choosing of pleasure on earth, or of pain of honor or
          of persecution; and very often the man is bewildered. If it were just
          simply hell that a man had to choose, none would prefer it; but since
          it is the sin which engenders hell, and the lust which brings him on
          to punishment, there comes the difficulty. For by nature we are all
          inclined to follow the way which leads downwards, we are naturally
          willing to walk the road which leads to the pit -- we do not seek the
          pit itself, but the road that leads to it -- and were it not for
          sovereign grace, none of us would ever have followed the path to
          heaven. I am daily more and more convinced that the difference between
          one man and another is, not the difference between his use of his
          will, but the difference of grace that has been bestowed upon him. So
          that if one man has his "inheritance in heaven," it will be because
          Christ chose his inheritance for him; and if another man has his place
          in hell, it will be because he chose his inheritance himself. We do
          need some one to choose for us in that matter; we want our Father to
          fix our eternal destiny, and write our names in the book of life,
          otherwise, if left to ourselves, the road to hell would be as
          naturally our choice as for a piece of inanimate matter to roll
          downwards, instead of assisting itself upwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, to come at once to our text, and leave every other person's
          observations alone, "He shall choose our inheritance for us." First, I
          shall speak of the text as being a glorious fact -- "He shall choose
          our inheritance for us." And, secondly, I will speak of it as being a
          very just and wise prayer -- "He shall choose our inheritance for us."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, I shall speak of this as being A GLORIOUS FACT. It is
          a great truth that God does choose the inheritance for his people. It
          is a very high honor conferred upon God's servants, that it is said of
          them, "He shall choose their inheritance." As for the worldling, God
          gives him anything, but for the Christian, God selects the best
          portion, and chooses his inheritance for him. Says a good divine, "It
          is one of the greatest glories of the Church of Christ, that our
          mighty Maker, and our Friend, always chooses our inheritance for us."
          He gives the worldling husks; but he stops to find out the sweet
          fruits for his people. He gathers out the fruits from among the
          leaves, that his people might have the best food, and enjoy the
          richest pleasures. Oh! it is the satisfaction of God's people to
          believe in this exalting truth that he chooses their inheritance for
          them. But, since there are many who dispute it, allow me just to stir
          up your minds by way of remembrance, by mentioning certain facts which
          will lead you to see clearly that verily God does choose our lot, and
          apportion for us our inheritance.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, first, let me ask, must we not all of us admit an over-ruling
          providence, and the appointment of Jehovah's hands, as to the means
          whereby we came into this world? These men who think that afterwards
          we are left to our own free will by choosing this or the other to
          direct our steps, must admit that our entrance into the world was not
          of our own will, but that God there had his hand upon us. What
          circumstances were those in our power which led us to elect a certain
          person to be our parent? Had we anything to do with it? Did not God of
          himself appoint our parents, native place, and friends? Could he not
          have caused me to be born with the skin of the Hottentot, brought
          forth by a filthy mother who should nurse me in her "kraal," and teach
          me to bow down to Pagan gods, quite as easily as to have given me a
          pious mother, who should each morning and night bend her knee in
          prayer on my behalf? Or, might he not, if he had pleased, have given
          me some profligate to have been my parent, from whose lips I might
          have early heard fearful, filthy, and obscene language? Might he not
          have placed me where I should have had a drunken father, who should
          have immured me in a very dungeon of ignorance, and brought me up in
          the chains of crime? Was it not God's providence that I had so happy a
          lot, that both my parents were his children, and endeavored to train
          me up in the fear of the Lord? To whom do any of you owe your
          parentage -- be it good, or be it bad? Is it not to be traced to the
          decree of God? Did not his predestination put you where you were? Was
          it not the Lord who appointed the place of your birth, and the hour
          thereof? Look again at your bodies, do you not see the doings of God
          there? How many children are born into the world deformed? How many
          come into it deficient in some one or other of their faculties? But
          look at ourself. You are perhaps comely in person, or if not, you have
          all your limbs; your bones are well set, and you are strong -- must
          you not trace this up to God? Do you not see that he arranged the
          commencement of your life for you? You might have opened your career
          there, or there, or there; but he placed you there in that particular
          spot, without asking your leave. Did he turn to you and say, O clay!
          in what shape shall I fashion you? Or, did he who begat you ask you
          what you would be? No: he made you what he pleased, and if you have
          now the possession of your faculties and limbs, you must acknowledge
          and confess that there was the decree of God in it. And, still
          further, how much of the finger of God must we discern in our temper
          and constitution? I suppose no one will be foolish enough to say that
          we are all born with the same natural temperament and constitution. I
          am sure there are some persons who differ a great deal from others, at
          least I should like to differ a little from them -- some of those with
          whom you could not sit a single moment without feeling that you would
          rather stand in a shower of rain, and get dripping wet than sit on a
          sofa by their side; some persons are so exceedingly warm in their
          tempers that they actually burn a hole in their manners and
          conversation -- they cannot speak without being cross, and testy and
          angry. Now, although such persons often indulge their temper, yet we
          must allow that, in some measure, they are excusable, because they can
          trace it to the nature which their mother gave them, (as the worldly
          poet would say) or rather, that temperament with which they were bore.
          As if there should be others here who are naturally amiable -- who
          have a kind loving spirit -- who are not so easily moved to wrath and
          passion; in whom there is not so much of that absurd pride which makes
          man exalt himself above his fellows: who has formed them aright or
          fashioned them so well? Has not God done it and proved himself a
          Sovereign? And must we not see in this that God in some way or other
          has fixed our destiny, from the very fact that the opening bud of life
          is entirely in his hands? It does seem rational that since God
          appointed the commencement of our existence, there should be some
          evidence of his control in the future parts of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now a second observation. I will ask any sensible man, above all,
          any serious Christian here, whether there have not been certain times
          in his life when he could most distinctly see that indeed God did
          "choose his inheritance for him?" You are a young man -- you are asked
          what will be your pursuit: you choose such-and-such a thing. You are
          about to be apprenticed to that peculiar trade -- a misfortune happens
          -- it cannot be done. Without your consent, or will, you are placed in
          another position. Your will was scarcely consulted; your parents
          exercised some authority, while the hand of providence seemed to say
          to you, "it must be so" -- and you could not help yourself. Take
          another case: you had established a house of business -- suddenly
          there came a crushing misfortune which you no more could avoid than an
          ant could stop an avalanche. You were driven from your business, and
          now you occupy your present position because there was nothing else to
          which you could betake yourself. Was not that the hand of God? You
          cannot trace it to yourself; you were positively compelled to change
          your plan; you were driven to it. Perhaps you once had friends on whom
          you depended; you had no thought of launching out into the world and
          being independent of the assistance of others. Suddenly, by a stroke
          of providence, one friend dies; then another; then another; and,
          without your own volition, you were placed in such circumstances that
          like a leaf in the whirlpool, you were whirled round and round, and
          the employment you now follow, or the engagement that now occupies
          you, is not of your own choosing, but is that of God? I do not know
          whether all of you can go with me here, but I think you must in some
          instance or other be forced to see that God has indeed ordained your
          inheritance for you. If you cannot, I can I can see a thousand
          chances, as men would call them, all working together like wheels in a
          great piece of machinery, to fix me just where I am, and I can look
          back to a hundred places where, if one of those little wheels had run
          awry -- if one of those little atoms in the great whirlpool of my
          existence had started aside -- I might have been anywhere but here,
          occupying a very different position. If you cannot say this, I know I
          can with emphasis, and can trace God's hand back to the period of my
          birth through every step I have taken; I can feel that indeed God has
          allotted my inheritance for me. If any of you are so wilfully
          beclouded that you will not see the hand of God in your being, and
          will insist that all has been done by your will without providence:
          that you have been left to steer your own course across the ocean of
          existence; and that you are where you are because your own hand guided
          the tiller, and your own arm directed the rudder, all I can say is, my
          own experience belies the fact, and the experience of many now in this
          place would rise in testimony against you, and say, "Verily, it is not
          in man that walketh to direct his steps." -- "Man proposes, but God
          disposes," and the God of heaven is not unoccupied, but is engaged in
          over-ruling, ordering, altering, working all things according to the
          good pleasure of his will.
        </p>
        <p>
          A third fact let me mention. If you turn to the pages of inspiration,
          and read the lives of some of the most eminent saints, I think you
          will be obliged to see the marks of God's providence in their
          histories too plainly to be mistaken Take, for instance, the life of
          Joseph. There is a young man who from early life serves God. Read that
          life till its latest period when he gave commandment concerning his
          bones, and you cannot help marvelling at the wondrous dealings of
          providence. Did Joseph choose to be hated of his brethren? But, yet,
          was not their envy a material circumstance in his destiny? Did he
          choose to be put into the pit? But was not the putting into the pit as
          necessary to his being made a king in Egypt as Pharaoh's dream! Did
          Joseph desire to be tempted of his mistress? He chose to reject the
          temptation, but did he choose the trial? Nay, God sent it. Did he
          choose to be put into the dungeon? No. And had he aught to do with the
          baker's dream, or with Pharaoh's either? Can you not see, all the way
          through, from first to last, even in the forgetfulness of the butler,
          who forget to speak of Joseph till the appointed time came, when
          Pharaoh should want an interpreter, that there was verily the hand of
          God? Joseph's brethren did just as they liked when they put him into
          the pit. Potiphar's wife followed the dictates of her own abandoned
          lust in tempting him. And yet, notwithstanding all the freedom of
          their will, it was ordained of God, and worked according together for
          one great end, to place Joseph on the throne; for as he said himself,
          "Ye meant it for evil, but God intended it for good, that he might
          save your souls alive! "There was the ordinance of God's Providence in
          it as clearly as there is light in the sun. Or take again the life of
          such a man as Moses. I suppose no one will deny that there was a
          Providence in his being placed in the ark, just in the particular spot
          where Pharaoh's daughter came to wash. And who will deny that it was a
          providence that she should say, "Go and fetch me a woman to nurse this
          child," and his mother, Jochebed, should come to nurse him? I imagine
          that no one would consider that there was an absence of Providence in
          the fact that the child was comely, and that he grew in all the wisdom
          of Egypt, and that he had a mind capacious enough to receive
          knowledge. Nor will you deny the providence that led him to the side
          of Horeb's mountain, or to Jethro's daughter, nor can you for an
          instant deny that there was a providence which afterwards brought him
          before King Pharaoh, and helped him all his way through. The man was a
          God's-man. God seems to be stamped upon his brow in all his acts; in
          all the three forties of his life, whether the forty spent in the
          palace, the forty in the wilderness, or the forty that he was king in
          Jeshurun. In all this there seems to be so manifestly God overruling
          the man's acts, that you cannot help saying, "Here is the Almighty!
          here is the hand of God in everything the man does!" and ye turn from
          the history of Moses, and say, "Truly God was in this place though I
          knew it not." I might refer you to the life of Daniel, fraught with
          interest as it was, and in that book you would see how his steps were
          first of all sadly guided to Babylon, by being carried captive; and
          yet that from the degradation of his banishment there arises the
          grandeur of Daniel's visions, and Daniel's character is displayed in
          all its clearness, so that you must see that a wise hand was dealing
          with him, and developing his virtues and his excellencies. More I
          shall not say here, because I like you to refer to the Scripture
          yourselves. Scripture is the best book of providence we have ever
          read. If any one should ask me for a book of anecdotes illustrative of
          providence, I should refer him to the Bible. There he might find the
          marvellous story of the woman who went out into a distant country, and
          during her absence lost her inheritance. On a certain day she went to
          the king to ask him for it, and just as she came there Gehazi was
          telling the king concerning a woman whose son Elijah had raised to
          life -- and he said, "O, my Lord! this is the woman, and this is the
          son!" There were Gehazi and the king talking on the subject, and the
          woman came in just at the moment. And yet there are some fools who
          call that a "chance." Why, sirs, it is an appointment as clearly as
          anything could be. And that is just one out of myriads of instances
          you could find in Scripture, where you can see God present in the
          affairs of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as the Bible, after all, is the best proof of any doctrine we can
          advance, I beg to refer you to one or two texts therein: and first,
          let me ask you to direct your attention to a passage in the Isaiah,
          6,7, "I am the Lord and there is none else. I form the light and
          create darkness, I make peace and create evil; I the Lord do all these
          things." Now here is a most direct assertion of the power of God in
          everything: that he maketh peace, and that he maketh evil -- that he
          createth light and that he createth darkness. We may ask as the
          prophet did of old, "Is there evil in the city and the Lord hath not
          done it?" Even providential evil is to be ascribed to God; and in some
          marvellous sense which we understand not and cannot comprehend, the
          ordinance of God has even reference to the sins of men "He has made
          even the wicked for the day of his wrath." "The vessels of wrath
          fitted to destruction even these shall show forth his praise. Good and
          evil in your condition you must ever regard as the work of God.
          Whatever your circumstances are this morning -- are you sick, are you
          in poverty or are you much troubled, the evil as well as the good is
          the work of God; and shall a man receive good at the hands of the
          Lord, and shall he not in equal patience receive evil? Will you not
          take everything from God which he is pleased to give, seeing that he
          himself asserts "I create light I create darkness; I make good and I
          make evil." Turn now to a passage in Job 14:5. -- "His days are
          determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast
          appointed his bounds that he cannot pass." What a solemn thought! God
          has "appointed our bounds." One of the prophets says, "Thou hast
          hedged up my way with thorns and made a wall so that I cannot find my
          paths." And that is first the truth in regard to man's life. The
          "bounds" of it are "appointed!" man only walks within these "bounds;"
          out of these limits he cannot get. If this does not imply the hand of
          God in everything I do not know what does. Turn now to a proverb from
          the wise man -- Proverbs 16:33. -- "The lot is cast into the lap but
          the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord." And if the disposal of
          the lot is the Lord's whose is the arrangement of our whole life? You
          know when Achan had committed a great sin the tribes were assembled
          and the lot fell upon Achan. When Jonah was in the ship they cast lots
          and the lot fell upon Jonah. And when Jonathan had tasted the honey
          they cast lots and Jonathan was taken. When they cast lots for an
          apostle who should succeed the fallen Judas, the lot fell upon
          Matthias, and he was separated to the work. The lot is directed of
          God. And if the simple casting of a lot is guided by him how much more
          the events of our entire life -- especially when we are told by our
          blessed Saviour: "The very hairs of your head are all numbered: not a
          sparrow falleth to the ground without your Father." If it be so; if
          these hairs are counted; if an inventory is written of each one of
          them; and if the existence of each of these hairs is marked and
          mapped, how much more precious in the sight of the Lord shall our
          lives be. Take one more passage in Jeremiah 10:23: "O Lord I know that
          the way of man is not in himself. It is not in man that walketh to
          direct his steps." Jeremiah said, "I know" and he was an inspired man,
          and that satisfies us. "I know." I have sometimes when quoting a
          passage out of the apostle Paul been met by somebody replying that;
          really they did not think Paul so great an authority as other
          Scripture writers." I was astonished at hearing of the following
          dialogue between two young persons. One remarked "Mr. Spurgeon is too
          high in doctrine." Said her friend: "He is not higher than St. Paul."
          "No" said she "But St. Paul was not quite right according to my
          opinion." I was very glad to sink in the same boat as Paul for if Paul
          was not right in the view of poor pitiful creatures, verily Spurgeon
          should not care. I would rather be wrong with Paul than right with
          anybody else because Paul was inspired. But will they cut out some of
          the Old Testament too? Will they dare to accuse Jeremiah of mistake?
          Jeremiah says, "I know that the way of man is not in himself, it is
          not in man that walketh to direct his steps."
        </p>
        <p>
          I may not have proved my point to any person who is an antagonist to
          this doctrine: but to you who believe I do not doubt that I have
          somewhat confirmed it. Let me say one word. Perhaps some who hear me
          will say, "Then, sir in the case of Christians you make God the author
          of sin if you believe that their lives were ordained of him!" I never
          said so! Prove that I said it and then I will come before your bar and
          try to excuse myself. But until you hear these lips say, that God is
          the author of sin go your way and prove first of all what it means to
          speak the truth. I have not asserted any such vile doctrine; but I
          will tell you who does say that God is the author of sin -- and that
          is the man who does not believe in natural depravity -- that man makes
          God the author of sin. I remember the case of a minister who most
          fearfully split on this rock. When a child had been doing something
          that was far from right a friend said, "See there brother, there is
          original sin in the child; for at its early age see how it sins." "No"
          said he, "it is only certain powers God has placed in the child
          developing themselves; it is the nature which God has given it
          originally it is one of God's perfect creatures." These gentlemen make
          God the author of sin, because they throw the nature upon God, whereas
          had we not fallen, every one of us would have been born with a perfect
          nature; but since we have fallen, anything good in us is the gift of
          God, and that which is evil springs naturally from our parents, by
          carnal descent from Adam. I never said God was the author of sin. I
          thank you, sir, take the accusation yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now having thus spoken upon the doctrine, we shall have a few
          minutes concerning this as A PRAYER. "He shall choose our inheritance
          for us." Dry doctrine my friends is of little use. It is not the
          doctrine which helps us it is our assent to the doctrine. And now I
          have been preaching this morning concerning God's ordaining our lives.
          Some do not like it, to them the truth will be of no service. But
          there are some of you, who if it were not the truth, would say you
          wish to have it so, for you would say, in your prayer "Thou shalt
          choose my inheritance for me."
        </p>
        <p>
          First, "thou shalt choose my mercies for me." You and I beloved often
          get choosing our own mercies. God in his wisdom may have made one man
          rich. "Ah!" says he, at night, "would God I had not all this wealth to
          tease my mind and worry me. I believe any peasant who toils for me has
          far more rest than I have." Another who is a poor man wipes the hot
          sweat from his brow, and says, "O my Father, I have asked thee to give
          me neither poverty nor riches; but here am I so poor that I am obliged
          to toil incessantly for my bread, would God I could have my mercies
          there among the rich." One has been born with abilities. He has
          improved them by education, and this improvement of his natural powers
          has entailed upon him fearful responsibilities, so that he has to
          exercise his thoughts and his brain from morning till night. Sometimes
          he sits down and says, "Now if I am not the most hard worked of all
          mortals. Those who keep a shop can shut it up; but I am open it all
          times, and I am always under this responsibility. What shall I do and
          how shall I rest myself?" Another who has to toil with his hands is
          thinking, "Oh! if I could lead such a gentlemanly life as that
          minister. He never has to work hard. He only has to think and read, of
          course that is not hard work. He has perhaps to sit up till twelve
          o'clock at night to prepare his sermon, that is not work of course. I
          wish I had his situation." So we all cry out about our mercies, and
          want to choose our allotments. "Oh!" says one, "I have health, but I
          think I could do without that if I had wealth." Another says, "I have
          wealth, but I could give all my gold to have good constitution." One
          says, "Here am I stowed away in this dirty London; I would give
          anything if I could go and live in the country." Another, who resides
          in the country, says, "There is no convenience here, you have to go so
          many miles for the doctor, and one thing and the other, I wish I dwelt
          in London." So that we are none of us satisfied with our mercies. But
          the true Christian says, or ought to say, "Thou shalt choose my
          inheritance for me;" high or low, rich or poor, town or country,
          wealth or poverty, ability or ignorance, "Thou shalt choose my
          inheritance for me."
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, we must leave to God the choice of our employment. "Oh!" says
          the preacher -- and I have been wicked enough to say so myself -- "how
          would I like to have all my employment in the week that I might sit in
          the pew on the Sabbath and hear a sermon, and be refreshed?" I am sure
          I should be glad to hear a sermon; it is a long time since I heard
          one. But when I do attend one, it always tires me -- I want to be
          improving on it. How would I like to sit down and have a little of the
          feast in God's house myself, instead of always being the serving man
          in God's household. Thank God! I can steal a crumb for myself
          sometimes. But then we fancy, O that I were not in that employment! O
          that like Jonah we might flee to Tarshish, to avoid going to that
          great Nineveh. Another is a Sabbath-school teacher. He says, "I would
          rather visit the sick than sit with those troublesome boys and girls.
          And then the teachers do not seem to be so friendly with me as they
          should be." The Sunday-school teacher thinks he can do anything better
          than teach; but there is his friend who visits the sick coming down
          the stairs, and he says, "I could teach little children, or preach a
          little; but really I cannot visit the sick. There is nothing so hard,
          and that requires so much self-denial." Another says, "I am a tract
          distributor. It is not easy work to have your tracts refused at this
          door, and then at another; and persons looking at you as if you came
          to rob them; could stand up before the congregation and speak, but I
          cannot do this." And so we get selecting our employments. Ah! but we
          ought to say, "Thou shalt choose my inheritance for me;" and leave our
          employment to God. "If there were two angels in heaven," said a good
          man, "supposing there were two works to be done, and one work was to
          rule a city, and the other to sweep a street crossing -- the angels
          would not stop a moment to say which they would do. They would do
          which ever God told them to do. Gabriel would shoulder his broom and
          sweep the crossing cheerfully, and Michael would not be a bit prouder
          in taking the scepter to govern the city." So with a Christian.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is nothing that we oftener want to choose than our crosses.
          None of us like crosses at all; but all of us think everybody else's
          trials lighter than our own. Crosses we must have; but we often want
          to be choosing them. "Oh!" says one, "my trouble is in my family. It
          is the worst cross in the world -- my business is successful; but if I
          might have a cross in my business, and get rid of this cross in my
          family, I should not mind." Then, my beloved hearers, in reference to
          your mercies, your employments, and your afflictions, say -- "Lord,
          thou shalt choose my inheritance for me! I have been a silly child; I
          have often tried to meddle with my lot. Now I leave it. I cast myself
          on the stream of Providence, hoping to float along. I give myself up
          to the influence of thy will." He that kicks and struggles in the
          water, they say, will be sure to sink; but he who lies still will
          float -- so with Providence. He that struggles against it goes down;
          but he who resigns everything to it, will float along quietly calmly,
          and happily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having thus spoken upon the extent of the surrender very briefly, I
          might hint at the wisdom of it, and show you it is not only good for
          you to offer this prayer, but it is better for you, than to control
          yourself. I might tell you that it is good for you to give yourself up
          to God's hands, because he understands your wants, he knows your case
          and he will so pity your necessities that he will give you the best
          supplies. It is better for you then if you trusted in yourself, for if
          you had the choosing of your troubles, or your employments, you would
          always have this bitter thought, "Now, I chose it myself, and
          therefore I must blame my own folly."
        </p>
        <p>
          But now another thought. What was the cause of the Psalmist saying
          this? How came he to be able to feel it? for there are few Christians
          who can really affirm it and stand to it: "Thou shalt choose my
          inheritance for me." I think the cause is to be found in this, that he
          had a true experience of God's wisdom. Poor David could indeed thank
          God for having chosen his inheritance for him, for he had given him a
          very goodly one. He had put him in a king's mansion; he had made him
          conqueror over Goliath, and had raised him to be ruler over a great
          people. David, by a practical experience, could say, "Thou shalt
          choose my inheritance for me." Some of you cannot say it, can you?
          What is the reason? because you have never witnessed Divine guidance,
          you have never looked to see the hand that supplies your mercies. Some
          of us who have seen that hand in a few instances are obliged to say
          from the very force of circumstances,
        </p>
        <p>"Here I raise my Ebenezer."</p>
        <p>Then, again --</p>
        <p>"Hither by thy help I've come."</p>
        <p>
          I hope and trust in that same good pleasure which has guided me
          hitherto, that it will bring me safely home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, it was a true faith that made the Psalmist say he relied upon
          God. He knew him to be worthy of his trust, so he said, "Thou shalt
          choose my inheritance for me." And, again, it was true love, for love
          can trust -- affection can put confidence in the one it loves; and
          since David loved his God, he took the unwritten roll of his life, and
          he said, "Write what thou wilt, my Lord." "Thou shalt choose my
          inheritance for me."
        </p>
        <p>
          I might finish, if I had time, by telling you the good effects that
          this produced upon the Psalmist's mind, and what it would produce upon
          yours; how it would bring a holy calm continually if you were always
          to pray this prayer; and how it would so relieve your mind from
          anxiety, that you would be better able to walk as a Christian should.
          For when a man is anxious he cannot pray; when he is troubled about
          the world he cannot serve his Master, he is serving himself. If you
          could "seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness," beloved,
          "all things would then be added to you." What a noble Christian you
          would be; how much more honorable you would be to Christ's religion;
          and how much better you could serve him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now you who have been meddling with Christ's business, I have been
          preaching this to you. You know you sometimes sing --
        </p>
        <p>"Tis mine to obey, tis his to provide,"</p>
        <p>
          but then you have been meddling with Christ's business, you have been
          leaving your own; you have been trying the "providing" part and
          leaving the "obeying?" to somebody else. Now, you take the obeying
          part, and let Christ manage the providing. Come then, brethren,
          doubting and fearful ones, come and see your father's storehouse, and
          ask whether he will let you starve while he has stored away such
          plenty in his garner! Come and look at his heart of mercy, see if that
          will ever fail! Come and look at his inscrutable wisdom and see if
          that will ever go amiss: Above all, look up there to Jesus Christ your
          intercessor, and ask yourself, "while he pleads, can my Father forget
          me?" And if he remembers even sparrows, will he forget one of the
          least of his poor children? "Cast thy burden upon the Lord and he will
          sustain thee," "He will never suffer the righteous to be moved."
        </p>
        <p>
          This I have preached to God's children: and now one word to the other
          portion of this crowded assembly. The other day there was a very
          singular scene in the House of Commons. There is a certain enclosure
          there set apart for the members; into this place a gentleman
          ignorantly strayed. By-and- bye some one raised the cry "A stranger in
          the house!" The sergeant of the House went up to him, took him by the
          shoulder and reminded him that he had no business there -- not being a
          member -- not one of the elect -- not having been elected by the
          country. The man of course looked very foolish. But, as he had made a
          mistake, he was let go. Had he wilfully strayed within the enclosure,
          and taken a seat he might not have got off so easily. When I saw that,
          I thought, "A stranger in the House!" This morning is there not a
          stranger in the house? There are some here who are strangers to the
          subject we have been discussing -- strangers to God -- strangers to
          true religion. "There's a stranger in the house." It led me to think
          of that great "assembly and Church of the first-born, whose names are
          written in heaven;" and I thought of the people who, last Sabbath
          night, sat down to the Lord's table to partake of the Sacrament; and
          the idea struck me, "There's a stranger in the house." Now, in the
          House of Commons, a stranger cannot sit five minutes without being
          detected, for all eyes are so soon fixed upon him; but in Christ's
          Church -- in this church -- a stranger can sit in the house without
          being found out. Ah! there are strangers sitting here, looking as
          religious as other people: some that are not children, some that are
          not chosen some that are not heirs of God. They are "strangers in the
          house." Shall I tell you what will happen by-and-bye? Though I cannot
          detect you under the cloak of you profession; though God's people may
          not find you out, the grim "sergeant of the house "is coming -- Death
          is coming -- and he will discover you! What will be the penalty of
          your intrusion, as a professor, into Christ's Church? What will be
          your lot if you have been a stranger in his house below, when you find
          that, though you may have sat for a little while in this House of
          Commons below, you cannot sit in the House of Lords above? What will
          be your lot when it shall be said, "Depart ye accused?" And you may
          exclaim "Lord! Lord! have we not eaten and drunk in thy presence, and
          taught in thy streets?" And yet he will say, "Verily, I never knew
          you!" "You are a stranger in the house!" -- " Depart, accursed one!"
          How can I tell who is a stranger in these pews, and who are strangers
          upstairs? Some of us are not strangers! "We are no more strangers and
          foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints and of the household
          of God." To such of you as are strangers, I pray you think of it, and
          go to Christ's throne, and beg of him that yet you may be his
          children, and numbered with his people. Then, after that, I will talk
          with you about my text, but not now. Then I will bid you pray to God,
          "Thou shalt choose my inheritance for me."<br />
