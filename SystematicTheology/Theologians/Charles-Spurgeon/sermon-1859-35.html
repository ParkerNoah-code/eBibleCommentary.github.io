        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.259)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, June 26th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is
          no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither
          thou goest." -- Ecclesiastes 9:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          IF GOD had willed it we might each one of us have entered heaven at
          the moment of our conversion. It was not absolutely necessary for our
          preparation for immortality that we should tarry here. It is possible
          for a man to be taken to heaven, and to be found meet to be a partaker
          of the inheritance of the saints in light, though he hath but believed
          in Christ a solitary moment. The thief upon the cross had no long time
          for the process of sanctification; for thus spake the Saviour. "Verily
          I say unto thee this day shalt thou be with. me in paradise." It is
          true that in our case sanctification is a long and continued process,
          and we shall not be perfected -- the being of sin shall not be cast
          out -- till we lay aside our bodies and enter within the veil. But
          nevertheless, it is quite certain that if God had so willed it, he
          might have sanctified us in a moment. He might l eve changed us front.
          imperfection to perfection, he might have cut out the very roots of
          sin, and have destroyed the very being of corruption, and have taken
          us to heaven instanter, if so he had willed it. Notwithstanding that,
          we are here. and why are we here? Would God keep his children out of
          paradise a single moment longer than was necessary? Yet it is not
          absolutely necessary for them. Then, why are they here? Does God
          delight to tantalise his people by keeping them in a wilderness when
          they might be in Canaan? Will he shut them up in prison when he might
          give them instant liberty, unless there be some overwhelming reason
          for his delay in giving them the fullness of their life and bliss? Why
          are they here? Why is the army of the living God still on the battle
          field? One charge might give them the victory. Why are God's ships
          still at sea? One breath of his wind might waft them to the haven. Why
          are his children still wandering hither and thither through a maze,
          when hen a solitary word from his lips would bring them into the
          center of their hopes in heaven? The answer is; they are here that
          they may glorify God, and that they may bring others to know his love.
          We are not here in vain, dear brethren. We are here on earth like
          sowers scattering good seed; like ploughmen ploughing up the fallow
          ground. We are here as heralds, telling to sinners around
        </p>
        <p>"What a dear Saviour we have found,"</p>
        <p>
          and heralding the coming of our Master. We are here as the salt to
          preserve a world, which else would become putrid and destroyed. We are
          here as the very pillars of this world's happiness: for when God shall
          take away his saints, the universal moral fabric "shall tumble to its
          fall; and great shall be the crash, when the righteous shall be
          removed, and the foundations shall be shaken. Taking it therefore as
          granted that the people of God are here to do something to bless their
          fellow-men, our text comes in very pertinently as the rule of our
          life. May God help us to practice it by giving us much of his powerful
          Spirit. "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might."
          This is what thou art here for. Thou art here for a certain purpose.
          That purpose will soon be ended, and whether it be accomplished or
          unaccomplished, there shall never be a second opportunity for
          attempting it, "for there is no work, nor device nor knowledge, nor
          wisdom in the grave, wither hither thou goest." So far as this world
          is concerned, the grave is the end of our doing. So far as this time
          and state are concerned, the grave shall be the burial of our wisdom,
          our knowledge, and our devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I shall this morning, first, endeavor to explain the preacher's
          exhortation; and then endeavor to enforce it by evangelical arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, I shall explain THE PREACHER'S EXHORTATION. I shall do so by
          dividing it into three parts. What shall I do? -- "Whatsoever thy hand
          findeth." How shall I do it? -- "Do it with thy might." -- And then,
          why shall I do it? -- "For there is no work, nor device, nor
          knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave, whither thou goest.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, then, are there not some here who are saying, I hope I love
          Christ; I desire to serve him, for I have been saved by his work upon
          the cross; what then can I do? "The answer is -- "whatsoever thy hand
          findeth to do." Here we will observe, first, that this refers us to
          the works that are near at hand. You are not called upon to-day, the
          most of you, to do works which your eye sees far away in Hindostan or
          China. The most of you are called especially to do the work which is
          near at hand. People are always desiring to be doing something miles
          off, If they could but be somewhere else what wonders they would
          accomplish! Many a young man thinks if he could stand up under a
          banyan tree, and discourse to the black faces in India, how eloquent
          he might be. My dear fellow, why don't you try the streets of London
          first, and see whether you are eloquent there. Many a lady imagines
          that if she could move in a high circle she would no doubt become
          another Lady Huntingdon, and do wonders. But why cannot you do wonders
          in the circle in which God has placed you? He does not call you to do
          that which is leagues away, and which is beyond your power; it is that
          which your hand findeth to do I am persuaded that our home duties, --
          the duties which come near to us in our own streets, in our own lanes
          and alleys, -- are the duties in which we ought most of us mainly to
          glorify Christ. Why will you be stretching out your hands to that
          which you cannot reach? Do that which is near, -- which is at your
          hand. People sometimes come to their minister and say, "What shall I
          do for Christ?" In nine eases out of ten it is evidence of a lazy,
          idle spirit, when men ask what they shall do. For if they were really
          in earnest, -- wanting to do something they would find themselves
          placed in the midst of such a press of work, that the question would
          not be, "What can I do?" but "Which out of all these shall I do first?
          for here is enough to fill an angel's hands, and occupy more than all
          a mortal's time." Very often I find men ambitious to serve God in an
          orbit in which they will never move. Many say, I wish I could become a
          preacher." Yes, but you are not called to be a preacher it may be.
          Serve God in that which your hand findeth present. Serve him in your
          immediate situation, where you now are. Can you not distribute tracts?
          "Oh yes," you say, "but I was thinking of doing something else." Yes,
          but God put you there to do that. Could you not teach an infant class
          in the Sunday School?" I was thinking of being the superintendent of
          the Sunday School." Were you, indeed? but flour hand has not found out
          how to get there. Do what thy hand has found: it has found an infant
          class to teach. Could you not endeavor to instruct your family, and
          teach your servants in the way of God -- God helping? "Oh yes," says
          one, "but I was thinking about organizing a Dorcas Society, or a
          Ladies' Visiting or Tract Distributing Society." Yes, but your hand
          has not found that out yet. Just do that first which is nearest to
          you. Begin at home. When Jerusalem was built, every man built before
          his own house. Do you the same? There is a vise provision by our
          rulers, that every man should cleanse the street in front of his own
          house. Why will you, who fire here in Southwark walk all the way to
          Islington to cleanse the street in front of somebody else's door? Stop
          and attend to y our own work. and if everybody will do that which
          comes immediately under his own eyes, and is found out by his own hand
          then how much may be accomplished. Depend upon it, there is more
          wisdom in that than some of us dream. "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to
          do, do it." Do not be prowling about for work, but do it where it is
          when thy hand findeth it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, "whatsoever thy hand findeth to do," refers to works that are
          possible. There are many things which our heart findeth to do that we
          never shall do. It is well it is in our heart, God accepts the will
          for the deed. But if we would be eminently useful, we must not be
          content with forming schemes in our heart, and talking of them with
          our lips. We must get plan" that are tangible, schemes that we can
          really manage, ideas that we can really carry out; and so we shall
          fulfill the exhortation of Solomon, "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to
          do, do it." I will give you an illustration not many months ago in a
          certain magazine, which I will not mention, there was a supplement
          given upon China; in which supplement the churches represented by that
          magazine were exhorted to raise enough money to send a hundred
          missionaries to China. There was a vary earnest appeal made to the
          churches -- a glorious blast of trumpets as if something very great
          was coming. The mountain was in labor, and labor it did. Now, I have
          been told that the secretary of the Chinese mission called upon the
          editor of the aforesaid magazine, and said, "I see you have a proposal
          to send a hundred missionaries to China. Will you strike the two off
          and find money enough to send one. It is said that they who aim at the
          moon will shoot higher than those who shoot at a bush. It may be
          correct, they may shoot higher, but I do not think they are so likely
          to hit their mark. Shooting high is not the thing: it is hitting what
          you shoot at now, if they had said, "We will do our utmost to send one
          missionary to China," they might have effected it; but they were
          talking about a hundred and they have not succeeded, nor are they
          likely to do".
        </p>
        <p>
          The exhortation of our preacher would come home to such people. They
          have got it in their hearts to do it; they say when they grow big
          enough they mean to accomplish great things. "Who art thou. O great
          mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain." Now, instead
          of meddling with that great mountain, suppose you try your faith upon
          a fig tree first; and, then, if you moved that first, you might have
          confidence to move a mountain. John Bunyan was a very wise man when he
          thought once he would try to work miracles, Instead of ordering the
          sun and moon to go back several degrees, as he rode along he thought
          he would tell the puddles in the road to become dry. It was a miracle
          that would not interfere with anybody, and therefore a very proper one
          to begin with. But in the beginning the thought came into his mind,
          "Pray first;" and when he prayed he could not find any promise that he
          could dry up the puddles, and so he determined to leave them alone. I
          hope those men who come with some splendid vision in their heads would
          only try to do what they can and no more. When they become giants let
          them do a giant's work, but as long as they are dwarfs, let them do a
          dwarf's work Remember, the exhortation of the great man is, to do, not
          great things, but to do the things that thy hand findeth to do --
          present things, possible things. Do not be scheming and speculating
          about what you would do if your old aunt were to leave you twenty
          thousand pounds, or what you would do if you were to become prime
          minister, and so forth. Do what you can, in your workshop or shed, or
          with a needle in your hand; and if ever you have a scepter -- which is
          not likely -- and you use your needle well, you would be the most
          likely person to use your scepter well also.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is another word of exhortation which seems to strike me as being
          very necessary when addressing God's people, it is this: "Whatsoever
          thy hand findeth to do." Suppose, now, the duty which lies against our
          door to be a very disagreeable one. A sad thing that any duty should
          be disagreeable to the man who has been saved by Christ, but so it is.
          There are some duties, which while we are nothing but poor flesh and
          blood will always be less agreeable than certain others; yet, mark
          you, though the duties seem to you to be degrading and disagreeable,
          contrary to your taste, yet the exhortation hath it, "Whatsoever thy
          hand findeth to do, do it with thy might." Whether it be the
          visitation of the poorest of the poor or the teaching of tile most
          ignorant, whether the hewing of wood or the drawing of water, the very
          lowest work in the Lord's house, if thy hand findeth it to do it. You
          will remark in many Christians, and possibly if you are wise you will
          remark in yourself, how we all have a preference to do those duties
          which we regard as being honorable, as coming strictly within the
          range of our own office, those which probably will be rewarded with
          the praise of men. But it there is any duly that shall never be heard
          of till the day of judgment, if there is any work that never shall be
          seen until the blaze of the last day shall manifest it to a blind
          world, then we generally slur such a duty and seek another. Oh, if ire
          did but understand the true majesty of humility, and how great a thing
          it is for a Christian to do little things, to bow himself and to
          stoop, we should rather envy the meanest of the flock than the
          greatest, and each of us try to wash the saint's feet and perform the
          most menial service for the Master. Often, I think, when you and I are
          standing back for some humbling duty if Christ Jesus should come by
          that way and do it, how we should blush. Let me give you Christ's own
          picture. There was a poor wounded Samaritan who was left half dead.
          There was a priest coming to Jerusalem. He was busy with his sermon,
          looking over his notes, and thinking of what he should have to say to
          the people when he addressed them. Well, there was a poor fellow the
          other side of the road, wounded. It was no business of his -- he was a
          preacher. If he went to interfere with that poor man's wounds, he was
          quite sure it would be such a ghastly sight that he would not be able
          to preach half so well, so he passed by. Well, then there came a
          Levite, a good respectable deacon in the sanctuary. "Well," he says,
          "I must make haste and catch the minister, or else I shall not be in
          time to read the hymns." It was no business of his to go and see after
          the poor man who was wounded. At last the Master himself came that
          way, and he, the head of the church, the prince of preachers. the
          great deacon, the great servant of servants, he did not disdain to
          bind up the broken heart, and to heal the poor man's wounds. There is
          a story told in the old American war, that once upon a time George
          Washington, the commander-in-chief, was going around among his
          soldiers. They were hard at work, lifting a heavy piece of timber at
          some fortification There stood the corporal of the regiment calling
          out to his men, "Heave there, heave ahoy!" and giving them all kinds
          of directions. As large as possible the good corporal was. So
          Washington, alighting from his horse, said to him, "What is the good
          of your calling out to those men, why don't you help them yourself and
          do part of the work." The corporal drew himself up and said, "Perhaps
          you are not aware to whom you are speaking, sir; 1 am a corporal." "I
          beg your pardon," said Washington; "you are a corporal are you; I am
          sorry I should have insulted you." So he took off his own coat and
          waistcoat and set to work to help the men build the fortification When
          he had done he said, "Mr. Corporal, I am sorry I insulted you, but
          when you have any more fortifications to get up, and your men won't
          help you, send for George Washington, the commander-in-chief, and I
          will come and help them." The corporal slunk away perfectly ashamed of
          himself. And so Christ Jesus might say to us, "Oh, you don't like
          teaching the poor; it is beneath your dignity; then let your
          commander-in-chief do it; he can teach the poor, he can wash the feet
          of the saints, he can visit the sick and afflicted -- he came from
          heaven to do this, and he will set you the example." Surely we should
          each be ashamed of ourselves, and declare from this time forward
          whatever it is, be it great or little, if it comes to our hand, and if
          God will but give us help and give us grace, we will do it with all
          our might. I have thus explained what we are to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. And, now, How are we to do it? "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,
          do it with thy might." First, "do it." That is do it promptly; not
          fritter away your lives in setting down what you intend to do
          to-morrow as being a recompense for the idleness of to-day. No man
          ever served God by doing things tomorrow. If we have honored Christ
          and are blessed, it is by the things which we do to-day. For after
          all, the ticking of the clock saith-today! to-day! to-day! We have no
          other time in which to live. The past is gone; the future hath not
          come; we have, we never shall have, anything but the present. This is
          our all. let us do what our hand findeth to do. Young Christian, are
          you just converted? Do not wait until your experience has ripened into
          maturity before you attempt to serve God. And now to bring forth
          fruit. This very day, if it be the first day of your conversion, bring
          forth fruits meet for repentance -- even now. And thou who art now in
          middle age, say not, "I will begin to serve Christ when my hair shall
          be frosty with age." No. Now do it. -- do it -- "do it with thy
          might." Oh that God would keep us to this -- that we would always do
          our day's work in our day, and serve him now. I have heard of a
          certain divine who was a preacher at Newgate. He preached a sermon
          divided into two parts: the first was to the saint, the second was to
          the sinner. When he had finished the first part, to the saint, in the
          morning, he said he would preach to the sinner the next Sunday
          morning, and then finish his sermon. There was a poor man who was
          hanged on the Monday, and who therefore never heard that part of the
          discourse which was best adapted to his case. How often may we be
          found in the like light. We may be saying, "I will do him good
          by-and-bye." But he may be dead then, and our opportunity will be
          gone, or, what is just as likely, we may be dead also; and then all
          our opportunities will be passed, and it will be totally out of our
          power to do anything. Do it! do it! do it! This is what the church of
          Christ wants to have proclaimed as with the sound of a trumpet in all
          her ranks, "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it." Put it not off
          one hour. Do it! Procrastinate not a day. "Procrastination is the
          thief of time." Let him not steal thy time. Do it, at once. Serve thy
          God now; for now is all the time thou canst reckon on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, the next words, "Do it with thy might." Whatever you do for
          Christ, throw your whole soul into it Christ wants none to serve him
          with their fingers: he must have their hands their arms, their hearts,
          We must not give Christ a little slurred labor, which is done as a
          matter of course now and then; but when we do serve him, we must do it
          with all our bears, and soul, and strength, and might. Among the old
          Roman pagans, they were accustomed to slay the beasts and cut them
          open, in order to discover future events. If ever they cut open a
          bullock and could not find the heart, it was always considered by the
          people to be an ill omen. And depend upon it, if ye cut your works
          open and cannot find your hearts in them, it is an ill omen for your
          works -- they are good for nothing, and their object shall never be
          accomplished. The worst part of the Christian church at this time is,
          that it seems as if many of our ministers and their churches had lost
          their hearts. Step into your churches and chapels, everything is
          orderly and precise. but where is the life, where is the power? I
          confess that I would rather address a congregation of ignorant men who
          are alive and enthusiastic, than a congregation of the most learned
          and orderly who are dead and blank, upon whose ears all the preaching
          in the world falls as but a dull monotony. About three weeks ago I was
          addressing a Methodist congregation. They leaped on their feet, now
          and then, and cried, "Hallelujah! Glory be to God!" My whole soul was
          stirred within me, and I felt that I could preach and preach again,
          and never grow weary while these people drink in the word with real
          life. I am persuaded that real good was done, and that they did not
          forget what was said. But, then, our people take things so orderly;
          they come and take their seats so quietly; until it often seems that
          one might preach to a set of statues or wooden blocks, with just as
          much hope of effect as to preach to them. We want life, we want heart.
          heart in the ministry, heart in the deacons, heart in all the offices
          of the church, and until we have this we cannot expect the Master's
          blessing. You are going to teach in the Sunday school this afternoon,
          are you? How are you going to teach? "I am going to do as I have often
          done." Stand back I If you are going to serve Christ, stand back till
          you have got your heart with you, and take with you all your strength,
          and all your might, and say as David did, "Bless the Lord, and serve
          the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me." Serve the Master and
          spend yourself in your strength. I would rather have no sermon than a
          dull sermon, no teaching than sleepy teaching, no prayers than
          lifeless prayers. A cold religion is tasteless. Let us have a hot
          religion that will burn its way into the heart. this is the religion
          that will make its way in the world, and make itself respected, even
          though some pretend to despise it. "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,
          do it with thy might."
        </p>
        <p>
          But where is the might of a Christian? Let us not forget that. The
          might of a Christian is not in himself, for he is perfect weakness.
          His might lieth in the Lord of Hosts. It will be well for us if all we
          attempt to do is done in God's strength, or else it will not be done
          with might: it will be feebly and badly done. Whenever we attempt to
          serve a loaf in the winning of souls, let us first begin with prayer.
          Let us seek his help. Let us go on with prayer mixed with faith; and
          when we have concluded the work, let us commend it again to God with
          renewed faith and fresh prayer. What we do thus will be well done, and
          will not fail in its effect. But what we do merely with
          creature-strength, with the mere influence of carnal zeal, will come
          to nothing at all. "whatsoever thy hand findeth to do," do it with
          that real might which God hath promised them that ask it, with that
          real wisdom which he giveth liberally, which he bestows on all who
          seek it meekly and reverently at his feet. God help us, then to carry
          out this exhortation, "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it v with
          thy might."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. And, now, the third part of the exhortation was, Why? We are to do
          it with all our might death is near. and when death comes there will
          be an end to all our serving God on earth, an end to our preaching, an
          end to our praying, an end to our doing aught for God's glory among
          the perishing souls of men. If we all lived in the light of our
          funerals how well should we live. Some of the old Romish monks always
          read their Bibles with a candle stuck in a skull. The light from a
          death's head may be an awful one, but it is a very profitable one.
          There is no way of living like that. There is an old monkish legend
          told of a great painter, who had begun a painting, but did not finish
          it; and as the legend went, he prayed that he might come back on earth
          that he might finish that painting. There is a picture now extant,
          representing him after he had come back to finish his picture. There
          is a solemnity about that man's look, as he paints away with all his
          might, for he had but little time allowed him, and a ghastliness, as
          if he knew that he must soon go back again, and wanted his labor to be
          finished. If you were quite sure of the time of your death, if you
          knew you had but a week or two to live, with what haste would you go
          round and bid farewell to all your friends; with what haste would you
          begin to set all matters right on earth, supposing matters are all
          right for eternity. But, Christian men like other men, forget that
          they are mortal, and even we who profess to see into the future, and
          declaring that we are looking for a city that hath foundations, whose
          builder and maker is God, even we seem to think that we shall live
          here for ever. It is well that God puts a thorn into our nest, or
          else, often his own birds of Paradise would build their nests here and
          never mount higher. Let us pause a moment, and think that in a short
          time we must die. The hour is not to be staved off. When yon winged
          arrow shall have ended its hasty journey, and found its target in this
          heart, then all is over. I may preach to you to-day and exhort you to
          flee from the wrath to come; but when this tongue is sealed in
          silence, I can no more warn you. If I have been unfaithful, and have
          not discharged my Master's message and faithfully told it, I cannot
          come back and tell it over again. Mother, you can pray for your
          children, now; but when death shall have sealed your eyes in darkness,
          there can be no more prayers lifted up for ever. You can teach them
          now in God's Word, and labor that they may be brought to know their
          mother's God, but it shall be all over then. You may now, O Sunday
          school teacher, instruct those children. and God blessing you, you may
          be their spiritual father and bring them to Christ; but it shall one
          day be whispered in your class, "teacher is dead;" and there is the
          end of your labor. Your children may come to your grave, and sit down
          there and weep, but from the clay-cold sod no voice of warning can
          come up. There, your warning and your love is lost, alike unknowing
          and unknown. And you, the servant of Christ, with great stores of
          wealth, you have this day money with which God's cause might be
          greatly helped; you have talent, too, which might fit you well to
          stand in the midst of the church and serve it. You are going the way
          of all flesh. Grey hairs are scattered here and there. You know that
          your end is approaching. When once death shall have come your ham!
          cannot devise liberal things; your brain cannot form new devices for
          the spread of your Master's kingdom, neither can your heart, then,
          bend and weep over sinners perishing, or your tongue address them with
          earnest exhortation. Think, dear friends, that all we can do for our
          fellows we must do, now. For the cerement shall soon enwrap us, the
          hands must soon hang down, and the eyes be shut, and the tongue be
          still. While we live let us live. There are no two live. accorded us
          on earth. If we build not now, the fabric can never be built. If now
          we spin not, the garment will never be woven. Work while ye live, and
          live while ye work; and God grant to each of us that we may discharge
          in this life all the desires of our hearts, in magnifying God and
          bringing sinners to the cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. How, having thus explained and opened the exhortation, I shall
          pray that God's Holy Spirit may be solemnly with me while very briefly
          and very vehemently, I endeavor to STIR UP ALL PROFESSORS OF RELIGION
          HERE PRESENT TO DO WHATSOEVER THEIR HANDS FINDETH TO DO, TO DO IT NOW,
          AND WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT. If Christ Jesus should leave the upper world
          and come into the midst of this hall this morning, what answer could
          you give if after showing you his wounded hands and feet, and his rent
          side, he should put this question, "I have done all this for thee what
          hast thou done for me?" Let me put that question for him, and in his
          behalf. You have known his love some of you, forty years, some of you
          thirty, twenty, ten, three, one. He has done all this for you, has
          bled away his precious life, has died in agonies most exquisite upon
          the cross. What have you done for him? Turn over your diary now. Can
          you remember the contributions you have given out of your wealth, and
          what do they amount to? Add them up. Think of what you have done for
          him, how much of v our time you have spent in his service. Add that
          up, turn over another leaf, and then observe how much time you have
          spent in praying for the progress of his kingdom. What have you done
          there? Add that up. I will do so for myself, and I can say without a
          boast I have labored to serve God, and have been in labors more
          abundant; but when I come to add all up and set what I have done side
          by side with what I owe to Christ, it is less than nothing and vanity,
          I pour contempt upon it all, it is but dust of vanity. and though from
          this day forward I should preach every hour in the day, though I could
          spend myself and be spent; though night should know no rest and day
          should never cease from toil, and year should succeed to year till
          this hair was hoary and this frame exhausted, when I come to render up
          my account he might say, "Well done." but I should not feel it was so,
          but should rather say, "I am still an unprofitable servant; I have not
          done that which it was even my bare duty to do much less have I done
          all to show the love I owe." Now will you think what you have done
          dear brother and sister, and surely your account must fall short
          equally with mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as for some of you, you have done positively nothing. You have
          joined the church and have been baptized, and that is about all, you
          have sometimes doled out a little from your abundance to the cause of
          Christ, but oh, how little when you think he gave his all for you!
          Others there are of you who out of your little have given much, out of
          your weakness have been strong, in your poverty you have never been
          poor towards Christ's cause; ye shall not lack your reward at last but
          even ye will come with the rest of us and say, "Lord help us to love
          the poor and by thy amazing love to us constrain us to devote
          ourselves wholly, unreservedly to thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          Another argument let me give you, why you should serve Christ with all
          your might now. You believe, my dear hearers, that if men die
          unconverted their doom is fearful beyond all expression. You and I are
          compelled to believe from the testimony of the Spirit, that the
          punishment of those who die impenitent is beyond all that words can
          describe. They sink into a pit that is bottomless, into a fire that
          never can be quenched where they are fed on by a worm that dieth not.
          You know, and sometimes your hair has almost stood on end with the
          thought that the wrath to come is more than the soul can conceive. And
          is it possible, can it be possible with this belief in your mind that
          many of your fellow-creatures are going post-haste to this awful, this
          fearful hell, that you are idle and doing nothing? May God forgive you
          if such is your unfeeling state of heart -- that you can contemplate a
          fellow-creature perishing in the fires of hell, and yet permit your
          band to hang down in listless idleness. O children of the living God,
          I beseech you by the fires of hell, by the agony that knows of no
          abatement by the thirst that is not to be mitigated by a drop of
          water, by the eternity which knows no end; I beseech you by the wrath
          to come, be ye up and doing, earnestly striving together to be the
          means in God's hand of awakening poor souls and bringing them to the
          mercy of Christ. Be ye earnest. If ye do not believe this Bible, I
          care not what you are -- earnest or dull. But if ye do believe it, act
          as ye believe; if ye think men are perishing, if the Lord's right hand
          is dashing in pieces his enemy, then I beseech you be strengthened by
          the same right hand, to endeavor to bring those enemies to Christ that
          they may be reconciled by the blood of the cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, now last of all, let, me just appeal to you in this way.
          Possibly, in my explanation, I have led you to form in your heart some
          great scheme of what you would do. Let me knock that all to pieces,
          because that is not my text. It is not a great scheme, but it is,
          "whatsoever your hand findeth to do," that I want you to do. My dear
          friends, many of you are parents of children. It is quite certain,
          whatever else may be your duty, that your duty as parents is first. As
          their parents you owe them a duty; you have responsibilities towards
          them, and it is your duty to bring them up in the fear and nurture of
          God. May I earnestly beg and beseech of you, not to neglect this; for
          remember, you will soon be gone, and will not this be a thorn in your
          dying pillow, if, when your children stand around your bed to bid
          farewell to their dying father, or their dying mother, they shall have
          to say to you, "You are going from us, but we shall not miss you. We
          shall miss you as far as temporal things is concerned but when you are
          dead we shall be as well off in spiritual things as we were before,
          for you neglected us." They will not say so but do you suppose they
          will not think so, if such be the truth? Children are always quick.
          and if they say it not they would feel it. Will it not be far better,
          if God stroll so bless you, that when you lay sick and dying, there
          shall be a daughter wiping the hot sweat from your brow, and saying,
          "Fear not, mother, though you walk through the valley of the shadow of
          death, "God is with you, and you need fear no evil?' Will it not be a
          satisfaction to you, father, when you die if glancing at the foot of
          the bed, you can say to your son, "Farewell, my son; I bless God that
          I leave you in this world to carry on the work which I have begun, for
          you are walking in your father's steps." I know of no greater joy than
          for some aged patriarch, and I know of one, -- God bless him, he is
          preaching the word I doubt not this morning, -- to be able to look to
          sons and daughters converted to Christ and then to look to another
          generation and see grandchildren converted to Christ It must be a
          noble thing to die and leave behind three generations, and many of
          these already able to call the Redeemer blessed. O neglect not your
          present work I beseech you, or otherwise you shall lose the present
          blessing; and by neglecting this present duty which concerns your own
          household, you shell incur a household curse and make your death-bed
          uneasy, so that you shall toss there with those eyes looking on you,
          and silently charging you with having neglected their souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sunday school teachers, I give you the same exhortation. I pray God
          that when you die it may not be said in your schools, "Well, we do not
          miss so-and-so at all; she was not a teacher we could desire, she
          filled up a gap, and that is all we can say." I hope it may be said of
          you, my brothers and sisters, in the holy work of Sunday -- school
          teaching, "They are gone to their grave, and there is a vacancy made
          which will not soon be filled." But still your children shall gather
          round your coffin, and say, "God be blessed that we ever had such a
          teacher!" And though they are not converted, yet shall their little
          eyes weep w hen they think, "Teacher will never weep over us again.
          teacher will never pray for us any more, teacher will never tell us of
          Christ again;" and that very thought may be more powerful in their
          minds than all you ever said to them, and may, perhaps, effect the
          work which was not accomplished when your soul left the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I charge myself most solemnly in his conclusion, to be more
          earnest than ever in preaching the Word to you, -- to preach it in
          season and out of season to preach it with all my might, for I shall
          soon be gone. Life lasts not long, and when we have all departed may
          not others have to think of us, that we went before our work was fully
          accomplished? Once when George Whitfleld was very sick and ill he was
          laid down by his friends by the fireside and he lay there as if he was
          dying. Presently he opened his eyes and a poor old negro woman, who
          had watched over him when others had given him up, spoke to him and
          said, "Massa George Whitfield are you still alive?" He looked and
          said, "Yes, I am; but I was in hopes I should have been in heaven."
          Then the old woman made this pretty speech. "Ah! Massa George," she
          said, "you went to the very gates of heaven, and Christ said, Go back,
          Massa George; there are many poor negroes down on the earth that I
          mean to have saved. Go back and tell them I love them, and mind you do
          not come back any more till you bring them all with you." So Whitfield
          recovered strength, and even found, as the old women said, a desire
          not to go home till he could take these poor negroes with him. So may
          it be with us; may we live till we shall bring many souls home with us
          to glory, and then may it be said --
        </p>
        <p>"Servant of Christ well done,</p>
        <p>Rest from thy loved employ;</p>
        <p>The battle's fought. the victory's won,</p>
        <p>Enter thy rest with joy."</p>
        <p>
          "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved, for he that
          believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not
          shall be damned."<br />
