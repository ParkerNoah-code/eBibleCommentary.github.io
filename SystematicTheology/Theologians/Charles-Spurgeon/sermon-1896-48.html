          13. As a father is compassionate towards his children, so has Jehovah
          been compassionate towards them that fear him.14. For he knoweth of
          what we are made; he hath remembered that we are dust.15. As for man,
          his days are like the grass: as a flower of the field, so he
          flourisheth.16. As soon as the wind passeth over it, it is gone; and
          its place shall know it no more.

          13. As a father is compassionate towards his children, The Psalmist
          not only explains by a comparison what he has already stated, but he
          at the same time assigns the cause why God so graciously forgives us,
          which is, because he is a father It is then in consequence of God's
          having freely and sovereignly adopted us as his children that he
          continually pardons our sins, and accordingly we are to draw from that
          fountain the hope of forgiveness. And as no man has been adopted on
          the ground of his own merit, it follows that sins are freely pardoned.
          God is compared to earthly fathers, not because he is in every respect
          like them, but because there is no earthly image by which his
          unparalleled love towards us can be better expressed. That God's
          fatherly goodness may not be perverted as an encouragement to sin,
          David again repeats that God is thus favorable only to those who are
          his sincere worshippers. It is indeed a proof of no ordinary
          forbearance for God to "make his sun to rise on the evil and on the
          good," (Matthew 5:45;) but the subject here treated is the free
          imputation of the righteousness by which we are accounted the children
          of God. Now this righteousness is offered only to those who entirely
          devote themselves to so bountiful a Father, and reverently submit to
          his word. But as our attainments in godliness in this world, whatever
          they may be, come far short of perfection, there remains only one
          pillar on which our salvation can securely rest, and that is the
          goodness of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          14. For he knoweth David here annihilates all the worth which men
          would arrogate to themselves, and asserts that it is the consideration
          of our misery, and that alone, which moves God to exercise patience
          towards us. This again we ought carefully to mark, not only for the
          purpose of subduing the pride of our flesh, but also that a sense of
          our unworthiness may not prevent us from trusting in God. The more
          wretched and despicable our condition is, the more inclined is God to
          show mercy, for the remembrance that we are clay and dust is enough to
          incite him to do us good.
        </p>

          To the same purpose is the comparison immediately following, (verse
          15,) that all the excellency of man withers away like a fading flower
          at the first blast of the wind. Man is indeed improperly said to
          flourish. But as it might be alleged that he is, nevertheless,
          distinguished by some endowment or other, David grants that he
          flourishes like the grass, instead of saying, as he might justly have
          done, that he is a vapor or shadow, or a thing of nought. Although, as
          long as we live in this world, we are adorned with natural gifts, and,
          to say nothing of other things, "live, and move, and have our being in
          God," (Acts 17:28;) yet as we have nothing except what is dependent on
          the will of another, and which may be taken from us every hour, our
          life is only a show or phantom that passes away. The subject here
          treated, is properly the brevity of life, to which God has a regard in
          so mercifully pardoning us, as it is said in another psalm: "He
          remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passeth away, and
          cometh not again," (Psalm 78:39.) If it is asked why David, making no
          mention of the soul, which yet is the principal part of man, declares
          us to be dust and clay? I answer, that it is enough to induce God
          mercifully to sustain us, when he sees that nothing surpasses our life
          in frailty. And although the soul, after it has departed from the
          prison of the body, remains alive, yet its doing so does not arise
          from any inherent power of its own. Were God to withdraw his grace,
          the soul would be nothing more than a puff or blast, even as the body
          is dust; and thus there would doubtless be found in the whole man
          nothing but mere vanity.<br />
