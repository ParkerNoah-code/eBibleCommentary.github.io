        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.274)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, September 11th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "Having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far
          better." -- Philippians 1:23.
        </p>
        <p>
          WE KNOW THAT DEATH is not the end of our being. By a confident faith
          we are persuaded that better things await us in another state. We are
          speeding onwards through our brief life like an arrow shot from a bow,
          and we feel that we shall not drop down at the end of our flight into
          the dreariness of annihilation, but we shall find a heavenly target
          far across the flood of death. The force which impels us onwards is
          too mighty to be restrained by death. We have that within us which is
          not to be accounted for, if there be not a world to come, and
          especially, as believers, we have hopes, and desires, and aspirations,
          which cannot be fulfilled, and which must have been given us purposely
          to make us miserable, and to tantalize us, if there be not a state in
          which every one of these shall be satisfied and filled to the brim
          with Joy. We know, too, that the world into which we shall soon be
          ushered is one which shall never pass away. We have learned full well
          by experience that all things here are but for a season. They are
          things which shall be shaken, and, therefore, will not remain in the
          day when God shall shake both heaven and earth. But equally certain
          are we that the inheritance which awaits us in the world to come is
          eternal and unfailing, that the cycles of ages shall never move it;
          that the onflowing of eternity itself shall not diminish its duration.
          We know that the world to which we go is not to be measured by
          leagues, nor is the life thereof to be calculated by centuries. Well
          does it become every one of us, then, professing the Christian name,
          to be questioning ourselves as to the view which we take of the world
          to come. lt may be there are some of you now present who call
          yourselves believers, who look into a future state with shuddering and
          awe. Possibly there may be but few here who have attained to the
          position of the apostle, when he could say, that he had a desire to
          depart and to be with Christ. I take it that our view of our own death
          is one of the readiest tokens by which we may judge of our own
          spiritual condition. When men fear death it is not certain that they
          are wicked, but it is quite certain that if they have faith it is in a
          very weak and sickly condition. When men desire death we may not rest
          assured that they are therefore righteous, for they may desire it for
          wrong reasons; but if for right reasons they are panting to enter into
          another state, we may gather from this, not only that their minds are
          right with God, but that their faith is sanctified and that their love
          is fervent.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope that the service of this morning may have the effect of leading
          every one of us to self-examination. I shall endeavor while preaching
          to search myself, and I pray that each one of you may be led to hear
          for himself, and I beseech you to put home each pertinent and personal
          question to your own souls, while in a quiet, but I hope in a forcible
          manner, I shall endeavor to describe the apostle's feelings in
          prospect of departure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three things I shall observe this morning. First of all, the apostle's
          description of death; secondly, his desire for it, and thirdly, the
          reasons which justified such a desire.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. THE APOSTLE'S DESCRIPTION OF DEATH. We are to understand this of
          course as being a description not of the death of the wicked, but of
          the death of the righteous. And you will remark the apostle does not
          call it an arrest. In the death of the wicked, the sheriff's officer
          of justice doth lay his clay-cold hand upon the man's shoulder, and he
          is his prisoner for ever. The sergeant-at-arms in the name of the
          justice which has been incensed, puts the fetters about his wrists,
          and conducts him to the prison-house of despair and everlasting
          torment. In the Christian's case, however, there is no such thing as
          an arrest, for there is no one that can arrest him. We sometimes talk
          of death arresting the believer in the midst of his career, but we
          misuse terms. Who shall arrest a man against whom there is neither
          conviction nor accusation? Who is he that condemneth the man for whom
          Christ has died? Nay, further, who shall so much as lay anything to
          the charge of God's elect? How then can the Christian be arrested? It
          is no such thing; it is an arrest of the ungodly, but not of the
          believer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor does Paul speak of the believer's death as being a sudden plunge.
          This is a proper description of the death of the ungodly. He stands
          upon the brink of a precipice, and beneath him there is a yawning and
          bottomless gulf. Through thick darkness he must descend, and into it
          his unwilling spirit must take a desperate leap. Not so the believer.
          His is no leap downwards: it is a climbing upwards. He has his foot
          upon the first round of the ladder, and joyful is the hour when his
          Master saith unto him, "Come up higher; ascend to another
          guest-chamber, and here feast upon richer dainties than those I have
          given thee below." Aye! tis no leap in the dark. Tis no plunge into a
          cold sea; tis simply a departure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me describe what I think the apostle means by the figure of a
          departure. Many deaths are preceded by a long season of sickness, and
          then I think we might picture them by the departure of a ship from its
          moorings. There lies the ship in its haven. there is a friend of yours
          about to journey away to some distant clime. You will never see his
          face again in the flesh. He is going to emigrate; he will find a home
          in another and he hopes a happier land. You stand upon the shore; you
          have given him the last embrace. The mother has given to her son the
          last kiss, the friend has shaken him by the hand for the last time,
          and now the signal is given; the anchor is taken up; the rope which
          held the ship to the shore is loosed, and lo, the ship is moving and
          she floats outward towards the sea. You look, you still wave your hand
          as you see the ship departing. Your friend stands on some prominent
          spot on the deck, and there he waves his handkerchief to the last. But
          the most sharpsighted of friends in such scenes must lose sight of one
          another. The ship floats on; you just now catch a sight of the sails,
          but with the strongest telescope you cannot discover your friend. He
          is gone: it is his departure. Weep as you may, you cannot bring him
          back again. Your sorrowful tears may mingle with the flood that has
          carried him away, but they cannot entice a single wave to restore him
          to you. Now even so is the death of many a believer. His ship is
          quietly moored in its haven. He is calmly lying upon his bed. You
          visit him in his chamber. Without perturbation of spirit be bids you
          farewell. His grip is just as hearty as he shakes your hand, as ever
          it was in the best hour of his health. His voice is still firm, and
          his eye is still bright. He tells you he is going to another and a
          better land. You say to him, "Shall I sing to you" --
        </p>
        <p>"Begone unbelief, my Saviour is near?"</p>
        <p>"Oh! no" says he, "sing me no such a hymn as that; sing me --</p>
        <p>"Jerusalem my happy home,</p>
        <p>Name ever dear to me,</p>
        <p>When shall my labors have an end</p>
        <p>In joy, and peace, and thee."</p>
        <p>
          He bide you a last farewell. You see him for a little season even
          after that, although he is too far gone again to address you. It may
          be a partial insensibility seizes hold of him; he is like a ship that
          is just going out of sight; you look at his lips, and as you bow down
          your ear, you can catch some faint syllables of praise. He is talking
          to himself of that precious Jesus who is still his joy and hope. You
          watch him till the last heaving breath has left the body, and you
          retire with the sweet reflection that his Spirit on a glassy sea has
          floated joyously to its post. Thus the believer's death is a
          departure. There is no sinking in the wave; there is no destruction of
          the vessel: it is a departure. He has gone; he has sailed over a calm
          and quiet sea, and he is gone to a better land.
        </p>
        <p>
          At other times deaths are more sudden, and are not heralded by
          protracted sickness. The man is in health, and he is suddenly snatched
          away, and the place which knew him once knows him no more for ever. I
          am about to use a figure which will seem to you extremely homely, and
          certainly could not be classical. I remember to have been once a
          spectator in a sorrowful scene. A company of villagers, the younger
          branches of a family, were about to emigrate to another land. The aged
          mother who had not for some years left her cottage and her fireside,
          came to the railway station from which they must start on their
          departure. I stood among the sorrowful group as a friend and minister
          I think I see the many embraces which the fond mother gave to her son
          and daughter, and the little ones, her grand-children. I see them even
          now folding their arms about her a aged neck, and then bidding
          farewell to all the friends in the village who had come to bid them
          adieu. And well I remember her, who was about to lose the props of her
          household. A shrill sound is heard, as if it were the messenger of
          death, it sends a pang through all hearts. In great haste at the small
          village station the passengers are hurried to their seats They thrust
          their heads out of the carriage window. The aged parent stands on the
          very edge of the platform that she may take the last look. There is a
          sound from the engine, and away goes the train. I remember well the
          instant when that poor woman leaning on her staff sprang up from the
          chair with which she had been accommodated, and jumping from the
          platform, rushed alone the railway with all her might, crying, "My
          children! My children! My children! They are gone and I shall never
          see them again." The figure may not be classical, but nevertheless I
          have been reminded of it by many a death. When I have seen the godly
          suddenly snatched away -- no time to watch them -- they are gone,
          swift as the wind itself could bear them, as if the hasty waves of the
          sea had buried them out of sight. It is our affliction and our
          trouble, but we must stand behind and weep, for they are gone beyond
          recall. Notwithstanding, there is something pleasant in the picture.
          It is but a departure; they are not destroyed; they are not blown to
          atoms, they are not taken away to prison. Tis but a departure from one
          place to another. They still live; they still are blessed. While we
          weep they are rejoicing. While we mourn they are singing psalms of
          praise. Remember this my brethren in the apparel of mourning, and, if
          you hare lost friends of late, this may tend to console your spirits.
          Death to a believer is but a departure, yet what a departure it is!
          Can you and I think calmly of it? The time must come when I must
          depart from wife and children, and from house and home, when I must
          depart from everything that is dear to me on earth. The time is coming
          to thee, oh rich Christian, when thou must depart from all the
          comforts of thine estate, from all the luxuries of thine household,
          from all the enjoyments which thy rank confers upon thee. And oh, poor
          Christian, lover of thy home, the time is coming when thou must depart
          from thy cot, homely though it be, still dear unto thee; thou must
          leave the place of thy toil, and the sanctuary of thy rest. We must
          mount as on eagle's wings far from this world. We must bid adieu to
          its green fields as well as its dreary streets. We must say farewell
          to its blue skies and to its dusky clouds; farewell to foe and friend:
          farewell to all we have, alike to trial and to joy. But blessed be God
          it is not the last look of a criminal condemned to die, it is the
          farewell of one who departs to another and a happier land.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle's description of death, however, is not finished. He has
          here only pictured that which is visible. We now come to notice his
          description of the invisible part of death --
        </p>
        <p>"In vain the fancy strives to paint</p>
        <p>The moment after death;</p>
        <p>The glories which surround the saint</p>
        <p>When yielding up his breath.</p>
        <p>This much -- and this is all we know,</p>
        <p>They are supremely blest;</p>
        <p>Have done with sin, and care, and woe,</p>
        <p>And with their Saviour rest."</p>
        <p>
          This is precisely the apostle's description of the state of the
          believer after death. They depart; yes, but whither? To be with
          Christ. Just observe how quickly these scenes follow each other. The
          sail is spread; the soul is launched upon the deep. How long will be
          its voyage? How many wearying winds must beat upon the sail ere it
          shall be reefed in the port of peace? How often shall that soul be
          tossed upon the waves before it comes to the sea that knows no storm.
          Oh tell it, tell it everywhere; yon ship that has just departed is
          already at its haven. It did but spread its sail and it was there.
          Like the old ship on the lake of Galilee, there was a storm that
          tossed it, but Jesus said, "Peace, be still," and immediately it came
          to land. Yes, think not that there is a long period between the
          instant of death and the eternity of glory. There is not so much as
          space for the intervening of a lightning's flash. One gentle sigh, the
          fetter breaks, we scarce can say it is gone before the ransomed spirit
          takes its mansion near the throne. We depart, we are with Christ; more
          quickly than I can say the words, swifter than speech can express them
          they become true. They depart, nod they are with Christ; the selfsame
          instant they have closed their eyes on earth they have opened them in
          heaven. And what is this invisible part of death? "To be with Christ."
          Who can comprehend this but the Christian? It is a heaven which the
          worldling cares not for, if he could have it, be would not pawn his
          meanest lust to gain it. To be with Christ is to him a thing of
          nought, as gold and silver are of no more value to little children
          than the pieces of platter with which they will amuse themselves. So
          heaven and being with Christ is of no value to the childish sons of
          earthly mirth. They know not what a mass of glory is crowded into that
          one sentence. "To be with Christ." To the believer who understands it,
          it means, first, vision. "Thine eyes shall see him." I have heard of
          him, and though I have not seen his face, unceasingly I have adored
          him. But I shall see him. Yes, we shall actually gaze upon the exalted
          Redeemer. Realize the thought. Is there not a young heaven within it?
          Thou shalt see the hand that was nailed for thee; thou shalt kiss the
          very lips that said, "I thirst;" thou shalt see the thorn-crowned
          head, and bow with all the blood-washed throng, thou, the chief of
          sinners, shalt adore him who washed thee in his blood; when thou shalt
          have a vision of his glory. Faith is precious but what must sight be?
          To view Jesus as the Lamb of God through the glass of faith makes the
          soul rejoice with joy unspeakable; but oh! to see him face to face, to
          look into those dear eyes; to be embraced by those divine arms rapture
          begins at the very mention of it! While I speak of him, my soul is
          like the chariots of Aminadab, and I desire to depart and to be with
          him. But what must the vision be when the veil is taken from his face,
          and the dimness from our eyes, and when we shall talk with him even as
          a man talketh with his friend. But it is not only vision, it is
          communion. We shall walk with him, he shall walk with us, he shall
          speak to us, and we shall speak to him. All that the spouse desired in
          Solomon's Song, we shall have, and ten thousand times more. Then will
          the prayer be fulfilled "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his lips,
          for his love is better than wine." Then we shall be able to say "His
          left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me." Then
          will he tell us his love; then will rehearse the ancient story of the
          ever-lasting covenant, of his election of us by his own true love, of
          his bethrothal of us through his boundless affection, of his purchase
          of us by his rich compassion, of his preservation of us by his
          omnipotence, and of his bringing us safe at last to glory as the
          result of his promise and his blood. And then will we tell to him our
          love, then into his ear will we pour out the song of gratitude, a song
          such as we have never sung on earth, unmixed and pure, full of
          serenity and joy, no groans to mar its melody; a song rapt and
          seraphic, like the flaming sonnets which flash from burning tongues
          above. Happy, happy, happy day, when vision and communion shall be
          ours in fullness!" To be with Christ which is far better."
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is this all, it means fruition of Christ. Here we look and long to
          taste or if we taste it is but a sip, and we long to drink to the
          full. Here we are like Israel in the wilderness, who had but one
          cluster from Eschol, there we shall be in the vineyard. Here do we
          have the manna falling small, like coriander seed, but there shall we
          eat the bread of heaven and the old corn of the kingdom. We have
          sometimes on earth, lusts, ungratified desires, that lack
          satisfaction, but there the lust shall be slain and the desire shall
          be satiated. There shall be nothing we can want; every power shall
          find the sweetest employment in that eternal world of joy. There will
          be a full and lasting fruition of Christ, and last of all upon this
          point there shall be a sharing with Christ in his glory, and that for
          ever. "We shall see him," yes, and let us have the next sentence, and
          "shall be like him when we shall see him as he is." Oh Christian,
          antedate heaven for a few years. Within a very little time thou shalt
          be rid of all thy trials and thy troubles; thine aching head shall be
          girt with a crown of glory, thy poor panting heart shall find its rest
          and shall be satisfied with fullness as it beats upon the breast of
          Christ. Thy hands that now toil shall know no harder labor than
          harp-strings can afford. Thine eyes now suffused with tears shall weep
          no longer. Thou shalt gaze in ineffable rapture upon the splendor of
          him who sits upon the throne. Nay more, upon his throne shalt thou
          sit. He is King of kings, but thou shalt reign with him. He is a
          priest after the order of Melchisedec, but thou shalt be a priest with
          him. Oh rejoice! The triumph of his glory thou be shared by thee; his
          crown, his joy, his paradise, these shall be thine, and thou shalt be
          co-heir with him who is the heir of all things. Doth not this very
          description of the unseen part of death stir up in the heart of the
          believer a longing "to depart and to be with Christ which is far
          better."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I have thus, as well as I was able, spoken upon the first part.
          And now my friends, let us consider THE APOSTLE'S DESIRE. How
          differently do men regard death. We have seen men shriek at the
          prospect of it. I have seen the man driven to madness when the
          skeleton king has stared him in the face. Pacing up and down his
          chamber he has declared with many a curse and imprecation that he
          would not and could not die -- shrieking so that you could scarcely
          bear his company. He has looked forward to death as the concentration
          of all despair and agony, and he has vainly striven, with all his
          might, not to die. When he felt at last that death was stronger than
          he, and that he must get a desperate fall in the struggle, then has he
          began to shriek and to cry in such a strain that scarce demons
          themselves could excel the despair concentrated in each shriek. Others
          have we seen who have met death somewhat more calmly. Biting their
          lips, and setting fast their teeth, they have endeavored to keep up
          appearances, even in the last moment, but they have endured the inward
          suffering, betrayed to us most plainly by the staring eye, and the
          awful look. Others, too, we have seen, who, callous through sin,
          totally deserted by God's Spirit and given up to a seared conscience
          have gone to their death with idiot resignation. They have even played
          the madman yet more fully, and have tried to brag and bully even in
          the jaws of hell. Many Christians, have we met -- true believers --
          who can go so far as to say they were willing to die. Please God,
          whenever the solemn hour should come, they were prepared to go up to
          their chamber and stretch themselves upon their bed, and say, "Lord,
          now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace." But the apostle had
          gone further than they. He said he had a desire to depart, and the
          desire was a strong one. The Greek word has much force in it. He
          panteth, he longeth to be gone. I might paraphrase it by one of the
          verses of an old hymn --
        </p>
        <p>"To Jesus, the crown of my hope,</p>
        <p>My soul is in haste to be gone."</p>
        <p>
          He desired not to get away from earth for he loved to serve his
          Master, but he desired to be with Christ, which he declared to be far
          better. I ask you if you were in Paul's condition would not such a
          desire contain the very fullness of wisdom. There is a ship at sea,
          Fully laden. It has a precious cargo of gold on board. Happy is the
          kingdom that shall receive the wealth which is contained within its
          hold. Would you not if you were a possessor of such a vessel long to
          be safe in port. The empty ship needs scarcely fear the water for what
          hath she to lose. If it casts its ballast into the sea, what is it the
          poorer? But when the ship is full of treasure well may the captain
          long to see it safely moored. Now Paul was full of faith and love. He
          could say, "I have finished my course, I have kept the faith." And
          what wonder therefore that he was longing to be safely anchored at
          home. So the soldier, who in the midst of battle has smitten down foe
          after foe, knows that a high reward awaits him. He has charged upon
          the enemy, and driven them back in many a desperate struggle. He has
          already been victor. Do you wonder he wishes the fight now were over,
          that his laurels may be safe? If he had played the coward he might
          long that the campaign should be protracted, that he might redeem his
          disgrace. But having so far fought with honor he may well desire that
          the garment rolled in blood, may be rolled up for ever. Ay! and so was
          it with the apostle. He had fought a good fight, and knew that the
          crown was laid up for him in heaven, and he anticipated the triumph
          which Christ would give him, and what marvel that panting and longing,
          he said, "I have a desire to depart and to be with Christ which is far
          better?" Upon this point I am constrained to be brief, because the
          next division involves the whole matter, and upon this, I would be
          somewhat longer. And may God grant that what I shall say upon it may
          be impressive.

          III. PAUL'S REASONS FOR LONGING TO DEPART. There have been -- it is
          the part of candour to admit it -- there have been other men besides
          Christians who have longed to die. There is the suicide who, mad, from
          life's history hangs to be hurled, even though hell receive him. Tired
          of all life's troubles he thinks he sees a way to escape from his toil
          and from his sorrow through the grim gate of death. He stains his hand
          with his own blood, and red with his own gore appears before his
          Maker. Ah fool, to leap from one evil to a myriad! Ah madman, to
          plunge from little streams of woe into an unfathomable gulf of agony!
          There can be no more absurd, revolting, and insensible act, than for a
          man to take away his life. Setting aside the horrors of crime that
          surround it, how foolish is the attempt to escape by rushing into the
          very midst of danger! The ostrich who buries het head in the sand, and
          when she cannot see the hunter thinks the hunter cannot see her, is
          sensible and wise compared with such a man, who rushing into the very
          thick of the battle hopes in this way to escape from his enemy. How
          can it be thou foolish man? Is the stream too deep for thee already,
          and instead of seeking to find a shore by faith in God dost thou seek
          the center of the stream that thou mayest get a firmer footing there?
          Oh foolish generation and unwise, "Put up thy sword into thy scabbard
          and do thyself no harm," for harm thou wilt do if thou rush into a
          greater evil to escape the less.
        </p>
        <p>
          There have been other men, who with a so called philosophic spirit,
          have desired to die. Some men are sick altogether of mankind. They
          have met with so many ungrateful and deceitful wretches that they say,
          "Let me get rid of them all.
        </p>
        <p>'Oh for a lodge in some vast wilderness,</p>
        <p>Where rumor of oppression never more</p>
        <p>May reach mine ear.'"</p>
        <p>
          And they have thought to find this lodge in the wilderness of death;
          and so they long for the wings of a dove to flee away from the
          degenerate race of men. Not so this apostle. He was no such coward as
          to fly from evils; he sought to better them. The apostle loved his
          race; he was no man-hater. He could say that he loved them all, and
          thus he had prayed for them all, and had carried them in the bowels of
          Christ continually to the throne of mercy. Others, too, have thought
          by getting out of the world they should get rid of their
          disappointments. They have struggled very hard to get rich, or they
          have striven for fame, and they have not succeeded, in their ambitious
          designs, and then they have said, "Let me die." Now the apostle was
          never disappointed in seeking wealth for he never cared for it. He had
          no desires whatever beyond food ard raiment. He wished for nothing
          more, and as for rank that he utterly despised. He did tread beneath
          his feet as the mire of the streets all the honors that man could give
          him. Nor was the apostle in any sense a disappointed man. He had
          sought to spread his Master's fame and he had done it. He had a
          standard to plant and right well had he planted it. He had a gospel to
          preach and he did preach it everywhere with all his might. He was a
          singularly happy man, and therefore he had no such cowardly reasons
          for desiring to depart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others, too, have said that they wished to depart because of their
          great suffering. Now the apostle thought of no such dastard flight. He
          was ready for all weathers. He had been beaten with rods; he had been
          stoned; he had been shipwrecked; but he could say, "None of these
          things move me, neither count I my life dear unto me." He did not wish
          to escape from persecution. He rejoiced therein. He had often sung a
          hymn in prison, besides that hymn which he had sung with Silas for his
          companion. He had often shouted in the prospect of the block or the
          flames. Nor did he wish to die because of old age, for he was not an
          aged man when he wrote this epistle. He was just then, I suppose, in
          full vigorous health, and though in prison I do think that an angel
          might have ransacked the whole world before he could have found a
          happier man than the apostle Paul, for a man's happiness consisteth
          not in the wealth which he possesses. In the bare dungeons of Rome,
          Paul, the tent maker, had a glory about him which Nero never had in
          all his palaces; and there was a happiness there to which Solomon in
          all his glory never had attained. So then, the desire of Paul to
          depart is for these reasons far superior to the desire of the mere
          philosopher, or of the disappointed worldling.
        </p>
        <p>
          What then made Paul wish to depart? I shall put it thus -- the same
          reasons prompt the desires of every true believer; but they can have
          no power whatever with many here, who have no desire to depart,
          because for you to die would be not happiness and bliss, but an
          eternal weight of misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the apostle felt a desire to depart because he knew that in
          departing and being with Christ he should be clean rid of sin. Paul
          hated sin; every true believer does the same. There have been times
          with us brethren and sisters when we could say, "Oh, wretched man that
          I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" Sin has been
          our plague. Like righteous Lot in Sodom, the sins of others have vexed
          us; but, alas! we have had to bear a Sodom in our own hearts, which
          has vexed us still more. As to the trials and troubles of this world,
          they are nothing at all to the believer, compared with the annoyance
          of sin. Could he get rid of his unbelief, of his murmuring
          disposition, of his hasty temper -- could he get rid of the various
          temptations of Satan, could he be clean, and pure, and perfect, he
          would be thoroughly satisfied. And this made the apostle long to
          depart. "Oh," saith he to himself, one baptism in the stream of death
          and I am perfect -- but to pass the chill and dreary stream and I
          shall stand without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, before the
          throne of God." The dog of hell shall follow us to the very edge of
          Jordan, but he cannot swim that stream. The arrows of temptation will
          be shot at us as long as we are here, but on the other side of Jordan
          these darts can never wound us more. Rejoice, then, believer, in the
          prospect of death, because in dying thou art once for all clean rid of
          sin. When I lay down this body I have laid down every infirmity, and
          every lust, and every temptation, and when clothed upon with that
          house which is from heaven, I have girt about my loins perfection and
          unsullied purity. But oh! ye that believe not in Christ, ye do not
          desire to die for such a reason as this. For you there is no such a
          prospect. For you to die will be but to plunge deeper into sin. You
          sin now, and when you die your spirit will descend to hell, where, in
          the midst of fit companions, whose guilt is ripened, you shall spend
          an eternity in oaths, and curses, and blasphemies. O sinner! to-day
          you sow your sins in the furrows, and when you die you shall reap the
          harvest. To-day you break the clods, to-day you work in the husbandry
          of iniquity, then there shall be a shouting of an awful harvest home.
          When pressed down with the sheaves of your sins, divine justice shall
          bring forth the harvest of misery and torment to you. You have reason
          enough to long to live, because for you to die is to reap the reward
          of your iniquities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, Paul longed to die for another reason, because he knew that as
          soon as he should depart he could meet his brethren in faith who had
          gone before. This desire also prompts you and me. I long to see,
          though it is but a few hours since we have lost their society, those
          two sisters, and the dear brother who during this week have departed
          in Christ. Worshipping among us but a few days ago, it seems a strange
          thing to talk of them as being in heaven. But there they are, far from
          the reach of mortal, vision. At our departure we shall see them. It
          was our happiness to see them not long before their departure, and to
          mark it down as one of the notabilia of our life, that these three,
          all of them alike died in quiet peace singing themselves into heaven,
          never staying their song, so long as memory and breath held out. We
          shall see them. But we have others we are longing for. Some of you may
          remember the departed wife, scarce cold within her grave. Many of you
          look back to dear little ones taken away in their infancy, carried off
          to their father's God. Many of you remember aged parents; those that
          taught you in the way of God; the mother from whose lips you learned
          the first verse of Scripture, and the father upon whose arms you were
          carried for the first time up to the house of God. They are gone; but
          the joyous reflection remains that we are going in the same direction,
          and that we shall meet them soon. Some of us can look back through
          generations and trace our pedigree through the saints, and we are
          longing for the time when the whole band of us, those who have gone in
          olden time, and those who remain may sing together that new song of
          praise to our common God. Beloved, we have high joys in prospect: we
          shall soon join the general assembly and church of the first-born,
          whose names are written in heaven. Our companions now are but poor and
          despised, but we shall soon be brethren with princes. Moses who was
          king in Jeshuron, and David who ruled over Israel, shall not be
          ashamed to call us brethren, for the Highest himself shall acknowledge
          us, and he that on the throne doth sit shall lead us unto living
          fountains of waters, and in his gracious fellowship shall wipe away
          all tears from off our faces. I think that the company of apostles,
          and prophets, and holy martyrs and confessors, who have gone before,
          will be a very sweet part of the bliss of the redeemed. And all this
          may make us pant to depart. But, O ye ungodly ones! ye who have never
          been converted, and who fear not God, this hope is not for you. You
          must go to your own place. And whither must you go? To your drunken
          companions damned before you? Must you go down to the pit with harlots
          and with the profane? Whither away, whither away, thou careless man,
          thou lover of sin? Whither art thou going when thou diest? Thine
          answer might well be this doleful ditty: "I am going to be the guest
          of devils; I am going to feast with fiends; I am going to abide with
          murderers, and whoremongers, and adulterers, and with such as God hath
          condemned. These must be my companions for ever." Methinks I see the
          wheat of God standing in the valley every year, about to be gathered
          into the garner of heaven in its own place, and yonder I see the
          tares, and what is the message for them? "Gather up the tares and bind
          them in bundles to burn them." And who knows in what bundle you may
          be? You may be bound up in the same bundle with murderers and
          suicides. Yes, the men that you despise may be your companions in the
          bundle of the wicked. The drunkard and the swearer, whom some of you
          pretendedly good people look down upon with scorn, may be your bundle
          companions, your bed-fellows for ever when you make your bed in hell
          and abide in everlasting torment.
        </p>
        <p>
          But last of all, Paul's grand reason for desiring to depart was to be
          with Christ. Again I say, simple though the words be -- to be with
          Christ, have all heaven condensed in them. Like the sounding of the
          silver trumpet of jubilee rings this precious sentence, "to be with
          Christ." Like the harps of the glorified -- like the singing of the
          redeemed, like the hallelujahs of paradise, does this ring upon mine
          ears, "To be with Christ." Lift up your voices, ye seraphim! Tune your
          hearts anew, ye seraphs! Shout for joy ye blood-washed, but your
          loudest strains cannot excel the thundering glory of this magnificent
          but brief sentence, "to be with Christ, which is far better." This, my
          beloved -- this shall well repay the tiresome pilgrimage of life. This
          reward shall be sufficient for all our contests with temptation, for
          all the shame we have endured in following Christ, in the midst of a
          wicked generation. This, this shall be all the heaven that our largest
          desires shall crave. This immensity of bliss shall stretch across
          eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          But O unbeliever, what hast thou to do with such a hope as this? Thou
          canst not desire to depart and to be with Christ, for what is Christ
          to thee? To-day thou despisest him. The man of sorrow thou esteemed
          not. Jesus of Nazareth thou dost not regard. He is preached to thee
          every Sabbath day, but thou despisest him. With many tears have I
          presented him to thee, but thou hast shut thine heart against him; he
          has knocked at thy door and there he stands shivering even now, but
          thou wilt not admit him. Beware ye that despise Jesus, for in another
          world ye shall see him after another fashion. Ye too shall be with
          him, but it shall be but for an instant. Summoned before his bar,
          dragged reluctantly to his dread tribunal, ye shall see him whom you
          despise; ye shall see him and not another. But oh, with what
          astonishment will ye behold him, and what amazement shall seize upon
          you! Ye shall see him, but no longer as the humble man! his eyes shall
          be as flames of fire. Out of his mouth shall go a two-edged sword.
          About him shall be wrapped "the rainbow wreath, and robes of storm,"
          and he shall speak in louder tones than the noise of many waters, and
          in great thunderings shall he address thee, "Depart ye cursed into
          everlasting fire in hell, prepared for the devil and his angels." Oh
          "Kiss the Son, lest he be angry and ye perish from the way when his
          wrath is kindled but a little." Oh, go to your houses; may God the
          Spirit draw you to your chambers, and may you there be led to fall
          upon your knees, confess your guilt, and humbly seek for pardon,
          through that precious blood which flows freely this day, and which
          will freely give pardon to you if with all your heart you seek it. May
          God's Spirit lead you so to seek that you may find, and may you and I,
          and all of us, in the day of our departure, see the land before us --
          the happy shore of heaven. May we know that as our vessel sails from
          earth it shall only take a hasty voyage "to be with Christ which is
          far better." God the Spirit visit you now, God the Son bless you, God
          the Father remember you, through Jesus. Amen.

          The absence of the regular reporter is the publishers' apology for the
          incorrectness of this sermon. Mr. SPURGEON has found it utterly
          impossible to recall the words which he uttered, and which many of his
          hearers declare to have been attended with peculiar power.
