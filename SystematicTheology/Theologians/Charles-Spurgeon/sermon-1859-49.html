          "Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty." -- Hosea
          10:2.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS passage may be taken as referring to the people of Israel as a
          nation, and it is not less applicable to the church of God. It is one
          grand and grievous fault with the church of Christ at the present day,
          that it is not merely divided somewhat in its creed, and somewhat also
          in its practice of the ordinances, but alas, it is also somewhat
          divided in heart. When the differences are of such a character, that
          as people of God we can still love each other, and still unite in the
          common battle against the cause of evil and in the common end of
          building up the church, then there is but little that is faulty. But
          when our doctrinal divisions grow to so great a head that we cease to
          co-operate; when our opinions upon mere ordinances become so acid
          towards each other, that we can no longer extend the right hand of
          fellowship to those who differ from us, then indeed is the church of
          God found faulty. "A house divided against itself cannot stand." Even
          Beelzebub with all his craft cannot stand when once his hosts are
          divided. If Beelzebub be divided against himself, even he must fall,
          and assuredly this must be the case with those who lack that craft
          which might tend to overcome disunion. Oh, my brethren, nothing can so
          soon cast down the church from its high place, mar its glories, and
          diminish its opportunities of success, as divisions among the hearts
          of God's people. If we would grieve the Holy Spirit and cause him to
          begone; if we would provoke the anger of the Most High and bring down
          trying providences on the churches, we have nothing to do but to be
          divided in our hearts and all will be accomplished. If we wish that
          every vial may empty out its ill, and that every vessel may withhold
          its oil, we have but to cherish our bickerings till they become
          animosities; we have but to nurse our animosities till they become
          hatreds, and all the work will be fully completed. And if this be the
          case in the church at large, it is peculiarly true in those various
          sections of it which we now call Apostolic Churches. Oh, my brethren,
          the smallest church in the world is potent for good when it hath but
          one heart and one soul; when pastor, elders, deacons, and members, are
          bound together by a threefold cord that cannot be broken. Then are
          they mighty against every attack. But however great their numbers,
          however enormous their wealth, however splendid may be the talents
          with which they are gifted, they are powerless for good the moment
          that they become divided amongst themselves. Union is strength.
          Blessed is the army of the living God, in that day when it goeth forth
          to battle with one mind, and its soldiers as with the tramp of one
          man, in undivided march, go onwards towards the attack. But a curse
          awaiteth that church which runneth hither and thither and which,
          divided in itself, hath lost the main stay of its strength with which
          it should batter against the enemy. Division cuts our bowstrings,
          snaps our spears, hoofs our horses, and burns our chariots in the
          fire. We are undone the moment the link of love is snapped. Let this
          perfect bond be once cut in twain and we fall down, and our strength
          is departed. By union we live, and by disunion we expire.
        </p>
        <p>
          I intend, however, to take the text this morning specially with
          reference to our individual condition. We shall look at the separate
          individual heart of each man. If divisions in the great main body --
          if separation among the distinct classes of that body should each
          promote disasters, how much more disastrous must be a division in that
          better kingdom -- the heart of man. If there be civil tumult in the
          town of Mansoul, even when no enemy attacks its walls, it will be in a
          sufficiently dangerous position. If the isle of Man be governed by two
          kings, then is it disorganised, and it will soon be destroyed. I
          address myself this morning to some of whom it can be said, "their
          heart is divided, now shall they be found faulty." And thus shall I
          address you, first of all noticing a fearful disease; secondly, its
          usual symptoms; thirdly, its sad effects; and fourthly, its future
          consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Observe, then, that our text describes a FEARFUL DISEASE. Their
          heart is divided. I have called it a fearful disease, and this will
          very readily appear if you observe, first of all, the seat of it. It
          affects a vital part, it is not merely a disease of the hand, that
          reformation might cure; it is not merely a disease of the foot, that
          restraint might sometimes mollify; it is not merely a disease of the
          eye which hath but to be couched to let the light stream in upon it.
          It is a disease of a vital region -- of the heart; a disease in a part
          so vital that it affects the whole man. The utmost extremity of the
          frame suffers when once the heart becomes affected, and especially so
          affected as to be divided. There is no power, no passion, there is no
          motive, no principle, which does not become vitiated, when once the
          heart is diseased. Hence it is that Satan, who is always crafty,
          endeavors to strike at the heart. He will give you the hand if you
          please; you may be honest. He will give you the eye if you please; you
          shall be outwardly chaste. He will give you the foot, if you please;
          you shall appear to run in the way of righteousness Only let him keep
          the heart, only let him rule in the citadel, and he will be well
          content to give up all the rest. John Bunyan describes this as being
          one of the terms which old Diabolus was said to make with King
          Shaddai, -- "Oh!" said he, "I will give up all the city of Mansoul, if
          thou wilt but permit me to live in the citadel of the heart." Surely
          there was but little in his terms and conditions. Ay but give up
          everything else; if thou retainest the heart, thou retainest all, O,
          fiend! for out of the heart are the issues of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the disease of our text is one that toucheth a vital part, a part
          which if once affected, tends to vitiate the whole frame. But you will
          observe, the disease here described, not only deals with a vital part,
          but toucheth it after a most serious fashion. It does not simply say
          the heart palpitates; it doth not declare that the life-floods that
          issue from it have become more shallow and less rapid, but it declares
          something worse than all these, namely, that the heart was cleft in
          twain and utterly divided. A stony heart may be turned to flesh but
          turn a divided heart into whatsoever you please, so long as it is
          divided, all is ill. Nothing can go right when that which should be
          one organ becomes two; when the one motive power begins to send forth
          its life-floods into two diverse channels, and so creates intestine
          strife and war. A united heart is life to a man, but if the heart be
          cut in twain, in the highest, deepest, and most spiritual sense, he
          dies. It is a disease which is not only affecting a vital part, but
          affecting it after the most deadly fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we must observe again of this divided heart, that it is a division
          in itself peculiarly loathsome. Men who are possessed of it do not
          feel themselves to be unclean; in fact they will visit all society,
          they will venture into the church, they will propose to receive her
          communion, and to be numbered with her members, and they will
          afterwards go and mingle with the world; and they do not feel that
          they have become dishonest. They think themselves fit to mingle with
          honest worldlings, and with sincere Christians too. If a man had spots
          upon his countenance or some disease that stared everyone else in the
          face as often as he was beheld surely he would retire from society and
          endeavor to keep himself a recluse. But not so the man with a divided
          heart. He goes everywhere, utterly unconscious that his disease is of
          the most loathsome character. Shall I show you how it is so? Take the
          glass and look at the man's heart, and you will discern that it is
          loathsome, because Satan and sin reigns there. Although the man goes
          about and has sufficient of what is right and what is wrong, to be
          uneasy in his sin, yet has he such an intense love of all manner of
          iniquity, that he allows the loathsome demons to come and dwell in his
          heart. But his loathsomeness is worse than this, because all the while
          that he is really living in sin, he is a loathsome hypocrite,
          pretending that he is a child of God. Of all the things in the world
          that stink in the nostrils of a honest man, hypocrisy is the worst. If
          thou be a worldling, be a worldling. If thou serve Satan, serve him.
          If Baal be god, serve him, but mask not thy service of self and sin by
          a pretended service of God. Appear to be what thou art, tear off thy
          masks. The church was never meant to be a masquerade. Stand out in thy
          true colors. If thou preferest Satan's shrine say so, and let men know
          it, but if thou wilt serve God, serve him, and do it heartily, as
          knowing him who is a jealous God and searcheth the hearts and trieth
          the reins of the children of men. It is a terribly loathsome disease
          this of a divided heart. If the man were but known, his disease is so
          loathsome, that the most wicked men in the world would have nothing to
          do with him. I have known sometimes instances of this. A man who
          pretended to be religious and regularly attended his place of worship
          is seen on one occasion entering into a ball-room of the very lowest
          class. He begins at once to plunge into its gaieties, with the most
          evil intentions. He is at once observed. The right senses even of the
          wicked themselves are awakened. "Kick that man down stairs," is the
          unanimous verdict, and he receives it and he deserved it right well.
          When a man has a divided heart -- tries to do right and to do wrong,
          to serve God and to serve Satan at the same time; I say his disease is
          of so loathsome and degraded a character, that the very worldling,
          whose leprosy is on his brow, despises, hates him, and avoids him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet again, not merely is the disease loathsome, but I must observe
          it is one always difficult to cure, because it is chronic. It is not
          an acute disease, which brings pain, and suffering, and sorrow with
          it, but it is chronic, it has got into the very nature of the man. A
          divided heart, how are you to get at that? If it were a disease in any
          other part, the lancet might find it out, or some medicine might heal
          it. But what physician can join together a divided heart? What
          skillful surgeon can set together the disrupted members of a soul that
          has been divided between God and mammon? This is a disease which
          enters into the very nature, and will lie in the blood, though the
          most powerful medicines search it out. This is a disease, in fact,
          which nothing but Omnipotent grace can ever overcome. But he has no
          grace whose heart is divided between God and mammon. He is an enemy to
          God, he is an injury to the church, he is a despiser of God's Word, he
          is a sheaf ripening for the harvest of eternal fire. His disease is
          deeply rooted within him, and if left alone it will come to a most
          dreadful end -- its end is sure destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          I must observe once more, and then I will leave this point of the
          disease, that, according to the Hebrew of my text, this disease is a
          very difficult one to deal with, from the fact that it is a flattering
          disease. The text might be rendered -- "Their heart flatters them; now
          are they found faulty." There are many cunning flatterers in the
          world, but the most cunning is man's own heart. A man's own heart will
          flatter him even about his sins. A man is a grasping miser -- his
          heart flatters him that he is only exercising proper business habits.
          A man on the other hand is extravagant and spends the good gifts of
          God upon his own evil passions; then his heart tells him that he is a
          liberal soul. The heart turns "sweet into bitter and bitter into
          sweet." It is so "deceitful above all things," and so "desperately
          wicked," that it has the impudence to "put darkness for light and
          light for darkness." Now when a man has a divided heart, he generally
          flatters himself. "Well," says he, "it is true I drink too much, but
          then there is never a time that I refuse a guinea towards a charity.
          It is true," says he "I am not certainly what I should be in my moral
          character, but still, see how regularly I keep to my church or chapel.
          It is true," says he, "I don't now and then mind a trick or two in my
          trade, but I am always ready to help the poor." And so he imagines
          that he blots out an evil trait in his character with a good one and
          thus flatters his heart. And see how self-contented and satisfied he
          is. The poor child of God is trying his own heart with the deepest
          possible anxiety; this man knows of no such thing. He is always fully
          assured that he is right. The true believer is sitting down and
          turning over his accounts day by day to see whether he be really on
          the road to heaven or whether he has mistaken his evidence and has
          been deceived. But this man, self-satisfied, bandages his own eyes and
          walks deliberately on, singing at every step, straight to his own
          destruction. I know of some such now. It will not suffice for me
          simply to state what their character is unless God the Holy Spirit
          open their eyes. They will be sure not to know their own likeness,
          even though I should paint it to the very life, and put in every touch
          and stroke, yet they will say, "Ah he could not refer to me. I am so
          good and so godly, there could have been no reference to me in
          anything that he said." Do you know a class of people that pull the
          most tremendously long faces, that always look so serious, that talk
          the English language with a kind of unctuous twang, that give a
          savoury pronunciation to every word they utter? Beware of them. When a
          man wears all his religion in his face, he has generally but a very
          small stock in his heart. Those tradesmen that put such a great
          display in their windows, frequently have very little behind. So with
          these professors; no one would know they were religious, so they label
          themselves that you may not make a mistake. You would think they were
          worldlings, if it were not for their sanctimonious appearance. But by
          putting that on, they think to glide through the world with credit. I
          hope they are not imagining that they shall stand accepted before the
          bar of God and deceive the Omniscient. Alas for them! Their heart is
          divided. This is no uncommon disease, despite its loathsomeness and
          its terrible fatality. Rife is it in this day; tens of thousands of
          Englishmen who are reckoned good and honorable are afflicted with it.
          Their whole head is sick, and their whole heart faint from the fact
          that their heart is divided. They lack the courage to be
          thorough-going sinners, and they have not sincerity enough to be
          truly-devoted people of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Having thus described the disease, I proceed to notice its USUAL
          SYMPTOMS. When a man's heart is divided, one of the most frequent
          symptoms is formality in his religious worship. You know some men,
          perhaps, who are very stringent believers of a certain form of
          doctrine, and very great admirers of a certain shape of church rule
          and government. You will observe them utterly despising, and
          abhorring, and hating all who differ from their predilections. Albeit
          the difference be but as a jot or a tittle, they will stand up and
          fight for every rubric, defend every old rusty nail in the church
          door, and think every syllable of their peculiar creed should be
          accepted without challenge. "As it was in the beginning, so must it be
          now, and so must it ever be even unto the end." Now it is an
          observation which your experience will probably warrant, as certainly
          mine does, that mostly these people stand up so fiercely for the form,
          because lacking the power, that is all they have to boast of. They
          have no faith, though they have a creed. They have no life within, and
          they supply its place with outward ceremony. What wonder therefore
          that they fiercely defend that? The man who knows how precious the
          life of godliness is, the man who understands its vitality, its
          deep-seated, deeply-rooted heart power, he also loves the form, but
          not as he loves the Spirit. He approves the letter, but he likes the
          pith and marrow better. He is apt, perhaps to think less of forms than
          he should do, for he will mingle first with one body of sincere
          Christians and then with another, and he will say, "If I can enjoy my
          Master's presence it is but little matter to me where I am found. If I
          can but find the name of Christ extolled, and his simple gospel
          preached, this is all I desire." Not so, the man whose heart is
          divided who has no soul in godliness. He is bigoted to the extreme,
          and well -- I repeat it -- he may be, poor man; all he has is the
          empty shell. What wonder therefore that he should be ready to fight
          for it? You will notice many persons punctilious with regard even to
          the form of our own simple worship. They will have it that there must
          always be observed, not simply reverent behavior in the house of God,
          but something more than mere reverence, there must be an abject
          slavish, tyrannical fear upon the hearts of all who are gathered. They
          will have it that every jot and tittle of our worship must always be
          conducted with a certain traditional decorum. Now these people, as
          frequently as not, know nothing whatever of the power of godliness,
          and only contend for these little shells because they have not the
          kernel. They fight for the surface albeit they have never discovered
          "the deep that coucheth beneath." They know not the precious ores that
          lie in the rich mines of the gospel, and therefore the surface,
          covered though it be with weeds, and thistles, is quite enough for
          them. Formality in religion is very often a trait in the character of
          a man who has a divided heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this, perhaps, is not the most prominent symptom. Another mark in
          such a man's character is his inconsistency. You must not see him
          always, if you would have a good opinion of him. You must be guarded
          as to the days on which you call upon him. Call upon him on a Sunday
          and you will find him like a saint; don't call upon him on the
          Saturday night -- you might, perhaps, find him very much like the
          worst of sinners. Oh! of all the men in the world whom I fear most
          for, because I know their dangerous and deceitful position, they are
          those among you who try with all your might to follow the church and
          yet follow the world You can come up and sing the sacred hymns of Zion
          one evening, and another time you can go to your haunts and sing a
          profane and lascivious song. You can drink one day at the table of the
          Lord and another day at the table of devils. You appear to run first
          of all with God's people in his service, and then afterwards run with
          the multitude to do evil. Ah, men and brethren, this, indeed, is a
          terrible fact -- a terrible index of a frightful disease, You must
          have a divided heart if you lead an inconsistent life. It is a happy
          circumstance when a minister can believe of his church that be has no
          hypocrite in the whole number, but I am bold to say, though with the
          deepest sorrow, this is more than I could believe of so large a church
          as that over which I am called to preside. Ah, friends, there may be
          some of you who practice sins unseen by your pastor's eye. Neither
          elder or deacon has yet tracked you out. You have been cunning in your
          iniquity. Perhaps your sin is of such an order that church discipline
          would altogether fail to touch it. You know, however, and your
          conscience tells you, that your life is not consistent with your
          profession. I adjure you, by the living God, as you and I must stand
          at the last great day face to face at his tremendous bar, either give
          up your profession, or be true to it. Cease to be called a Christian,
          or else be a Christian in truth. Seek more grace, that you may live up
          to the example of your Master, or else I entreat of you -- and do it
          honestly, and if you would take me at my word, I should rejoice that
          you had done so -- renounce your membership, and no longer make a
          profession of godliness. An inconsistent life, I say, is a sure token
          of a divided heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          And again I must observe there is another token of a divided heart,
          namely -- variableness in object. I might depict a character which you
          have met with often in your life. A man who attends a public meeting
          upon some religious matter is seized with a sudden enthusiasm to do
          good. If he will not be a missionary to the heathen himself, yet he
          will undertake to devote of his substance to the cause, and for the
          next week there is nothing on his tongue but the missionary
          enterprise. A little while after he attends some political meeting,
          and now there is nothing before him but the reformation of politics.
          Another week, and he is called to attend some sanitary commission, and
          now there is nothing wanted but proper drainage. Religion, politics,
          social economy, each in its turn, and everything else must give place
          to the last topic which has engrossed his attention. These men run
          first in one direction -- then in another. Their religion is all
          spasmodic. They are taken with it as men are taken with an ague. They
          shake by fits, and anon they are calm. They are sometimes hot and
          feverish, and anon they are chilly and cold. They take up their
          religion, and then they lay it down again. What does this prove
          concerning them, but that they have a divided heart, and they are in
          the sight of God diseased, loathsome persons, who shall never see his
          face with joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          To conclude the list of symptoms. Once more, frivolity in religion is
          often a token of a divided heart; and here I address myself more
          immediately to those of my own age. It is perhaps too common a sin
          with young persons to treat religion with a light and frivolous air.
          There is a seriousness which is well becoming, especially in youthful
          Christians. Cheerfulness should be the constant aim of the aged. Their
          tendency is towards sadness. Perhaps a proper seriousness and
          solemnity should be the aim of the youthful believer, whose tendency
          will rather be to levity than to despondency. Oh, my brethren, when we
          can talk about religious things with flippancy; when we can quote
          texts of Scripture in order to make jests upon them, when we come up
          to the Lord's table as if it were but a common repast; when we come to
          baptism as though it were but an ordinary observance, about which no
          solemnity is to be found -- then I fear we prove that our heart is
          divided. And I know that any soul conscious of its guilt, if it has
          really been brought to know the love of Christ, will always come to
          sacred things in a altered manner. We do not come to the Lord's table
          with lightness of heart. There have been times when it has seemed too
          solemn a matter for us to come at all; and as for baptism, he that
          comes to baptism without having searched his heart, without having
          looked well to his motives, and without true devotion of spirit, comes
          altogether in vain. As the wrong communicant may eat and drink
          damnation to himself, so may he who would be thus wrongly baptized
          receive condemnation instead of a blessing. Frivolity of spirit is
          often a sign of a divided heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. This brings us to the third point, the sad effects of a divided
          heart. When a man's heart is divided, he is at once everything that is
          bad. With regard to himself he is an unhappy man. Who can be happy
          while he has rival powers within his own breast. The soul must find a
          nest for itself, or else it cannot find rest. The bird that would seek
          to rest upon two twigs would never have peace, and the soul that
          endeavors to find two resting places, first, the world, and then the
          Saviour, will never have any joy or comfort. A united heart is a happy
          heart; hence David says, "Unite my heart to fear thy name." They that
          give themselves wholly to God are a blessed people, for they find that
          the ways of religion are "ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are
          peace." Men who are neither this nor that, neither one thing nor
          another, are always uneasy and miserable. The fear of discovery, and
          the consciousness of being wrong, conspire together to agitate the
          soul and make it full of unease, disease, and restlessness of spirit.
          Such a man is unhappy in himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is in the next place useless in the church. Of what good is such a
          man to us? We cannot put him in the pulpit to propound that gospel he
          does not practice. We cannot put him in the deaconship to serve the
          church which his life would ruin. We cannot commit to his charge the
          spiritual matters of the church in the eldership, because we discern
          that not being spiritual himself, he is not to be entrusted with them.
          In no respect is he of any good to us. "Reprobate silver shall men
          call them." His name may be in the church-book, but it had better be
          taken away. He may sit among us and give us his contribution, we
          should be better without it and without him than with either, though
          he should double his talent and treble his contribution. We know that
          no man who is not united in his heart vitally and entirely to Christ,
          can ever be of the slightest service to the church of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But not only this; he is a man dangerous to the world. Such a man is
          like a leper going abroad in the midst of healthy people; he spreads
          the disease. The drunkard is a leper set apart by himself; he doth but
          little harm comparatively, for he in his drunkenness is like the leper
          when he is driven from society. His very drunkenness cries out,
          "Unclean, unclean, unclean!" But this man is a professor of religion
          and therefore tolerated. He says he is a Christian, and therefore he
          is admitted into all society, and yet he is inwardly full of
          rottenness and deception. Though outwardly whitewashed like a
          sepulcher, he is more dangerous to the world, I say, than the most
          vicious of men. Tie him up -- let him not go loose; build a prison for
          him. But what am I saying? If you would build a prison for hypocrites,
          all London would not suffice for ground for the prisons. Oh my
          brethren, notwithstanding the impossibility of binding them, I do say
          that the maddest dog in the hottest weather is not one-half so
          dangerous to men as a man who hath a divided heart, one who runs about
          with the rabid poison of his hypocrisy upon his lips, and destroys the
          souls of men by contamination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only unhappy himself, useless to the church, and dangerous to the
          world but he is contemptible to everybody. When he is found out nobody
          receives him. Scarcely will the world own him, and the church will
          have nothing to administer to him but its censure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most solemn consideration, however, is that this man is reprobate
          in the sight of God. To the eye of infinite purity he is one of the
          most obnoxious and detestable of beings. His heart is divided. A pure
          and holy God hates, first, his sin, and secondly, the lies with which
          he endeavors to cover it. Oh, if there be a place where sinners are
          more loathsome to God than anywhere else, it is in his church. A dog
          in its kennel is well enough; but a dog in the throne-room is quite
          out of place. A sinner in the world is bad enough, but in the church
          he is hideous. A madman in an asylum is a creature to be pitied, but a
          madman who protests he is not mad, and will thrust himself among us
          that he may obtain means of doing mischief, is not merely to be
          pitied, he is to be avoided, and needs to be restrained. God hateth
          sin anywhere, but when sin puts its fingers upon his divine altar;
          when it comes and lays its insolent hand upon the sacrifice that is
          burning there, then God spurns it from him with disgust. Of all men,
          who stand in the most likely place to receive the mightiest
          thunderbolt, and the most terrible lightning's flash, those are the
          men who have a divided heart, and profess to serve God while with
          their souls they are serving sin. Take heed, sinner, take heed,
          running on in thy sin thou wilt meet with punishment; but after all, O
          hypocrite, look well to thy ways, for thy sin and thy lie together
          shall bring down a dread and swift destruction upon thy devoted head.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. In conclusion I have to address some remarks to you with regard to
          the FUTURE PUNISHMENT of the man whose heart is divided, unless he be
          rescued by a great salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have endeavored to preach faithfully this morning, as faithfully as
          I could, but I am conscious that many of the children of God do not
          find food under such a sermon as this, nor is it my intention that
          they should do so. It is not rightly possible to blend the sieve of
          sifting, with the bushel of the gospel. We cannot well bring you the
          wheat and the sieve too. This morning I have sought to take the fan
          ministerially into my hand, and thoroughly purge this floor, in the
          name of him who shall be the great "Purger" at the last day. We all
          need it whether we know it or not. The best Christian needs sometimes
          to question himself as to his motives. And when God's children are not
          fed, it is often more profitable to them to be led to examine
          themselves, than it would be if they had some rich promise to feed
          upon. My hearers, out of so vast a number this morning, are there none
          among you with divided hearts? Is it possible that this whole
          congregation is made up of sincere Christians, truly enlightened,
          called, and saved? Is there not one man, who, mistaking his place, has
          put himself among the sheep when he should have been among the goats?
          Is there not one man here who without making a mistake has dared
          impudently to thrust himself into the number of God's priests, when he
          is really a worshipper of Baal? Let me then, in the last place, that I
          may with faithfulness discharge my mission, describe the terrible
          condition of the hypocrite when God shall come to judge the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          He comes with brazen face, he comes in the midst of the congregation
          of the righteous. The mandate has gone from the throne, "Gather out
          first the tares!" He hears the mandate, and his cheek pales not. His
          impudence continues with him even now. He would still knock at the
          door, and say, "Lord! Lord! open to me." The dividing angel flies.
          Terror is on the face of the wicked, as on the left the tares are
          bound in bundles to burn. Imagine, however the still greater
          consternation of this individual, who, standing in the midst of
          ministers, saints and apostles, suddenly finds himself about to be
          gleaned from them. With a tremendous swoop, like an eagle descending
          from its lofty height, the death angel bears upon him, snatches him
          away, and claims him as his own. "Thou art," says the black angel,
          "Thou art a tare. Thou hast grown side by side with the wheat, but
          that has not changed thy nature. The dew that falls upon the wheat has
          fallen upon thee; the sun which shone upon it thou hast enjoyed also,
          but thou art still a tare, and thy doom remaineth the same. Thou shalt
          be bound up with the rest in bundles to be burned." O hearer, what
          must be his consternation when with mighty hand that angel plucks him
          up by the roots, carries him away, and he that thought himself a saint
          is bound up with sinners for destruction!
        </p>
        <p>
          And now imagine the reception that he meets. He is brought into the
          midst of the wicked -- the wicked who once with Pharasaic tongue he
          had reproved. "Here he comes," say they, "the man who instructed us,
          the good man who taught us to do better, here he comes himself, found
          out at last to be no better than those whom he despised." And then
          imagine, if you dare, the inner dungeon, the reserved seats of that
          fiery abode, and the heaviest chain of despair -- imagine, I say, if
          you can, the terrible destruction, terrible beyond every other, which
          shall overwhelm the man who in this world deceived the church and
          dishonored God, but who is now detected to his shame. Common sinners
          have the common prison, but this man shall be thrust into the inner
          prison, and made fast in the stocks of despair. Tremble, professors,
          tremble, you who are half and half religious men, tremble, you who
          pretend to fear God, but like the Samaritans, worship your idols also.
          O, tremble now lest your trembling should come upon you in a day when
          you are not aware of it, when you shall long for the rocks to hide,
          and for the mountains to cover you, but shall be without a shelter in
          the day of the fierce anger of the God of the whole earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, I cannot send you away without preaching the gospel for a
          moment or two. I have, perhaps, one here who is saying, "Sir, my heart
          is not only divided, but it is broken." Ah, there is a great deal of
          difference between a divided heart and a broken heart. The divided
          heart is cut in twain, the broken heart is broken in pieces, all
          asunder, and yet it is not divided. It is all in pieces, in one sense,
          as to its proud hope, and it is melted, in another sense, as to its
          earnest longing that it may be saved. Poor broken heart, I was not
          rebuking thee. Art thou desirous thy morning to have thy sins put
          away. Then from the bottom of thy poor broken heart cry to day, Lord,
          save me from hypocrisy. Whatever I may be, do not permit me to think I
          am one of thine if I am not." Are you breathing out this prayer to
          God, "Lord, make me truly thine. Put me among thy children. Let me
          call thee my Father,' and not turn away from thee. Give me a new heart
          and a right spirit; O wash me in the blood of Christ, and make me
          clean. Make me what thou wouldst have me be, and I will praise thee
          for ever." Remember, my dear hearer if that is the desire of thy
          heart, thou art this day bidden to believe that Christ is able to save
          thee, and willing to save thee, and waiting to be gracious unto thee,
          and more ready to bestow mercy than thou art to receive it. Therefore
          thou art commanded to trust him, fur all thy sins have been punished
          on him as thy surety, and for the sake of Christ, God is willing now
          to receive thee, now to bless thee. Come close with him this morning.
          Lift thine eye to him that did die upon the tree. Put thy trust in him
          who is my Redeemer, and thy Redeemer too; let the blood which flows
          from his side be received into thy heart. Open thy poor wounds, and
          say, "My Master, heal these wounds for me. O Jesus! I know no other
          trust. If thou wilt save me I will know no other love. My heart is
          undivided in its love, it looks alone to thee; it shall be soon
          undivided in its gratitude; I will praise thee and thee alone. Poor
          heart-broken penitent, I said not ill when I contradicted myself by
          saying, "Though thy heart is broken, it is not divided." Bring it just
          as it is, and say, "Lord, receive me through the blood of Christ, and
          let me be thine now, and thine for ever, through Jesus." Amen.<br />
