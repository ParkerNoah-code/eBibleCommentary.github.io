          "Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee,
          meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass." --
          Matthew.21:5.
        </p>
        <p>
          WE HAVE READ the chapter from which our text is taken; let me now
          rehearse the incident in your hearing. There was an expectation upon
          the popular mind of the Jewish people, that Messiah was about to come.
          They expected him to be a temporal prince, one who would make war upon
          the Romans and restore to the Jews their lost nationality. There were
          many who, though they did not believe in Christ with a spiritual
          faith, nevertheless hoped that perhaps he might be to them a great
          temporal deliverer, and we read that on one or two occasions they
          would have taken him and made him a king, but that he hid himself.
          There was an anxious desire that somebody or other should lift the
          standard of rebellion and lead the people against their oppressors.
          Seeing the mighty things which Christ did, the wish was father to the
          thought, and they imagined that He might probably restore to Israel
          the kingdom and set them free. The Saviour at length saw that it was
          coming to a crisis. For him it must either be death for having
          disappointed popular expectation, or else he must yield to the wishes
          of the people, and be made a king. You know which be chose. He came to
          Save others, and not to be made a king himself in the sense in which
          they understood him. The Lord had worked a most remarkable miracle, he
          had raised Lazarus from the dead after he had been buried four days.
          This was a miracle so novel and so astounding, that it became town
          talk. Multitudes went out of Jerusalem to Bethany, it was only about
          two miles distant, to see Lazarus. The miracle was well authenticated,
          there were multitudes of witnesses, it was generally accepted as being
          one of the greatest marvels of the age, and they drew the inference
          from it that Christ must be the Messiah. The people determined that
          now they would make him a king, and that now he should lead them
          against the hosts of Rome. He, intending no such thing, nevertheless
          overruled their enthusiasm that by it he might have an opportunity of
          performing that which had been written of him in the prophets. You
          must not imagine that all those who strewed the branches in the way
          and cried "Hosanna" cared about Christ as a spiritual prince. No, they
          thought that he was to be a temporal deliverer, and when they found
          out afterwards that they were mistaken they hated him just as much as
          they had loved him, and "Crucify him, crucify him," was as loud and
          vehement a cry as "Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the name of
          the Lord." Our Saviour thus availed himself of their mistaken
          enthusiasm for divers wise ends and purposes. It was needful that the
          prophecy should be fulfilled -- "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!
          Shout O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold thy King cometh unto thee, he is
          just and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a
          colt the foal of an ass." It was needful again, that he should make a
          public claim to be the Son of David, and that he should claim to be
          the rightful inheritor of David's throne, -- this he did on this
          occasion. It was needful too, that he should leave his enemies without
          excuse. In order that they might not say, "If thou be the Messias,
          tell us plainly," he did tell them plainly. This riding through the
          streets of Jerusalem was as plain a manifesto and proclamation of his
          royal rights as could possibly have been issued. I think, moreover, --
          and upon this I build the discourse of this morning, -- I think that
          Christ used the popular fanaticism as an opportunity of preaching to
          us a living sermon, embodying great truths which are too apt to be
          forgotten because of their spiritual character, embodying them in the
          outward form and symbol of himself riding as a king, attended by hosts
          of followers. We come to this as the subject of our sermon. Let us
          what we can lean from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. One of the first things we learn is this. By thus through the
          streets in state, Jesus Christ claimed to be a king. That claim had
          been to a great extent kept in the background until now, but ere he
          goes to his Father, when his enemies' rage has reached its utmost
          fury, and when his own hour of deepest humiliation has just arrived,
          he makes an open claim before the eyes of all men to be called and
          acknowledged a king. He summonses first his heralds. Twit disciples
          come. He sends forth his mandate -- "Go ye into the village over
          against you, and ye shall find an ass and a colt." He gathers together
          his courtiers. His twelve disciples, those who usually attended him,
          come around him. He mounts the ass which of old had been ridden by the
          Jewish lawgivers, the rulers of the people. He begins to ride through
          the streets and the multitudes clap their hands. It is reckoned by
          some that no fewer than three thousand people must have been present
          on the occasion, some going before some following after, and others
          standing on either side to see the show. He rides to his capital; the
          streets of Jerusalem, the royal city, are open to him, like a king, he
          ascends to his palace. He was a spiritual king, and therefore he went
          not to the palace temporal but to the palace spiritual. He rides to
          the temple, and then, taking possession of it, he begins to teach in
          it as he had not done before. He had been sometimes in Solomon's
          porch, but he was oftener on the mountain's side than in the temple;
          but now, like a king, he takes possession of his palace, and there,
          sitting down on his prophetic throne, he teaches the people in his
          royal courts. Ye princes of the earth, give ear, there is one who
          claims to be numbered with you. It is Jesus, the Son of David, the
          King of the Jews. Room for him, ye emperors, room for him! Room for
          the man who was born in a manger! Room for the man whose disciples
          were fishermen! Room for him whose garment was that of a peasant,
          without seam, woven from the top throughout! He wears no crown except
          the crown of thorns, yet he is more royal than you. About his loins he
          wears no purple, yet he is more imperial far than you. Upon his feet
          there are no silver sandals bedight with pearls, yet he is more
          glorious than you. Room for him: room for him! Hosanna! Hosanna! Let
          him be proclaimed again a King! a King! a King! Let him value his
          place upon his throne, high above the kings of the earth. This is what
          he then did, he proclaimed himself a King.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Moreover, Christ by this act showed what sort of a king he might
          have been if he had pleased, and what sort of a king he might be now,
          if he willed it. Had it been our Lord's will, those multitudes who
          followed him in the streets would actually have crowned him there and
          then, and bowing the knee, they would have accepted him as the branch
          that sprung out of the dried root of Jesse -- him that was to come --
          the ruler, the Shiloh among God's people. He had only to have said a
          word, and they would have rushed with him at their head to Pilate's
          palace, and taking him by surprise, with but few soldiers in the land,
          Pilate might soon have been his prisoner, and have been tried for his
          life. Before the indomitable valor and the tremendous fury of a Jewish
          army, Palestine might soon have been cleared of all the Roman legions,
          and have become again a royal land. Nay, we aver it, with his power of
          working miracles, with his might by which he drove the soldiers back,
          when he said, "I am he;" he might have cleared not only that land but
          every other, he might have marched from country to country, and from
          kingdom to kingdom, till every royal city and every regal state would
          have yielded to his supremacy. He could have made those that dwelt in
          the isles of the sea to bow before him, and they that inhabit the
          wilderness could have been bidden to lick the dust. There was no
          reason, O ye kings of the earth, why Christ should not have been
          mightier than you. If his kingdom had been of this world, he might
          have founded a dynasty more lasting than yours, he might have gathered
          troops before whose might your legions would be melted like snow
          before the summer's sun, he might have dashed to pieces the Roman
          image, till, a broken mass, like a potter's vessel shivered by a rod
          of iron, it might have been dashed to shivers.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is even so, my brethren. If it were Christ's will, he might make
          his saints, everyone of them, a prince, he might make his Church rich
          and powerful, he might lift up his religion if he chose, and make it
          the most magnificent and sumptuous. If it were his will, there is no
          reason why all the glory we read of in the Old Testament under
          Solomon, might not be given to the Church under David's greater Son.
          But he does not come to do it, and hence the impertinence of those who
          think that Christ is to be worshipped with a gorgeous architecture,
          with magnificent vestments, with proud processions, with the alliance
          of states with churches, with making the bishops of God magnificent
          lords and rulers, with lifting up the Church herself, and attempting
          to put upon her shoulders those garments that will never fit her,
          vestments that were never meant for her. If Christ cared for this
          world's glory, it might soon be at his feet. If he willed to take it,
          who should raise a tongue against his claim, or who should lift a
          finger against his might! But he cares not for it. Take your gewgaws
          elsewhere, take your tinsel hence, he wants it not. Remove your glory,
          and your pomp, and your splendor, he needs it not at your hands. His
          kingdom is not of this world, else would his servants fight, else were
          his ministers clothed in robes of scarlet, and his servants would sit
          among princes, he cares not for it. People of God, seek not after it.
          What your Master would not have, do not court yourselves. Oh! Church
          of Christ what thine husband disdained, do thou disdain also. He might
          have had it, but he would not. And he read to us the lesson, that if
          all these things might be the Church's, it were well for he to pass by
          and say, "These are not for me -- I was not meant to shine in these
          borrowed plumes."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But thirdly, and here lies the pith of the matter, you have seen
          that Christ claimed to be a king; you have seen what kind of a king he
          might have been and would not be, but now you see what kind of a king
          he is, and what kind of a king claimed to be. What was his kingdom?
          What its nature? What was his royal authority? Who were to be his
          subjects? What his laws? What his government? Now you perceive at once
          from the passage taken as a whole, that Christ's kingdom is a very
          strange one, totally different from anything that ever has been seen
          or ever will be seen besides.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a kingdom, in the first place, in which the disciples are the
          courtiers. Our blessed Lord had no prince in waiting, no usher of the
          black rod, no gentlemen-at-arms who supplied the place of those grand
          officers? Why a few poor humble fishermen, who were his disciples.
          Learn, then, that if in Christ's kingdom you would be a peer you must
          be a disciple; to sit at his feet is the honor which he will give you.
          Hearing his words obeying his commands, receiving of his grace -- this
          is true dignity, this is true magnificence. The poorest man that loves
          Christ, or the humblest woman who is willing to accept him as her
          teaches, becomes at once one of the nobility that wait upon Christ
          Jesus. What a kingdom is this which makes fishermen nobles, and
          peasants princes while they remain but fishermen and peasants still!
          This is the kingdom of which we speak, in which discipleship is the
          highest degree, in which divine service is the patent of nobility.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a kingdom, strange to say it, in which the king's laws are none
          of then written upon paper. The king's laws are not promulgated by
          mouth of herald, but are written upon the heart. Do you not perceive
          that in the narrative Christ bids his servants go and take his royal
          steed, such as it was, and this was the law, "Loose him and let him
          go?" but where was the law written? It was written upon the heart of
          that man to whom the ass and the foal belonged, for he immediately
          said, "Let them go" cheerfully and with great joy; he thought it a
          high honor to contribute to the royal state of this great King of
          peace. So, brethren, in the kingdom of Christ you shall see no huge
          law books, no attorneys, no solicitors, no barristers who have need to
          expound the law. The law-book is here in the heart, the barrister is
          here in the conscience, the law is written no more on parchment, no
          more promulgated and written, as the Roman decrees were, upon steel
          and harass, but upon the fleshy tablets of the heart. The human will
          is subdued to obedience, the human heart is moulded to Christ's image,
          his desire becomes the desire of his subjects, his glory their chief
          aim, and his law the very delight of their souls. Strange kingdom
          this, which needs no law save those which are written upon the hearts
          of the subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stranger still, as some will think it, this was a kingdom in which
          riches unsure no part whatever of its glory. There rides the King, the
          poorest of the whole state, for yonder King had not where to lay his
          head. There rides the King, the poorest of them all, upon another
          man's ass that he has borrowed. There rides the King, one who is soon
          to die; stripped of his robes to die naked and exposed. And yet he is
          the King of this kingdom, the First, the Prince, the Leader, the
          crowned One of the whole generation, simply because he had the least.
          He it was who had given most to others, and retained least himself. He
          who was least selfish and most disinterested, he who lived most for
          others, was King of this kingdom. And look at the courtiers, look at
          the princes! they were all poor too; they had no flags to hang out
          from the windows, so they cast their poor clothes upon the hedges or
          hung them from the windows as he rode along. They had no splendid
          purple to make a carpet for the feet of his ass, so they cast their
          own toil-worn clothes in the way, they strewed along the path palm
          branches which they could easily reach from the trees which lined the
          road, because they had no money with which to bear the expense of a
          greater triumph. Every way it was a poor thing. No spangles of gold,
          no flaunting banners no blowing of silver trumpets, no pomp, no state!
          It was poverty's own triumph. Poverty enthroned on Poverty's own beast
          rides through the streets. Strange kingdom this, brethren! I trust we
          recognize it -- a kingdom in which he that is chief among us, is not
          he that is richest in gold, but he that is richest in faith; a kingdom
          which depends on no revenue accept the revenue of divine grace; a
          kingdom which bids every man sit down under its shadow with delight,
          be he rich or be he poor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strange kingdom this! But, brethren, here is something perhaps yet
          more exceeding wonderful, it was a kingdom without armed force. Oh,
          prince, where are thy soldiers? Is this thine army? These thousands
          that attend thee? Where are their swords? They carry branches of palm.
          Where are their accoutrements? They have almost stripped themselves to
          pave thy way with their garments. Is this thine host? Are these thy
          battalions? Oh strange kingdom, without an army! Most strange King,
          who wears no sword, but rides along in this midst of his people
          conquering and to conquer a strange kingdom, in which there is the
          palm without the sword, the victory without the battle. No blood, no
          tears, no devastation, no burned cities, no mangled bodies! King of
          peace, King of peace, this is thy dominion! Tis even so in the kingdom
          over which Christ is king to-day, there is no force to be used. If the
          kings of the earth should any to the ministers of Christ, "We will
          lend you our soldiers," our reply would be, "What can we do with them?
          -- as soldiers they are worthless to us." It was an ill day for the
          Church when she borrowed the army of that unhallowed heathen, the
          emperor Constantine and thought that would make her great. She gained
          nothing by it save pollution, degradation and shame, and that Church
          which asks the civil arm to help it, that Church which would make her
          Sabbaths binding on the people by force of law, that Church which
          would have her dogmas proclaimed with beat of drum, and make the fist
          or the sword to become her weapons, knoweth not what spirit she is of.
          These are carnal weapons. They are out of place in a spiritual
          kingdom. His armies are loving thoughts, his troops are kind words.
          The power by which he rules his people is not the strong hand and the
          stretched-out arm of police or soldiery, but by deeds of love and
          words of overflowing benediction he asserts his sovereign sway.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a strange kingdom too, my brethren, because it was without
          any pomp. If you call it pomp, what singular pomp it was! When our
          kings are proclaimed, three strange fellows, the like of whom one
          would never see at any other time, called heralds, come riding forth
          to proclaim the king. Strange are their dresses, romantic their
          costume, and with sound of trumpet the king is magnificently
          proclaimed. Then comes the coronation and how the nation is moved from
          end to end with transport when the new king is about to be crowned!
          What multitudes crowd the street. Sometimes of old the fountains were
          made to flow with wine, and there was scarce a street which was not
          hung with tapestry throughout. But here comes the King of kings, the
          Prince of the kings of the earth; no mottled steed, no prancing horse
          which would keep at a distance the sons of poverty; he rides upon his
          ass, and as he rides along speaks kindly to the little children, who
          are crying, "Hosanna," and wishes well to the mothers and fathers of
          the lowest grade, who crowd around him. He is approachable; he is not
          divided from them; he claims not to be their superior, but their
          servant so little stately as a king, he was the servant of all No
          trumpet sounds -- he is content with the voice of men, no caparisons
          upon his ass, but his own disciple's garments, no pomp but the pomp
          which loving hearts right willingly yielded to him. Thus on he rides;
          his the kingdom of meekness, the kingdom of humiliation. Brethren, may
          we belong to that kingdom too; may we feel in our hearts that Christ
          is come in us to cast down every high and every proud thought, that
          every valley may be lifted up, and every hill may be abased, and the
          whole land exalted in that day!
        </p>
        <p>
          Listen again, and this perhaps is a striking part of Christ's kingdom
          -- he came to establish a kingdom without taxations. Where were the
          collectors of the King's revenue? You say he had not any; yes he had,
          but what a revenue it was! Every man took off his garments willingly;
          he never asked it; his revenue flowed freely from the willing gifts of
          his people. The first had lent his ass and his colt, the rest had
          given their clothes. Those who had scarce clothes to part with,
          plucked the branches from the trees, and here was state for once which
          cost no man anything, or rather for which nothing was demanded of any
          man, but everything spontaneously given. This is the kingdom of
          Christ, -- a kingdom which subsists not upon tithe, Church-rate or
          Easter dues, but a kingdom which lives upon the free-will offering of
          the willing people, a kingdom which demands nothing of any man, but
          which comes to him with a stronger force than demand, saying to him,
          "Thou art not under the law, but under grace, wilt thou not, being
          bought with a price, consecrate thyself and all that thou hast, to the
          service of the King of kings! Brethren, do you think me wild and
          fanatical in talking of a kingdom of this sort? Indeed, twere
          fanatical if we said that any mere man could establish such a
          dominion. But Christ has done it, and this day there be tens of
          thousands of men in this world who call him King, and who feel that he
          is more their King than the ruler of their Dative land; that they give
          to him a sincerer homage than they ever give to the beg beloved
          sovereign, they feel that his power over them is such as they would
          not wish to resist -- the power of love, that their gifts to him are
          an too little, for they wish to give themselves away, tis all that
          they can do. Marvellous and matchless kingdom! it's like shall never
          be found on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I leave this point, I should like to remark that apparently
          this was a kingdom in which all creatures were considered. Why did
          Christ have two beasts? There was an ass and a colt the foal of an
          ass; he rode on the foal of the ass because it had never been ridden
          before. Now I have looked at several of the commentators to see what
          they say about it, and one old commentator has made me laugh -- I
          trust he will not make you laugh too -- by saying, that Christ telling
          his disciples to bring the foal as well as the sea should teach us
          thee infants ought to be baptized as well as their parents, which
          seemed to me to be an argument eminently worthy of childish baptism.
          Thinking the matter over, however, I consider there is a better reason
          to be given, -- Christ would not have any pain in his kingdom, he
          would not have even an ass suffer by him, and if the foal had been
          taken away from its mother, there would have been the poor mother in
          the stable at home, thinking of its foal, and there would have been
          the foal longing to get back, like those oxen that the Philistines
          used when they took back the ark, and which went lowing as they went,
          because their calves were at home. Wondrous kingdom of Christ, in
          which the very beast shall have its share! "For the creature was made
          subject to vanity by our sin." It was the beast that suffered because
          we sinned, and Christ intends that his kingdom should bring back the
          beast to its own pristine happiness. He would make us merciful men,
          considerative even to the beasts. I believe that when his kingdom
          fully comes, the animal nature will be put back to its former
          happiness. "Then shall the lion eat straw like the ox, the sucking
          child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall
          put his hand on the cockatrice den." Old Eden's peacefulness, and the
          familiarity between man and the lower creatures, shall come back once
          more. And even now, wherever the gospel is fully known in man's heart,
          man begins to recognize that he has no right wantonly to kill a
          sparrow or a worm, because it is in Christ's dominion; and he who
          would not ride a foal without having its mother by its side, that it
          might be at peace and happy, would not have any of his disciples think
          lightly of the meanest creature that his hands have made. Blessed
          kingdom this which considereth even the berate! Doth God care for
          oxen? Ay, that he doth; and for the very ass itself, that heir of
          toil, he careth. Christ's kingdom, then, shall care for beasts as well
          as men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more: Christ, in riding through the streets of Jerusalem, taught
          in a public manner, that his kingdom was to be one of joy. Brethren,
          when great conquerors ride through the streets, you often hear of the
          joy of the people; how the women throw roses on the pathway, how they
          crowd around the hero of the day, and wave their handkerchiefs to show
          their appreciation of the deliverance he has wrought. The city has
          been long besieged; the champion has driven away the besiegers, and
          the people will now have rest. Fling open wide the gates, clear the
          road and let the hero come, let the meanest page that is in his
          retinue be honored this day for the deliverer's sake. Ah! brethren,
          but in those triumphs how many tears there are that are hidden! There
          is a woman who hears the sound of the bells for victory, and she says,
          "Ah! victory indeed, but I am a widow, and my little ones are
          orphans." And from the balconies where beauty looks down and smiles,
          there may be a forgetfulness for the moment of friends and kindred
          over whom they will soon have to weep, for every battle is with blood,
          and every conquest is with woe, and every shout of victory hath in it
          weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth. Every sound of trumpet
          because the battle is obtained, doth but cover over the cries, the
          sorrows, and the deep agonies of those that have been bereaved of
          their kinsfolk! But in thy triumph, Jesu, there were no tears! When
          the little children cried, "Hosanna," they had not lost their fathers
          in battle. When the men and women shouted, "Blessed is he that cometh
          in the name of the Lord," they had no cause to shout with bated
          breath, or to mar their joys with the remembrance of misery. No, in
          his kingdom there is unalloyed, unmingled joy. Shout, shout, ye that
          are subjects of King Jesus! Sorrows ye may have, but not from him,
          troubles may come to you because you are in the world, but they come
          not from him, His service is perfect liberty. His ways are ways of
          pleasantness, and all his paths are peace.
        </p>
        <p>"Joy to the world, the Saviour comes,</p>
        <p>The Saviour promised long;</p>
        <p>Let every heart prepare a tune,</p>
        <p>And every voice a song."</p>
        <p>
          He comes wipe away your tears and not to make them flow, he comes to
          lift you from your dunghills and set you upon his throne, to fetch you
          from your dungeons and make you leap in liberty.

        <p>"Blessings abound wherein he reigns,</p>
        <p>The prisoner leaps to lose his chain;</p>
        <p>The weary find eternal rest,</p>
        <p>And all the eons of want are blessed."</p>
        <p>Singular kingdom this!</p>
        <p>
          IV. And now I come to my fourth and last head. The Saviour, in his
          triumphal entrance into the capital of his fathers, declared to us
          very plainly the practical effects of his kingdom. Now what are these?
          One of the first effects was that the whole city was moved. What does
          that mean? It means that everybody had something to say about it, and
          that everybody felt something because Christ rode through the street.
          There were some who leaned from the tops of their houses, and looked
          down the street and said to one another -- "Aha! Did ever you see such
          fool's play as this? Humph! Here is Jesus of Nazareth down here riding
          on an ass! Surely if he meant to be king he might have chosen a horse.
          Look at him! They call that pomp! There is some old fisherman has just
          thrown down his bad-smelling garment; I dare say it had fish in it an
          hour or two ago? "Look," says one, "see that old beggar throwing his
          cap into the air for joy!" "Aha!" say they, "was there ever such a
          ridiculous thing as that?" I cannot put it in such terms as they would
          describe it; if I could, I think I would. I should like to make you
          see how ridiculous this must have seemed to the people. Why, if Pilate
          himself had heard about it he would have said -- "Ah! there is nothing
          much to fear from that. There is no fear that that man will ever upset
          Caesar; there is no fear that he will ever overturn an army. Where are
          their swords? There is not a sword among them! They have no cries that
          sound like rebellion; their songs are only some religious verses taken
          out of the Psalms." "Oh!" says he, "the whole thing is contemptible
          and ridiculous." And this was the opinion of a great many in
          Jerusalem. Perhaps that is your opinion, my friend. The kingdom of
          Christ, you say, is ridiculous; you do not believe perhaps that there
          are any people who are ruled by him though we say that we own him as
          our King, and that we feel the law of love to be a law which
          constrains us to sweet obedience. "Oh," you say, "it is cant and
          hypocrisy." And there are some who attend where they have golden
          censers, and altars, and priests, and they say, "Oh! a religion that
          is so simple -- singing a few hymns, and offering extempore prayer! --
          Ah! give me a bishop with a mitre -- a fine fellow in lawn sleeves --
          that is the thing for me." "Oh," says another, "let me hear the peals
          of the organ; let me see the thing done scientifically, let me see a
          little drapery too; let the man come up clad in his proper garb to
          show that he is something different from other people; do not let him
          stand dressed as if he were an ordinary man; let me see something in
          the worship different from anything I have seen before." They want it
          clothed with a little pomp, and because if is not so they say -- "Ah!
          Humph!" They sneer at it, and this is all that Christ gets from
          multitudes of men who think themselves exceeding wise. He is to them
          foolishness and they pass by with a sneer. Your sneers will be
          exchanged for tears ere long sirs! When he comes with real pomp and
          splendor you will weep and wail, because you disowned the King of
          Peace.
        </p>
        <p>"The Lord shall come! a dreadful form,</p>
        <p>With rainbow wreath and robes of storm,</p>
        <p>With cherub voice and wings of wind,</p>
        <p>The appointed Judge of all mankind."</p>
        <p>
          Then you will find it inconvenient to have treated him with contempt.
          Others no doubt there were in Jerusalem who were filled with
          curiosity. They said -- "Dear me, whatever can it be? What is the
          meaning of it? Who is this? I wish you would come," they said to their
          neighbors, "and tell us the history of this singular man, we should
          like to know about it." Some of them said, "He is gone to the temple,
          I dare say he will work a miracle;" so off they ran, and squeezed and
          pressed, and thronged to see a marvel. They were like Herod, they
          longed to see some wonder wrought by him. It was the first day of
          Christ's coming too, and of course the enthusiasm might last some nine
          days if he would keep it up, so they were very curious about it. And
          this is all Christ gets from thousands of people. They hear about a
          revival of religion. Well, they would like to know what it is and hear
          about it. There is something doing at such-and-such a place of
          worship; well, they would like to go if it were only to see the place.
          "There is a strange minister says queer things; let us go and hear
          him. We had intended to go out" -- you know who I mean among
          yourselves -- "we had intended to go out on an excursion today," said
          you, "but let us go there instead." Just so, curiosity, curiosity;
          this is all Christ gets to-day, and he that died upon the cross
          becomes a theme for an idle tale, and he that is Lord of angels and
          adored of men, is to be talked of as though he were a Wizard of the
          North or some eccentric impostor! Ah! you will find it inconvenient to
          have treated him thus by-and-bye; for when he comes, and when every
          eye shall see him, you who merely curiously enquired for him shall
          find that he shall inquire for you, not with animosity but with wrath,
          and it shall be -- "Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire." But
          anon the crowd there were some who were worse still, for they looked
          on the whole thing with envy "Ah!" said Rabbi Simeon to Rabbi Hillel,
          "the people were never so pleased with us. We know a great deal more
          than that impostor; we have read through all our religious books."
          "Don't you remember him," says one, "that when he was a boy he was
          rather precocious? You remember he came into the temple and talked
          with us, and since then he deceiveth the people," meaning by that he
          outshone them, that he had more esteem in the hearts of the multitude
          than they had, though they were prouder far. "Oh!" said the Pharisee,
          "he does not wear any phylactery, and I have made mine very large; I
          have made my garments almost all borders, so that they may be
          exceeding broad." "Ah!" says another, "I tithe my mint, my anise, and
          my cummin, and I stand at the corner of the street and blow a trumpet
          when I give away a penny, but yet people will not put me on an ass;
          they will not clap their hands and say, Hosanna' to me, but the whole
          earth is gone after this man like a parcel of children. Besides, think
          of going into the temple disturbing their betters, disturbing us who
          are making a show of our pretended prayers and standing in the
          courts!" And this is what Christ gets from a great many. They do not
          like to see Christ's cause get on. Nay, they would have Christ be lean
          that they might fatten themselves upon the plunder, they would have
          his Church be despicable. They like to hear of the falls of Christian
          ministers. If they can find a fault in a Christian man "Report it,
          report it, report it," say they. But if a man walk uprightly, if he
          glorifies Christ, if the Church increases, if souls are saved,
          straightway there is an uproar and the whole city is stirred, the
          whole uproar begins and is carried on by falsehoods, lying
          accusations, and slanders against the characters of Christ's people.
          In some way or other, men are sure to be moved, if they are not moved
          to laugh, if they are not moved to enquire, they are moved to envy.
          But blessed is it that some in Jerusalem were moved to rejoice. Oh!
          there were many who, like Simeon and Anna rejoiced to see that day,
          and many of them went home and said, "Lord, now lettest thou thy
          servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation." There
          was many a bedridden woman in the back streets of Jerusalem, that sat
          up in the bed and said, "Hosanna," and wished that she could get down
          into the street, that she might throw her old mantle in the way, and
          might bow before him who was the King of the Jews. There were many
          weeping eyes that wiped away their tears that day, and many mourning
          believers who began from that hour to rejoice with joy unspeakable.
          And so there are some of you that hear of Christ the King with joy.
          You join in the hymn; not as we have all joined with the voice, but
          with the heart.
        </p>
        <p>"Rejoice, the Saviour reigns,</p>
        <p>The God of peace and love</p>
        <p>When he had purged our stains.</p>
        <p>He took his seat above</p>
        <p>Rejoice, rejoice!</p>
        <p>Rejoice aloud, ye saints, rejoice!"</p>
        <p>
          Such, then, the first effect of Christ's kingdom! Wherever it comes,
          the city is stirred. Do not believe the gospel is preached at all if
          it does not make a stir. Do not believe, my brethren, that the gospel
          is preached in Christ's way if it does not make some angry and some
          happy, if it does not make many enemies and some friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is yet another practical effect of Christ's kingdom. He went up
          to the temple and there at one table sat a lot of men with baskets
          containing pairs of doves. "Any doves, sir, any doves!" He looked at
          them and said, "Take these things hence." He spoke with a holy furore.
          There were others changing money as the people came in to pay their
          half shekel; he overturned the tables and set them all a-flying, and
          soon emptied the whole court of all these merchants who were making a
          gain of godliness, and making religion a stalking-horse for their own
          emolument. Now this is what Christ does wherever he comes. I wish he
          would come in the Church of England a little more, and purge out the
          sale of advowsons, get rid of that accursed simony which is still
          tolerated by law and purge out the men that are malappropriators, who
          take that which belongs to the ministers of Christ, and apply it to
          their own uses. I would that he would come into all our planes of
          worship, so that once for all it might be seen that they who serve God
          serve him because they love him, and not for what they can get by it.
          I would that every professor of religion could be quite clean in his
          own conscience that he never made a profession to get respectability
          or to get esteem, but only made it that he might honor Christ and
          glorify his Master. The spiritual meaning of it all is this -- We have
          no houses of God now; bricks and mortar are not holy, the places where
          we worship God are places of worship, but they are not the houses of
          God any longer than we are in them. We believe no superstition which
          makes any place holy, but we are the temple of God. Men themselves are
          God's temples, and where Christ comes he drives out the buyers and
          sellers, he expunges all selfishness. I will never believe that
          Christ, the King, has made your heart his palace till you are
          unselfish. Oh, how many professors there are who want to get so much
          honor, so much respect! As to giving to the poor, thinking it more
          blessed to give than to receive, as for feeding the hungry and
          clothing the naked, as for living for other people, and not for
          themselves -- they do not think of that. O Master, come into thy
          temple and drive out our selfishness, now come, turn out all those
          things which would make it convenient to serve Mammon by serving God;
          help us to live unto thee, and to live for others by living to thee,
          and not live unto ourselves!
        </p>
        <p>
          The last practical effect of our Lord Jesus Christ's kingdom was he
          held a grand levee; he had, if I may so speak, a drawing-room day; and
          who we be the people who came to attend him? Now, ye courtiers, the
          disciples, show up your nobility and gentry that are come to wait upon
          him. Here comes one man, he has a bandage over here, and the other eye
          has almost failed -- show him in, here comes another, his feet are all
          twisted and contorted -- show him in, here comes another limping on
          two crutches, both his limbs are disabled, and another has lost his
          limbs. Here they come and here is the levee. The King himself comes
          here and holds a grand meeting, and the blind and the lame are his
          guests, and now he comes, he touches that blind eye and light shines
          in; he speaks to this man with a withered leg, he walks; he touches
          two eyes at once, and they both see, and to another he says, "I will
          take away thy crutches, stand upright and rejoice and leap with joy."
          This is what the King does wherever he comes. Come hither this
          morning, I beseech thee, thou great King! There are blind eyes here
          that cannot see thy beauty. Walk, Jesu, walk among this crowd and
          touch the eyes. Ah! then, brethren, if he should do that, you will
          say, "There is a beauty in him that I never saw before." Jesu, touch
          their eyes, they cannot take away their own blindness, do thou do it!
          Help them to look to thee hanging upon the cross! They cannot do it
          unless thou dost enable them. May they do it now, and find life in
          thee! O Jesu, there are some here that are lame -- knees that cannot
          bend, they have never prayed; there are some here whose feet will not
          run in the way of thy commandments -- feet that will not carry them up
          where thy name is praised, and where thou art had in honor. Walk,
          great King, walk thou in solemn pomp throughout this house, and make
          it like the temple of old! Display here thy power and hold thy grand
          meeting in the healing of the lame and the curing of the blind "Oh!"
          saith one, "I would that he would open my blind eyes." Soul, he will
          do it, he will do it. Breathe thy prayer out now, and it shall be
          done, for he is nigh thee now. He is standing by thy side, he speaks
          to thee, and he saith -- "Look unto me and be thou saved, thou vilest
          of the vile." There is another, and he says -- "Lord, I would be made
          whole." He says -- "Be thou whole then." Believe on him and he will
          save thee. He is near you, brother, he is near you. He is not in the
          pulpit more than he is in the pew, nor in one pew more than in
          another. Say not -- "Who shall go to heaven to find him, or into the
          depths to bring him up?" He is near you; he will hear your prayer even
          though you speak not; he will hear your heart speak. Oh! say unto him
          -- "Jesus, heal me," and he will do it; he will do it now. Let us
          breathe the prayer, and then we will part.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus, heal us! Save us, Son of David, save us! Thou seest how blind
          we be -- oh, give us the sight of faith! Thou seest how lame we be --
          oh, give us the strength of grace! And now, e'en now, thou Son of
          David, purge out our selfishness, and come and live and reign in us as
          in thy temple-palaces! We ask it, O thou great King, for thine own
          sake. Amen. And ere we leave this place, we cry again, "Hosanna,
          hosanna, hosanna. Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord."
