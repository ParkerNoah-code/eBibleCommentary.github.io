        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.235)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, January 23rd, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "O wretched man that I am I who shall deliver me from the body of this
          death? I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord." -- Romans 7:24,
          25.
        </p>
        <p>
          IF I chose to occupy your time with controversial matter, I might
          prove to a demonstration that the apostle Paul is here describing his
          own experience as a Christian. Some have affirmed that he is merely
          declaring what he was before conversion, and not what he was when he
          became the recipient of the grace of God. But such persons are
          evidently mistaken, and I believe wilfully mistaken; for any
          ample-hearted, candid mind, reading through this chapter, could not
          fall into such an error. It is Paul the apostle, who was not less than
          the very greatest of the apostles -- it is Paul, the mighty servant of
          God, a very prince in Israel, one of the King's mighty men -- it is
          Paul, the saint and the apostle, who here exclaims, "O wretched man
          that I am!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, humble Christians are often the dupes of a very foolish error.
          They look up to certain advanced saints and able ministers, and they
          say, "Surely, such men as these do not suffer as I do; they do not
          contend with the same evil passions as those which vex and trouble
          me." Ah! if they knew the heard of those men, if they could read their
          inward conflicts, they would soon discover that the nearer a man lives
          to God, the more intensely has he to mourn over his own evil heart,
          and the more his Master honors him in his service, the more also doth
          the evil of the flesh vex and tease him day by day. Perhaps, this
          error is more natural, as it is certainly more common, with regard to
          apostolic saints. We have been in the habit of saying, Saint Paul, and
          Saint John, as if they were more saints than any other of the children
          of God. They are all saints whom God has called by his grace, and
          sanctified by his Spirit; but somehow we very foolishly put the
          apostles and the early saints into another list, and do not venture to
          look on them as common mortals. We look upon them as some
          extraordinary beings, who could not be men of like passions with
          ourselves. We are told in Scripture that our Saviour was "tempted in
          all points like as we are;" and yet we fall into the egregious error
          of imagining that the apostles, who were far inferior to the Lord
          Jesus, escaped these temptations, and were ignorant of these
          conflicts. The fact is, if you had seen the apostle Paul, you would
          have thought he was remarkably like the rest of the chosen family: and
          if you had talked with him, you would have said, "Why, Paul, I find
          that your experience and mine exactly agree. You are more faithful,
          more holy, and more deeply taught than I, but you have the self same
          trials to endure. Nay, in some respects you are more sorely tried than
          I." Do not look upon the ancient saints as being exempt either from
          infirmities or sins, and do not regard them with that mystic reverence
          which almost makes you an idolater. Their holiness is attainable even
          by you, and their faults are to be censured as much as your own. I
          believe it is a Christian's duty to force his way into the inner
          circle of saintship; and if these saints were superior to us in their
          attainments, as they certainly were, let us follow them; let us press
          forward up to, yea, and beyond them, for I do not see that this is
          impossible. We have the same light that they had, the same grace is
          accessible to us, and why should we rest satisfied until we have
          distanced them in the heavenly race? Let us bring them down to the
          sphere of common mortals. If Jesus was the Son of man, and very man,
          "bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh;" so were the apostles; and
          it is an egregious error to suppose that they were not the subjects of
          the same emotions, and the same inward trials, as the very meanest of
          the people of God. So far, this may tend to our comfort and to our
          encouragement, when we find that we are engaged in a battle in which
          apostles themselves have had to fight.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now we shall notice this morning, first, the two natures, secondly
          their constant battle; thirdly, we shall step aside and look at the
          weary warrior, and hear him cry, "O wretched man that I am;" and then
          we shall turn our eye in another direction, and see that fainting
          warrior girding up his loins to the conflict, and becoming an
          expectant victor, while he shouts, "I thank God through Jesus Christ
          our Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, THE TWO NATURES. Carnal men, unrenewed men, have one
          nature -- a nature which they inherited from their parents, and which,
          through the ancient transgression of Adam, is evil, only evil, and
          that continually. Mere human nature, such as is common to every man,
          has in it many excellent traits, judging of it between man and man. A
          merely natural man may be honest, upright, kind, and generous, he may
          have noble and generous thoughts, and may attain unto a true and manly
          speech; but when we come to matters of true religion, spiritual
          matters that concern God and eternity, the natural man can do nothing.
          The carnal mind, whose ever mind it may be, is fallen, and is at
          enmity to God, does not know the things of God, nor can it ever know
          them. Now, when a man becomes a Christian, he becomes so through the
          infusion of a new nature. He is naturally "dead in trespasses and
          sins," "without God and without hope." The Holy Spirit enters into
          him, and implants in him a new principle, a new nature, a new life.
          That life is a high, holy and supernatural principle, it is, in fact
          the divine nature, a ray from the great "Father of Lights;" it is the
          Spirit of God dwelling in man. Thus, you see, the Christian becomes a
          double man -- two men in one. Some have imagined that the old nature
          is turned out of the Christian: not so, for the Word of God and
          experience teach the contrary, the old nature is in the:Christian
          unchanged, unaltered, just the same, as bad as ever it was; while the
          new nature in him is holy, pure and heavenly; and hence, as we shall
          have to notice in me next place -- hence there arises a conflict
          between the two.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I want you to notice what the apostle says about these two
          natures that are in the Christian, for I am about to contrast them.
          First, in our text the apostle calls the old nature "the body of this
          death." Why does he call it "the body of this death?" Some suppose he
          means these dying bodies; but I do not think so. If it were not for
          sin, we should have no fault to find with our poor bodies. They are
          noble works of God, and are not in themselves the cause of sin. Adam
          in the garden of perfection, felt the body to be no encumbrance, nor
          if sin were absent should we have any fault to find with our flesh and
          blood. What, then, is it? I think the apostle calls the evil nature
          within him a body, first, in opposition to those who talk of the
          relics of corruption in a Christian. I have heard people say that
          there are relics, remainders and remnants of sin in a believer. Such
          men do not know much about themselves yet. Oh! it is not a bone, or a
          rag which is left; it is the whole body of sin that is there -- the
          whole of it, "from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot."
          Grace does not maim this body and cut away its members; it leaves it
          entire, although blessed be God, it crucifies it, nailing it to the
          cross of Christ. And again, I think he calls it a body because it is
          something tangible. We all know that we have a body; it is a thing we
          can feel, we know it is there. The new nature is a spirit subtle, and
          not easy to detect, I sometimes have to question myself as to whether
          it is there at all. But as for my old nature, that is a body, I can
          never find it difficult to recognize its existence, it is as apparent
          as flesh and bones. As I never doubt that I am in flesh and blood, so
          I never doubt but what I have sin within me. It is a body -- a thing
          which I can see and feel, and which, to my pain, is ever present with
          me."
        </p>
        <p>
          Understand, then, that the old nature of the Christian is a body; it
          has in it a substance or, as Calvin puts it, it is a mass of
          corruption. It is not simply a shred, a remnant -- the cloth of the
          old garment, but the whole of it is there still. True, it is crushed
          beneath the foot of grace; it is cast out of its throne; but it is
          there, there in all its entireness, and in all its sad tangibility, a
          body of death. But why does he call it a body of death? Simply to
          express what an awful thing this sin is that remains in the heart. It
          is a body of death. I must use a figure, which is always appended to
          this text, and very properly so. It was the custom of ancient tyrants,
          when they wished to put men to the most fearful punishments, to tie a
          dead body to them, placing the two back to back; and there was the
          living man, with a dead body closely strapped to him, rotting, putrid,
          corrupting, and this he must drag with him wherever he went. Now, this
          is just what the Christian has to do. He has within him the new life;
          he has a living and undying principle, which the Holy Spirit has put
          within him, but he feels that every day he has to drag about with him
          this dead body, this body of death, a thing as loathsome, as hideous,
          as abominable to his new life, as a dead stinking carcase would be to
          a living man. Francis Quarles gives a picture at the beginning of one
          of his emblems, of a great skeleton in which a living man is encased.
          However quaint the fancy, it is not more singular than true. There is
          the old skeleton man, filthy, corrupt and abominable. He is a cage for
          the new principle which God has put in the heart. Consider a moment
          the striking language of our text, "The body of this death," it is
          death incarnate, death concentrated, death dwelling in the very temple
          of life. Did you ever think what an awful thing death is? The thought
          is the most abhorrent to human nature. You say you do not fear death,
          and very properly; but the reason why you do not fear death is because
          you look to a glorious immortality. Death in itself is a most
          frightful thing. Now, inbred sin has about it all the unknown terror,
          all the destructive force, and all the stupendous gloom of death. A
          poet would be needed to depict the conflict of life with death -- to
          describe a living soul condemned to walk through the black shades of
          confusion, and to bear incarnate death in its very bowels. But such is
          the condition of the Christian. As a regenerate man he is a firing,
          bright, immortal spirit; but he has to tread the shades of death. He
          has to do daily battle with all the tremendous powers of sin, which
          are as awful, as sublimely terrific, as even the power's of death and
          hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon referring to the preceding chapter, we find the evil principle
          styled "the old man." There is much meaning in that word "old." But
          let it suffice us to remark, that in age the new nature is not upon an
          equal footing with the corrupt nature. There are some here who are
          sixty years old in their humanity, who can scarce number two years in
          the life of grace. Now pause and meditate upon the warfare in the
          heart. It is the contest of an infant with a full-grown man, the
          wrestling of a babe with a giant. Old Adam, like some ancient oak, has
          thrust his roots into the depths of manhood; can the divine infant
          uproot him and cast him from his place? This is the work, this is the
          labor. From its birth the new nature begins the struggle, and it
          cannot cease from it until the victory be perfectly achieved.
          Nevertheless, it is the moving of a mountain, the drying up of an
          ocean the threshing of the hills, and who is sufficient for these
          things? The heaven-born nature needs, and will receive, the abundant
          help of its Author, or it would yield in the struggle, subdued beneath
          the superior strength of its adversary and crushed beneath his
          enormous weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, observe, that the old nature of man, which remains in the
          Christian is evil, and it cannot ever be anything else but evil, for
          we are told in this chapter that "in me," -- that is, in my flesh --
          "there dwelleth no good thing." The old Adam-nature cannot be
          improved; it cannot be made better; it is hopeless to attempt it. You
          may do what you please with it, you may educate it, you may instruct
          it, and thus you may give it more instruments for rebellion, but you
          cannot make the rebel into the friend, you cannot turn the darkness
          into light; it is an enemy to God, and an enemy to God it ever must
          be. On the contrary, the new life which God has given us cannot sin.
          That is the meaning of a passage in John, where it is said, "The child
          of God sinneth not; he cannot sin, because he is born of God." The old
          nature is evil only evil, and that continually, the new nature is
          wholly good; it knows nothing of sin, except to hate it. Its contact
          with sin brings it pain and misery, and it cries out, "Woe is me that
          I dwell in Meshech, that I tabernacle in the tents of Kedar."
        </p>
        <p>
          I have thus given you some little picture of the two natures. Let me
          again remind you that these two natures are essentially unchangeable.
          You cannot make the new nature which God has given you less divine;
          the old nature you cannot make less impure and earthly. Old Adam is a
          condemned thing. You may sweep the house, and the evil spirit may seem
          to go out of it, but he will come back again and bring with him seven
          other devils more wicked than himself. It is a leper's house, and the
          leprosy is in every stone from the foundation to the roof; there is no
          part sound. It is a garment spotted by the flesh; you may wash, and
          wash, and wash, but you shall never wash it clean; it were foolish to
          attempt it. Whilst on the other hand the new nature can never be
          tainted -- spotless, holy and pure, it dwells in our hearts; it rules
          and reigns there expecting the day when it shall cast out its enemy,
          and without a rival it shall be monarch in the heart of man for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I have thus described the two combatants; we shall now come in the
          next place to THEIR BATTLE. There was never deadlier feud in all the
          world between nations than there is between the two principles, right
          and wrong. But right and wrong are often divided from one another by
          distance, and therefore they have a less intense hatred. Suppose an
          instance: right holds for liberty, therefore right hates the evil of
          slavery. But we do not so intensely hate slavery as we should do if we
          saw it before our eyes: then would the blood boil, when we saw our
          black brother, smitten by the cow-hide whip. Imagine a slaveholder
          standing here and smiting his poor slave until the red blood gushed
          forth in a river; can you conceive your indignation? Now it is
          distance which makes you feel this less acutely. The right forgets the
          wrong, because it is far away. But suppose now that right and wrong
          lived in the same house; suppose two such desperate enemies, cribbed,
          cabined, and confined within this narrow house, man; suppose the two
          compelled to dwell together, can you imagine to what a desperate pitch
          of fury these two would get with one another. The evil thing says, "I
          will turn thee out, thou intruder; I cannot be peaceful as I would, I
          cannot riot as I would, I cannot indulge just as I would; out with
          thee, I will never be content until I slay thee." "Nay," says the new
          born nature, "I will kill thee, and drive thee out. I will not suffer
          stick or stone of thee to remain. I have sworn war to the knife with
          thee; I have taken out the sword and cast away the scabbard, and will
          never rest till I can sing complete victory over thee, and totally
          eject thee from this house of mine." They are always at enmity
          wherever they are; they were never friends, and never can be. The evil
          must hate the good, and the good must hate the evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          And mark although we might compare the enmity to the wolf and lamb,
          yet the new-born nature is not the lamb in all respects. It may be in
          its innocence and meekness, but it is not in its strength; for the
          new-born nature has all the omnipotence of God about it, whilst the
          old nature has all the strength of the evil one in it, which is a
          strength not easily to be exaggerated, but which we very frequently
          underestimate. These two things are ever desperately at enmity with
          one another. And even when they are both quiet they hate each other
          none the less. When my evil nature does not rise, still it hates the
          newborn nature, and when the new-born nature is inactive, it has
          nevertheless a thorough abhorrence of all iniquity. The one cannot
          endure the other, it must endeavor to thrust it forth. Nor do these at
          any time allow an opportunity to pass from being revenged upon one
          another. There are times when the old nature is very active, and then
          how will it ply all the weapons of its deadly armoury against the
          Christian. You will find yourselves at one time suddenly attacked with
          anger, and when you guard yourself against the hot temptation, on a
          sudden you will find pride rising, and you will begin to say in
          yourself; "Am I not a good man to have kept my temper down?" And the
          moment you thrust down your pride there will come another temptation,
          and lust will look out of the window of your eyes, and you desire a
          thing upon which you ought not to look, and ere you can shut your eyes
          upon the vanity, sloth in its deadly torpor surrounds you, and you
          give yourself up to its influence and cease to labor for God. And then
          when you bestir yourselves once more, you fled that in the very
          attempt to rouse yourself you have awakened your pride. Evil haunts
          you go where you may, or stand in what posture you choose. On the
          other hand the new nature will never lose an opportunity of putting
          down the old. As for the means of grace, the newborn nature will never
          rest satisfied unless it enjoys them. As for prayer, it will seek by
          prayer to wrestle with the enemy. It will employ faith, and hope, and
          love, the threatenings, the promises, providence, grace, and
          everything else to cast out the evil. Well," says one, "I don't find
          it so." Then I am afraid of you. If you do not hate sin so much that
          you do everything to drive it out, I am afraid you are not a living
          child of God. Antinomians like to hear you preach about the evil of
          the heart, but here is the fault with them, they do not like to be
          told that unless they hate that evil, unless they seek to drive it out
          and unless it is the constant disposition of their new-born nature to
          root it up, they are yet in their sins. Men who only believe their
          depravity, but do not hate it, are no further than the devil on the
          road to heaven. It is not my being corrupt that proves me a Christian,
          nor knowing I am corrupt, but that I hate my corruption. It is my
          agonizing death struggle with my corruptions that proves me to be a
          living child of God. These two natures will never cease to struggle so
          long as we are in this world. The old nature will never give up; it
          will never cry truce, it will never ask for a treaty to be made
          between the two. It will always strike as often as it can. When it
          lies still it will only be preparing for some future battle. The
          battle of Christian with Apollyon lasted three hours; but the battle
          of Christian with himself lasted all the way from the Wicket-gate to
          the River Jordan. The enemy within can never be driven out while we
          are here. Satan may sometimes be absent from us, and get such a defeat
          that he is glad to go howling back to his den, but old Adam abideth
          with us from the first even to the last. He was with us when we first
          believed in Jesus, and long ere that, and he will be with us till that
          moment when we shall leave our bones in the grave, our fears in the
          Jordan, and our sins in oblivion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more observe, that neither of these two natures will be content
          in the fight without bringing in allies to assist. The evil nature has
          old relations, and in its endeavor to drive out the grace that is
          within, it sends off messengers to all its helpers. Like
          Cherdorlasmer, the King of Elam, it bringeth other kings with it, when
          it goeth out to battle. "Ah!" says old Adam, "I have friends in the
          pit." He sends a missive down to the depths, and willing allies come
          therefrom -- spirits from the vasty deep of hell; devils without
          number come up to the help of their brother. And then, not content
          with that, the flesh says: -- "Ah! I have friends in this world;" and
          then the world sends its fierce cohorts of temptation, such as the
          lust of the eyes and the pride of life. What a battle, when sin,
          Satan, and the world, make a dead-set upon the Christian at once.
          "Oh," says one, "it is a terrible thing to be a Christian." I assure
          you it is. It is one of the hardest things in the world to be a child
          of God; in fact, it is impossible, unless the Lord makes us his
          children, and keeps us so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, what does the new nature do? When it sees all these enemies, it
          cries unto the Lord, and then the Lord sends it friends. First comes
          in to its help, Jehovah, in the everlasting counsel, and reveals to
          the heart its own interest in the secrets of eternity. Then comes
          Jesus with his blood. "Thou shalt conquer," says he; "I will make thee
          more than a conqueror through my death." And then appears the Holy
          Spirit, the Comforter. With such assistance, this new-born nature is
          more than a match for its enemies. God will sometimes leave that new
          nature alone, to let it know its own weakness; but it shall not be for
          long, lest it should sink in despair. Are you fighting with the enemy
          to-day, my dear Christian brethren? Are Satan, the flesh, and the
          world -- that hellish trinity -- all against you? Remember, there is a
          divine trinity for you. Fight on, though like Valiant-for-Truth, your
          blood runs from your hand and glues your sword to your arm. Fight on!
          for with you are the legions of heaven; God himself is with you;
          Jehovah Nissi is your banner, and Jehovah Rophi is the healer of your
          wounds. You shall overcome; for who can defeat Omnipotence, or trample
          divinity beneath his foot?
        </p>
        <p>
          I have thus endeavored to describe the conflict; but understand me, it
          cannot be described. We must say, as Hart does in his hymn, when after
          singing the emotions of his soul, he says --
        </p>
        <p>"But, brethren, you can surely guess,</p>
        <p>For you perhaps have felt the same."</p>
        <p>
          If you could see a plain upon which a battle is fought, you would see
          how the ground is torn up by the wheels of the cannon, by the horse
          hoofs, and by the trampling of men. What desolation is where once the
          golden crops of harvest grew. How is the ground sodden with the blood
          of the slain. How frightful the result of this terrible struggle. But
          if you could see the believers' heart after a spiritual battle, you
          would find it just a counterpart of the battle-field -- as much cut up
          as the ground of the battle-field after the direst conflict that men
          or fiends have ever waged. For, think: we are combating man with
          himself; nay, more, man with the whole world; nay, more, man with
          hell; God with man, against man, the world and hell. What a fight is
          that! It were worth an angel's while to come from the remotest fields
          of ether to behold such a conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. We come now to notice THE WEARY COMBATANT. He lifts up his voice,
          and weeping he cries, "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me
          from the body of this death?" It is the cry of a panting warrior. He
          has fought so long that he has lost his breath, and he draws it in
          again; he takes breath by prayer. "O wretched man that I am! who shall
          deliver me from the body of this death?" He will not give up the
          conflict; he knows he cannot, and he dare not. That thought does not
          enter into his mind; but the conflict is so sore, the battle so
          furious, that he is almost defeated; he sits down to refresh himself,
          and thus he sighs out his soul; like the panting hart, longing for the
          water brook, he says, "O wretched man that I am." Nay, it is more than
          that. It is the cry of one who is fainting. He has fought till all his
          strength is spent, and he falls back into the arms of his Redeemer
          with this fainting gasp, "O wretched man that I am!" His strength has
          failed him; he is sorely beaten in the battle, he feels that without
          the help of God he is so totally defeated that he commences his own
          wail of defeat, "O wretched man that I am." And then he asks this
          question, "Who shall deliver me?" And there comes a voice from the
          Law, "I cannot and I will not." There comes a voice from Conscience,
          "I can make thee see the battle, but I cannot help thee in it." And
          then there comes a cry from old Human Nature, and that says, "Ah! none
          can deliver thee, I shall yet destroy thee; thou shalt fall by the
          hand of thine enemy; the house of David shall be destroyed, and Saul
          shall live and reign for ever." And the poor fainting soldier cries
          again, "Who shall deliver me?" It seems a hopeless case, and I believe
          that sometimes the true Christian may think himself hopelessly given
          over to the power of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wretchedness of Paul, I think, lay in two things, which are enough
          to make any man wretched. Paul believed the doctrine of human
          responsibility, and yet he felt the doctrine of human inability. I
          have heard people say sometimes -- "You tell the sinner that he cannot
          believe and repent without the help of the Holy Spirit, and yet you
          tell him that it is his duty to believe and repent. How are these two
          to be reconciled? We reply that they do not want any reconciliation;
          they are two truths of Holy Scripture, and we leave them to reconcile
          themselves, they are friends, and friends do not need any
          reconciliation. But what seems a difficulty as a matter of doctrine is
          clear as daylight as a matter of experience. I know it is my duty to
          be perfect, but I am conscious I cannot be. I know that every time I
          commit sin I am guilty, and yet I am quite certain that I must sin --
          that my nature is such that I cannot help it. I feel that I am unable
          to get rid of this body of sin and death, and yet I know I ought to
          get rid of it. These two things are enough to make any man miserable
          -- to know that he is responsible for his sinful nature, and yet to
          know that he cannot get rid of it -- to know that he ought to keep it
          down, and yet to feel he cannot -- to know that it is his business to
          keep God's law perfectly, and walk in the commandments of the law
          blameless, and yet to know by sad experience that he is as unable to
          do so as he is to reverse the motion of the globe, or dash the sun
          from the center of the spheres. How will not these two things drive
          any man to desperation? The way in which some men avoid the dilemma,
          is by a denial of one of these truths. They say, "Well, it is true I
          am unable to cease from sin;" and then they deny their obligation to
          do so; they do not cry, "O wretched man that I am;" they live as they
          like, and say they cannot help it. On the other hand, there are some
          men who know they are responsible; but then they say, "Ay but I can
          cast off my sin," and these are tolerably happy. The Arminian and the
          hyper-Calvinist both of them get on very comfortably; but the man who
          believes these two doctrines, as taught in God's Word, that he is
          responsible for sin and yet that he is unable to get rid of it, I do
          not wonder that when he looks into himself he finds enough to make him
          sigh and cry, ever, to faintness and despair, "O wretched man that I
          am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now says one, "Ah, I would be a Christian, if that is the way in
          which he faints -- it be is always to be fighting with himself; and
          even until he despairs of victory." Stop a moment. Let us complete the
          picture. This man is fainting; but he will be restored by-and-bye.
          Think not that he is hopelessly defeated, he falls to rise, he faints
          but to be revived afresh. I know a magic, which can awaken his
          sleeping hopes and shoot a thrill along the freezing current of his
          blood. Let us sound the promise in his ear, see how soon he revives.
          Let us put the cordial to his lips; see how he starts up and plays the
          man again. "I have been almost defeated" says he, "almost driven to
          despair. Rejoice not over me, O mine enemy; though I fall, yet shall I
          rise again." And he lets fly against him once more, shouting, "I thank
          God through Jesus Christ our Lord." So on he goes again, more than a
          conqueror, through him that has loved him.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. This brings me to this last point, that THE CHRISTIAN IS TO BE A
          CONQUEROR AT LAST. Do you think that we are for ever to be the drudges
          and the slaves of sin? Am I for ever to be the galley-slave of my own
          nature, to tug for freedom and never to escape? Am I always to have
          this dead man chained to my back, and sniff the pestiferous
          exhalations of his putrid body? No, no, no, that which is within my
          heart, is like a caged eagle; and I know that soon the bars which
          confine me shall be broken; the door of my cage shall be opened, and I
          shall mount with my eye upon the sun of glory, soaring upward, true to
          the line, moving neither to the right hand nor to the left, flying
          till I reach my eyrie in the everlasting rocks of God's eternal love.
          No, we that love the Lord are not for ever to dwell in Mesech. The
          dust may besmear our robes and filth may be upon our brow, and
          beggared may be our garment, but we shall not be so for ever. The day
          is coming when we shall rise and shake ourselves from the dust, and
          put on our beautiful garments. It is true we are now like Israel in
          Canaan. Canaan is full of enemies; but the Canaanites shall and must
          be driven out. Amalek shall be slain, Agag shall be hewn in pieces;
          our enemies shall, every one of them, be dispersed, and the whole land
          from Dan to Beersheba shall be the Lords. Christians, rejoice! You are
          soon to be perfect, you are soon to be free from sin, totally free
          from it, without one wrong inclination, one evil desire. You are soon
          to be as pure as the angels in light; nay, more, with your Master's
          garments on you are to be "holy as the holy one." Can you think of
          that? Is not that the very sum of heaven, the rapture of bliss, the
          sonnet of the hill-tops of glory -- that you are to be perfect? No
          temptation can reach you from eye, or ear, or hand; nor if the
          temptation could reach you would you be hurt by it; for there will be
          nothing in you that could in any way foster sin. It would be as when a
          spark falls upon an ocean, your holiness would quench it in a moment.
          Yes, washed in the blood of Jesus, afresh baptized with the Holy
          Spirit, you are soon to walk the golden streets, white-robed and
          white-hearted too, and perfect as your Maker, you are to stand before
          his throne, and sing his praises to eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, soldiers of Christ, to arms again! Once more rush into the fight,
          you cannot be defeated; you must overcome. Though you faint a little,
          yet take courage; you shall conquer through the blood of the Lamb.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, turning aside for a minute, I shall conclude by making an
          observation or two to many now present. There are some here who say,
          "I am never disturbed in that fashion." Then I am sorry for you. I
          will tell you the reason of your false peace. You have not the grace
          of God in your hearts. If you had you would surely find this conflict
          within you. Do not despise the Christian because he is in the
          conflict, despise yourself because you are out of it. The reason why
          the devil lets you alone is, that he knows you are his. He does not
          need to trouble you much now; he will have time enough to give you
          your wages as the last. He troubles the Christian because he is afraid
          of losing him; he thinks that if he does not tease him here, he shall
          never have the chance to do it in eternity, so he will bite him, and
          bark at him while he may. That is why the Christian is vexed more then
          you are. As for you, you may well be without any pain, for dead men
          feel no blows. You may well be without prickings of conscience; for
          men that are corrupt are not likely to feel wounds, though you stab
          them from head to foot. I pity your condition, for the worm that dieth
          not is preparing to feed upon you; the eternal vulture of remorse
          shall soon wet his horrid beak with the blood of your soul. Tremble;
          for the fires of hell are hot and unquenchable, and the place of
          perdition is hideous beyond a madman's dream. Oh that you would think
          of your last end. The Christian may have an evil present, but he has a
          glorious future; but your future is the blackness of darkness for
          ever. I adjure you by the living God, you that fear not Christ,
          consider your ways. You and I must give an account for this morning's
          service. You are warned, men; you are warned. Take heed to yourselves,
          that ye think not this life to be everything. There is a world to
          come; there is "after death the judgment." If you fear not the Lord,
          there is after judgment eternal wrath and everlasting misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now a word to those who are seeking Christ. "Ah!" says one, "sir,
          I have sought Christ, but I feel worse than I ever was in my life.
          Before I had any thoughts about Christ I felt myself to be good, but
          now I feel myself to be evil." It is all right, my friend; I am glad
          to hear you say so. When surgeons heal a patient's wound, they always
          take care to cut away the proud flesh, because the cure can never be
          radical while the proud flesh remains. The Lord is getting rid of your
          self-confidence and self-righteousness. He is just now revealing to
          your soul the deadly cancer which is festering within you. You are on
          the sure road to healing, if you are on the way to wounding. God
          wounds before he heals; he strikes a man dead in his own esteem before
          he makes him alive. "Ah," cries one, "but can I hope that I ever shall
          be delivered?" Yes, my brother, if you now look to Christ. I care not
          what your sin nor what your despair of heart; if you will only turn
          your eye to him who bled upon the tree, there is not only hope for
          you, but there is a certainty of salvation. I myself, while thinking
          over this subject, felt a horror of great darkness rush over my
          spirit, as I thought what danger I was in lest I should be defeated,
          and I could not get a glimpse of light into my burdened spirit, until
          I turned my eye, and saw my Master hanging on the tree. I saw the
          blood still flowing; faith laid hold upon the sacrifice, and I said,
          "This cross is the instrument of Jesu's victory, and shall be the
          means of mine." I looked to his blood; I remembered that I was
          triumphant in that blood, and I rose from my meditations, humbled, but
          yet rejoicing; cast down, but not in despair; looking for the victory.
          Do likewise. "Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners:
          believe that. You are an awakened, conscious and penitent sinner;
          therefore, he came to save you. Believe his word; trust him. Do
          nothing for your own salvation of yourself, but trust him to do it.
          Cast yourself simply and only on him; and, as this Bible is true, you
          shall not find the promise fail you -- "He that seeketh findeth; to
          him that knocketh it shall be opened."
        </p>
        <p>
          May God help you, by giving you this new life within! May he help you
          to look to Jesus, and though long and hard be the conflict, sweet
          shall be the victory.<br />
