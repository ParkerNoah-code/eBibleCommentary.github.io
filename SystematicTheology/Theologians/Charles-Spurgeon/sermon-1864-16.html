        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.573)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, June 5th, 1864, by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the
          gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be
          saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.| -- Mark 16:15-16.
        </p>
        <p>
          IN the preceding verse our Lord Jesus Christ gives us some little
          insight into the natural character of the apostles whom he selected to
          be the first ministers of the Word. They were evidently men of like
          passions with us, and needed to be rebuked even as we do. On the
          occasion when our Lord sent forth the eleven to preach the gospel to
          every creature, he |appeared unto them as they sat at meat, and
          upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they
          believed not them which had seen him after he was risen;| from which
          we may surely gather that to peach the Word, the Lord was pleased to
          choose imperfect men; men, too, who of themselves were very weak in
          the grace of faith in which it was most important that they should
          excel. Faith is the conquering grace, and is of all things the main
          requisite in the preacher of the Word; and yet the honoured men who
          were chosen to be the leaders of the divine crusade needed a rebuke
          concerning their unbelief. Why was this? Why, my brethren, because the
          Lord has ordained evermore that we should have this treasure in
          earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God and
          not of us. If you should find a perfect minister, then might the
          praise and honour of his usefulness accrue to man; but God is
          frequently pleased to select for eminent usefulness men evidently
          honest and sincere, but who have some manifest infirmity by which all
          the glory is cast off from them and laid upon Himself, and upon
          Himself alone. Let it never be supposed that we who are God's
          ministers either excuse our faults or pretend to perfection. We labour
          to walk in holiness, but we cannot claim to be all that we wish to be.
          We do not base the claims of God's truth upon the spotlessness of our
          characters, but upon the fact that it comes from him. You have
          believed in spite of our infirmities, and not because of our virtues;
          if, indeed, you had believed our word because of our supposed
          perfection, your faith would stand in the excellency of man and not in
          the power of God. We come unto you often with much trembling,
          sorrowing over our follies and weaknesses, but we deliver to you God's
          Word as God's Word, and we beseech you to receive it not as coming
          from us poor, sinful mortals, but as proceeding from the Eternal and
          Thrice Holy God; and if you so receive it, and by its own vital force
          are moved and stirred up towards God and his ways, then is the work of
          the Word sure work, which it could not and would not be if it rested
          in any way upon man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord having thus given us an insight into the character of the
          persons whom he has chosen to proclaim his truth, then goes on to
          deliver to the chosen champions, their commission for the Holy War. I
          pray you mark the words with solemn care. He sums up in a few words
          the whole of their work, and at the same time foretells the result of
          it, telling them that some would doubtless believe and so be saved,
          and some on the other hand would not believe and would most certainly,
          therefore, be damned, that is, condemned for ever to the penalties of
          God's wrath. The lines containing the commission of our ascended Lord
          are certainly of the utmost importance, and demand devout attention
          and implicit obedience, not only from all who aspire to the work of
          the ministry, but also from all who hear the message of mercy. A clear
          understanding of these words is absolutely necessary to our success in
          our Master's work, for if we do not understand the commission it is
          not at all likely that we shall discharge it aright. To alter these
          words were more than impertinence, it would involve the crime of
          treason against the authority of Christ and the best interests of the
          souls of men. O for grace to be very jealous here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wherever the apostles went they met with obstacles to the preaching of
          the gospel, and the more open and effectual was the door of utterance
          the more numerous were the adversaries. These brave men who wielded
          the sword of the Spirit as to put to flight all their foes; and this
          they did not by craft and guile, but by making a direct cut at the
          error which impeded them. Never did they dream for a moment of
          adapting the gospel to the unhallowed tastes or prejudices of the
          people, but at once directly and boldly they brought down with both
          their hands the mighty sword of the Spirit upon the crown of the
          opposing error. This morning, in the name of the Lord of Hosts, my
          Helper and Defense, I shall attempt to do the same; and if I should
          provoke some hostility -- if I should through speaking what I believe
          to be the truth lose the friendship of some and stir up the enmity of
          more, I cannot help it. The burden of the Lord is upon me, and I must
          deliver my soul. I have been loath enough to undertake the work, but I
          am forced to it by an awful and overwhelming sense of solemn duty. As
          I am soon to appear before my Master's bar, I will this day, if ever
          in my life, bear my testimony for truth, and run all risks. I am
          content to be cast out as evil if it must be so, but I cannot, I dare
          not, hold my peace. The Lord knoweth I have nothing in my heart but
          the purest love to the souls of those whom I feel imperatively called
          to rebuke sternly in the Lord's name. Among my hearers and readers, a
          considerable number will censure if not condemn me, but I cannot help
          it. If I forfeit your love for truth's sake I am grieved for you, but
          I cannot, I dare not, do otherwise. It is as much as my soul is worth
          to hold my peace any longer, and whether you approve or not I must
          speak out. Did I ever court your approbation? It is sweet to everyone
          to be applauded; but if for the sake of the comforts of respectability
          and the smiles of men any Christian minister shall keep back a part of
          his testimony, his Master at the last shall require it at his hands.
          This day, standing in the immediate presence of God, I shall speak
          honestly what I feel, as the Holy Spirit shall enable me; and I shall
          leave the matter with you to judge concerning it, as you will answer
          for that judgment at the last great day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I find that the great error which w e have to contend with throughout
          England (and it is growing more and more), is one in direct opposition
          to my text, well known to you as the doctrine of baptismal
          regeneration. We will confront this dogma with the assertion, that
          BAPTISM WITHOUT FAITH SAVES NO ONE. The text says, |He that believeth
          and is baptized shall be saved;| but whether a man be baptized or no,
          it asserts that |he that believeth not shall be damned:| so that
          baptism does not save the unbeliever , nay, it does not in any degree
          exempt him from the common doom of all the ungodly. He may have
          baptism, or he may not have baptism, but if he believeth not, he shall
          be in any case most surely damned. Let him be baptized by immersion or
          sprinkling, in his infancy, or in his adult age, if he be not led to
          put his trust in Jesus Christ -- if he remaineth an unbeliever, then
          this terrible doom is pronounced upon him -- |He that believeth not
          shall be damned.| I am not aware that any Protestant Church in England
          teaches the doctrine of baptismal regeneration except one, and that
          happens to be the corporation which with none too much humility calls
          itself the Church of England. This very powerful sect does not teach
          this doctrine merely through a section of its ministers, who might
          charitably be considered as evil branches of the vine, but it openly,
          boldly, and plainly declares this doctrine in her own appointed
          standard, the Book of Common Prayer, and that in words so express,
          that while language is the channel of conveying intelligible sense, no
          process short of violent wresting from their plain meaning can ever
          make them say anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are the words: we quote them from the Catechism which is intended
          for the instruction of youth, and is naturally very plain and simple,
          since it would be foolish to trouble the young with metaphysical
          refinements. The child is asked its name, and then questioned, |Who
          gave you this name?| |My godfathers and godmothers in my baptism;
          wherein I was made a member of Christ, the child of God, and an
          inheritor of the kingdom of heaven.| Is not this definite and plain
          enough? I prize the words for their candour; they could not speak more
          plainly. Three times over the thing is put, lest there should be any
          doubt in it. The word regeneration may, by some sort of juggling, be
          made to mean something else, but here there can be no
          misunderstanding. The child is not only made |a member of Christ| --
          union to Jesus is no mean spiritual gift -- but he is made in baptism
          |the child of God| also; and, since the rule is, |if children then
          heirs,| he is also made |an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven.|
          Nothing can be more plain. I venture to say that while honesty remains
          on earth the meaning of these words will not admit of dispute. It is
          clear as noon day that, as the Rubric hath it, |Fathers, mothers,
          masters, and dames, are to cause their children, servants, and
          apprentices,| no matter how idle, giddy, or wicked they may be, to
          learn the Catechism, and to say that in baptism they were made members
          of Christ and children of God. The form for the administration of this
          baptism is scarcely less plain and outspoken, seeing that thanks are
          expressly returned unto Almighty God, because the person baptized is
          regenerate. |Then shall the priest say, Seeing now, dearly beloved
          brethren, that this child is regenerate and grafted into the body of
          Christ's Church, let us give thanks unto Almighty God for these
          benefits; and with one accord make our prayers unto him, that this
          child may lead the rest of his life according to this beginning.'| Nor
          is this all, for to leave no mistake, we have the words of the
          thanksgiving prescribed, |Then shall the priest say, We yield thee
          hearty thanks, most merciful Father, that it hath pleased thee to
          regenerate this infant with thy Holy Spirit, to receive him for thine
          own child by adoption, and to incorporate him into thy holy Church.'|
        </p>
        <p>
          This, then, is the clear and unmistakable teaching of a Church calling
          itself Protestant. I am not now dealing at all with the question of
          infant baptism: I have nothing to do with that this morning. I am now
          considering the question of baptismal regeneration, whether in adults
          or infants, or ascribed to sprinkling, pouring, or immersion. Here is
          a Church which teaches every Lord's day in the Sunday-school, and
          should, according to the Rubric, teach openly in the Church, all
          children that they were made members of Christ, children of God, and
          inheritors of the kingdom of heaven when they were baptized! Here is a
          professedly Protestant Church, which, every time its minister goes to
          the font, declares that every person there receiving baptism is there
          and then |regenerated and grafted into the body of Christ's Church.|
        </p>
        <p>
          |But,| I hear many good people exclaim, |there are many good clergymen
          in the Church who do not believe in baptismal regeneration.| To this
          my answer is prompt. Why then do they belong to a Church which teaches
          that doctrine in the plainest terms? I am told that many in the Church
          of England preach against her own teaching. I know they do, and herein
          I rejoice in their enlightenment, but I question, gravely question
          their morality. To take oath that I sincerely assent and consent to a
          doctrine which I do not believe, would to my conscience appear little
          short of perjury, if not absolute downright perjury; but those who do
          so must be judged by their own Lord. For me to take money for
          defending what I do not believe -- for me to take the money of a
          Church, and then to preach against what are most evidently its
          doctrines -- I say for me to do this (I judge others as I would that
          they should judge me) for me, or for any other simple, honest man to
          do so, were an atrocity so great, that if I had perpetrated the deed,
          I should consider myself out of the pale of truthfulness, honesty, and
          common morality. Sirs, when I accepted the office of minister of this
          congregation, I looked to see what were your articles of faith; if I
          had not believed them I should not have accepted your call, and when I
          change my opinions, rest assured that as an honest man I shall resign
          the office, for how could I profess one thing in your declaration of
          faith, and quite another thing in my own preaching? Would I accept
          your pay, and then stand up every Sabbath-day and talk against the
          doctrines of your standards? For clergymen to swear or say that they
          give their solemn assent and consent to what they do not believe is
          one of the grossest pieces of immorality perpetrated in England, and
          is most pestilential in its influence, since it directly teaches men
          to lie whenever it seems necessary to do so in order to get a living
          or increase their supposed usefulness: it is in fact an open testimony
          from priestly lips that at least in ecclesiastical matters falsehood
          may express truth, and truth itself is a mere unimportant nonentity. I
          know of nothing more calculated to debauch the public mind than a want
          of straightforwardness in ministers; and when worldly men hear
          ministers denouncing the very things which their own Prayer Book
          teaches, they imagine that words have no meaning among ecclesiastics,
          and that vital differences in religion are merely a matter of
          tweedle-dee and tweedle-dum, and that it does not much matter what a
          man does believe so long as he is charitable towards other people. If
          baptism does regenerate people, let the fact be preached with a
          trumpet tongue, and let no man be ashamed of his belief in it. If this
          be really their creed, by all means let them have full liberty for its
          propagation. My brethren, those are honest Churchmen in this matter
          who, subscribing to the Prayer Book, believe in baptismal
          regeneration, and preach it plainly. God forbid that we should censure
          those who believe that baptism saves the soul, because they adhere to
          a Church which teaches the same doctrine. So far they are honest men;
          and in England, where else, let them never lack a full toleration. Let
          us oppose their teaching by all Scriptural and intelligent means, but
          let us respect their courage in plainly giving us their views. I hate
          their doctrine, but I love their honesty; and as they speak but what
          they believe to be true, let them speak it out, and the more clearly
          the better. Out with it, sirs, be it what it may, but do let us know
          what you mean. For my part, I love to stand foot to foot with an
          honest foeman. To open warfare, bold and true hearts raise no
          objection but the ground of quarrel; it is covert enmity which we have
          most cause to fear, and best reason to loathe. That crafty kindness
          which inveigles me to sacrifice principle is the serpent in the grass
          -- deadly to the incautious wayfarer. Where union and friendship are
          not cemented by truth, they are an unhallowed confederacy. It is time
          that there should be an end put to the flirtations of honest men with
          those who believe one way and swear another. If men believe baptism
          works regeneration, let them say so; but if they do not so believe it
          in their hearts , and yet subscribe, and yet more, get their livings
          by subscribing to words asserting it, let them find congenial
          associates among men who can equivocate and shuffle, for honest men
          will neither ask nor accept their friendship.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ourselves are not dubious on this point, we protest that persons
          are not saved by being baptized. In such an audience as this, I am
          almost ashamed to go into the matter, because you surely know better
          than to be misled. Nevertheless, for the good of others we will drive
          at it. We hold that persons are not saved by baptism, for we think,
          first of all that it seems out of character with the spiritual
          religion which Christ came to teach, that he should make salvation
          depend upon mere ceremony. Judaism might possibly absorb the ceremony
          by way of type into her ordinances essential to eternal life; for it
          was religion of types and shadows. The false religions of the heathen
          might inculcate salvation by a physical process, but Jesus Christ
          claims for his faith that it is purely spiritual, and how could he
          connect regeneration with a peculiar application of aqueous fluid? I
          cannot see how it would be a spiritual gospel, but I can see how it
          would be mechanical, if I were sent forth to teach that the mere
          dropping of so many drops upon the brow, or even the plunging a person
          in water could save the soul. This seems to me to be the most
          mechanical religion now existing, and to be on a par with the praying
          windmills of Thibet, or the climbing up and down of Pilate's staircase
          to which Luther subjected himself in the days of his darkness. The
          operation of water-baptism does not appear even to my faith to touch
          the point involved in the regeneration of the soul. What is the
          necessary connection between water and the overcoming of sin? I cannot
          see any connection which can exist between sprinkling, or immersion,
          and regeneration, so that the one shall necessarily be tied to the
          other in the absence of faith. Used by faith, had God commanded it,
          miracles might be wrought; but without faith or even consciousness, as
          in the case of babes, how can spiritual benefits be connected
          necessarily with the sprinkling of water? If this be your teaching,
          that regeneration goes with baptism, I say it looks like the teaching
          of a spurious Church, which has craftily invented a mechanical
          salvation to deceive ignorant, sensual, and grovelling minds, rather
          than the teaching of the most profoundly spiritual of all teachers,
          who rebuked Scribes and Pharisees for regarding outward rites as more
          important than inward grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it strikes me that a more forcible argument is that the dogma is
          not supported by facts. Are all persons who are baptized children of
          God? Well, let us look at the divine family. Let us mark their
          resemblance to their glorious Parent! Am I untruthful if I say that
          thousands of those who were baptized in their infancy are now in our
          goals? You can ascertain the fact if you please, by application to
          prison authorities. Do you believe that these men, many of whom have
          been living by plunder, felony, burglary, or forgery, are regenerate?
          If so, the Lord deliver us from such regeneration. Are these villains
          members of Christ? If so, Christ has sadly altered since the day when
          he was holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners. Has he really
          taken baptized drunkards and harlots to be members of his body? Do you
          not revolt at the supposition? It is a well-known fact that baptized
          persons have been hanged. Surely it can hardly be right to hang the
          inheritors of the kingdom of heaven! Our sheriffs have much to answer
          for when they officiate at the execution of the children of God, and
          suspend the members of Christ on the gallows! What a detestable farce
          is that which is transacted at the open grave, when |a dear brother|
          who has died drunk is buried in a |sure and certain hope of the
          resurrection of eternal life,| and the prayer that |when we shall
          depart this life we may rest in Christ, as our hope is that this our
          brother doth.| Here is a regenerate brother, who having defiled the
          village by constant uncleanness and bestial drunkenness, died without
          a sign of repentance, and yet the professed minister of God solemnly
          accords him funeral rites which are denied to unbaptized innocents,
          and puts the reprobate into the earth in |sure and certain hope of the
          resurrection to eternal life.| If old Rome in her worst days ever
          perpetrated a grosser piece of imposture than this, I do no read
          things aright; if it does not require a Luther to cry down this
          hypocrisy as much as Popery ever did, then I do not even know that
          twice two make four. Do we find -- we who baptize on profession of
          faith, and baptize by immersion in a way which is confessed to be
          correct, though not allowed by some to be absolutely necessary to its
          validity -- do we who baptize in the name of the sacred Trinity as
          others do, do we find that baptism regenerates? We do not. Neither in
          the righteous nor the wicked do we find regeneration wrought by
          baptism. We have never met with one believer, however instructed in
          divine things, who could trace his regeneration to his baptism; and on
          the other hand, we confess it with sorrow, but still with no surprise,
          that we have seen those whom we have ourselves baptized, according to
          apostolic precedent, go back into the world and wander into the
          foulest sin, and their baptism has scarcely been so much as a
          restraint to them, because they have not believed in the Lord Jesus
          Christ. Facts all show that whatever good there may be in baptism, it
          certainly does not make a man |a member of Christ, the child of God,
          and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven,| or else many thieves,
          whoremongers, drunkards, fornicators, and murderers, are members of
          Christ, the children of God, and inheritors of the kingdom of heaven.
          Facts, brethren, are against this Popish doctrine; and facts are
          stubborn things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet further, I am persuaded that the performance styled baptism by the
          Prayer Book is not at all likely to regenerate and save. How is the
          thing done? One is very curious to know when one hears of an operation
          which makes men member s of Christ, children of God, and inheritors of
          the kingdom of heaven, how the thing is done. It must in itself be a
          holy thing truthful in all its details, and edifying in every portion.
          Now, we will suppose we have a company gathered round the water, be it
          more or less, and the process of regeneration is about to be
          performed. We will suppose them all to be godly people. The clergyman
          officiating is a profound believer in the Lord Jesus, and the father
          and mother are exemplary Christians, and the godfathers and godmothers
          are all gracious persons. We will suppose this -- it is a supposition
          fraught with charity, but it may be correct. What are these godly
          people supposed to say? Let us look to the Prayer Book. The clergyman
          is suppose to tell these people, |Ye have heard also that our Lord
          Jesus Christ hath promised in his gospel to grant all these things
          that ye have prayed for: which promise he, for his part, will most
          surely keep and perform. Wherefore, after this promise made by Christ,
          this infant must also faithfully, for his part, promise by you that
          are his sureties (until he come of age to take it upon himself) that
          he will renounce the devil and all his works, and constantly believe
          God's holy Word, and obediently keep his commandments.| This small
          child is to promise to do this, or more truly others are to take upon
          themselves to promise, and even vow that he shall do so. But we must
          not break the quotation, and therefore let us return to the Book. |I
          demand therefore, dost thou, in the name of this child, renounce the
          devil and all his works, the vain pomp and glory of the world, with
          all covetous desires of the same, and the carnal desires of the flesh,
          so that thou wilt not follow, nor be led by them?| Answers |I renounce
          them all.| That is to say, on the name and behalf of this tender
          infant about to be baptized, these godly people, these enlightened
          Christian people, these who know better , who are not dupes, who know
          all the while that they are promising impossibilities -- renounce on
          behalf of this child what they find it very hard to renounce for
          themselves -- |all covetous desires of the world and the carnal
          desires of the flesh, so that they will not follow nor be led by
          them.| How can they harden their faces to utter such a false promise,
          such a mockery of renunciation before the presence of the Father
          Almighty? Might not angels weep as they hear the awful promise
          uttered? Then in the presence of high heaven they profess on behalf of
          this child that he steadfastly believes the creed, when they know, or
          might pretty shrewdly judge that the little creature is not yet a
          steadfast believer in anything, much less in Christ's going down into
          hell. Mark, they do not say merely that the babe shall believe the
          creed, but they affirm that he does, for they answer in the child's
          name, |All this I steadfastly believe. Not we steadfastly believe,|
          but I, the little baby there, unconscious of all their professions and
          confessions of faith. In answer to the question, |Wilt thou be
          baptized in this faith?| they reply for the infant, |That is my
          desire.| Surely the infant has no desire in the matter, or at the
          least, no one has been authorized to declare any desires on his
          behalf. But this is not all, for then these godly, intelligent people
          next promise on the behalf of the infant, that |he shall obediently
          keep all God's holy will and commandments, and walk in the same all
          the days of his life.| Now, I ask you, dear friends, you who know what
          true religion means, can you walk in all God's holy commandments
          yourselves? Dare you make this day a vow on your own part, that you
          would renounce the devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of
          this wicked world, and all the sinful lusts of the flesh? Dare you,
          before God, make such a promise as that? You desire such holiness, you
          earnestly strive after it, but you look for it from God's promise, not
          from your own. If you dare make such vows I doubt your knowledge of
          your own hearts and of the spirituality of Gods's law. But even if you
          could do this for yourself, would you venture to make such a promise
          for any other person? For the best-born infant on earth? Come,
          brethren, what say you? Is not your reply ready and plain? There is
          not room for two opinions among men determined to observe truth in all
          their ways and words . I can understand a simple, ignorant rustic, who
          has never learned to read, doing all this at the command of a priest
          and under the eye of a squire. I can even understand persons doing
          this when the Reformation was in its dawn, and men had newly crept out
          of the darkness of Popery; but I cannot understand gracious, godly
          people, standing at the font to insult the all-gracious Father with
          vows and promises framed upon a fiction, and involving practical
          falsehood. How dare intelligent believer s in Christ to utter words
          which they know in their conscience to be wickedly aside from truth?
          When I shall be able to understand the process by which gracious men
          so accommodate their consciences, even then I shall have a confirmed
          belief that the God of truth never did and never will confirm a
          spiritual blessing of the highest order in connection with the
          utterance of such false promises and untruthful vows. My brethren,
          does it not strike you that declarations so fictitious are not likely
          to be connected with a new birth wrought by the Spirit of truth?
        </p>
        <p>
          I have not done with this point, I must take another case, and suppose
          the sponsors and others to be ungodly, and that is no hard
          supposition, for in many cases we know that godfathers and parents
          have no more thought of religion than that idolatrous hollowed stone
          around which they gather. When these sinners have taken their places,
          what are they about to say? Why, they are about to make the solemn
          vows I have already recounted in your hearing! Totally irreligious
          they are, but yet they promise for the baby what they never did, and
          never thought of doing for themselves -- they promise on behalf of
          this child, |that he will renounce the devil and all his works, and
          constantly believe God's holy Word, and obediently keep his
          commandments.| My brethren, do not think I speak severely here. Really
          I think there is something here to make mockery for devils. Let every
          honest man lament, that ever God's Church should tolerate such a thing
          as this, and that there should be found gracious people who will feel
          grieved because I, in all kindness of heart, rebuke the atrocity.
          Unregenerate sinners promising for a poor babe that he shall keep all
          God's holy commandments which they themselves wantonly break every
          day! How can anything but the longsuffering of God endure this? What!
          not speak against it? The very stones in the street might cry out
          against the infamy of wicked men and women promising t hat another
          should renounce the devil and all his works, while they themselves
          serve the devil and do his works with greediness! As a climax to all
          this, I am asked to believe that God accepts that wicked promise, and
          as the result of it, regenerates that child. You cannot believe in
          regeneration by this operation, whether saints or sinners are the
          performers. Take them to be godly, then they are wrong for doing what
          their conscience must condemn; view them as ungodly, and they are
          wrong for promising what they know they cannot perform; and in neither
          case can God accept such worship, much less infallibly append
          regeneration to such a baptism as this.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you will say |Why do you cry out against it?| I cry out against it
          because I believe that baptism does not save the soul, and that the
          preaching of it has a wrong and evil influence upon men. We meet with
          persons who, when we tell them that they must be born again, assure us
          that they were born again when they were baptized. The number of these
          persons is increasing, fearfully increasing, until all grades of
          society are misled by this belief. How can any man stand up in his
          pulpit and say Ye must be born again to his congregation, when he ha s
          already assured them, by his own |unfeigned assent and consent| to it,
          that they are themselves, every one of them, born again in baptism.
          What is he to do with them? Why, my dear friends, the gospel then has
          no voice; they have rammed this ceremony down its throat and it cannot
          speak to rebuke sin. The man who has been baptized or sprinkled says,
          |I am saved, I am a member of Christ, a child of God, and an inheritor
          of the kingdom of heaven. Who are you, that you should rebuke me? Call
          me to repentance? Call me to a new life? What better life can I have?
          for I am a member of Christ -- a part of Christ's body. What! rebuke
          me? I am a child of God. Cannot you see it in my face? No matter what
          my walk and conversation is, I am a child of God. Moreover, I am an
          inheritor of the kingdom of heaven. It is true, I drink and swear, and
          all that, but you know I am an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven, for
          when I die , though I live in constant sin, you will put me in the
          grave, and tell everybody that I died in sure and certain hope of the
          resurrection to eternal life.'|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, what can be the influence of such preaching as this upon our
          beloved England? Upon my dear and blessed country? What but the worst
          of ills? If I loved her not, but loved myself most, I might be silent
          here, but, loving England, I cannot and dare not; and having soon to
          render an account before my God, whose servant I hope I am, I must
          free myself from this evil as well as from every other, or else on my
          head may be the doom of souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here let me bring in another point. It is a most fearful fact, that in
          no age since the Reformation has Popery made such fearful strides in
          England as during the last few years. I had comfortably believed that
          Popery was only feeding itself upon foreign subscriptions, upon a few
          titled perverts, and imported monks and nuns. I dreamed that its
          progress was not real. In fact, I have often smiled at the alarm of
          many of my brethren at the progress of Popery. But, my dear friends,
          we have been mistaken, grievously mistaken. If you will read a
          valuable paper in the magazine called |Christian Work,| those of you
          who are not acquainted with it will be perfectly startled at its
          revelations. This great city is now covered with a network of monks,
          and priests, and sisters of mercy, and the conversions made are not by
          ones or twos, but by scores, till England is being regarded as the
          most hopeful spot for Romish missionary enterprise in the whole world;
          and at the present moment there is not a mission which is succeeding
          to anything like the extent which the English mission is. I covet not
          their money, I despise their sophistries, but I marvel at the way in
          which they gain their funds for the erection of their ecclesiastical
          buildings. It really is an alarming matter to see so many of our
          countrymen going off to that superstition which as a nation we once
          rejected, and which it was supposed we should never again receive.
          Popery is making advances such as you would never believe, though a
          spectator should tell it to you. Close to your very doors, perhaps
          even in your own houses, you may have evidence ere long of what a
          march Romanism is making. And to what is it to be ascribed? I say,
          with every ground of probability, that there is no marvel that Popery
          should increase when you have two things to make it grow: first of
          all, the falsehood o f those who profess a faith which they do not
          believe, which is quite contrary to the honesty of the Romanist, who
          does through evil report and good report hold his faith; and then you
          have, secondly, this form of error known as baptismal regeneration,
          and commonly called Puseyism, which is not only Puseyism, but
          Church-of-Englandism, because it is in the Prayer Book, as plainly as
          words can express it -- you have this baptismal regeneration preparing
          stepping-stones to make it easy for men to go to Rome. I have but to
          open my eyes a little to foresee Romanism rampant everywhere in the
          future, since its germs are spreading everywhere in the present. In
          one of our courts of legislature but last Tuesday, the Lord Chief
          Justice showed his superstition, by speaking of |the risk of the
          calamity of children dying unbaptized!| Among Dissenters you see a
          veneration for structures, a modified belief in the sacredness of
          places, which is idolatry; for to believe in the sacredness of
          anything but of God and of his own Word, is to idolize, whether it is
          to believe in the sacredness of the men, the priests, or in the
          sacredness of the bricks and mortar, or of the fine linen, or what
          not, which you may use in the worship of God. I see this coming up
          everywhere -- a belief in ceremony, a resting in ceremony, a
          veneration for altars, fonts, and Churches -- a veneration so profound
          that we must not venture upon a remark, or straightway of sinners we
          are chief. Here is the essence and soul of Popery, peeping up under
          the garb of a decent respect for sacred things. It is impossible but
          that the Church of Rome must spread, when we who are the watch-dogs of
          the fold are silent, and others are gently and smoothly turfing the
          road, and making it as soft and smooth as possible, that converts may
          travel down to the nethermost hell of Popery. We want John Knox back
          again. Do not talk to me of mild and gentle men, of soft manners and
          squeamish words, we want the fiery Knox, and even though his vehemence
          should |ding our pulpits into blads,| it were well if he did but rouse
          our hearts to action. We want Luther to tell men the truth
          unmistakably, in homely phrase. The velvet has got into our ministers'
          mouths o f late, but we must unrobe ourselves of soft raiment, and
          truth must be spoken, and nothing but truth; for of all lies which
          have dragged millions down to hell, I look upon this as being one of
          the most atrocious -- that in a Protestant Church there should be
          found those who swear that baptism saves the soul. Call a man a
          Baptist, or a Presbyterian, or a Dissenter, or a Churchman, that is
          nothing to me -- if he says that baptism saves the soul, out upon him,
          out upon him, he states what God n ever taught, what the Bible never
          laid down, and what ought never to be maintained by men who profess
          that the Bible, and the whole Bible, is the religion of Protestants.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have spoken thus much, and there will be some who will say -- spoken
          thus much bitterly. Very well, be it so. Physic is often bitter, but
          it shall work well, and the physician is not bitter because his
          medicine is so; or if he be accounted so, it will matter, so long as
          the patient is cured; at all events, it is no business of the patient
          whether the physician is bitter or not, his business is with his own
          soul's health. There is the truth, and I have told it to you; and if
          there should be one among you, or if there should be one among the
          readers of this sermon when it is printed, who is resting on baptism,
          or resting upon ceremonies of any sort, I do beseech you, shake off
          this venomous faith into the fire as Paul did the viper which fastened
          on his hand. I pray you do not rest on baptism.
        </p>
        <p>|No outward forms can make you clean,</p>
        <p>The leprosy lies deep within.|</p>
        <p>
          I do beseech you to remember that you must have a new heart and a
          right spirit, and baptism cannot give you these. You must turn from
          your sins and follow after Christ; you must have such a faith as shall
          make your life holy and your speech devout, or else you have not the
          faith of God's elect, and into God's kingdom you shall never come. I
          pray you never rest upon this wretched and rotten foundation, this
          deceitful invention of antichrist. O, may God save you from it, and
          bring you to seek the true rock of refuge for weary souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          I come with much brevity, and I hope with much earnestness, in the
          second place, to say that FAITH IS THE INDISPENSABLE REQUISITE TO
          SALVATION. |He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; he that
          believeth not shall be damned.| Faith is the one indispensable
          requisite for salvation. This faith is the gift of God. It is the work
          of the Holy Spirit. Some men believe not on Jesus; they believe not
          because they are not of Christ's sheep, as he himself said unto them;
          but his sheep hear his voice: he knows them and they follow him: he
          gives to them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall
          any pluck them out of his hand. What is this believing? Believing
          consists in two things; first there is an accrediting of the testimony
          of God concerning his Son. God tells you that his Son came into the
          world and was made flesh, that he lived upon earth for men's sake,
          that after having spent his life in holiness he was offered up a
          propitiation for sin, that upon the cross he there and then made
          expiation -- so made expiation for the sins of the world that
          Whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting
          life. If you would be saved, you must accredit this testimony which
          God gives concerning his own Son. Having received this testimony, the
          next thing is to confide in it -- indeed here lies, I think, the
          essence of saving faith, to rest yourself for eternal salvation upon
          the atonement and the righteousness of Jesus Christ, to have done once
          for all with all reliance upon feelings or upon doings, and to trust
          in Jesus Christ and in what he did for your salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is faith, receiving of the truth of Christ: first knowing it to
          be true, and then acting upon that belief. Such a faith as this --
          such real faith as this makes the man henceforth hate sin. How can he
          love the thing which made t he Saviour bleed? It makes him live in
          holiness. How can he but seek to honour that God who has loved him so
          much as to give his Son to die for him. This faith is spiritual in its
          nature and effects; it operates upon the entire man; it changes his
          heart, enlightens his judgment, and subdues his will; it subjects him
          to God's supremacy, and makes him receive God's Word as a little
          child, willing to receive the truth upon the ipse dixit of the divine
          One; it sanctifies his intellect, and makes him willing to be taught
          God's Word; it cleanses within; it makes clean the inside of the cup
          and platter, and it beautifies without; it makes clean the exterior
          conduct and the inner motive, so that the man, if his faith be true
          and real, becomes henceforth another man to what he ever was before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that such a faith as this should save the soul, is, I believe,
          reasonable; yea, more, it is certain, for we have seen men saved by it
          in this very house of prayer. We have seen the harlot lifted out of
          the Stygian ditch of her sin, and made an honest woman; we have seen
          the thief reclaimed; we have known the drunkard in hundreds of
          instances to be sobered; we have observed faith to work such a change,
          that all the neighbours who have seen it have gazed and admired, even
          though they hated it; we have seen faith deliver men in the hour of
          temptation, and help them to consecrate themselves and their substance
          to God; we have seen, and hope still to see yet more widely, deeds of
          heroic consecration to God and displays of witness-bearing against the
          common current of the times, which have proved to us that faith does
          affect the man, does save the soul. My hearers, if you would be saved,
          you must believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. Let me urge you with all my
          heart to look nowhere but to Christ crucified for your salvation. Oh!
          if you rest upon any ceremony, though it be not baptism -- if you rest
          upon any other than Jesus Christ, you must perish, as surely as this
          Book is true. I pray you believe not every spirit, but though I, or an
          angel from heaven, preach any other doctrine than this, let him be
          accursed, for this, and this alone, is the soul-saving truth which
          shall regenerate the world -- |He that believeth and is baptized shall
          be saved.| Away from all the tag-rags, wax candles, and millinery of
          Puseyism! away from all the gorgeous pomp of Popery! away from the
          fonts of Church-of-Englandism! we bid you turn your eyes to that naked
          cross, where hangs as a bleeding man the Son of God.
        </p>
        <p>|None but Jesus, none but Jesus</p>
        <p>Can do helpless sinners good.|</p>
        <p>
          There is life in a look at the crucified; there is life at this moment
          for you. Whoever among you can believe in the great love of God
          towards man in Christ Jesus, you shall be saved. If you can believe
          that our great Father desireth us to come to him -- that he panteth
          for us -- that he calleth us every day with the loud voice of his
          Son's wounds; if you can believe now that in Christ there is pardon
          for transgressions past, and cleansing for years to come; if you can
          trust him to save you, you have already the marks of regeneration. The
          work of salvation is commenced in you, so far as the Spirit's work is
          concerned: it is finished in you so far as Christ's work is concerned.
          O, I would plead with you -- lay hold on Jesus Christ. This is the
          foundation: build on it. This is the rock of refuge: fly to it. I pray
          you fly to it now. Life is short: time speeds with eagle's-wing. Swift
          as the dove pursued by the hawk, fly, fly poor sinner, to God's dear
          Son; now touch the hem of his garment; now look into that dear face,
          once marred with sorrows for you; look into those eyes, once shedding
          tears for you. Trust him, and if you find him false, then you must
          perish; but false you never will find him while this word standeth
          true, |He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that
          believeth not shall be damned.| God give us this vital, essential
          faith, without which there is no salvation. Baptized, re-baptized,
          circumcised, confirmed, fed upon sacraments, and buried in consecrated
          ground -- ye shall all perish except ye believe in him. The word is
          express and plain -- he that believeth not may plead his baptism, may
          plead anything he likes, |But he that believeth not shall be damned;|
          for him there is nothing but the wrath of God, the flames of hell,
          eternal perdition. So Christ declares, and so must it be.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now to close, there are some who say, |Ah! but baptism is in the
          text; where do you put that?| That shall be another point, and then we
          shall have done.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE BAPTISM IN THE TEXT IS ONE EVIDENTLY CONNECTED WITH FAITH. |He
          that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.| It strikes me, there
          is no supposition here, that anybody would be baptized who did not
          believe; or, if there be such a supposition, it is very clearly laid
          down that his baptism will be of no use to him, for he will be damned,
          baptized or not, unless he believes. The baptism of the text seems to
          me -- my brethren, if you differ from me I am sorry for it, but I must
          hold my opinion and out with it -- it seems to me that baptism is
          connected with, nay, directly follows belief. I would not insist too
          much upon the order of the words, but for other reasons, I think that
          baptism should follow believing. At any rate it effectually avoids the
          error we have been combating. A man who knows that he is saved by
          believing in Christ does not, when he is baptized, lift his baptism
          into a saving ordinance. In fact, he is the very best protester
          against that mistake, because he holds that he has no right to be
          baptized until he is saved. He b ears a testimony against baptismal
          regeneration in his being baptized as professedly an already
          regenerate person. Brethren, the baptism here meant is a baptism
          connected with faith, and to this baptism I will admit there is very
          much ascribed in Scripture. Into that question I am not going; but I
          do find some very remarkable passages in which baptism is spoken of
          very strongly. I find this -- |Arise, and be baptized, and wash away
          thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.| I find as much as this
          elsewhere; I know that believer's baptism itself does not wash away
          sin, yet it is so the outward sign and emblem of it to the believer,
          that the thing visible may be described as the thing signified. Just
          as our Saviour said -- |This is my body,| when it was not his body,
          but bread; yet, inasmuch as it represented his body, it was fair and
          right according to the usage of language to say, |Take, eat, this is
          my body.| And so, inasmuch as baptism to the believer representeth the
          washing of sin -- it may be called the washing of sin -- not that it
          is so, but that it is to saved souls the outward symbol and
          representation of what is done by the power of the Holy Spirit, in the
          man who believes in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          What connection has this baptism with faith? I think it has just this,
          baptism is the avowal of faith; the man was Christ's soldier, but now
          in baptism he puts on his regimentals. The man believed in Christ, but
          his faith remained between God an d his own soul. In baptism he says
          to the baptizer, |I believe in Jesus Christ;| he says to the Church,
          |I unite with you as a believer in the common truths of Christianity;|
          he saith to the onlooker, |Whatever you may do, as for me, I will
          serve the Lord.| It is the avowal of his faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we think baptism is also to the believer a testimony of his
          faith; he does in baptism tell the world what he believes. |I am
          about,| saith he, |to be buried in water. I believe that the Son of
          God was metaphorically baptized in suffering: I believe he was
          literally dead and buried.| To rise again out of the water sets forth
          to all men that he believes in the resurrection of Christ. There is a
          showing forth in the Lord's Supper of Christ's death, and there is a
          showing forth in baptism of Christ's burial and resurrection. It is a
          type, a sign, a symbol, a mirror to the world: a looking-glass in
          which religion is as it were reflected. We say to the onlooker, when
          he asks what is the meaning of this ordinance, |We mean to set forth
          our faith that Christ was buried, and that he rose again from the
          dead, and we avow this death and resurrection to be the ground of our
          trust.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, baptism is also Faith's taking her proper place. It is, or
          should be one of her first acts of obedience. Reason looks at baptism,
          and says, |Perhaps there is nothing in it; it cannot do me any good.|
          |True,| says Faith, |and therefore will I observe it. If it did me
          some good my selfishness would make me do it, but inasmuch as to my
          sense there is no good in it, since I am bidden by my Lord thus to
          fulfil all righteousness, it is my first public declaration that a
          thing which looks to be unreasonable and seems to be unprofitable,
          being commanded by God, is law, is law to me. If my Master had told me
          to pick up six stones and lay them in a row I would do it, without
          demanding of him, What good will it do?' Cui bono? is no fit question
          for soldiers of Jesus. The very simplicity and apparent uselessness of
          the ordinance should make the believer say, Therefore I do it because
          it becomes the better test to me of my obedience to my Master.'| When
          you tell your servant to do something, and he cannot comprehend it, if
          he turns round and says, |Please, sir, what for?| you are quite clear
          that he hardly understands the relation between master and servant. So
          when God tells me to do a thing, if I say, |What for?| I cannot have
          taken the place which Faith ought to occupy, which is that of simple
          obedience to whatever the Lord hath said. Baptism is commanded, and
          Faith obeys because it is commanded, and thus takes her proper place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, baptism is a refreshment to Faith. While we are made up of
          body and soul as we are, we shall need some means by which the body
          shall sometimes be stirred up to co-work with the soul. In the Lord's
          Supper my faith is assisted by the outward and visible sign. In the
          bread and in the wine I see no superstitious mystery, I see nothing
          but bread and wine, but in that bread and wine I do see to my faith an
          assistant. Through the sign my faith sees the thing signified. So in
          baptism there is no mysterious efficacy in the baptistry or in the
          water. We attach no reverence to the one or to the other, but we do
          see in the water and in the baptism such an assistance as brings home
          to our faith most manifestly our being buried with Christ, and our
          rising again in newness of life with him. Explain baptism thus, dear
          friends, and there is no fear of Popery rising out of it. Explain it
          thus, and we cannot suppose any soul will be led to trust to it; but
          it takes it s proper place among the ordinances of God's house. To
          lift it up in the other way, and say men are saved by it -- ah! my
          friends, how much of mischief that one falsehood has done and may do,
          eternity alone will disclose. Would to God another George Fox would
          spring up in all his quaint simplicity and rude honesty to rebuke the
          idol-worship of this age; to rail at their holy bricks and mortar,
          holy lecterns, holy alters, holy surplices, right reverend fathers,
          and I know not what. These things are not holy. God is holy; his truth
          is holy; holiness belongs not to the carnal and the material, but to
          the spiritual. O that a trumpet-tongue would cry out against the
          superstition of the age. I cannot, as George Fox did, give up baptism
          and the Lord's Supper, but I would infinitely sooner do it, counting
          it the smaller mistake of the two than perpetrate and assist in
          perpetrating the uplifting of baptism and the Lord's Supper out of
          their proper place. O my beloved friends, the comrades of my struggles
          and witnessings, cling to the salvation of faith, and abhor the
          salvation of priests. If I am not mistaken, the day will come when we
          shall have to fight for a simple spiritual religion far more than we
          do now. We have been cultivating friendship with those who are either
          unscriptural in creed or else dishonest, who either believe baptismal
          regeneration, or profess that they do, and swear before God that they
          do when they do not. The time is come when there shall be no more
          truce or parley between God's servants and the time-servers. The time
          is come when those who follow God must follow God, and those who try
          to trim and dress themselves and find out a way which is pleasing to
          the flesh and gentle to carnal desires, must go their way. A great
          winnowing time is coming to God's saints, and we shall be clearer one
          of these days than we now are from union with those who are upholding
          Popery, under the pretence of teaching Protestantism. We shall be
          clear, I say, of those who teach salvation by baptism, instead of
          salvation by the blood of our blessed Master, Jesus Christ. O may the
          Lord gird up your loins. Believe me, it is no trifle. It may be that
          on this ground Armageddon shall be fought. Here shall come the great
          battle between Christ and his saints on the one hand, and the world,
          and forms, and ceremonies, on the other. If we are overcome here,
          there may be years of blood and persecution, and tossing to and fro
          between darkness and light; but if we are brave and bold, and flinch
          not here, but stand to God's truth, the future of England may be
          bright and glorious. O for a truly reformed Church in England, and a
          godly race to maintain it! The world's future depends on it under God,
          for in proportion as truth is marred at home, truth is maimed abroad.
          Out of any system which teaches salvation by baptism must spring
          infidelity, an infidelity which the false Church already seems willing
          to nourish and foster beneath her wing. God save this favoured land
          from the brood of her own established religion. Brethren, stand fast
          in the liberty wherewith Christ has made you free, and be not afraid
          of any sudden fear nor calamity when it cometh, for he who trusteth to
          the Lord, mercy shall compass him about, and he who is faithful to God
          and Christ shall hear it said at the last, |Well done, good and
          faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of the Lord.| May the Lord
          bless this word for Christ's sake.

          [Note. -- Having been informed that the whole of the burial service is
          not usually read at executions, I have, for the sake of fairness,
          altered the passage upon page 318, although it strikes me that I might
          justly have retained it, since the rubric of the Church and not the
          practice of some of its ministers is that with which we must deal. The
          rubric says, |The office ensuing is not to be used for any that die
          unbaptized, or excommunicate, or have laid violent hands upon
          themselves.| The victim of our capital punishment is not by this
          rubric shut out from the privileges (?) of the Anglican burial
          service, unless his condemnation may be viewed as tantamount to
          excommunication, which I can hardly think be the case, since many
          condemned persons receive the sacrament. I have also altered an
          incorrect expression on page 316, which has been pointed out to me by
          both friends and foes. May God grant that the controversy which this
          sermon has commenced may lead to the advancement of his truth, and the
          enlightenment of many.]
