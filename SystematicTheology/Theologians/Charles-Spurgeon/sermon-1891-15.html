          1. But there is another among these heretics, Marcus by name, who
          boasts himself as having improved upon his master. He is a perfect
          adept in magical impostures, and by this means drawing away a great
          number of men, and not a few women, he has induced them to join
          themselves to him, as to one who is possessed of the greatest
          knowledge and perfection, and who has received the highest power from
          the invisible and ineffable regions above. Thus it appears as if he
          really were the precursor of Antichrist. For, joining the buffooneries
          of Anaxilaus to the craftiness of the magi, as they are called, he is
          regarded by his senseless and cracked-brain followers as working
          miracles by these means.

          2. Pretending to consecrate cups mixed with wine, and protracting to
          great length the word of invocation, he contrives to give them a
          purple and reddish colour, so that Charis, who is one of those that
          are superior to all things, should be thought to drop her own blood
          into that cup through means of his invocation, and that thus those who
          are present should be led to rejoice to taste of that cup, in order
          that, by so doing, the Charis, who is set forth by this magician, may
          also flow into them. Again, handing mixed cups to the women, he bids
          them consecrate these in his presence. When this has been done, he
          himself produces another cup of much larger size than that which the
          deluded woman has consecrated, and pouring from the smaller one
          consecrated by the woman into that which has been brought forward by
          himself, he at the same time pronounces these words: "May that Charis
          who is before all things, and who transcends all knowledge and speech,
          fill thine inner man, and multiply in thee her own knowledge, by
          sowing the grain of mustard seed in thee as in good soil." Repeating
          certain other like words, and thus goading on the wretched woman [to
          madness], he then appears a worker of wonders when the large cup is
          seen to have been filled out of the small one, so as even to overflow
          by what has been obtained from it. By accomplishing several other
          similar things, he has completely deceived many, and drawn them away
          after him.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It appears probable enough that this man possesses a demon as his
          familiar spirit, by means of whom he seems able to prophesy, and also
          enables as many as he counts worthy to be partakers of his Charis
          themselves to prophesy. He devotes himself especially to women, and
          those such as are well-bred, and elegantly attired, and of great
          wealth, whom he frequently seeks to draw after him, by addressing them
          in such seductive words as these: "I am eager to make thee a partaker
          of my Charis, since the Father of all doth continually behold thy
          angel before His face. Now the place of thy angel is among us: it
          behoves us to become one. Receive first from me and by me [the gift
          of] Charis. Adorn thyself as a bride who is expecting her bridegroom,
          that thou mayest be what I am, and I what thou art. Establish the germ
          of light in thy nuptial chamber. Receive from me a spouse, and become
          receptive of him, while thou art received by him. Behold Charis has
          descended upon thee; open thy mouth and prophesy." On the woman
          replying, "I have never at any time prophesied, nor do I know how to
          prophesy;" then engaging, for the second time, in certain invocations,
          so as to astound his deluded victim, he says to her, "Open thy mouth,
          speak whatsoever occurs to thee, and thou shalt prophesy." She then,
          vainly puffed up and elated by these words, and greatly excited in
          soul by the expectation that it is herself who is to prophesy, her
          heart beating violently [from emotion], reaches the requisite pitch of
          audacity, and idly as well as impudently utters some nonsense as it
          happens to occur to her, such as might be expected from one heated by
          an empty spirit. (Referring to this, one superior to me has observed,
          that the soul is both audacious and impudent when heated with empty
          air.) Henceforth she reckons herself a prophetess, and expresses her
          thanks to Marcus for having imparted to her of his own Charis. She
          then makes the effort to reward him, not only by the gift of her
          possessions (in which way he has collected a very large fortune), but
          also by yielding up to him her person, desiring in every way to be
          united to him, that she may become altogether one with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But already some of the most faithful women, possessed of the fear
          of God, and not being deceived (whom, nevertheless, he did his best to
          seduce like the rest by bidding them prophesy), abhorring and
          execrating him, have withdrawn from such a vile company of revellers.
          This they have done, as being well aware that the gift of prophecy is
          not conferred on men by Marcus, the magician, but that only those to
          whom God sends His grace from above possess the divinely-bestowed
          power of prophesying; and then they speak where and when God pleases,
          and not when Marcus orders them to do so. For that which commands is
          greater and of higher authority than that which is commanded, inasmuch
          as the former rules, while the latter is in a state of subjection. If,
          then, Marcus, or any one else, does command, -- as these are
          accustomed continually at their feasts to play at drawing lots, and
          [in accordance with the lot] to command one another to prophesy,
          giving forth as oracles what is in harmony with their own desires, --
          it will follow that he who commands is greater and of higher authority
          than the prophetic spirit, though he is but a man, which is
          impossible. But such spirits as are commanded by these men, and speak
          when they desire it, are earthly and weak, audacious and impudent,
          sent forth by Satan for the seduction and perdition of those who do
          not hold fast that well-compacted faith which they received at first
          through the Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Moreover, that this Marcus compounds philters and love-potions, in
          order to insult the persons of some of these women, if not of all,
          those of them who have returned to the Church of God -- a thing which
          frequently occurs -- have acknowledged, confessing, too, that they
          have been defiled by him, and that they were filled with a burning
          passion towards him. A sad example of this occurred in the case of a
          certain Asiatic, one of our deacons, who had received him (Marcus)
          into his house. His wife, a woman of remarkable beauty, fell a victim
          both in mind and body to this magician, and, for a long time,
          travelled about with him. At last, when, with no small difficulty, the
          brethren had converted her, she spent her whole time in the exercise
          of public confession, weeping over and lamenting the defilement which
          she had received from this magician.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Some of his disciples, too, addicting themselves to the same
          practices, have deceived many silly women, and defiled them. They
          proclaim themselves as being "perfect," so that no one can be compared
          to them with respect to the immensity of their knowledge, nor even
          were you to mention Paul or Peter, or any other of the apostles. They
          assert that they themselves know more than all others, and that they
          alone have imbibed the greatness of the knowledge of that power which
          is unspeakable. They also maintain that they have attained to a height
          above all power, and that therefore they are free in every respect to
          act as they please, having no one to fear in anything. For they
          affirm, that because of the "Redemption" it has come to pass that they
          can neither be apprehended, nor even seen by the judge. But even if he
          should happen to lay hold upon them, then they might simply repeat
          these words, while standing in his presence along with the
          "Redemption:" "O thou, who sittest beside God, and the mystical,
          eternal Sige, thou through whom the angels (mightiness), who
          continually behold the face of the Father, having thee as their guide
          and introducer, do derive their forms from above, which she in the
          greatness of her daring inspiring with mind on account of the goodness
          of the Propator, produced us as their images, having her mind then
          intent upon the things above, as in a dream, -- behold, the judge is
          at hand, and the crier orders me to make my defence. But do thou, as
          being acquainted with the affairs of both, present the cause of both
          of us to the judge, inasmuch as it is in reality but one cause." Now,
          as soon as the Mother hears these words, she puts the Homeric helmet
          of Pluto upon them, so that they may invisibly escape the judge. And
          then she immediately catches them up, conducts them into the bridal
          chamber, and hands them over to their consorts.

          7. Such are the words and deeds by which, in our own district of the
          Rhone, they have deluded many women, who have their consciences seared
          as with a hot iron. Some of them, indeed, make a public confession of
          their sins; but others of them are ashamed to do this, and in a tacit
          kind of way, despairing of [attaining to] the life of God, have, some
          of them, apostatized altogether; while others hesitate between the two
          courses, and incur that which is implied in the proverb, "neither
          without nor within;" possessing this as the fruit from the seed of the
          children of knowledge.<br />
