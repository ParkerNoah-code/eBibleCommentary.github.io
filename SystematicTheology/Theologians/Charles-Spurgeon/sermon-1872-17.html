          |For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that
          everyone may receive the things done in his body, according to that he
          hath done, whether it be good or bad.| -- 2Corinthians 5:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS MORNING WE preached concerning the resurrection of the dead, and
          it seems consistent with order to carry forward our thoughts this
          evening, to that which follows immediately after the resurrection,
          namely: THE GENERAL JUDGMENT; for the dead rise on purpose that they
          may be judged in their bodies. The Resurrection is the immediate
          prelude to the Judgment. There is no need that I try to prove to you
          from Scripture that there will be a general judgment, for the Word of
          God abounds with proof-passages. You have them in the Old Testament.
          You find David anticipating that great assize in the Psalms
          (especially in such as the forty-ninth and fiftieth, the ninety-sixth
          Psalm, and the three that follow it), FOR MOST ASSUREDLY THE LORD
          COMETH: HE COMETH TO JUDGE THE EARTH IN RIGHTEOUSNESS. Very solemnly
          and very tenderly does Solomon in the Ecclesiastes warn the young man,
          that, let him rejoice as he may and cheer his heart in the days of his
          youth, for all these things God will bring him into judgment; for God
          will judge every secret thing. Daniel in the night visions beholds the
          Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven, and drawing near to the
          Ancient of Days; then he sits upon the throne of judgment AND THE
          NATIONS ARE GATHERED BEFORE HIM. It was no new doctrine to the Jews;
          it was received and accepted by them as a most certain fact that there
          would be a day in which God would judge the earth in righteousness.
          The New Testament is very express. The twenty-fifth of Matthew, which
          we read to you just now, contains language, which could not possibly
          be more clear and definite, from the lips of the Saviour himself. He
          is the faithful witness, and cannot lie. You are told that before him
          will be gathered ALL NATIONS, and he shall divide them the one from
          the other, as the shepherd divideth the sheep from the goats. Other
          passages there are in abundance, as, for instance, the one that is now
          before us, which is plain enough. Another we might quote is in the
          second epistle to the Thessalonians, the first chapter, from the
          seventh to the tenth verse. Let Us read it, | And to you who are
          troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from
          heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on
          them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus
          Christ: who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the
          presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; when he shall
          come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that
          believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.|
          The book of the Revelation is very graphic in its depicting that last
          general judgment. Turn to the twentieth chapter, at the eleventh and
          twelfth verses. The seer of Patmos says, | And I saw a great white
          throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the
          heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And I saw the
          dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened:
          and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead
          were judged out of those things which were written in the books,
          according to their works.| Time would fail me to refer you to all the
          Scriptures. It is asserted over and over again by the Holy Spirit,
          whose Word is truth, that THERE WILL BE A JUDGMENT OF THE QUICK AND OF
          THE DEAD.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beside that direct testimony, it should be remembered there is a
          convincing argument that so it must needs be, from the very fact that
          God is just as the Ruler over men. In all human governments there must
          he an assize held. Government cannot be conducted without its days of
          session and of trial, and, inasmuch as there is evidently sin and evil
          in this world, it might fairly be anticipated that there would be a
          time when God will go on circuit, and when he will call the prisoners
          before him, and the guilty shall receive their condemnation. Judge for
          yourselves: is this present state the conclusion of all things? If so,
          what evidence would you adduce of the divine justice, in the teeth of
          the fact that the best of men are often in this world the poorest and
          the most afflicted, while the worst of men acquire wealth, practice
          oppression, and receive homage from the crowd? Who are they that ride
          in the high places of the earth? Are they not those, great
          transgressors, who |wade through slaughter to a throne and shut the
          gates of mercy on mankind|? Where are the servants of God? They are in
          obscurity and suffering full often. Do they not sit like Job among the
          ashes, subjects of little pity, objects of much upbraiding? And where
          are the enemies of God? Do not many of them wear purple and fine linen
          and fare sumptuously every day? If there be no hereafter, then Dives
          has the best of it; and the selfish man who fears not God, is after
          all, the wisest of men and more to be commended than his fellows. But
          it cannot be so. Our common sense revolts against the thought. There
          must be another state in which these anomalies will all be rectified.
          |If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the
          most miserable,| says the apostle. The best of men were driven to the
          worst of straits in those persecuting times for being God's servants.
          How say ye then, |Finis coronat opus,| the end crowns the work? That
          cannot be the final issue of life, or justice itself were frustrated.
          There must be a restitution for those who suffer unjustly: there must
          be a punishment for the wicked and the oppressor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only may this be affirmed from a general sense of justice, but
          there is in the conscience of most men, if not of all, an assent to
          this fact. As an old Puritan says, |God holds a petty session in every
          man's conscience, which is the earnest of the assize which he will
          hold by and by; for almost all men judge themselves, and their
          conscience knows this to be wrong and that to be right. I say almost
          all,' for there seems to be in this generation a race of men who have
          so stultified their conscience that the spark appears to have gone
          out, and they put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter. The lie they
          seem to approve, but the truth they do not recognize. But let
          conscience alone and do not stultify her, and you shall find her
          bearing witness that there is a Judge of all the earth who must do
          right.| Now this is peculiarly the case when conscience is allowed
          full play. Men who are busy about their work or entertained with their
          pleasures, often keep their consciences quiet. As John Bunyan puts it,
          they shut up Mr Conscience; they blind his windows; they barricade his
          doors; and as for the great bell on the top of the house, which the
          old gentleman was wont to ring, they cut the rope of it, so that he
          cannot get at it, for they do not wish him to disturb the town of
          Man-soul. But when death comes, it often happens that Mr. Conscience
          escapes from his prison-house, and then, I warrant you, he will make
          such a din that there is not a sleeping head in all Man-soul. He will
          cry out and avenge himself for his constrained silence, and make the
          man know that there is a something within him not quite dead, which
          cries out still for justice, and that sin cannot go unchastised. There
          must be a judgment, then. Scripture asserts it, that would be enough:
          but by way of collateral evidence the natural order of things requires
          it; and conscience attests it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we come to consider what our text says about the Judgment. I pray
          you, brethren, if I should speak coldly tonight on this momentous
          truth, or fail to excite your attention and stir your deepest
          emotions, forgive me, and may God forgive me, for I shall have good
          reason to ask God's forgiveness, seeing that if ever a topic should
          arouse the preacher to a zeal for the honor of his Lord and for the
          welfare of his fellow creatures, and so make him doubly in earnest, it
          is this. But, then, permit me to say, that, if ever there was a theme
          quite independent of the speaker, which on its own account alone
          should command your thoughtfulness, it is that which I now bring
          before you. I feel no need of oratory or of speech well selected: the
          bare mention of the fact that such a judgment is impending, and will
          ere long occur, might well hold you in breathless silence, still the
          very throbbings of your pulse, and choke the utterance of my lips. The
          certainty of it, the reality of it, the terrors that accompany it, the
          impossibility of escaping from it, all appeal to us now and demand our
          vigilance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Ask ye now, who is it, or who ARE THEY THAT WILL HAVE APPEAR BEFORE
          THE THRONE OF JUDGMENT? The answer is plain; it admits of no
          exemption: |We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ.|
          This is very decisive, if there were no other text. We must all
          appear; that is to say, every one of the human race. We must all
          appear. And that the godly will not be exempted from this appearance
          is very clear, for the apostle here is speaking to Christians. He
          says, |We walk by faith, not by sight. We are confident. We labour|
          and so on; and then he puts it, |We must all appear.| So that, beyond
          all others, it is certain that all Christians must appear there. The
          text is quite conclusive upon that point. And if we had not that text,
          we nave the passage in Matthew, which we have read, in which the sheep
          are summoned there as certainly as are the goats; and the passage in
          the Revelation, where all the dead are judged according to the things
          which are written in the books. They are all there. And if the
          objection should be raised, |We thought that the sins of the righteous
          being pardoned, and for ever blotted out, they could never come into
          judgment,| we have only to remind you, beloved, that if they are so
          pardoned and blotted out, as they undoubtedly are, the righteous have
          no reason to fear coming into judgment. They are the persons who covet
          the judgment, and will be able to strand there to receive a public
          acquittal from the mouth of the great Judge. Who, among us, wishes, as
          it were, to be smuggled into heaven unlawfully? Who desires to have it
          said by the damned in hell, |You were never tried, or else you might
          have been condemned as we were.| No, brethren, we have a hope that we
          can stand the trial. The way of righteousness by Christ Jesus enables
          us to submit ourselves to the most tremendous tests which even that
          burning day can bring forth. We are not afraid to be put into the
          balances. We even desire that day when our faith in Jesus Christ is
          strong and firm; for we say, |who is he that condemneth?| We can
          challenge the day of judgment. Who is he that shall lay anything to
          our charge in that day, or at any other, since Christ hath died and
          hath risen again?It is needful that the righteous should be there that
          there may not be any partiality in the matter whatever; that the thing
          may be all clear and straight, and that the rewards of the righteous
          may be seen to be, though of grace, yet without any violation of the
          most rigorous justice. Dear brethren, what a day it will be for the
          righteous! For some of them were -- perhaps some here present are --
          lying under some very terrible accusation of which they are perfectly
          guiltless. All will be cleared up then, and that will be one great
          blessing of that day. There will be a resurrection of reputations as
          well as of bodies. Men call the righteous, fools; then shall they
          shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. They hounded
          them to death, as not being fit to live. In early ages they laid to
          the Christians charges of the most terrible character, which I should
          count it shame to mention. But then they will all be clear; and those
          of whom the world was not worthy, who were driven and hunted about
          find made to dwell in the caves of the earth, they shall come forth as
          worthy ones, and the world shall know her true aristocracy, earth
          shall own her true nobility. The men whose names she cast out as evil,
          all then be held in great repute, for they shall stand out clear and
          transparent without spot or blemish. It is well that there should be a
          trial for the righteous, for the clearing of them, the vindication of
          them, and that it should be public, defying the evil and criticism of
          all mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          |We must all appear.| What a vast assembly, what a prodigious
          gathering, that of the entire human race! It struck me as I was
          meditating upon this subject, what would be the thoughts of Father
          Adam, as he stood there with Mother Eve and looked upon his offspring.
          It will be the first time in which he has ever had the opportunity of
          seeing all his children met together. What a sight will he then behold
          -- far stretching, covering all the globe which they inhabit, enough
          not only to people all earth's plains, but crown her hill-tops, and
          cover even the ways of the sea, so numberless must the human race have
          been, if all the generations that have ever lived, or shall ever live,
          shall at once rise from the dead. Oh, what a sight will that be! Is it
          too marvelous for our imagination to picture? Yet it is quite certain
          that the assemblage will be mustered, and the spectacle will he
          beheld. Every one from before the Flood, from the days of the
          Patriarchs, from the times of David, from the Babylonian kingdom, all
          the legions of Assyria, all the hosts of Persia, all the phalanx of
          the Greeks, all the vast armies and legions of Rome, the barbarian,
          the Scythian, the bond, the free, men of every color and of every
          tongue -- they shall all stand in that great day before the Judgment
          Seat of Christ. There come the kings -- no greater than the men they
          call their slaves. There come the princes -- but they have doffed
          their coronets, for they must stand like common flesh and blood. Here
          come the judges, to be judged themselves, and the advocates and
          barristers, needing an advocate on their own account. Here come those
          that thought themselves too good, and kept the street to themselves.
          There are the Pharisees, hustled by the Publicans on either side and
          sunk down to the natural level with them. Mark the peasants rising
          from the soil; see the teeming myriads from outside the great cities
          streaming in, countless hosts such as no Alexander or Napoleon ever
          beheld! See how the servant is as great as his master! |Liberty,
          Equality, Fraternity,| are now proclaimed. No kings, no princes, no
          nobles, can shelter themselves behind their order, assert a privilege
          or claim an immunity. Alike on one common level they stand together,
          to be tried before the last tremendous tribunal. There shall come the
          wicked of every sort. Proud Pharaoh shall be there; Senacherib, the
          haughty; Herod, that would have slain the young child; Judas, that
          betrayed his master; Demas, that sold him for gold; and Pilate, who
          would fain have washed his hands in innocency. There shall come the
          long list of infallibles, the whole line of popes, to receive their
          damnation at the Almighty's hands, and the priests that trod upon the
          necks of nations, and the tyrants that used the priests as their tools
          -- they shall come to receive the thunderbolts of God which they so
          richly deserve. Oh, what a scene will it be! These little companies,
          which look to us so large when they are gathered together beneath this
          roof, how do they shrink into the drop of a bucket as compared with
          the ocean of life that shall swell around the throne at the last great
          Judgment day. They shall all be there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the most important thought connected with this to me, is that I
          shall be there; to you young men, that you will be there; to you, ye
          aged of every sort, that you, in propria personae -- each one shall be
          there. Are you rich? Your dainty dress shall be put off. Are you poor?
          Your rags shall not exempt you from attendance at that court. None
          shall say -- I am too obscure.| You must come up from that hiding
          place. None shall say, |I am too public.| You must come down from that
          pedestal. Everyone must be there. Note the word |We|, |We must all
          appear.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And still further, note the word, |appear.| | We must all appear.| No
          disguise will be possible. Ye cannot come there dressed in masquerade
          of profession or attired in robes of state, but we must appear; we
          must be seen through, must be displayed, must be revealed; off will
          come your garments, and your spirit will be judged of God, not after
          appearance, but according to the inward heart. Oh, what a day that
          will be when every man shall see himself, and every man shall see his,
          fellow, and the eyes of angels and the eyes of devils, and the eyes of
          God upon the throne, shall see us through and through. Let these
          thoughts dwell upon your minds, while you take this for the answer to
          our first enquiry, |Who is to be judged?|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Our second question is, Who will be the judge? |We must all appear
          before the judgment seat of Christ.| That Christ should be appointed
          judge of all mankind is most proper and fitting. Our British law
          ordains that a man shall be tried by his peers, and there is justice
          in the statute. Now the Lord God will judge men, but at the same time
          it will be in the person of Jesus Christ the man. Men shall be judged
          by a man. He that was once judged by men shall judge men. Jesus knows
          what man should be; he has been under the law himself in deep
          humility, who is ordained to administer the law in high authority. He
          can hold the scales of justice evenly, for he has stood in man's place
          and borne and braved man's temptations; he therefore is the most fit
          judge that could be selected. I have sometimes heard and read sermons
          in which the preacher said that a Christian ought to rejoice that his
          judge is his friend. There may be no impropriety intended, still it
          seems to me rather a questionable suggestion. I should not like to put
          it use that way myself; because any judge that was partial to his
          friends when he sat on the judgment seat would deserve to come off the
          seat immediately. As a judge I expect no favoritism from Christ. I
          expect when he sits there he will deal out even-handed justice to all.
          I cannot see how it is right for any minister to hold it forth that we
          should find encouragement in the judge being our friend. Friend or no
          friend, we shall go in for a fair trial every one of us, and Christ
          will not be a respecter of persons. Of him whom God has appointed to
          judge the world, it shall not be said when the assize is over that he
          winked at the crimes of some and extenuated them, while he searched
          out the faults of others and convicted them. He will be fair and
          upright throughout. He is our friend, I grant you, and he will be our
          friend and Saviour for ever; but, as a judge, we must keep to the
          thought, and believe and maintain it that he will be impartial to all
          the sons of men. You will have a fair trial, man. He that will judge
          you will not take sides against you. We have sometimes thought that
          men have been shielded from the punishment they deserved, because they
          were of a certain clerical profession, or because they occupied a
          certain official position. A poor labourer who kills his wife shall be
          hanged, but when another matt of superior station does the like deed
          of violence, and stains his hands with the blood of her whom he had
          vowed to love and cherish, the capital sentence shall not be executed
          upon him. Everywhere we see in the world that with the best intentions
          justice somehow or other does squint a little. Even in this country
          there is just the slightest possible turning of the scale, and God
          grant that may be cured ere long. I do not think it is intentional;
          and I hope the nation will not long have to complain about it. There
          ought to be the same justice for the poorest beggar that crawls into a
          casual ward, as for his Lordship that owns the broadest acres in all
          England. Before the law, at least, all men ought to stand equal. So
          shall it be with the Judge of all the earth. Fiat justia, ruat coelum.
          Christ will by all means hold the scales even. Thou shalt have a fair
          trial and a full trial, too. There shall be no concealment of anything
          in thy favour, and no, keeping back of anything against thee. No
          witnesses shall be borne across the sea to keep them out of the way.
          They shall all be there, and all testimony shall be there, and all
          that is wanted to condemn or to acquit shall be produced in full court
          at that trial, and hence it will be a final trial. From that court
          there will be no appeal. If Christ, saith | Cursed!| cursed must they
          be for ever. If Christ saith |Blessed!|, blessed shall they be for
          aye. Well, this is what we have to expect then, to stand before the
          throne of the man Christ Jesus the Son of God, and there to be judged.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now the third point is, WHAT WILL BE RULE OF JUDGEMENT? The text
          says that |every one may receive the things done in his body according
          to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.| Then it would appear
          that our actions will be taken in evidence at the last. Not our
          profession, not our boastings, but our actions will be taken in
          evidence at the last, and every man shall receive according to what he
          hath done in the body. That implies that everything done by us in this
          body will be known. It is all recorded; it will be all brought to
          light. Hence, in that day every secret sin will be published. What was
          done in the chamber, what was hidden by the darkness, shall be
          published as upon the housetop -- every secret thing. With great care
          you have concealed it, most dexterously you have covered it up; but it
          shall be brought out to your own astonishment to form a part of your
          judgment. There, hypocritical actions as well as secret sins will be
          laid bare. The Pharisee who devoured the widow's house and made a long
          prayer, will find that widow's house brought against him, and the long
          prayer too; for the long prayer will then be understood as having been
          a long lie against God from beginning to end. Oh, how fine we can make
          some things look With the aid of paint and varnish and gilt; but at
          the last day off will come the varnish and veneer, and the true metal,
          the real substance, will then be seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it is said that everything that is done in the body will be
          brought up as evidence against us or for us, remember this includes
          every omission as well as every commission; for that which is not done
          that ought to have been done is as greatly sinful as the doing of that
          which ought not to be done. Did not you notice when we were reading
          the twenty-fifth chapter of Matthew, how those on the left hand were
          condemned, not for what they did, but for what they did not do: |I was
          an hungry, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no
          drink.| Where would some of you stand, according to this rule, who
          have lived in neglect of holiness, and neglect of faith, and neglect
          of repentance, before God all your days? Bethink yourselves, I pray
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recollect, too, that all our words will be brought up. For every idle
          word that man shall speak he will have to give an account. And all our
          thoughts, too, for these lie at the bottom of our actions and give the
          true colour to them good or bad. Our motives, our heart sins,
          especially, our hatred of Christ, our neglect of the gospel, our
          unbelief -- all of these shall be read aloud and published
          unreservedly. |Well,| saith one, |who then can be saved?| Ah! indeed,
          who then can be saved? Let me tell you who will be. There will come
          forward those who have believed in Jesus, and albeit they have many
          sins to which they might well plead guilty, they will be able to say,
          |Great God, thou didst provide for us a substitute, and thou didst say
          that if we would accept him he should be a substitute for us and take
          our sins upon himself, and we did accept him and our sins were laid
          upon him, and we have now no sins; they have been transferred from us
          to the great Saviour, substitute and sacrifice.| And in that day there
          will be none who can put in a demurrer to that plea: it will hold
          good; for God has said, |Whosoever believeth on Christ Jesus shall
          never be condemned.| Then will the actions of the righteous, the
          gracious actions, be brought forth to prove that they had faith. For
          that faith which never evidences itself by good works is a dead faith
          and a faith that will never save a soul. Now, if the dying thief were
          brought up, he would say, |My sins were laid on Jesus.| |Ay, but how
          about your good works? Thou must have some evidence of thy faith,|
          Satan might reply. Then would the recording angel say, |The dying
          thief said to his fellow thief who was dying with him, Wherefore art
          thou railing? In his last moments he did what he could; he rebuked the
          thief that was dying with him and made a good confession of his Lord.
          There was the evidence of the sincerity of his faith.| Dear hearer,
          will there lie any evidence of the sincerity of your faith? If your
          faith has no evidence before the Lord, what will you do? Suppose you
          thought you had a faith and went on drinking. Suppose you did as I
          know some have done here, go straight from this place into the public
          house? Or suppose you joined the Christian church and remained a
          drunkard? Ay, and women have done that also as well as men. Suppose
          you professed to have faith in Christ and yet cheated in your weights
          and measures and common dealings? Do you think that God will never
          requite these things at your hands? Oh, sirs, if ye be no better than
          other men in your conduct, ye are no better than other men in your
          character, and ye will stand no better than other men in the judgment
          day. If your actions are not superior to theirs, you may profess what
          you will about your faith, but you are deceived, and, as deceivers,
          you will be discovered at the last great day. If grace does not make
          us differ from other men, it is not the grace which God gives his
          elect. We are not perfect, but all God's saints keep their eyes on the
          great standard of perfection, and, with strong desire, aim to walk
          worthy of their high calling of God and to bring forth works which
          prove that they love God; and if we have not these signs following
          faith, or if they are not put in as evidence for us, at the last great
          day we shall not be able to prove our faith. It will be proof positive
          that you hated God; for a man must hate God indeed who will spurn his
          counsels, give no heed to his reproof, scorn his grace, and dare the
          vengeance of him who points out the way of escape and the path that
          leadeth to life. He that will not be saved by God's mercy proves that
          he hates the God of mercy. If God gives his own Son to die and men
          will not trust in his Son, will not have him as their Saviour, that
          one sin, if they had no other, would at once prove that they were
          enemies of God and black at heart. But if thy faith be in Jesus, if
          thou lovest Jesus, if thy heart goes out to Jesus, if thy life be
          influenced by Jesus, if thou makest him thy example as well as thy
          Saviour, there will be evidence -- thou canst not see it, but there
          will be evidence -- in thy favour. For notice those gracious things,
          when the evidence was brought, and Christ said, |I was an hungry, and
          ye gave me no meat, thirsty and ye gave me no drink,| they said, |O
          Lord, we never knew this.| Should any man stand up here and say, |I
          have plenty of evidence to prove my faith,| I should reply, |Hold your
          tongue, sir! Hold your tongue! I am afraid you have no faith at all,
          or you would not be talking about your evidence.| But if you are
          saying, |Oh, I am afraid I have not the evidence that will stand me in
          good stead at the last,| yet if all the while you have been feeding
          the hungry, and clothing the naked, and doing all you can for Christ,
          I would tell you not to be afraid. The master will find witnesses to
          say, |That man relieved me when I was in poverty. He knew I was one of
          Christ's and he came and helped me.| And another will come and say
          (perhaps it will be an angel), |I saw him when he was alone in his
          chamber and heard him pray for his enemies.| And the Lord will say, |I
          read his heart when I saw how he put up with rebuke, and slander, and
          persecution, and would not make any answer for my sake. He did it all
          as evidence that my grace was in his heart.| You will not have to
          fetch up the witnesses: the judge will call them, for he knows all
          about your case; and as he calls up the witness, will be surprised to
          find how even the ungodly will be obliged to consent to the just
          salvation of the righteous. Oh, how the secret deeds and the true
          heart-sincerity of the righteous, when thus unveiled, will make devils
          bite their tongues in wrath to think that there was so much of grace
          given to the sons of men, with which to defeat persecution, to
          overcome temptation, and to follow on in obedience to the Lord. Oh
          yes, the deeds, the deeds, the deeds of men -- not their prating, not
          their profession, not their talk, but their deeds (though nobody shall
          be saved by the merits of his deeds) -- their deeds shall be the
          evidence of their grace, or their deeds shall be the evidence of their
          unbelief; and so, by their works shall they stand before the Lord, or
          by their world shall they be condemned as evidence and nothing more.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Now the last point is this: What is the object of this judgment?
          Will sentence of acquittal and condemnation be given, and then the
          whole thing be over? Far from it. The judgment is with a view to the
          thereafter -- |That every man may receive the things done in his
          body.| The Lord will grant unto his people an abundant reward for all
          that they have done. Not that they deserve any reward, but that God
          first gave them grace to do good works, then took their good works as
          evidence of a renewed heart, and then gave them a reward for what they
          had done. Oh, what a bliss it will be to hear it said, |Well done,
          good and faithful servant,| -- and to find that you have worked for
          Christ when nobody knew it, to find that Christ took stock of it all,
          -- to you that served the Lord under misrepresentation, to find that
          the Lord Jesus cleared the chaff away from the wheat, and knew that
          you were one of his precious ones. For him, then, to say, |Enter into
          the joy of thy Lord,| oh, what a bliss will it be to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to the ungodly how terrible. They are to receive the things that
          they have done; that is to say, the punishment due, -- not every man
          alike, but the greater sinner the greater doom; to the man who sinned
          against light a greater damnation than to the man who had not the same
          light, -- Sodom and Gomorrah their place, Tyre and Sidon their place,
          and then to Capernaum and Bethsaida their place of more intolerable
          torment, because they had the Gospel and rejected it -- so the Lord
          himself tells us. And the punishment will not only be meted out in
          proportion to the transgression, but it will be a development of the
          evil actions done in the evil consequences to be endured, as every man
          shall eat the fruit of his own ways. Sin, after the natural order,
          ripens into sorrow. This is not a blind fate, but it is the operation
          of a divine law, wise and invariable. Oh, how dreadful it will be for
          the malicious man to have for ever to gnaw his own envious heart, to
          find his malice come home to him, as birds come home to roost, to hoot
          for ever in his own soul; for the lustful man to feel lust burning in
          every vein, which he can never gratify; -- for the drunkard to have a
          thirst, which not even a drop of water can allay; -- for the glutton
          who has fared sumptuously every day, to be in hunger perpetually; and
          the soul that has been wrathful to be for ever wrathful, with the fire
          of wrath for ever burning like a volcano in his soul; and the rebel
          against God for ever a rebel, cursing God whom he cannot touch, and
          finding his curses come back upon himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no punishment worse than for a man who is sinfully disposed
          to gratify his lusts, to satiate his bad propensities, and to multiply
          and fatten his vices. Only let men grow into what they would be, and
          then see what they would be like! Take away the policemen in some
          parts of London, and give the people plenty of money, and let their do
          just as they like. Last Saturday, it might be, there were half-a-dozen
          broken heads, and wives and children were in one general skirmish.
          Keep those people together: let their vigor continue unimpaired by age
          or decay, while they keep on developing their characters. Why, they
          would be worse than a herd of tigers! Let them give way to their rage
          and anger, with nothing to check their passions; let miserly, greedy
          people for ever go on with their greed. It makes them miserable here,
          but let these things be indulged in for ever, and what worse hell do
          you want? Oh, sin is hell and holiness is heaven. Men will receive the
          things done in their body. If God has made them to love him, they
          shall go on to love him; if God has made them trust him, they shall go
          on to trust in him; if God has made them to be like Christ, they shall
          go on to be like Christ, and they shall receive the things done in
          their body as a reward; but if a man has lived in sin, |he that is
          filthy shall be filthy still|; he that has been unbelieving shall be
          unbelieving still. This, then, shall be the worm that never dieth, and
          the fire which never shall be quenched, to which shall be added the
          wrath of God forever and ever. Oh, that we may have grace every one of
          us to flee to Christ! There is our only safety. Simple faith in Jesus
          is the basis for the character which will evidence at last that you
          are chosen of God. A simple belief in the merit of the Lord Jesus,
          wrought in us by the Holy Spirit, is the rock foundation upon which
          shall he built up, by the same divine hands, the character which shall
          evidence that the kingdom was prepared for us from before the
          foundations of the world. God work in us such a character, for
          Christ's sake. Amen.
