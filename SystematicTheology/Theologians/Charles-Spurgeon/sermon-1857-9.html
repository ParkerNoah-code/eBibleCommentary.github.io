        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.115)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, February 1, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>"Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake." -- Psalm 106:8.</p>
        <p>
          IN LOOKING upon the works of God in creation, there are two questions
          which at once occur to the thoughtful mind, and which must be answered
          before we can procure a clue to the philosophy and science of creation
          itself. The first one is the question of authorship: Who made all
          these things? And the next question is that of design: For what
          purpose were all these things created? The first question, "Who made
          all these things?" is one which is easily answered by a man who has a
          honest conscience and a sane mind, for when he lifts eyes up yonder to
          read the stars, he will see those stars spell out in golden letters
          this word -- God; and when he looks below upon the waves, if his ears
          are honestly opened, he will hear each wave proclaiming, God. If he
          looks to the summits of the mountains, they will not speak, but with a
          dignified answer of silence they seem to say,
        </p>
        <p>"The hand that made us is Divine."</p>
        <p>
          If we listen to the rippling of the freshet at the mountain side, to
          the tumbling of the avalanche, to the lowing of the cattle, to the
          singing of the birds, to every voice and sound of nature, we shall
          hear this answer to the question, "God is our maker; he hath made us,
          and not we ourselves."
        </p>
        <p>
          The next question, as to design -- Why were these things made? -- is
          not so easy to answer, apart from Scripture; but when we look at
          Scripture we discover this fact -- that as the answer to the first
          question is God, so the answer to the second question is the same. Why
          were these things made? The answer is, for God's glory, for his honor,
          and for his pleasure. No other answer can be consistent with reason.
          Whatever other replies men may propound, no other can be really sound.
          If they will for one moment consider that there was a time when God
          had no creatures -- when he dwelt alone, the mighty maker of ages,
          glorious in an uncreated solitude, divine in his eternal loneliness --
          "I am and there is none beside me" -- can any one answer this question
          -- Why did God make creatures to exist? -- in any other way than by
          answering it thus: "He made them for his own pleasure and for his own
          glory." You may say he made them for his creatures; but we answer,
          there were then no creatures to make them for. We admit that the
          answer may be a sound one now. God makes the harvest for his
          creatures; he hangs the sun in the firmament to bless his creatures
          with light and sunshine; he bids the moon walk I her course by night,
          to cheer the darkness of his creatures upon earth. But the first
          answer, going back to the origin of all things, can be nothing else
          than this: "For his pleasure they are and were created." "He made all
          things for himself and by himself."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, this which holds good in the works of creation, holds equally
          good in the works of salvation. Lift up your eyes on high; higher than
          those stars which glimmer on the floor of heaven; look up, where
          spirits in white, clearer than light, shine like stars in their
          magnificence; look there, where the redeemed with their choral
          symphonies "circle the throne of God rejoicing," and put this
          question: "Who saved those glorified beings, and for what purpose were
          they saved." We tell you that the same answer must be given as we have
          previously given to the former question -- "He saved them -- he saved
          them for his name's sake." The text is an answer to the two great
          questions concerning salvation: Who saved men, and why are they saved?
          "He saved them for his name's sake."
        </p>
        <p>
          Into this subject I shall endeavour to look this morning. May God make
          it profitable to each of us, and may we be found among the number who
          shall be saved "for his name's sake." Treating the text verbally --
          and that is the way most will understand -- here are four things.
          First, a glorious Saviour -- "He saved them;" secondly, a favored
          people -- "He saved them;" thirdly a divine reason why he saved them
          -- "for his names sake;" and fourthly, an obstruction conquered, in
          the word "nevertheless," implying that there was some difficulty that
          was removed. "Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake." A
          Saviour; the saved; the reason; the obstruction removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, here is A GLORIOUS SAVIOUR -- "He saved them." Who is
          to be understood by that pronoun "he?" Possibly man of my hearers may
          answer, "Why, the Lord Jesus Christ is the Saviour of men." Right, my
          friends; but not all the truth. Jesus Christ is the Saviour; but not
          more so than God the Father, or God the Holy Ghost. Some persons who
          are ignorant of the system of divine truth think of God the Father as
          being a great Being full of wrath, and anger, and justice, but having
          no love, they think of God the Spirit perhaps as a mere influence
          proceeding from the Father and the Son. Now, nothing can be more
          incorrect than such opinions. It is true the Son redeems me, but then
          the Father gave the Son to die for me, and the Father chose me in the
          everlasting election of his grace. The Father blots out my sin; the
          Father accepts me and adopts me into his family through Christ. The
          Son could not save without the Father any more than the Father without
          the Son; and as for the Holy Spirit, if the Son redeems, know ye not
          that the Holy Ghost regenerates? It is he that makes us new creatures
          in Christ, who begets us again unto a lively hope, who purifies our
          soul, who sanctifies our spirit, and who, at last, presents us
          spotless and faultless before the throne of the Most High, accepted in
          the beloved. When thou sayest, "Saviour," remember there is a Trinity
          in that word -- the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, this Saviour
          being three persons under one name. Thou canst not be saved by the Son
          without the Father, nor by the Father without the Son, nor by Father
          and Son without the Spirit. But as they are one in creation, so are
          they one in salvation, working together in one God for our salvation,
          and unto that God be glory everlasting, world without end, Amen.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, note here, how this Divine being claims salvation wholly to
          himself. "Nevertheless HE saved them." But, Moses, where art thou?
          Didst not thou save them, Moses? Thou didst stretch the rod over the
          sea, and it clave in halves; thou didst lift up thy prayer to heaven,
          and the frogs came, and the flies swarmed, and the water was turned
          into blood, and the hail smote the land of Egypt. Was not thou their
          Saviour, Moses? And thou Aaron, thou didst offer the bullocks which
          God accepted; thou didst lead them, with Moses, through the
          wilderness. Wast not thou their Saviour? They answer, "Nay, we were
          the instruments, but he saved them. God made use of us, but unto his
          name be all the glory, and none unto ourselves." But, Israel, thou
          wast a strong and mighty people; didst not thou save thyself? Perhaps
          it was by thine own holiness that the Red Sea was dried up; perhaps
          the parted floods were frighted at the piety of the saints that stood
          upon their margin; perhaps it was Israel that delivered itself. Nay,
          nay, saith God's Word; he saved them; they did not save themselves,
          nor did their fellow-men redeem them. And yet, mark you, there are
          some who dispute this point, who think that men save themselves, or,
          at least, that priests and preachers can help to do it. We say that
          the preacher, under God, may be the instrument of arresting man's
          attention, of warning him and arousing him; but the preacher is
          nothing; God is everything. The most mighty eloquence that ever
          distilled from the lips of seraphic preacher is nothing apart from
          God's Holy Spirit. Neither Paul, nor Apollos, nor Cephas, are
          anything: God gave the increase and God must have al the glory. There
          are some we meet with here and there who say, "I am Mr. So-and-so's
          convert; I am a convert of the Rev. Dr. this or that." Well, if you
          are, sir, I cannot give you much hope of heaven. Only God's converts
          go there; not proselytes of man, but the redeemed of the Lord. Oh, it
          is very little to convert a man to our own opinions; it is something
          to be the means of converting him to the Lord our God. I had a letter
          some time ago from a good Baptist minister in Ireland, who very much
          wanted me to cover over to Ireland, as he said, to represent the
          Baptist interest, because it was low there, and perhaps it might lead
          the people to think a little more of Baptists. I told him I would not
          go across the street merely to do that, much less would I cross the
          Irish Channel. I should not think of going to Ireland for that; but if
          I might go there to make Christians, under God, and be the means of
          bringing men to Christ, I would leave it to them what they should be
          afterwards, and trust to God's Holy Spirit to direct and guide them as
          to what denomination they should consider nearest akin to God's truth.
          Brethren, I might make all of you Baptists, perhaps, and yet you would
          be none the better for it; I might convert you all in that way, but
          such a conversion would be that you would be washed to greater stains,
          converted into hypocrites, and not into saints. I have seen something
          of wholesale conversion. Great revivalists have rise up; they have
          preached thundering sermons that have made men's knees knock together.
          "What a wonderful man!" people have said. "He has converted so many
          under one sermon." But look for his converts in a month, and where
          will they be? You will see some of them in the alehouse, you will hear
          others of them swear, you will find many of them rogues, and cheats,
          because they were not God's converts, but only man's. Brethren, if the
          work be done at all, it must be done of God, for if God do not convert
          there is nothing done that shall last, and nothing that shall be of
          any avail for eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          But some reply, "Well, sir, but men convert themselves." Yes, they do,
          and a fine conversion it is. Very frequently they convert themselves.
          But then that which man did, man undoes. He who converts himself one
          day, unconverts himself the next; he tieth a knot which his own
          fingers can loosen. Remember this -- you may convert yourselves a
          dozen times over, but "that which is born of the flesh is flesh," and
          "cannot see the kingdom of God." It is only "that which is born of the
          Spirit" that "is Spirit," and is therefore able to be gathered at last
          into the spirit-realm, where only spiritual things can be found before
          the throne of the Most High. We must reserve this prerogative wholly
          to God. If any man state that God is not Creator, we call him infidel;
          if any man entrench upon this doctrine, that God is the absolute Maker
          of all things, we hiss him down in a moment; but he is an infidel of
          the worst kind, because more specious, who puts God out of the mercy
          throne, instead of putting him out of the creation throne, and who
          tells men that they may convert themselves, whereas God doth it all.
          "He" only, the great Jehovah -- Father, Son, and Holy Ghost -- "he
          saved them for his name's sake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus have I endeavoured to set out clearly the first truth of the
          divine and glorious Saviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, secondly, THE FAVORED PEOPLE -- "He saved them." Who are
          they? You will reply, "They were the most respectable people that
          could be found in the world; they were a very prayerful, loving, holy,
          and deserving people; and, therefore, because they were good he saved
          them." Very well, that is your opinion, I will tell you what Moses
          says, -- "Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they
          remembered not the multitudes of thy mercies; but provoked him at the
          sea, even at the Red Sea. Nevertheless he saved them." Look at the 7th
          verse, and you will have their character. In the first place, they
          were a stupid people -- "Our fathers understood not thy wonders in
          Egypt." In the next place, they were an ungrateful people -- "they
          remembered not the multitude of thy mercies." In the third place, they
          were a provoking people -- "they provoked him at the sea, even at the
          Red Sea." Ah, these are the people whom free grace saves, these are
          the men and these the woman whom the God of all grace condescends to
          take to his bosom and to make anew.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, first, that they were a stupid people. God sends his gospel not
          always to the wise and prudent, but unto fools;
        </p>
        <p>"He takes the fool and makes him know</p>
        <p>The wonders of his dying love."</p>
        <p>
          Do not suppose, my hearer, because you are very unlettered and can
          scarcely read -- do not imagine, because you have always been brought
          up in extreme ignorance, and have scarcely learnt to spell your name,
          that therefore you cannot be saved. God's grace can save you, and then
          enlighten you. A brother minister once told me a story of a man who
          was known in a certain village as a simpleton, and was always
          considered to be soft in the head; no one thought he could ever
          understand anything. But one day he came to hear the gospel preached.
          He had been a drunken fellow, having wit enough to be wicked, which is
          a very common kind of wit. The Lord was pleased to bless the word to
          his soul, so that he became a changed character; and what was the
          marvel of all was, his religion gave him a something which began to
          develop his latent faculties. He found he had a something to live for,
          and he began to try what he could do. In the first place he wanted to
          read his Bible, that he might read his Saviour's name; and after much
          hammering and spelling away, at last he was able to read a chapter.
          Then he was asked to pray at a prayer-meeting; here was an exercise of
          his vocal powers. Five or six words made up his prayer, and down he
          sat abashed. But by continually praying in his own family at home, he
          came to pray like the rest of the brethren, and he went on till he
          became a preacher, and, singularly enough, he had a fluency -- a depth
          of understanding and a power of thought, such as are seldom found
          among ministers who only occasionally occupy pulpits. Strange it was,
          that grace should even tend to develop his natural powers, giving him
          an object, setting him devoutly and firmly upon it, and so bringing
          out all his resources that they were fully shown. AH, ignorant ones,
          ye need not despair. He saved them; not for their sakes -- there was
          nothing in them why they should be saved. He saved them, not for their
          wisdom's sake; but, ignorant though they were, understanding not the
          meaning of his miracles, "he saved them for his name's sake."
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, again, they were a very ungrateful people, and yet he saved
          them. He delivered them times without number, and worked for them
          mighty miracles; but they still rebelled. Ah, that is like you, my
          hearer. You have had many deliverances from the borders of the grave;
          God has given you house and food day after day, and provided for you,
          and kept you to this hour; but how ungrateful you have been! As Isaiah
          said, "The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib; but my
          people doth not know, Israel doth not consider." How many there are of
          this character, who have favors from God, the history of which they
          could not give in a year; but yet what have they ever done for him?
          They would not keep a horse that did not work for them, nor as much as
          a dog that would not notice them. But here is God; he has kept them
          day by day, and they have done a great deal against him, but they have
          done nothing for him. He has put the bread into their very mouths,
          nurtured them, and sustained their strength, and they have spent their
          strength in defying him, in cursing his name and breaking his Sabbath.
          "Nevertheless he saved them." Some of this sort have been saved. I
          hope I have some here now who will be saved by conquering grace, made
          new men by the mighty power of God's Spirit. "Nevertheless he saved
          them." When there was nothing to recommend them, but every reason why
          they should be cast away for their ingratitude, "Nevertheless he saved
          them."
        </p>
        <p>
          And note, once more, they were a provoking people -- "They provoked
          him at the sea, even at the Red Sea." Ah! how many people there are in
          this world that are a provoking people to God! If God were like man,
          who among us would be here to-day? If we are provoked once or twice,
          up goes the hand. With some men their passion stirs at the very first
          offence; others, who are somewhat more placid will bear offence after
          offence, till at last they say, "there is an end to everything, and I
          can bear that no longer; you must stay it, or else I must stay you!"
          Ah! if God had that temper, where should we be? Well might he say, "My
          thoughts are not as your thoughts; I am God, I change not, or else ye
          sons of Jacob had been consumed." They were a provoking people,
          "nevertheless he saved them." Have you provoked him? Take heart, if
          you repent, God has promised to save you; and what is more, he may
          this morning give you repentance, and even give you remission of sins,
          for he saves provoking people for his name's sake. I hear one of my
          hearers say, -- "Well, sir, that is encouraging sin with a vengeance!"
          Is it, indeed, sir! Why? "Because you are talking to the very worst of
          men, and you are saying that they may yet be saved." Pray, sirs, when
          I spoke to the worst of men, did I speak to you or not? You say, "No;
          I am one of the most respectable and best of men." Well then, sir, I
          have no need to preach to you, for you think you do not need mercy.
          "The whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick." But
          these poor people, whom you say I am encouraging in sin, need to be
          spoken to. I will leave you. Good morning to you! You keep to your own
          gospel, and I wonder whether you will find your way to heaven by it.
          Nay, I do not wonder, I know you will not, unless you are brought as a
          poor sinner to take Christ at his word, and be saved for his name's
          sake. But I say farewell to you, and I will keep on in my course. But
          why did you say I encourage men in sin? I encourage them to turn from
          it. I did not say he saved the provoking people, and then let them
          still provoke him as they had done before; I did not say he saved the
          wicked people, and then let them sin as they did before. But you know
          the meaning of the word "saved;" I explained it the other morning. The
          word "saved" does not mean merely taking men to heaven; it means more
          -- it means saving them from their sin; it means giving them a new
          heart, new spirits, new lives; it means making them into new men. Is
          there anything licentious in saying that Christ takes the worst of men
          to make them into saints? If there be, I cannot see it. I only wish he
          would take the worst of this congregation and make them into the
          saints of the living God, and then there would be far less
          licentiousness. Sinner, I comfort thee; not in thy sin, but in thy
          repentance. Sinner, the saints of heaven were once as bad as thou hast
          been. Art thou a drunkard, a swearer, an unclean person? "Such were
          some of them; but they have been washed -- but they have been
          sanctified." Is thy robe black? Ask them whether their robes were ever
          black, they would not have wanted washing, "We have washed our robes,
          and made them white in the blood of the Lamb." Then sinner, if they
          were black, and were saved, why not thyself?
        </p>
        <p>"Are not his mercies rich and free?</p>
        <p>Then say, my soul, why not for thee?</p>
        <p>Our Jesus died upon the tree,</p>
        <p>Then why, my soul, why not for thee?"</p>
        <p>
          Take heart, penitents, God will have mercy on you. "Nevertheless, he
          saved them for his name's sake."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now we come to the third point -- THE REASON OF SALVATION: "He
          saved them for his name's sake." There is no other reason why God
          should save a man, but for his name's sake; there is nothing in a
          sinner which can entitle him to salvation, or recommend him to mercy;
          it must be God's own heart which must dictate the motive why men are
          to be saved. One person says, "God will save me, because I am so
          upright." Sir, he will do no such thing. Says another, "God will save
          me because I am so talented." Sir, he will not. Your talent! Why thou
          drivelling, self-conceited idiot, thy talent is nothing compared with
          that of the angel that once stood before the throne, and sinned, and
          who now is cast into the bottomless pit for ever! If he would save men
          for their talent, he would have saved Satan; for he had talents
          enough. As for thy morality and goodness, it is but filthy rags, and
          he will never save thee for aught thou doest. None of us would ever be
          saved, if God expected anything of us: we must be saved purely and
          solely for reasons connected with himself, and lying in his own bosom.
          Blessed be his name, he saves us for "his name's sake." What does that
          mean? I think it means this: the name of God is his person, his
          attributes, and his nature. For his nature's sake, for his very
          attribute's sake, he saved men; and, perhaps, we may include this
          also, "My name is in him" -- that is, in Christ; he saves us for the
          sake of Christ, who is the name of God. And what does that mean? I
          think it means this:
        </p>
        <p>
          He saved them, first, that he might manifest his nature. God was all
          love, and he wanted to manifest it; he did show it when he made the
          sun, the moon, and the stars, and scattered flowers o'er the green and
          laughing earth. He did show his love when he made the air balmy to the
          body, and the sunshine cheering to the eye. He gives us warmth even in
          winter, by the clothing and by the fuel which he has stored in the
          bowels of the earth; but he wanted to reveal himself still more. "How
          can I show them that I love them with all my infinite heart? I will
          give my Son to die to save the very worst of them, and so I will
          manifest my nature." And God has done it, he has manifested his power,
          his justice, his love, his faithfulness, and his truth; he has
          manifested his whole self on the great platform of salvation. It was,
          so to speak, the balcony on which God stepped to show himself to man
          -- the balcony of salvation -- here it is he manifests himself, by
          saving men's souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did it, again, to vindicate his name. Some say God is cruel; they
          wickedly call him tyrant. "Ah!" says God, "but I will save the worst
          of sinners, and vindicate my name; I will blot out the stigma; I will
          remove the slur: they shall not be able to say that, unless they be
          filthy liars, for I will be abundantly merciful. I will take away this
          stain, and they shall see that my great name is a name of love." And
          said he, again, "I will do this for my name's sake; that is, to make
          these people love my name; but if I take the worst of men, oh, how
          they will love me! If I go and take some of the offscouring of the
          earth, and make them my children, oh, how they will love me! Then they
          will cleave to my name; they will think it more sweet than music; it
          will be more precious to them than the spikenard of the Eastern
          merchants; they will value it as gold, yea, as much fine gold. The man
          who loves me best, is the man who has most sins forgiven: he owes
          much, therefore he will love much." This is the reason why God often
          selects the worst of men to make them his. Saith an old writer, "All
          the carvings of heaven were made out of knots; the temple of God, the
          king of heaven, is a cedar one, but the cedars were all knotty trees
          before he cut them down." He chose the worst, that he might display
          his workmanship and his skill, to make unto himself a name; as it is
          written, "It shall be unto me for a name, for an everlasting sign that
          shall not be cut off." Now, dear hearers, of whatever class you are,
          here is something I have to offer well worthy of your consideration,
          namely -- that if saved, we are saved for the sake of God, for his
          name's sake, and not for our own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now this puts all men on a level with regard to salvation. Suppose
          that in coming into this garden, the rule had been that every one
          should have made mention of my name as the key of admittance; the law
          is, that no man is to be admitted for his rank or title, but only by
          the use of a certain name. Up comes a lord; he makes use of the name
          and comes in; up comes a beggar, all in patches; he makes use of the
          name -- the law says it is only the use of the name that will admit
          you -- he makes use of it and he enters, for there is no distinction.
          So, my lady, if you come, with all your morality, you must make use of
          His name: if you come, poor filthy inhabitant of a cellar or a garret,
          and make use of His name, the doors will fly wide open, for there is
          salvation for every one who makes mention of the name of Christ, and
          for none other. This pulls down the pride of the moralist, abases the
          self exaltation of the self righteous, and puts us all, as guilty
          sinners, on an equal footing before God, to receive mercy at his
          hands, "For his name's sake," and for that reason alone.
        </p>

          IV. I have detained you too long; let me close by noticing the
          OBSTACLES REMOVED in the word "nevertheless." I shall do that in
          somewhat of an interesting form, by way of parable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once on a time, Mercy sat upon her snow-white throne, surrounded by
          the troops of love. A sinner was brought before her, whom Mercy
          designed to save. The herald blew the trumpet, and after three blasts
          thereof, with a loud voice, he said -- "O heaven and earth, and hell,
          I summon you this day to come before the throne of Mercy, to tell why
          this sinner should not be saved." There stood the sinner, trembling
          with fear; he knew that there were multitudes of opponents, who would
          press into the hall of Mercy, and with eyes full of wrath would say,
          "He must not, and he shall not escape, he must be lost!" The trumpet
          was blown, and Mercy sat placidly on her throne, until there stepped
          in one with a fiery countenance; his head was covered with light; he
          spoke with a voice like thunder, and out of his eyes flashed
          lightning! "Who art thou?" said Mercy. He replied, "I am Law; the law
          of God." "And what hast thou to say?" "I have this to say," and he
          lifted up a stony tablet, written on both sides; "these ten commands
          this wretch has broken. My demand is blood; for it is written, The
          soul that sinneth it shall die.' Die he, or justice must." The wretch
          trembles, his knees knock together, the marrow of his bones melts
          within him, as if they were ice dissolved by fire, and he shakes with
          very fright. Already he thought he saw the thunderbolt launched at
          him, he saw the lightning penetrate into his soul, hell yawned before
          him in imagination, and he thought himself cast away for ever. But
          Mercy smiled, and said, "Law, I will answer thee. This wretch deserves
          to die; justice demands that he should perish -- I award thee thy
          claim." And oh! how the sinner trembles. "But there is one yonder who
          has come with me to-day, my king, my Lord; his name is Jesus; he will
          tell you how the debt can be paid, and the sinner can go free." Then
          Jesus spake, and said, "O Mercy, I will do thy bidding. Take me Law;
          put me in a garden; make me sweat drops of blood; then nail me to a
          tree; scourge my back before you put me to death; hang me on the
          cross; let blood run from my hands and feet; let me descend into the
          grave; let me pay all the sinner oweth; I will die in his stead." And
          the Law went out and scourged the Saviour, nailed him to the cross,
          and coming back with his face all bright with satisfaction, stood
          again at the throne of Mercy, and Mercy said, "Law, what hast thou now
          to say?" "Nothing," said he, "fair angel, nothing." "What! not one of
          these commands against him?" "No, not one. Jesus, his substitute, has
          kept them all -- has paid the penalty for his disobedience; and now,
          instead of his condemnation, I demand as a debt of justice that he be
          acquitted." "Stand thou here," said Mercy, "sit on my throne; I and
          thou together will now send forth another summons." The trumpet rang
          again. "Come hither, all ye who have aught to say against this sinner,
          why he should not be acquitted;" and up comes another -- one who often
          troubled the sinner, one who had a voice not so loud as that of the
          Law, but still piercing and thrilling -- a voice whose whispers were
          like the cuttings of a dagger. "Who art thou?" says Mercy. "I am
          Conscience; this sinner must be punished; he has done so much against
          the law of God that he must be punished; I demand it; and I will give
          him no rest till he is punished, nor even then, for I will follow him
          even to the grave, and persecute him after death with pangs
          unutterable." "Nay," said Mercy, "hear me," and while he paused for a
          moment, she took a bunch of hyssop and sprinkled Conscience with the
          blood, saying, "Hear me, Conscience, The blood of Jesus Christ, God's
          Son, cleanseth us from all sin;' Now hast thou ought to say,?" "No,"
          said Conscience, "nothing."
        </p>
        <p>'Covered is his unrighteousness;</p>
        <p>From condemnation he is free.'</p>
        <p>
          Henceforth I will not grieve him; I will be a good conscience unto
          him, through the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ." The trumpet rang a
          third time, and growling from the innermost vaults, up there came a
          grim black fiend, with hate in his eyes, and hellish majesty on his
          brows. He is asked, "Hast thou anything against that sinner?" "Yes,"
          said he, "I have; he has made a league with hell, and a covenant with
          the grave, and here it is signed with his own hand. He asked God to
          destroy his soul in a drunken fit, and vowed he would never turn to
          God; see, here is his covenant with hell!" "Let us look at it," said
          Mercy; and it was handed up, whilst the grim fiend looked at the
          sinner, and pierced him through with his black looks. "Ah! but," said
          Mercy, "this man had no right to sign the deed; a man must not sign
          away another's property. This man was bought and paid for long
          beforehand; he is not his own; the covenant with death is disannulled,
          and the league with hell is rent in pieces. Go thy way Satan," "Nay,"
          said he, howling again, "I have something else to say: that man was
          always my friend; he listened ever to my insinuations; he scoffed at
          the gospel; he scorned the majesty of heaven; is he to be pardoned,
          whilst I repair to my hellish den, for ever to bear the penalty of
          guilt?" Said Mercy, "Avaunt, thou fiend; these things he did in the
          days of his unregeneracy; but this word nevertheless' blots them out.
          Go thou to thy hell; take this for another lash upon thyself -- the
          sinner shall be pardoned, but thou -- never, treacherous fiend!" And
          then Mercy, smilingly turning to the sinner, said, "Sinner, the
          trumpet must be blown for the last time!" Again it was blown, and no
          one answered. Then stood the sinner up, and Mercy said, "Sinner ask
          thyself the question -- ask thou of heaven, of earth, of hell --
          whether any can condemn thee?" And the sinner stood up, and with a
          bold loud voice said, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's
          elect?" And he looked into hell, and Satan lay there, biting his iron
          bonds; and he looked on earth, and earth was silent; and in the
          majesty of faith the sinner did even climb to heaven itself, and he
          said, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? God?' And
          the answer came, "No; he justifieth." "Christ?" Sweetly it was
          whispered, "No; he died." Then turning round, the sinner joyfully
          exclaimed, "Who shall separate me from the love of God, which is in
          Christ Jesus our Lord." And the once condemned sinner came back to
          Mercy; prostrate at her feet he lay, and vowed henceforth to be hers
          for ever, if she would keep him to the end, and make him what she
          would desire him to be. Then no longer did the trumpet ring, but
          angels rejoiced, and heaven was glad, for the sinner was saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, you see, I have what is called, dramatized the thing; but I
          don't care what it is called; it is a way of arresting the ear, when
          nothing else will. "Nevertheless;" there is the obstruction taken
          away! Sinner, whatever be the "nevertheless," it shall never the less
          abate the Saviour's love; not the less shall it ever make it, but it
          shall remain the same.
        </p>
        <p>"Come, guilty soul, and flee away</p>
        <p>To Christ and heal thy wounds;</p>
        <p>This is the glorious gospel-day,</p>
        <p>Wherein free grace abounds.</p>
        <p>Come to Jesus, sinner, come."</p>
        <p>
          On thy knee weep out a sorrowful confession; look to his cross, and
          see the substitute; believe, and live. Ye almost demons, ye that have
          gone farthest in sin, now, Jesus says, "If you know your need of me,
          turn unto me, and I will have mercy upon you: and to our God, for he
          will abundantly pardon."<br />
