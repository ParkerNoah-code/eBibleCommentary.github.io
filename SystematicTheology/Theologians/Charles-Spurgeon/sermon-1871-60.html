        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1027)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's Day Morning, December 31st, 1871, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>"The joy of the Lord is your strength." -- Nehemiah 8:10.</p>
        <p>
          "And the singers sang aloud, with Jezrahiah their overseer. Also that
          day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them
          rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so
          that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off." -- Nehemiah
          12:42-43.
        </p>
        <p>
          LAST Sabbath day in the morning I spoke of the birth of our Saviour as
          being full of joy to the people of God, and, indeed, to all nations.
          We then looked at the joy from a distance; we will now in
          contemplation draw nearer to it, and perhaps as we consider it, and
          remark the multiplied reasons for its existence, some of those reasons
          may operate upon our own hearts, and we may go out of this house of
          prayer ourselves partakers of the exceeding great joy. We shall count
          it to have been a successful morning if the people of God are made to
          rejoice in the Lord, and especially if those who have been bowed down
          and burdened in soul shall receive the oil of joy for mourning. It is
          no mean thing to comfort the Lord's mourners; it is a work specially
          dear to the Spirit of God, and, therefore, not to be lightly esteemed.
          Holy sorrow is precious before God, and is no bar to godly joy. Let it
          be carefully noted in connection with our first text that abounding
          mourning is no reason why there should not speedily be seen an equally
          abundant joy, for the very people who were bidden by Nehemiah and Ezra
          to rejoice were even then melted with penitential grief, "for all the
          people wept when they heard the words of the law." The vast
          congregation before the watergate, under the teaching of Ezra, were
          awakened and cut to the heart; they felt the edge of the law of God
          like a sword opening up their hearts, tearing, cutting, and killing,
          and well might they lament: then was the time to let them feel the
          gospel's balm and hear the gospel's music, and, therefore, the former
          sons of thunder changed their note, and became sons of consolation,
          saying to them, "This day is holy unto the Lord your God; mourn not,
          nor weep. Go your way eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send
          portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy
          unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the Lord is your
          strength." Now that they were penitent, and sincerely turned to their
          God, they were bidden to rejoice. As certain fabrics need to be damped
          before they will take the glowing colours with which they are to be
          adorned, so our spirits need the bedewing of repentance before they
          can receive the radiant colouring of delight. The glad news of the
          gospel can only be printed on wet paper. Have you ever seen clearer
          shining than that which follows a shower? Then the sun transforms the
          rain-drops into gems, the flowers look up with fresher smiles and
          faces glittering from their refreshing bath, and the birds from among
          the dripping branches sing with notes more rapturous, because they
          have paused awhile. So, when the soul has been saturated with the rain
          of penitence, the clear shining of forgiving love makes the flowers of
          gladness blossom all around. The steps by which we ascend to the
          palace of delight are usually moist with tears. Grief for sin is the
          porch of the House Beautiful, where the guests are full of "The joy of
          the Lord." I hope, then, that the mourners, to whom this discourse
          shall come, will discover and enjoy the meaning of that divine
          benediction in the sermon on the mount, "Blessed are they that mourn,
          for they shall be comforted."
        </p>
        <p>
          From our text we shall draw several themes of thought, and shall
          remark: first, there is a joy of divine origin, -- "The joy of the
          Lord;" and, secondly, that joy is to all who partake of it a source of
          strength -- "The joy of the Lord is your strength." Then we shall go
          on to show that such strength always reveals itself practically -- our
          second text will help us there: and we shall close by noticing, in the
          fourth place, that this joy, and, consequently, this strength, are
          within our reach today.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. THERE IS A JOY OF DIVINE ORIGIN -- "The joy of the Lord." Springing
          from the Lord as its source, it will necessarily be of a very elevated
          character. Since man fell in the garden, he has too often sought for
          his enjoyments where the serpent finds his. It is written, "upon thy
          belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life,"
          this was the serpent's doom; and man, with infatuated ambition, has
          tried to find his delight in his sensual appetites, and to content his
          soul with earth's poor dust. But the joys of time cannot satisfy an
          undying nature, and when a soul is once quickened by the eternal
          Spirit, it can no more fill itself with worldly mirth, or even with
          the common enjoyments of life than can a man snuff up wind and feed
          thereon. But, beloved, we are not left to search for joy; it is
          brought to our doors by the love of God our Father; joy refined and
          satisfying, befitting immortal spirits. God has not left us to wander
          among those unsatisfactory things which mock the chase which they
          invite; he has given us appetites which carnal things cannot content,
          and he has provided suitable satisfaction for those appetites; he has
          stored up at his right hand pleasures for evermore, which even now he
          reveals by his Spirit to those chosen ones whom he has taught to long
          for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us endeavour to analyze that special and peculiar pleasure which
          is here called "The joy of the Lord." It springs from God, and has God
          for its object. The believer who is in a spiritually healthy state
          rejoices mainly in God himself; he is happy because there is a God,
          and because God is in his person and character what he is. All the
          attributes of God become well-springs of joy to the thoughtful,
          contemplative believer; for such a man says within his soul, "All
          these attributes of my God are mine: his power, my protection; his
          wisdom, my guidance; his faithfulness, my foundation; his grace, my
          salvation." He is a God who cannot lie, faithful and true to his
          promise; he is all love, and at the same time infinitely just,
          supremely holy. Why, the contemplation of God to one who knows that
          this God is his God for ever and ever, is enough to make the eyes
          overflow with tears, because of the deep, mysterious, unutterable
          bliss which fills the heart. There was nothing in the character of
          Jupiter, or any of the pretended gods of the heathen, to make glad a
          pure and holy spirit, but there is everything in the character of
          Jehovah both to purify the heart and to make it thrill with delight.
          How sweet is it to think over all the Lord has done; how he has
          revealed himself of old, and especially how he has displayed his glory
          in the covenant of grace, and in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
          How charming is the thought that he has revealed himself to me
          personally, and made me to see in him my Father, my friend, my helper,
          my God. Oh, if there be one word out of heaven that cannot be
          excelled, even by the brightness of heaven itself, it is this word,
          "My God, my Father," and that sweet promise, "I will be to them a God,
          and they shall be to me a people." There is no richer consolation to
          be found: even the Spirit of God can bring nothing home to the heart
          of the Christian more fraught with delight than that blessed
          consideration. When the child of God, after admiring the character and
          wondering at the acts of God, can all the while feel "he is my God; I
          have taken him to be mine; he has taken me to be his; he has grasped
          me with the hand of his powerful love; having loved me with an
          everlasting love, with the bands of lovingkindness has he drawn me to
          himself; my beloved is mine and I am his;" why, then, his soul would
          fain dance like David before the ark of the Lord, rejoicing in the
          Lord with all its might.
        </p>
        <p>
          A further source of joy is found by the Christian, who is living near
          to God, in a deep sense of reconciliation to God, of acceptance with
          God, and yet, beyond that, of adoption and close relationship to God.
          Does it not make a man glad to know that though once his sins had
          provoked the Lord they are all blotted out, not one of them remaineth;
          though once he was estranged from God, and far off from him by wicked
          works, yet he is made nigh by the blood of Christ. The Lord is no
          longer an angry judge pursuing us with a drawn sword, but a loving
          Father into whose bosom we pour our sorrows, and find ease for every
          pang of heart. Oh, to know, beloved, that God actually loves us! I
          have often told you I cannot preach upon that theme, for it is a
          subject to muse upon in silence, a matter to sit by the hour together
          and meditate upon. The infinite to love an insignificant creature, an
          ephemera of an hour, a shadow that declineth! Is not this a marvel?
          For God to pity me I can understand, for God to condescend to have
          mercy upon me I can comprehend; but for him to love me, for the pure
          to love a sinner, for the infinitely great to love a worm, is
          matchless, a miracle of miracles! Such thoughts must comfort the soul.
          And then, add to this, that the divine love has brought us believers
          into actual relationship with God, so that we are his sons and
          daughters, this again is a river of sacred pleasure. "Unto which of
          the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son." No minister of
          flame, though perfect in obedience, has received the honour of
          adoption; to us, even to us frail creatures of the dust, is given a
          boon denied to Gabriel, for through Jesus Christ the firstborn, we are
          members of the family of God. Oh! The abyss of joy which lies in
          sonship with God, and joint heirship with Christ! Words are vain here.
          Moreover, the joy springing from the spirit of adoption is another
          portion of the believer's bliss. He cannot be an unhappy man who can
          cry, "Abba, Father." The spirit of adoption is always attended by
          love, joy, and peace, which are fruits of the Spirit; for we have not
          received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but we have received the
          spirit of liberty and joy in Christ Jesus. "My God, my Father." Oh how
          sweet the sound. But all men of God do not enjoy this, say you. Alas!
          we grant it, but we also add that it is their own fault. It is the
          right and portion of every believer to live in the assurance that he
          is reconciled to God, that God loves him, and that he is God's child,
          and if he doth not so live he has himself only to blame. If there be
          any starving at God's table, it is because the guest stints himself,
          for the feast is superabundant. If however, a man comes, and I pray
          you all may, to live habitually under a sense of pardon through the
          sprinkling of the precious blood, and in a delightful sense of perfect
          reconciliation with the great God, he is the possessor of a joy
          unspeakable and full of glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, beloved, this is not all. The joy of the Lord in the spirit
          springs also from an assurance that all the future, whatever it may
          be, is guaranteed by divine goodness, that being children of God, the
          love of God towards us is not of a mutable character, but abides and
          remains unchangeable. The believer feels an entire satisfaction in
          leaving himself in the hands of eternal and immutable love. However
          happy I may be today, if I am in doubt concerning tomorrow, there is a
          worm at the root of my peace; although the past may now be sweet in
          retrospect, and the present fair in enjoyment, yet if the future be
          grim with fear, my joy is but shallow. If my salvation be still a
          matter of hazard and jeopardy, unmingled joy is not mine, and deep
          peace is still out of my reach. But when I know that he whom I have
          rested in hath power and grace enough to complete that which he hath
          begun in me, and for me; when I see the work of Christ to be no
          half-way redemption, but a complete and eternal salvation; when I
          perceive that the promises are established upon an unchangeable basis,
          and are yea and amen in Christ Jesus, ratified by oath and sealed by
          blood, then my soul hath perfect contentment. It is true, that looking
          forward there may be seen long avenues of tribulation, but the glory
          is at the end of them; battles may be foreseen, and woe unto the man
          who does not expect them, but the eye of faith perceives the crown of
          victory. Deep waters are mapped upon our journey, but faith can see
          Jehovah fording these rivers with us, and she anticipates the day when
          we shall ascend the banks of the hither shore and enter into Jehovah's
          rest. When we have received these priceless truths into our souls we
          are satisfied with favour and full of the goodness of the Lord. There
          is a theology which denies to believers this consolation, we will not
          enter into controversy with it, but sorrowfully hint that a heavy
          chastisement for the errors of that system of doctrine, lies in the
          loss of the comfort which the truth would have brought into the soul.
          For my part, I value the gospel not only for what it has done for me
          in the past, but for the guarantees which it affords me of eternal
          salvation. "I give unto my sheep eternal life, and they shall never
          perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my hand."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, beloved, I have not yet taken you into the great deeps of joy,
          though these streams are certainly by no means shallow. There is an
          abyss of delight for every Christian when he comes into actual
          fellowship with God. I spoke of the truth that God loved us, and the
          fact that we are related to him by ties most near and dear; but, oh,
          when these doctrines become experiences, then are we indeed anointed
          with the oil of gladness. When we enter into the love of God, and it
          enters into us; when we walk with God habitually, then our joy is like
          Jordan at harvest time, when it overfloweth all its banks. Do you know
          what it means -- to walk with God -- Enoch's joy; to sit at Jesus'
          feet -- Mary's joy; to lean your head upon Jesus' bosom -- John's
          familiar joy? Oh yes, communion with the Lord is no mere talk with
          some of us. We have known it in the chamber of affliction; we have
          known it in the solitude of many a night of broken rest; we have known
          it beneath discouragements and under sorrows and defamations, and all
          sorts of ills; and we reckon that one dram of fellowship with Christ
          is enough to sweeten an ocean full of tribulation, and that only to
          know that he is near us, and to see the gleaming of his dear eye,
          would transform even hell itself into heaven, if it were possible for
          us to enjoy his presence there. Alas! Ye do not and cannot know this
          bliss, ye who quaff. Your foaming bowls, listening to the sound of
          stringed instruments, ye do not know what this bliss means -- ye have
          not dreamed of it, nor could ye compass it though a man should tell it
          unto you. As the beast in the meadow knows not the far-reaching
          thoughts of him who reads the stars and threads the spheres, so
          neither can the carnal man make so much as a guess of what are the
          joys which God hath prepared for them that love him, which any day and
          every day, when our hearts seek it, he revealeth unto us by his
          Spirit. This is "the joy of the Lord," fellowship with the Father and
          with his Son Jesus Christ. Beloved, if we reach this point, we must
          labour to maintain our standing, for our Lord saith to us "abide in
          me." The habit of communion is the life of happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another form of "the joy of the Lord" will visit us practically every
          day in the honour of being allowed to serve him. It is a joy worth
          worlds to be allowed to do good. To teach a little child his letters
          for Christ, will give a true heart some taste of the joy of the Lord,
          if it be consciously done for the Lord's sake alone. To bear the
          portion to those for whom nothing is prepared, to visit the sick, to
          comfort the mourner, to aid the poor, to instruct the ignorant, any,
          and all of such Christian works, if done in Jesus' name, will in their
          measure array us in Jehovah's joy. And happy are we, brethren, if when
          we cannot work we are enabled to lie still and suffer, for
          acquiescence is another silver pipe through which "the joy of the
          Lord" will come to us. It is sweet to smart beneath God's rod, and
          feel that if God would have us suffer it is happiness to do so, to
          fall back with the faintness of nature, but at the same time with the
          strength of grace, and say, "Thy will be done." It is joy, when
          between the millstones crushed like an olive, to yield nothing but the
          oil of thankfulness; when bruised beneath the flail of tribulation,
          still to lose nothing but the chaff, and to yield to God the precious
          grain of entire submissiveness. Why, this is a little heaven upon
          earth. To glory in tribulations also, this is a high degree of
          up-climbing towards the likeness of our Lord. Perhaps, the usual
          communions which we have with our Beloved, though exceeding precious,
          will never equal those which we enjoy when we have to break through
          thorns and briars to be at him; when we follow him into the wilderness
          then we feel the love of our espousals to be doubly sweet. It is a
          joyous thing when in the midst of mournful circumstances, we yet feel
          that we cannot mourn because The Bridegroom is with us. Blessed is
          that man, who in the most terrible storm is driven -- not from his
          God, but even rides upon the crest of the lofty billows nearer towards
          heaven. Such happiness is the Christian's lot. I do not say that every
          Christian possesses it, but I am sure that every Christian ought to do
          so. There is a highway to heaven, and all in it are safe; but in the
          middle of that road there is a special way, an inner path, and all who
          walk therein are happy as well as safe. Many professors are only just
          within the hedge, they walk in the ditch by the road side, and because
          they are safe there, they are content to put up with all the
          inconveniences of their walk; but he who takes the crown of the
          causeway, and walks in the very centre of the road that God has cast
          up, shall find that no lion shall be there, neither shall any ravenous
          beast go up thereon, for there the Lord himself shall be his
          companion, and will manifest himself to him. You shallow Christians
          who do but believe in Christ, and barely that, whose bibles are
          unread, whose closets are unfrequented, whose communion with God is a
          thing of spasms, you have not the joy of the Lord, neither are you
          strong. I beseech you, rest not as you are, but let your conscious
          feebleness provoke you to seek the means of strength: and that means
          of strength is to be found in a pleasant medicine, sweet as it is
          profitable -- the delicious and effectual medicine of "the joy of the
          Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But time would fail me to prolong our remarks upon this very
          fruitful subject, and we shall turn to our second head, which is this:
          that THIS JOY IS A SOURCE OF GREAT STRENGTH.
        </p>
        <p>
          Very rapidly let us consider this thought. It is so because this joy
          arises from considerations which always strengthen the soul. Very much
          of the depth of our piety will depend upon our thoughtfulness. Many
          persons, after having received a doctrine, put it by on the shelf;
          they are orthodox, they have received the truth, and they are content
          to keep that truth on hand as dead stock. Sirs, of what account can
          this be to you, to store your garners with wheat if you never grind
          the corn for bread, or sow it in the furrows of your fields? He is the
          joyful Christian who uses the doctrines of the gospel for spiritual
          meat, as they were meant to be used. Why, some men might as well have
          a heterodox creed as an orthodox one for all the difference it makes
          to them. Having the notion that they know, and imagining that to know
          sufficeth them, they do not consider, contemplate, or regard the
          truths which they profess to believe, and, consequently, they derive
          no benefit from them. Now, to contemplate the great truths of divine
          election, of eternal love, of covenant engagements, of justification
          by faith through the blood of Christ, and the indwelling and perpetual
          abiding of the Holy Ghost in his people, to turn over these things is
          to extract joy from them; and this also is strengthening to the mind.
          To press the heavenly grapes by meditation, and make the red wine flow
          forth in torrents, is an exercise as strengthening as it is
          exhilarating. Joy comes from the same truths which support our
          strength, and comes by the process of meditation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, "the joy of the Lord" within us is always the sign and symbol
          of strong spiritual life. Holy vivacity betokens spiritual vigour. I
          said that he who had spiritual joy gained it by communion with God,
          but communion with God is the surest fosterer of strength. You cannot
          be with a strong God without getting strength yourself, for God is
          always a transforming God; regarding and looking upon him our likeness
          changes till we become in our measure like our God. The warmth of the
          South of France, of which you often hear so much, does not spring from
          soft balmy winds, but from the sun; at sunset the temperature falls.
          You shall be on one side of the street in Italy and think it May,
          cross the street into the shade and it is cold as January. The sun
          does it all. A man who walks in the sunlight of God's countenance, for
          that very reason is warm and strong. The sunlight of joy usually goes
          with the warmth of spiritual life. As the light of joy varies so does
          the warmth of holy strength; he who dwells in the light of God is both
          happy and strong. He who goes into the shade and loses the joy of the
          Lord becomes weak at the same time. So the joy of the Lord becomes our
          strength, as being an indicator of its rise or fall. When a soul is
          really vigorous and active, it is like the torrent which dashes down
          the mountain side, which scorns in winter to own the bonds of frost:
          in a few hours the stagnant pools and slowly moving streams are
          enchained in ice; but the snow king must bring forth all his strength
          ere he can manacle the rushing torrent. So when a soul dashes on with
          the sacred force of faith, it is hard to freeze it into misery, its
          vigour secures its joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the man who possesses "the joy of the Lord," finds it his
          strength in another respect, that it fortifies him against temptation.
          What is there that he can be tempted with? He has more already than
          the world can offer him as a reward for treachery. He is already rich;
          who shall ensnare him with the wages of unrighteousness? He is already
          satisfied; who is he that can seduce him with pleasing baits? "Shall
          such a man as I flee?" The rejoicing Christian is equally proof
          against persecution. They may well afford to be laughed at who win at
          such a rate as he does. "You may scoff," saith he, "but I know what
          true religion is within my soul, and your scoffing will not make me
          relinquish the pearl of great price." Such a man is, moreover, made
          strong to bear affliction; for all the sufferings put upon him are but
          a few drops of bitterness cast into his cup of bliss, to give a deeper
          tone to the sweetness which absorbs them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such a man becomes strong for service, too. What can he not do who is
          happy in his God? By his God he leaps over a wall, or breaks through a
          troop. Strong is he, too, for any kind of self-sacrifice. To the God
          who gives him all, and remains to him as his perpetual portion, such a
          man gives up all that he hath, and thinks it no surrender. It is but
          laying up his treasure in his own peculiar treasure house, even in the
          God of his salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          A joyous man, such I have now in my mind's eye, is to all intents and
          purposes a strong man. He is strong in a calm restful manner. Whatever
          happens he is not ruffled or disturbed. He is not afraid of evil
          tidings, his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord. The ruffled man is
          ever weak. He is in a hurry, and doth things ill. The man full of joy
          within is quiet, he bides his time and croucheth in the fulness of his
          strength. Such a man, though he is humble, is firm and steadfast; he
          is not carried away with every wind, or bowed by every breeze, he
          knows what he knows, and holds what he holds, and the golden anchor of
          his hope entereth within the veil, and holds him fast. His strength is
          not pretentious but real. The happiness arising from communion with
          God breeds in him no boastfulness; he does not talk of what he can do,
          but he does it; he does not say what he could bear, but he bears all
          that comes. He does not himself always know what he could do; his
          weakness is the more apparent to himself because of the strength which
          the Holy Ghost puts upon him; but when the time comes, his weakness
          only illustrates the divine might, while the man goes calmly on,
          conquering and to conquer. His inner light makes him independent of
          the outward sun; his secret granaries make him independent of the
          outer harvest; his inward fountains place him beyond dread though the
          brook Cherith may dry Up; he is independent of men and angels, and
          fearless of devils; all creatures may turn against him if they please,
          but since God himself is his exceeding joy, he will not miss their
          love or mourn their hate. He standeth where others fall, he sings
          where others weep, he wins where others fly, he glorifies his God
          where others bring dishonour on themselves and on the sacred name. God
          grant us the inward joy which arises from real strength and is so
          linked with it as to be in part its cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But now I must hasten on to notice in the third place that THIS
          STRENGTH LEADS TO PRACTICAL RESULTS. I am sure I shall have your
          earnest attention to this, because in many of you I have seen the
          results follow of which I now speak. I would not flatter any one, but
          my heart has been full of thanksgiving to the God of all grace when I
          have seen many of you rejoicing in the Lord under painful
          circumstances and producing the fruits of a gracious strength. Turn
          then to our second text, and there you shall observe some of the
          fruits of holy joy and pious strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it leads to great praise. "The singers sang aloud," their
          ministrelsy was hearty and enthusiastic. Sacred song is not a minor
          matter. Quaint George Herbert has said --
        </p>
        <p>"Praying's the end of preaching."</p>
        <p>
          Might he not have gone further and have said, praising's the end of
          praying? After all, preaching and praying are not the chief end of
          man, but the glorifying of God, of which praising God vocally is one
          form. Preaching is sowing, prayer is watering, but praise is the
          harvest. God aims at his own glory so should we; and "whoso offereth
          praise glorifieth me saith the Lord." Be ye diligent then to sing his
          praises with understanding. We have put away harps and trumpets and
          organs, let us mind that we really rise above the need of them. I
          think we do well to dispense with these helps of the typical
          dispensation; they are all inferior even in music to the human voice,
          there is assuredly no melody or harmony like those created by living
          tongues; but let us mind that we do not put away an atom of the joy.
          Let us be glad when in the congregation we unite in psalmody. It is a
          wretched thing to hear the praises of God rendered professionally, as
          if the mere music were everything. It is horrible to have a dozen
          people in the table-pew singing for you, as if they were proxies for
          the whole assembly. It is shocking to me to be present in places of
          worship where not a tenth of the people ever venture to sing at all,
          and these do it through their teeth so very softly, that one had need
          to have a mircroscope invented for his ears, to enable him to hear the
          dying strain. Out upon such mumbling and murdering of the praises of
          God; if men's hearts were joyous and strong, they would scorn such
          miserable worship. In this house we all try to sing, but might we not
          have more praise services? We have had a praise meeting every now and
          then. Ought we not to hold a praise meeting every week? Should not the
          prayer meeting be more than ever cheered by praise. The singing of
          God's people should be, and if they were more full of divine strength
          would be, more constant and universal. How sinners chant the praise of
          Baechus in the streets! You can hardly rest in the middle of the
          night, but what unseemly sounds of revelry startle you. Shall the
          votaries of wine sing so lustily, and shall we be silent? We are not
          often guilty of disturbing the world with our music; the days in which
          Christian zeal interfered with the wicked seem to have gone by; we
          have settled down into more orderliness, and I am afraid also into
          more lukewarmness. Oh for the old Methodistic shout. Brethren, wake up
          your singing again. May the Lord give us again a singing-time, and
          make us all praise him with heart, and with voice, till even the
          adversaries shall say, "The Lord hath done great things for them;" and
          we shall reply, "Ay, ye speak the truth; he hath done great things for
          us, whereof we are glad." Perhaps there has not been so large a
          blessing upon the churches of England, because they have not rendered
          due thanksgiving. In all the time in which we are in trouble we are
          anxious and prayerful; when a prince is sick bulletins are issued
          every hour or so; but ah, when the mercy comes but few bulletins are
          put out, calling upon us to bless and praise the name of God for his
          mercies. Let us praise the Lord from the rising of the sun unto the
          going down of the same, for great is the Lord, and greatly is he to be
          praised.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next result is great sacrifice. "That day they offered great
          sacrifices and rejoiced." What day is that in which the church of God
          now makes great sacrifices? I have not seen it in the calendar of
          late; and, alas! If men make any sacrifice they very often do so in a
          mode which indicates that they would escape the inflection if they
          could. Few make great sacrifices and rejoice. You can persuade a man
          to give a considerable sum; a great many arguments at last overcome
          him, and he does it because he would have been ashamed not to do it,
          but in his heart he wishes you had not come that way, and had gone to
          some other donor. That is the most acceptable gift to God which is
          given rejoicingly. It is well to feel that whatever good your gift may
          do to the church, or the poor, or the sick, it is twice as much
          benefit to you to give it. It is well to give, because you love to
          give; as the flower which pours forth its perfume because it never
          dreamed of doing otherwise; or like the bird which quivers with song,
          because it is a bird and finds a pleasure in its notes; or like the
          sun which shines, not by constraint, but because, being a sun, it must
          shine; or like the waves of the sea which flash back the brilliance of
          the sun, because it is their nature to reflect and not to hoard the
          light. Oh, to have such grace in our hearts that we shall joyfully
          make sacrifices unto our God. The Lord grant that we may have much of
          this; for the bringing of the tithes into the storehouse is the way to
          the blessing; as saith the Scripture: "Bring ye all the tithes into
          the storehouse, that there may be meat in thine house, and prove me
          now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the
          windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not
          be room enough to receive it."
        </p>
        <p>
          Next to that, there are sure to follow other expressions of joy. They
          "rejoiced, for God had made them to rejoice with great joy." It was
          not all singing and giving. When the wheels of the machine are well
          oiled the whole machine goes easily; and when the man has the oil of
          joy, then in his business, and in his family, the wheels of his nature
          glide along sweetly and harmoniously, because he is a glad and a happy
          man. There are some professors who imagine the sorrow of the Lord to
          be their strength; they glory in the spirit of bondage and in an
          unbelieving experience, having great acquaintance with the corruption
          of their hearts, sometimes of a rather too practical character. They
          make the deformities of the saints to be their beauty-spots, and their
          faults to be their evidences. Such men denounce all who rejoice in the
          Lord, and only tolerate the unbelieving. Their strength lies in being
          able to take you through all the catacombs of nature's darkness, and
          to show you the rottenness of their evil hearts. Well, such strength
          as that let those have who will, but we are persuaded that our text is
          nearer to wisdom: "The joy of the Lord is your strength." While we
          know something of our corruption, and mourn it, know something of the
          world's troubles, and sometimes lament as we bear them; yet there is a
          joy in the perfect work of Christ, and a joy in our union to him which
          uplifts us far above all other considerations. God becomes to us such
          a strength that we cannot help showing our joy in our ordinary life.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then the text tells us that holy joy leads to family happiness.
          "The wives also and the children rejoiced." It is so in this church. I
          have lately seen several children from households which God has
          blessed, and I have rejoiced to see that father and mother know the
          Lord, and that even the last of the family has been brought to Jesus.
          O happy households where the joy is not confined to one, but where all
          partake of it. I dislike much that Christianity which makes a man
          feel, "If I go to heaven it is all I care for." Why, you are like a
          German stove which I found in the room of an hotel the other day -- a
          kind of stove which required all the wood they could bring up merely
          to warm itself, and then all the heat went up the chimney. We sat
          around it to make it warm, but scarce a particle of heat came forth
          from it to us. Too many need all the religion they can get to cheer
          their own hearts, and their poor families and neighbours sit shivering
          in the cold of ungodliness. Be like those well constructed stoves of
          our own houses, which send out all the heat into the room. Send out
          the heat of piety into your house, and let all the neighbours
          participate in the blessing, for so the text finishes, "The joy of
          Jerusalem was heard afar off." The joy of the Lord should be observed
          throughout our neighbourhood, and many who might otherwise have been
          careless of true religion will then enquire, "What makes these people
          glad, and creates such happy households?" Your joy shall thus be God's
          missionary.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And now I have to close. THIS JOY, THIS STRENGTH, ARE BOTH WITHIN
          OUR REACH! "For the Lord had made them glad with great joy." God alone
          can give us this great joy. Then it is within the reach of any, for
          God can give it to one as well as to another. If it depended upon our
          good works or our natural abilities, some of us could never reach it;
          but if God is the source and giver of it he may give it to me as well
          as to thee, my brother, and to thee as well as to another. What was
          the way in which God gave this joy? Well first, he gave it to these
          people by their being attentive hearers. They were not only hearers,
          but they heard with their ears, their ears were into the word; it was
          read to them and they sucked it in, receiving it into their souls. An
          attentive hearer is on the way to being a joyous receiver. Having
          heard it they felt the power of it, and they wept. Did that seem the
          way to joy? It was. They received the threatenings of the law with all
          their terrors into their soul, they allowed the hammer of the word to
          break them in pieces, they submitted themselves to the word of
          reproof. Oh! That God would incline you all to do the same, for this,
          again, is the way in which God gives joy. The word is heard, the word
          is felt. Then after this, when they had felt the power of the word, we
          see that they worshipped God devoutly. They bowed the head. Their
          postures indicated what they felt within. Worshippers who with
          penitent hearts really adore God, will never complain of weary
          Sabbaths; adoration helps us into joy. He who can bow low enough
          before the throne shall be lifted as high before that throne as his
          heart can desire.
        </p>
        <p>
          We read also that these hearers and worshippers understood clearly
          what they heard. Never be content with hearing a sermon unless you can
          understand it, and if there be a truth that is above you, strain after
          it, strive to know it. Bible-reader, do not be content with going
          through the words of the chapter: pray the Holy Ghost to tell you the
          meaning, and use proper means for finding out that meaning; ask those
          who know, and use your own enlightened judgment to discover the sense.
          When shall we have done with formalism of worship and come into living
          adoration? Sometimes, for all the true singing that there is, the song
          might as well be in Latin or in Greek. Oh! To know what you are
          singing, to know what you are saying in prayer, to know what you are
          reading, to get at it, to come right into it, to understand it -- this
          is the way to holy joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          And one other point. These people when they had understood what they
          had devoutly heard, were eager to obey. They obeyed not only the
          common points of the law in which Israel of old had furnished them
          with examples, but they found out an old institution which had been
          buried and forgotten. What was that to them; God had commanded it, and
          they celebrated it, and in so doing this peculiar joy came upon them.
          Oh, for the time when all believers shall search the word of God, when
          they shall not be content with saying, "I have joined myself with a
          certain body of Christians, and they do so; therefore I do so." May no
          man say to himself any longer, "Such is the rule of my church;" but
          may each say, "I am God's servant and not the servant of man, not the
          servant of thirty-nine articles, of the Prayer-book, or the Catechism;
          I stand to my own Master, and the only law book I acknowledge is the
          book of his word, inspired by his Spirit." Oh, blessed day, when every
          man shall say, "I want to know wherein I am wrong; I desire to know
          what I am to do; I am anxious to follow the Lord fully." Well, then,
          if your joy in God leads you to practical obedience, you may rest
          assured it has made you strong in the very best manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved brethren and sisters, we had, before I went away for needed
          rest, a true spirit of prayer among us. I set out for the continent
          joyfully, because I left with you the names of some eighty persons
          proposed for church-membership. My beloved officers, with great
          diligence, have visited these and others, and next Lord's-day we hope
          to receive more than a hundred, perhaps a hundred and twenty fresh
          members into the church. Blessed be God for this. I should not have
          felt easy in going away if you had been in a barren, cold, dead state;
          but there was a real fire blazing on God's altar, and souls were being
          saved. Now, I desire that this gracious zeal should continue, and be
          renewed. It has not gone out in my absence, I believe, but I desire
          now a fresh blast from God's Spirit to blow the flame very vehemently.
          Let us meet for prayer tomorrow, and let the prayer be very earnest,
          and let those wrestlers who have been moved to agonizing supplication
          renew the ardour and fervency of their desires, and may we be a strong
          people, and consequently a joyous people in the strength and joy of
          the Lord. May sinners in great numbers look unto Jesus and be saved.
          Amen, and Amen.
