        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.2665)</p>
        <p>Intended for Reading on Lord's-Day, March 11th, 1900,</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington,</p>
        <p>On Lord's-day Evening, October 1st, 1882.</p>
        <p>
          "And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house."
          -- Luke 19:9.
        </p>
        <p>
          OBSERVE, DEAR FRIENDS, that our Lord spoke this sentence to Zacchaeus.
          Some of us may have fancied that he said it to the objecting people,
          but he did not. They may have heard it, and their objection may have
          been answered by it, but the main purpose of our blessed Lord, in
          uttering those words, was not to answer objectors, but to comfort one
          who might feel dispirited by their murmuring remark. Therefore, "Jesus
          said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house."
        </p>
        <p>
          It is always better to comfort believers than to answer cavillers. The
          cavillers scarcely deserve a reply, for they are pretty sure to find
          fault again; it is according to their nature to do so. But as for the
          poor distressed people of God, who gladly receive the truth, and yet
          have to endure unkind observations, let these be cheered, for has not
          the Lord himself said, "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people"? Now, what
          could give Zaccheus greater consolation than for the Lord Jesus Christ
          to bear witness to the fact of his salvation. "Jesus said unto him,
          This day is salvation come to this house."
        </p>
        <p>
          I fancy that I can hear some of you say, "We should count it the
          happiest day in our lives if the Lord Jesus would come and tell us
          that salvation had come to us." But, beloved, you cannot have him
          come, in the flesh, to say that to you, for he has gone away, to carry
          on his service elsewhere; among other things, he has gone to prepare a
          place for you who believe in him. But his Spirit is equally divine,
          and he is with as always; and you may have the Spirit of God bearing
          witness with your spirit that you are the children of God. Nay, I
          trust that you not only believe that you may have this witness, but
          that you actually have had it -- you have had that secret, silent,
          inward evidence which no man understands but the one who receives it;
          and you know, in your own soul, that you have passed from death unto
          life, because the Holy Sprit has sealed that truth upon your heart.
          Therefore, dear friend, be joyful; yea, be exceedingly glad. If
          anything can make a man leap for joy, it ought to be the assurance of
          his eternal safety. If salvation has come to your heart, you ought to
          be as happy as an angel; I think that there are some reasons why you
          should be even happier, for an angel cannot know, by personal
          experience, the bliss of having his sins forgiven. You, who have
          realized this wondrous blessing, ought to cause the wilderness and the
          solitary place to resound with the melody of your thanksgiving, and
          with the music of your grateful delight you should make even the
          desert to rejoice and blossom as the rose. Oh, what bliss it is to be
          assured by the Holy Spirit himself that you have passed from death
          unto life, and that salvation has indeed come unto you! May many of
          you enjoy that bliss from this very hour!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let us come directly to the text. "This day," says Christ, "is
          salvation come to this house." You will not forget the outline of the
          sermon, for it is very simple, and one that can be easily remembered.
          First, This day, -- what? Secondly, This day, -- why? Thirdly, This
          day, -- why not?
        </p>
        <p>I. First, THIS DAY, -- WHAT? What about this day?</p>
        <p>
          Christ says, "This day is salvation come to this house." He seemed to
          cut that day out of all the rest of time, and to say concerning it,
          "This day, -- this particular day, -- on this very day, -- is
          salvation come to you." Then, let this day be a holy day, and let it
          be a, holiday; let it be remembered for many a year; yea, let it be
          recollected throughout all time and throughout eternity, too: "this
          day."
        </p>
        <p>
          You know that there are some people who observe certain days which God
          has not ordained to be kept in any special manner. The Galatians did
          so, and therefore Paul wrote to them, "I am afraid of you, lest I have
          bestowed upon you labor in vain." We do not, judge those who act in a
          similar way to-day; but, still, like Paul, we are afraid of them; that
          is to say, we fear they are mistaken in what they do. But there are
          some days which God commanded to be observed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first was, the day when the work of creation was finished,
          concerning which we read, "On the seventh day God ended his work which
          he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which
          he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it:
          because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created
          and made." The completion of the creation, when, "God saw everything
          that he had made, and, behold, it was very good," deserves to be
          remembered. And does not the new creation also deserve to be
          remembered? When the Lord creates in a man a new heart and a right
          spirit, shall we not say, one to another, "This day -- this joyful day
          -- this divine day -- this, new creation day -- is a day to be
          observed very specially"?
        </p>
        <p>
          It is clear, from the practice of the apostles, that the Lord intends
          us to observe the first day of the week, because that was the day of
          Christ's resurrection from the dead, the day of the completion of our
          redemption; and well may we commemorate the complete redemption even
          more than the complete creation. Shall not each saved man specially
          celebrate the day when he was redeemed from sin? Shall he not count it
          worthy to be observed, with holy rites of preaching, praise, and
          prayer, and to be had in grateful remembrance as long as he lives?
          Each believer can say of the Lord's day, "This day, the Lord redeemed
          my soul out of the land of the enemy, and set me free for ever." God
          has appointed but one day to be kept sacred above all others; that is
          the Lord's day. Your Christmas days, and your Good Fridays, and all
          such seasons, are only observed by man's ordinance; but the Sabbath is
          ordained of God, and that is to be observed as the emblem of rest.
          Now, surely, when a man comes into rest, and "we which have believed
          do enter into rest," then that day should be specially observed by
          him. It should become a Sabbath unto the Lord throughout the man's
          whole life, -- that happy day in which salvation came to him. Let,
          then, "this day" stand as a special day in your calendar; mark it with
          a red line, if you like; or mark it with a golden seal, and let it be
          had in remembrance evermore.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord said to Zacchaeus, "This day is salvation come to this
          house." From these Words I learn, first, that salvation is a speedy
          blessing. It can come to a house in a day; nay, more, it can take
          possession of a man's heart in a day; nay, to go further, this great
          work can be "accomplished in a single moment. I suppose that the new
          birth is actually a thing which requires no appreciable period of
          time; -- a flash, and it is done. If a man be dead, and he is restored
          to life:, there may be, in certain respects, a gradual operation upon
          that man, and some time may elapse before he is able to walk; but
          there must be a certain instant in which there is life in the man,
          whereas, a moment before, there was no life in him. The actual
          quickening must be a thing that is instantaneous, so that the working
          of salvation in a man may not only be performed this. day, or this
          hour, or this quarter of an hour, but this minute, or even this
          second. Between light and darkness there is usually a period of
          twilight, and so there is in the soul; but, even in twilight:, there
          is a measure of light, and there must be a moment when the first real
          beam of light begins to smite the ebonite darkness. So there must be a
          moment when grace first enters the soul, and the man, who before was
          graceless, becomes gracious. I think this is a good point to be
          remembered. You poor deluded souls, who hope to save yourselves by
          your own works, will have to keep on throughout your whole lives at
          that useless occupation, and even when you lie dying, you may be sure
          that you are not saved if you have been trusting to your own works.
          But he that believes in Christ Jesus is saved there and then, and he
          can joyfully sing,
        </p>
        <p>"'Tis done! the great transaction's done;</p>
        <p>I am my Lord's, and he is mine."</p>
        <p>
          This is a blessed fact, that salvation can come to a soul this very
          hour; nay, as I have already reminded you, long ere the hand of that
          clock shall have reached the end of this hour, salvation may have
          entered into many hearts that are in this place, as truly as it
          entered into the house of Zacchaeus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, I learn from our text that salvation is a discernible blessing:
          "This day is salvation come to this house." Christ could see it, so
          that it was something which could be seen. Ay, and salvation was also
          seen by Zacchaeus himself, and the fruits of it were soon seen by
          those who were in the house with him. Do not suppose that a man can be
          saved, and yet know nothing about the great change that has been
          wrought in him. It is not every man who can say for certain that he is
          saved, for faith is a thing of growth and assurance may not come at
          once; but when a man is really and completely saved, he has but to use
          the proper means, and he may become absolutely certain of it. God the
          Holy Spirit is willing and waiting to give the full assurance of faith
          and of understanding to those who seek it at his hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, salvation is a perfect blessing: "This day is salvation come to
          this house." Well, but only as late as yesterday, that man had not
          even Seen Jesus. Half an hour ago, he was climbing a tree, like a boy
          might have done, with no wish but just to get a sight of Jesus; and,
          now, is that man saved! "Yes," says Christ, "this day is salvation
          come to this house." "But, surely, you don't talk as positively as
          that concerning a man who came here to-night unsaved, and who has just
          trusted in Jesus. You must mean that he has reached a hopeful stage in
          his experience, and that, after several years, he may perhaps come to
          be really assured that he is a saved man." I mean nothing of the sort;
          I mean just what the text implies, which is that, the moment the Lord
          Jesus Christ crossed the threshold of the house of Zacchaeus, his sins
          were forgiven him, his heart was renewed, his spirit was changed, and
          he was a saved man. "But," someone asks, "is anybody ever saved before
          he dies?" Yes, certainly. Were those persons dead of whom Paul wrote,
          "For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness;
          but unto us which are saved it is the power of God." They were living
          men and women, yet the apostle said that they were saved, and so they
          were. And, at the present moment, here are hundreds of thousands of
          believers in Jesus, upon the face of this earth, who are as truly
          saved now as they will be when they stand before the burning throne of
          God "without spot, or wrinkle or any such thing." In God's judgment,
          by virtue of the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ on whom they are
          resting by faith, they have been delivered from condemnation, they
          have escaped, from the dominion of sin, and, in a word, they are
          saved. So, you see dear friends, that salvation is a perfect blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice, next, that it is a much-containing blessing. A man who
          believes in Christ is saved directly, but he does not fully know how
          much that word "saved" means yet. It is like a big box that comes into
          the house, and you begin to open it, and to take out first one thing
          and then another. "There," you say, "that is all." "Oh, no!" says
          somebody, who looks more carefully, "here is another packet." "Well,
          then, that is surely all; there is nothing but straw now at the bottom
          of the box." You put your hand in, and you cry, "Why! there is
          something more, and something more; what a boxful it is!" And what a
          boxful salvation is! You have no idea what there is in it, not only
          the pardon of sin, but justifying righteousness; not only that, but
          regeneration, a new heart, and a right; spirit; not only that, but
          sanctification, adoption, acceptance, power in prayer, preservation,
          perseverance, victory; -- yea, we are to be more than conquerors
          through him that hath loved us; -- and all that is in the box. Ay, and
          more too; for we are to have a safe and happy departure out of this
          world, and an abundant entrance into the everlasting kingdom of God
          our Father. All that is in the box; and all that had come into the
          house of Zacchaeus when the Lord Jesus Christ came there; and you also
          have all that if you have Christ, for it is all in Christ. You know
          how he said, "All things are delivered unto me of my Father; and Paul
          wrote to the Corinthians, "All things are yours: whether Paul, or
          Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things
          present, or things to come; all are yours; and ye are Christ's; and
          Christ is God's." You will never get to the bottom of that box which
          bears the name "salvation." However great your needs may be, you may
          keep on taking out of it all that you require, and still there shall
          be more left; or, to change the figure, salvation is a springing well,
          from which the more you draw the more there is remaining, for drawn
          wells are always the sweetest, and usually the fullest. So, bring your
          buckets to this great well of gospel grace that is springing up at
          your very feet. Thus, you see that salvation is an all-containing
          blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, next, it is a spreading blessing, for salvation had come to the
          house of Zacchaeus, -- not to himself only, but to his wife, his
          children, and his Servants, I hope it means. I never like to have the
          servants left out, though I am afraid that they often are. You
          servants who live in Christian families, mind that you do not get left
          out; for, remember that Noah, although he was a good man, did not get
          a servant into the ark with him and his family. Recollect Lot also, he
          was a good man of a very poor sort, and he only got his two children
          out of Sodom, and no servant went with them. It is a sad thing when
          you live and labor in the midst of Christian people, and yet you
          yourselves remain unsaved. I hope and believe that, in the case of
          Zacchaeus, all in his house were saved when salvation came there.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, once more, the salvation which had come to the house of
          Zacchaeus, was an abiding blessing, for I never read that it went away
          again. If salvation comes to a man's house, it comes to stay there, as
          Christ said to Zacchaeus, "I must abide at thy house." I can never
          believe in a man being saved for a time, and then falling from grace,
          and having to begin all over again. If he does not hold on his way to
          the end, it is clear that he never was really saved at all. As I have
          often told you, I can understand a man being regenerated:, that is,
          being born again; but then some people tell us that it is possible for
          him, afterwards, to fall away from grace. But what is to become of him
          the next time? Why, I suppose that he must be re-regenerated -- born
          again and again; but I never read, in Scripture, anything of the kind.
          A man may be born again once, but he cannot be born again, and again,
          and again, and again, and again, and again. That cannot be; when the
          work of regeneration is done once, it is done for ever. The work of
          man comes to an end, but the work of God fails not. That which is born
          of God is as immortal as God himself; the new life, that comes into
          the converted man from God, cannot die. How often do we ring in the
          ears of our friends those glorious words of our Lord, "My sheep hear
          my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them
          eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
          them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than
          all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand." Happy
          is the man to whose house salvation comes, for it comes to stay world
          without end.
        </p>
        <p>That must suffice for the first head, This day, -- what?</p>
        <p>
          II. Now, secondly, we are to think of another aspect of the subject,
          that is, THIS DAY, -- WHY? Why had salvation come to the house of
          Zacchaeus that day?
        </p>
        <p>
          I answer, because, that day, Zacchaeus was called by effectual grace;
          and whenever effectual grace comes to anyone, it brings salvation.
          "Wherefore, brethren," as Peter says, "give diligence to make your
          calling and election sure," for these are the "things that accompany
          salvation." If you are sure that you are called of God, you may be
          quite certain that you are saved, for "this day" -- the day in which a
          man is effectually called by grace, this day does salvation come to
          his house. Look, dear friends, God chose his people in his everlasting
          purpose, but salvation did not come to their houses that day. They
          knew nothing of it at that time, for they were not then born. Christ
          redeemed his people when he died on the cross, but salvation did not
          come to their houses that day, for the most of them were not then in
          existence. But, in the fulness of time, the gospel was preached to
          them, and they heard it; yet, in all cases, salvation did not come to
          their houses that day, for though they heard it, they refused it. But
          the moment that effectual grace says. to anyone, "To-day I must abide
          at thy house," that grace at once gains admission, and salvation comes
          there and then to that, man's house. You remember how the apostle Paul
          wrote to the Romans: "Whom he called, them he also justified: and whom
          he justified, them he also glorified." These great blessings are
          joined together, like the links of a chain, and you cannot pull them
          asunder. There is the calling that fits into the justification, and
          the chain is so made that the two links never can be separated. And
          then justification fits into glorification in such a way that you
          cannot possibly part them. It is no use for anyone to try to separate
          them. The devil may pull and hammer as much as ever he likes, but all
          his efforts will be in vain. I have sometimes likened that passage in
          Romans to a vast suspension bridge between earth and heaven: "For whom
          he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image
          of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
          Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he
          called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also
          glorified." If you get your foot firmly resting on that great plank of
          effectual calling, you may be quite sure that you will be able to
          cross all the rest of the bridge, and will most certainly reach the
          other side, and be "for ever with the Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          But how do we know that Zacchaeus was really called? I answer in such
          a way that you may know whether you also are called or not. The call
          of Zaccheus was an effectual call, first, because it was a personal
          call. He was up in the sycomore tree, and he heard Christ call,
          "Zacchaeus." "Why!" he said to himself, "That is my name; he is
          calling me." "Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down." "Then he can see
          that I am up here; his description exactly fits my case." Now, when
          you come and hear me preach the gospel, I try to put the truth before
          you in a clear and very pointed manner. Some people say that it is
          wrong to be personal in preaching, but I always try to be as personal
          as ever I can. Yet I know that many of my hearers pass on to their
          neighbors and friends what I say to them. "Oh! that just fits Mrs.
          So-and-So," says somebody. No, my dear sir, -- it is meant for you,
          but you will not take it home to yourself. But when the Lord Jesus
          Christ himself calls, then the man says, "Dear me! I do not believe
          that the preacher can see me right away here, yet he is speaking
          straight at me; I am sure that he is. How singular! He just mentioned
          something that cannot have occurred to anybody but me; he has exactly
          described my case." Those are the times when God is about to bless the
          soul, -- when the man feels himself picked out from the rest of the
          congregation, and the gospel sharpshooter is just covering him with
          his rifle of grace. I pray that the blessed bullet of the gospel may
          find its billet in the very center of your heart, and bring you down
          at the feet of Jesus as a weeping penitent: "Zacchaeus!" The Lord knew
          that was the name of the man up the sycomore; and he also knows your
          name and your character; and when he means to call you by his
          effectual grace, he will hold your photograph up, and make you say,
          "Yes, that is my portrait; there is nobody else exactly like that."
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, it was a royal call. Jesus said to Zacchaeus, "To-day I must
          abide at thy house." One of our proverbs says, "Must is for the king;"
          and when the King speaks, he must be obeyed. We who are his ministers
          try to be very pressing and urgent; but when the Master himself utters
          the call, where: the word of that King is there is power. I hope he is
          saying to someone here, "To-day I must abide in thy heart." Now you
          have come to the point when you also will have to say, "I must." There
          must be no turning back now, dear friend; you must not say to Christ,
          "Go thy way for this time." No; but you must say, "This time present,
          is the time when I also will say 'must' as Christ says it to me." That
          is an effectual call when it comes as a royal mandate, a warrant from
          the King: "I must."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, next, it was a call which produced immediate obedience. The Lord
          said to Zacchaeus, "Make haste, and come down;" and we read, "He made
          haste, and came down." I think I see him coming down that tree a great
          deal faster than he had gone up; he had not moved at such a rate as
          that for a long while; but he scurried down, for he was told to make
          haste by One whose command compelled him to obey. When the Lord Jesus
          Christ calls any of you effectually, you will not put off your
          decision till the next morning; you will not say, "I will wait till I
          can get home and pray;" you will not even say, "I will wait till the
          end of the service, and then talk with a Christian person;" but your
          prayer will be, "Lord, help me to look to Jesus now. I yield myself up
          to thee this very instant. I am in a hurry about it. Lord, I am making
          haste to get to thee; make haste to come and save me. I would not
          delay a single second longer. I want to be thine alone, and thine at
          once." That is a mark of effectual calling, when immediate obedience
          is given to the call.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another mark in the case of Zacchaeus was, that it was joyful
          obedience; "He made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully."
          0h! the joy of the heart that receives Christ when Christ himself does
          really come to the soul! The moment I believed in Christ, I wanted to
          shout "Hallelujah"; and if I had done so, I think that I might have
          been forgiven. The moment one believes in Christ and knows that his
          sin is all gone, what extravagance would be extravagant under such
          circumstances! Is not the man justified in being joyful when at length
          his iniquity is blotted out, and his transgression is covered? It is a
          mark of effectual calling when we receive Christ joyfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of Zacchaeus, observe that his obedience was complete, for
          Christ said, "To-day I must abide at thy house;" and "he made haste,
          and came down, and received him joyfully" at his house, for the people
          murmured because Christ had gone to be his guest Now, dear friends,
          will you also receive Christ? That is the point. Are you willing to
          let him come unto you, and be your salvation? Are you eager that he
          should come? Do you beg him to Come? Depend upon it, he will come to
          you when you are ready to receive him; but mind you do not trust for
          salvation to anything else or anyone else but Christ. Be satisfied
          with nothing but the everliving Savior to be your Savior from first to
          last.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was yet one more mark of the effectual calling of Zacchaeus, and
          that was that he received Christ in a spiritual sense, for he did not
          only take him into his house, but he took him into his heart. I know
          that he did so because he began at once to purge his heart by driving
          out covetousness. That was a splendid way of getting rid of it when he
          said, "Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor?" Then he
          began to drive put his former grasping habit, for he said, "And if I
          have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him
          fourfold." That was clear evidence that he meant to receive Christ, in
          all his holy, gracious teaching, no merely as a man and a stranger;
          but, spiritually, as his Master, his Ruler, his Teacher, his Guide, --
          in a word, as his Savior.
        </p>
        <p>III. Now, lastly, THIS DAY -- WHY NOT?</p>
        <p>
          And now I change the day altogether, for I mean this very day when I
          am speaking to you, this first of October in the present year of grace
          1882. "This day." This day, -- why not. Why should we not, "this day,"
          give ourselves to Christ. I have tried to think of any reason why a
          man should not give himself up to the Lord Jesus Christ this day, and
          I cannot find one. Then, why should he give himself to Christ this
          day, on this particular day I think I know several reasons why he
          should do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it is late enough. Surely you do not want to wait any longer,
          How old did you say you are, friend? Seventy-six? Eighty-six? What! as
          old as that, and not yet saved? You do not need one like me, so much
          younger, to urge you to speedy decision. Or did you say that you are
          not more than my own age, -- not yet fifty? Well, I find it is quite
          late enough for me. There are certain influences and sensations
          creeping over me, which make me realize that I am somewhat different
          from what I used to be, and I expect it is the same with you. I think
          it is getting rather late in life for you to be still undecided.
          Perhaps some younger person says, "But I am only one-and-twenty."
          Well, that is late enough to be without Christ; it is a thousand
          pities that the devil should have had one-and-twenty years of your
          life. I was converted to the Lord Jesus Christ when I was fifteen, but
          I wish it could have been fifteen years before. Oh, that I had known
          and loved him as soon as I knew an thing, and had lisped his name with
          the first words I ever uttered! I think every Christian will say the
          same. Whatever our age is, the time past may well suffice to have
          wrought the will of he flesh. Do not you think so, my friend? Have not
          you had quite enough of sin? What profit have you ever received from
          it? It is surely quite late enough for you to receive Christ as your
          Savior.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, further, it is late enough in the year. It seems to me, when the
          leaves are falling all around you, as if they all said to you, "We all
          do fade as a leaf." Is it not fully time to seek the Lord? I know of
          no season that seems more suited for pensive thought than just now
          when the year seems to be weeping itself into its tomb, and burying
          itself amid falling leaves. Now is the time to yield yourself to the
          Lord; there cannot be a better period than just now, -- ere yet the
          year is fully gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mercy is, dear friend, that, though it is quite late enough, it is
          not too late for anybody here. There is yet time for you to seek the
          Lord. It is a pity to have put the Lord off until you yourself have
          got into the sere and yellow leaf; but yet there is time to turn unto
          him. What! have you reached the eleventh hour of life? It is late, it
          is very late; but, still, it is not yet too late. It is not yet too
          late even if you are to die this week; and there are some out of this
          great company who will, I suppose, pass into the unseen world this
          week. Dear friend, I know not who you are, but you who stand nearest
          to your eternal destiny, it is not yet too late even for you. I pray
          you, clutch at once at the great mercy now offered to you. God help
          you so to do!
        </p>
        <p>
          Every week, I have to hear of some out of our number who have passed
          away. There have been some this last week, and some whom I certainly
          thought we might have had with us for a long time. They were,
          apparently, in good health, yet now they are to be buried at the
          beginning of the week, for they have gone from us quite suddenly. And
          why may not some of you be the next to be taken! Do not postpone your
          decision any longer; I would that we could say to-night, "This day,
          October 1st, some soul did receive salvation. Let the recording angel
          mark it down." The harvest is not quite over, though I thought it was.
          We down south have almost forgotten it, but there is a farming friend
          up-with us to-day, who said to me, "We have not finished our harvest,
          for we have not got the beans in yet." So, you see, the harvest is not
          quite over, but I do not want you to have to say, The harvest is past,
          the summer is ended, and we are not saved." I would like to get some
          of you to come in with the beans, just with the last crop. Oh, that
          you might be brought to Christ just at this fag end of the harvest!
          The Master is willing that you should come to him even now, so do not
          delay. "To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts."
          "Behold, now is the accepted time: behold, now is the day of
          salvation."
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, also, that to-day is gospel time. Still is Christ preached
          unto you, still is the door of mercy set open before you, still is the
          cry "Come" uttered by the Spirit, and the bride, the Lamb's wife
          echoes it, "Come." Still the water of life is freely flowing for all
          who are willing to receive it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recollect, too, that this is praying time. You are still on praying
          ground; a prayer will find God yet. A traveler tells us that, when he
          was in the East, he saw the procession of a Sultan passing through a
          certain city. The monarch was there, all bedizened with gems and every
          kind of barbaric ornament, and surrounded by his guards. There was a
          poor wretch who wanted to get a petition to the Sultan, and he did not
          know how to manage it. He had no money with which to bribe the
          officials, and he could not force his way through the armed men; so,
          in his desperation, he got near enough to throw the petition down at
          the monarch's feet, but one of the soldiers stuck a spear through it,
          and he held it aloft, and that was the end of it, for the Sultan took
          no notice of the incident, he was much too great a man to attend to
          the petition of his poor subject. It is never so with God. Cast your
          petition, now you may, at his dear feet, he will answer it, and send
          you on your way rejoicing.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are not only on praying ground, for to-night seems to me to be a
          very auspicious season, for it is communion time. God's people are
          presently coming together around his table to remember Christ. Will
          not you also remember him? We are about to receive Christ spiritually
          through the emblems of bread and wine which will et him forth to us.
          Why should not you also receive Christ, in a spiritual fashion, by
          faith, as your Savior? Oh, that you would press through the throng,
          and bow at the feet of Jesus Christ, our Lord! If you do so, he will
          accept you, and again it shall be said, "This day is salvation come to
          this house." God grant it, for Christ's sake! Amen.
        </p>
        <p>Luke 18:35-43; and 19:1-10.</p>
        <p>
          Luke 18:35-39. And it carne to pass, that as he was come nigh unto
          Jericio, a certain blind man sot by the way side begging: and hearing
          the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant. And they told him, that
          Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of
          David, have mercy on me. And they which went before rebuked him, that
          he should hold his peace:
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hush!" they cried; "how can you disturb the blessed Master's
          discourse? Be quiet."
        </p>
        <p>
          39, 40. But he cried so much the more, Thou son of David, have mercy
          on me. And Jesus stood, --
        </p>
        <p>
          Prayer held him fast. Here is a stationary Savior, held in his place
          by the cries of a blind man. Oh, the power of prayer! It stays the
          onward march of the Son of God: "Jesus stood," --
        </p>
        <p>
          40, 41. And commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come
          near, he asked him saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee
          And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a great thing to know what you really do want. There are some
          persons who are so blind that they do not know that they are blind;
          and because they say, "We see," therefore is their blindness the more
          intense. I fear that there is many a person, who professes to pray,
          yet who, if Christ should come into the room, and say, "What wilt thou
          that I shall do unto thee?" would not know how to answer the question.
          This man did; and he said, very briefly, and very clearly, but in a
          very full way, "Lord, that I may receive my sight."
        </p>
        <p>42. And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight:</p>
        <p>
          Often, the blessing from Christ's lip is the echo of the prayer which
          fell from ours. The blind man said, "Lord, that I may receive my
          sight." Echo answered, "Receive thy sight."
        </p>
        <p>
          42, 43. Thy faith hath saved thee. And immediately he received his
          sight, --
        </p>
        <p>
          See, how the prayer, the word of Christ, and the immediate effect of
          it, all tally. "That I might receive my sight." "Receive thy sight."
          "He received his sight."
        </p>
        <p>43. And followed him, --</p>
        <p>Christ likes not blind followers: "and followed him," --</p>
        <p>
          43. Glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise
          unto God.
        </p>
        <p>
          They seemed to be greatly impressed, but we shall see that some of
          them soon spoke in another fashion.
        </p>
        <p>Luke 19:1 And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.</p>
        <p>
          There was to be a miracle at each end of Jericho. Long before, it had
          been cursed; now it was to have a double blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus which was the chief
          among the publicans, --
        </p>
        <p>That is, tax-gatherers --</p>
        <p>2. And he was rich.</p>
        <p>
          As they often were, for they farmed the taxes, and then squeezed every
          farthing they could out of the people.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. And he sought to see Jesus who he was and could not for the press,
          because he was little of stature.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was a fortunate thing for him. We need not all wish to be so tall
          as some people are. Perhaps Zacchaeus would not have gone up the
          sycomore tree if he had been a tall man; but the whole story turns
          upon something which many regard as a disadvantage: "he was little of
          stature."
        </p>
        <p>
          4-7. And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see
          him: for he was to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, he
          looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and
          come down; for to-day I must abide at thy house. And he made haste,
          the came down, and received him joyfully. And when they saw it, they
          all murmured, --
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a great contrast between this verse and the last one in th6
          previous chapter: "All the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto
          God." Here it is, "When they saw it, they murmured." Yet, very likely,
          many of them were the same people; certainly, they were the same sort
          of people that we hear of every now and then: "When they saw it, they
          all murmured." There are far too many of that kind about still; we do
          not quite know who they are, nor where they are, they have a sort of
          nondescript, mysterious existence that finds expression in the words,
          "They say so-and-so and so-and-so." They have been saying something
          about the minister, something about the Sunday-school, something about
          the Bible-class, something about your work and mine. You see, there
          always were such people about, and they always would talk, and their
          talk often took the form of complaining: "When they saw it, they all
          murmured,"
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he had not done so, he could not have gone anywhere, for all men
          are sinners. "All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."
          But this man was a sinner above others, for he had sold himself to the
          hated Roman power, and was authorized to collect the conqueror's taxes
          from his own people; so, of course, in the estimation of the Jews, he
          was the worst kind of sinner that could be found anywhere.

        <p>8. And Zacchaeus stood, --</p>
        <p>And he did not talk at all like a sinner, --</p>
        <p>
          8. And said unto the Lord; Beheld, Lord, the half of my goods I give
          to the poor; --
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of those saints, as they reckoned themselves, had not done
          anything like as much as that: "The half of my goods I give to the
          poor;" --
        </p>
        <p>
          8. And if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I
          restore him fourfold.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which restitution was an act of justice; and when charity and justice
          go hand in hand, what more can we expect of men?

          9, 10. And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this
          house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham. For the Son of man is
          come to seek and to save that which was lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that day he had both sought and saved one of the lost ones, for he
          had found Zacchaeus up in the sycomore tree, and he had brought
          salvation to the tax-gatherer's house. May he do the same for many who
          are here!
