          1. Jehovah reigns: let the earth rejoice, let the great islands be
          glad.2. Clouds and darkness are round about him; righteousness and
          judgment are the habitation of his throne.3. A fire shall go before
          his face, and shall burn up his enemies round about.4. His lightnings
          enlightened the world; the earth shall see, and tremble.5. The hills
          flow down like wax at the presence of Jehovah, at the presence of the
          Lord of the whole earth.

          1 Jehovah reigns His inviting men to rejoice, is a proof that the
          reign of God is inseparably connected with the salvation and best
          happiness of mankind. And, the joy he speaks of being common to the
          whole world and to the regions beyond the seas, it is evident that he
          predicts the enlargement of God's kingdom, which had been confined
          within the narrow boundaries of Judea, to a far wider extent. The
          Psalmist, in setting forth the various particulars of the Divine glory
          in the four verses which follow, would seek to impress all men with a
          reverential fear of him. Thus he gives us a representation of the
          formidable majesty attaching to God, that he may dash and humble vain
          confidence and carnal pride. A cloudy sky overawes us more than a
          clear one, as the darkness produces a peculiar effect upon the senses.
          The Psalmist makes use of this symbol, no doubt, to impress the world
          with the greater reverence of God. Others refine more upon the words,
          and think that clouds are said to be round about God, to check human
          rashness and presumption, and restrain that excessive curiosity which
          would pry more than is fit into the mysteries of Godhead. This is an
          interpretation of the words which makes them convey a very useful
          lesson; but I am against all refined renderings, and think that the
          Psalmist intended in associating darkness with God, to impress the
          hearts of men with a fear of him in general. The same meaning is
          brought out in the remaining context, when fire is said to go before
          him, and burn up his enemies, his lightnings to shake the earth, and
          the mountains to flow down. Should any object that this does not agree
          with what was said of the joy which his kingdom diffuses, I might
          answer, first, that although God is ready on his part to diffuse
          blessedness wherever he reigns, all are not capable of appreciating
          it. Besides, as I have already hinted, the truth is one of use to
          believers, humbling the pride of the flesh, and deepening their
          adoration of God. God's throne is represented as founded in justice
          and judgment, to denote the benefit which we derive from it. The
          greatest misery which can be conceived of, is that of living without
          righteousness and judgment, and the Psalmist mentions it as matter of
          praise exclusively due to God, that when he reigns, righteousness
          revives in the world. He as evidently denies that we can have any
          righteousness, till God subjects us to the yoke of his word, by the
          gentle but powerful influences of his Spirit. A great proportion of
          men obstinately resist and reject the government of God. Hence the
          Psalmist was forced to exhibit God in his severer aspect, to teach the
          wicked that their perverse opposition will not pass unpunished. When
          God draws near to men in mercy, and they fail to welcome him with
          becoming reverence and respect, this implies impiety of a very
          aggravated description; on which account it is that the language of
          denunciation suits with the kingdom of Christ. The Psalmist intimates
          that those who should despise God in the person of his only-begotten
          Son, will feel in due time and certainly the awful weight of his
          majesty. So much is implied in the expression used -- The earth Shall
          See. For the wicked, when they find that their attempts are vain in
          fighting against God, resort to subterfuge and concealment. The
          Psalmist declares that they would not succeed by any such vain
          artifice in hiding themselves from God.<br />
