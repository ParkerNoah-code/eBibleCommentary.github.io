        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.498)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, March 8th, 1863, by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy
          God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
          All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the
          ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad." -- Psalm 45:7, 8.
        </p>
        <p>
          DURING THE LAST FEW SABBATH-DAYS we have been considering the
          sufferings of our Lord Jesus Christ. We followed him through the agony
          of the garden, the sorrows of the betrayal, the weariness and slander
          of his various trials, the shame and mockery of the soldiery, and the
          sorrows of his cross-bearing progress along the streets of the city.
          It seems fit this morning to make a pause that we may take breath
          awhile in this our pilgrimage of sorrow, and be comforted by a view of
          the glory-land to which the thorny pathway leads. A festive occasion
          like the present may have unfitted your minds for deep contemplations
          upon the Passion, and it may be more congenial with our present mood
          of gladness to meditate upon the glory which followed the shame. The
          same person will be before our eye, but we shall view him in a
          brighter light, we shall see the silver lining of the black cloud of
          anguish, the rich pearls hidden in the stormy deep of his sufferings,
          and the days of heaven which were conceived in the womb of the black
          night of his agony. The Man of Sorrows is the fountain of all joy to
          others, and is the possessor of all the joys of heaven and earth, by
          virtue of his triumphs. He has experienced joys in proportion to his
          sorrows; as he once waded through deep waters of grief he has now
          climbed to the highest mountains of happiness. For the joy that was
          set before him he endured the cross despising the shame, and now
          having sat down at his Father's right-hand he enjoys pleasures for
          evermore. We have seen our David crossing the brook Kedron weeping as
          he went; shall we not gaze upon him as he dances before the ark for
          joy? We saw him crowned with thorns, shall we not go forth to meet him
          and behold him with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the
          day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart? Oh
          that while we muse upon these things our heavenly Father may hear the
          prayer of our great Advocate who once cried on our behalf -- "And now
          come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might
          have my joy fulfilled in themselves."
        </p>
        <p>
          Our text describes the joy poured forth upon our glorious King in a
          twofold manner. Our Lord is first made joyous by his Father -- "Thou
          lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God,
          hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows." But
          there is another joy, which he getteth not from one person, but from
          many. Read the next verse -- "All thy garments smell of myrrh, and
          aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made
          thee glad." Here both saints and angels unite to swell the
          ever-deepening, and widening river of the Savior's gladness. When we
          shall have walked by these still waters and trodden these green
          pastures, perhaps we shall be prepared to say with the apostle, "And
          not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by
          whom we have now received the atonement," and we shall be qualified to
          sing with the spouse, "We will rejoice and be glad in thee; Ye will
          remember thy love more than wine; the upright love thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Come, my brethren, let us ponder that part of OUR SAVIOR'S JOY
          WHICH IS GIVEN HIM BY HIS FATHER.
        </p>
        <p>
          To a degree the Redeemer possessed this joy even while he was here on
          earth. We are not sure that the early life of the Savior was full of
          sorrow. As he grrew in wisdom and in stature, he also grew in favor
          both with God and man; and favor with God and man would probably give
          the youthful Jesus an unusual degree of holy happiness. When he
          entered upon his public ministry, sorrows in troops beset him, so that
          the countenance once fairer than the children of men, became more
          marred than that of any man, and at the age of thirty-two or
          thirty-three he was taken to be near fifty, from the effect of labor,
          hardship and woe. Yet, even in the days of his affliction, the Great
          Mourner was not utterly wretched, even amid the wormwood and the gall
          there were drops of joy. When, in his baptism, the heavens were
          opened, and the Spirit descended, did that divine Dove bring no peace,
          no comfort upon his wings? When the Father bare witness, "This is my
          beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased," did those approving words
          from the opening heavens afford no satisfaction to the mind of the
          obedient Son? Brethren, the perfect nature of our Redeemer could not
          but rejoice exceedingly in the smile of the Father and the descent of
          the Holy Ghost. When in the wilderness, after the forty days of
          fasting and of temptation, the angels ministered unto him, did they
          bring him no celestial joys, no consolations of God? Did he know no
          secret joys upon the mountain-tops, where he communed with God at
          midnight? Was it no delight to him to utter sweet invitations and
          loving words of mercy? Surely those lips were blessed which poured
          forth benedictions, and there must have been some comfort in the hands
          which bound up the broken-hearted and opened the prisons of the
          captives. We read that Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, "Father, I
          thank thee, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent,
          and hast revealed them unto babes; even so, Father, for so it seemed
          good in thy sight." The doctrine of electing love stirred the deeps of
          his great soul, and made the floods clap their hands. "The King shall
          joy in thy strength, O Lord; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he
          rejoice."
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you think, brethren, our Savior lived in this world, doing so much
          good, without receiving some joy in his acts of mercy? To teach, to
          labor, and to make men holy, must give joy to a benevolent mind. It
          could not be otherwise than pleasant to a good man to do good. If God
          deligllteth in mercy, surely his express image must do the same. To
          restore the dead to their sorrowing relations, was this no
          satisfaction? Did the widow's grateful eye in the gates of Nain kindle
          no joy-flashes in his heart? Bid the thankfulness of Mary and Martha
          inspire no comfort in the Life-giver? Think you that it was not
          gladsome work to feed the famishing multitudes? Who could look upon
          the feasting thousands without rejoicing? To heal the leper, to
          restore the lame, to give eyes to the blind and ears to the deaf, who
          could do all this and not be happy in distributing the boons? Surely,
          brethren, there were some hosannas in Jesu's ears, and though he could
          always bear the cry of "Crucify him! Crucify him!" yet he must have
          felt the wondrous joy of doing good, which is one of the delights
          entailed on all self-sacrificing lovers of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bethink you, beloved, of his character, and surely he must have known
          the joy of being good; for there is a deep gladness in holiness, a
          blessed peacefulness in righteousness. The holiness of angels is their
          happiness, and although to a large degree the Savior laid his peace
          aside, yet there is a rest of soul from which virtue cannot separate.
          Distractions of conscience he never knew, disturbance of mind, on
          account of sin he did not feel on his own account, although as our
          substitute he was made sin for us. He suffered. Mark, I am not for a
          moment detracting from his sufferings, high mountains of grief I see;
          the eagle's wing cannot reach their summit, nor foot of angel climb
          their brows; but lo, I see leaping streams of pleasure running adown
          the rugged steeps, and amid the hollows of the desolate hills I gaze
          upon deep lakes of joy unfathomable by mortal line.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, we have every reason to believe that our Savior permanently
          found a solace while on earth, in the consideration that he was doing
          his Father's will. He said, "It is my meat and my drink, to do the
          will of him that sent me." "Wist ye not that I must be about my
          Father's business?" On several occasions the voice from heaven
          proclaimed the Father's good pleasure in his only begotten: once the
          glory of heaven enwraps him on the holy mount; and during his whole
          life he had the presence of God until the moment of necessary
          desertion, when we find him, for the first and only time, crying, "My
          God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!" To do a work which he had
          contemplated from all eternity, to engage in an occupation which had
          always been most delightful in prospect, could not have been
          altogether and only sorrowful. It was a Passover with many bitter
          herbs, but with desire had he desired to eat of it. It was a baptism,
          and a baptism of blood, but he was straitened until it was
          accomplished. Of old, in expectation his delights were with the sons
          of men. Were there none in the work? Brethren, let your Lord speak for
          himself -- "Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,
          I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart."
        </p>
        <p>
          In the glorious prospect which this great work opened to him when it
          should he completed, I am absolutely sure our Savior found comfort.
          Think not I speak too strongly; I have scriptural warrant. Turn to the
          twenty-second Psalm, which is the soliloquy of Christ upon the cross,
          and you find him, after he bemoaned his desolate condition, comforting
          himself thus, "All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto
          he Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before
          thee. All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they
          that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive
          his own soul. A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the
          Lord for a generation. They shall come, and shall declare his
          righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done
          this." He saw with prescient eye through the thick darkness which
          enveloped the cross, the rising of the bright sun of heaven's eternal
          noon. He saw, when he hung upon the cross, not only the mocking eyes
          of multitudes of enemies, but the loving eyes of millions of souls
          whom he should redeem from hell; he heard not only the shouts of the
          ribald mob, but the songs of blood-redeemed spirits. When he saw the
          lions and heard them roar, was it not a comfort to the shepherd that
          he had kept the sheep, and none of them had perished. Indeed, my
          brethren, there is more than enough of evidence to prove that a rich
          anointing of gladness rested on the head of the Man of Sorrows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, dear friends, this may be viewed by some as a moot point; we
          allow that there is room for difference of opinion; but not so as to
          the great joy which Christ obtained after he had endured the cross,
          despising the shame. Let us enter into the secret joys of our Beloved.
          Consider, my brethren, the work accomplished; Chiist has borne the
          wrath of God; God is reconciled to his people; death has been
          destroyed; Christ as risen from the dead; the dragon's head has been
          broken, the powers of sin have been subdued; our Lord ascends to
          heaven with a shout, with the trump of the archangel; the glorified
          spirits accord him a triumphal entry. "Lift up your heads, O ye gates,
          and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors, that the King of Glory may
          come in!" He sits down upon his throne at his Father's right hand, and
          then it is that he is anointed with the oil of gladness above his
          fellows.
        </p>
        <p>
          I should not have failed to remark that, as God, our Redeemer always
          possessed fullness of joy and pleasures for evermore, We are speaking
          of him in his complex person as man and God, and in his official
          character as Mediator, it is his delight in this capacity which we now
          consider.
        </p>
        <p>
          The joy of the risen Mediator laid, first of all, in this, that he had
          now accomplished a work which he had meditated upon from all eternity.
          Before the day-star marked the dawn; before the calm of space had ever
          been stirred by wing of angel, or the solemnity of silence had been
          startled with song of seraph, Christ had purposed to redeem his
          people, It was in the eternal purpose of the great Second Person in
          the Divine Unity, from before all worlds, to redeem unto himself a
          people by price. What joy must it give him now that he can say, "I
          have finished transgression, made an end of sin, and brought in
          everlasting righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          His heart had not only meditated, but had been mightily set upon his
          work. He had bound his people's names upon his breast; he had graven
          them upon the pylons of his hands. His ears were bored, for he
          intended to serve even until death. What if I say that, from before
          all worlds, he thirsted and panted that he might do the Father's will,
          and redeem his people from their ruin! Now, brethren, that desire
          which had been in him like coals of juniper, unquenchable, is now
          fulfilled to the uttermost; how can he be otherwise than anointed with
          the oil of gladness above his fellows, since none other ever purposed
          so firmly or succeeded so perfectly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider, too, how great the pains which he endured, and we must
          believe the joy to be commensurate with the pain. In the accomplishing
          of his great iife-purpose, he descended to the cross of deepest woe.
          Have I not tried to paint in my poor way the mysterious agonies of our
          blessed Savior? but I feel that I have failed. Now when all this had
          been suffered, what joy to look back upon it! Never day so bright as
          that which follows black darkness; never calm so sweet as that which
          succeeds hurricane and tempest; never native place so delightful as to
          the long exiled pilgrim. So deep the sorrow, so high the joy; so
          unspeakable the grief, so unutterable the bliss.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, beloved brethren, the enemies he had overcome, and you will
          not marvel that his joy was matchless. Had he not worsted Death --
          grim tyrant -- vanquisher of all mankind? Had he not broken the head
          of the old serpent, who in his crushing coils had bound and pressed a
          universe of souls? Did he not defeat in battle all the fiends in hell?
          Was not evil for ever dethroned? Did not goodness sit upon a glorious
          high throne? Was not virtue exalted to the highest heaven, and sin
          cast down to the lowest hell in that day of the judgment of this
          world, when the Prince of Darkness was cast out? "Behold," he might
          have said, "I see Satan falling like lightning from heaven; the dragon
          bound with a great chain. Lo, hell's gates are shut upon the saints,
          the grave is rifled of its spoils, heaven is crowded with the saved,
          and earth purified from sin." O Jesus, thou mighty conqueror, thy
          glorious victories must surely give to thee, as they do to us, a
          blessed anointing with the oil of gladness!
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord possesses in heaven now, as perfect man, the joy of looking
          back upon a life without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; the
          satisfaction of seeing this perfect obedience covering all his people,
          till they stand lovely in his loveliness; the equal delight of
          observing the efficacy of his blood to wash the foulest, and make them
          whiter than snow, while his intercession scatters mercy in one
          everlasting shower upon the sons of men. Since his heart was love his
          joy must be in deeds of love, and as he has become a fountain always
          welling up with loving gifts towards the chosen sons of men, his
          delight must be unchanging like his nature, and unbounded like his
          divinity. "God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
          above thy fellows."
        </p>
        <p>
          We pause a moment, having tried to dwell upon the joy, to notice the
          cause of it. "Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness,
          therefore God hath anointed thee." It seems, then, that the first
          cause why Jesus Christ has received fullness of joy lies in his having
          loved righteousness. This he did necessarily because of the spotless
          purity of his nature; this he did practically in the hallowed
          sincerity and integrity of his life. Of whom could it be said so truly
          as of our Lord, that the law of God was in his heart. How abundantly
          did he prove his love to righteousness, by vindicating it in his
          death, fulfilling in his own person all the sentence of divine wrath
          taking upon himself all the curses which fell upon offenders. You
          cannot suppose righteousness to be more clearly manifested than in the
          living works of Jesus, nor more completely avenged than in the dying
          throes. How sovereign is that righteousness to which even the Son of
          God bowed his head and gave up the ghost. The world deluged with
          water, the plains of Sodom smoking with brimstone, the land of Egypt
          vexed with plagues, all these terrible things in righteousness
          manifest the justice of God, but none of them so solemnly as the
          voluntary sacrifice of Jesus. Our Beloved loved righteousness indeed
          when he emptied out all his heart-floods that he might make us
          righteous. Moreover, as in his life and death we see that he loved
          righteousness, we discern it too in the constant effect of his work.
          His gospel makes men righteous. Does it not give them a legal
          righteousness by imputation, a real righteousness by infusion, a
          righteousness which covers them with fine linen without and makes them
          all glorious within. The spirit of the gospel which we preach is to
          magnify that which is pure and lovely and of good repute. Wherever the
          Lord Jesus displays his gracious power, sins yields the throne, purity
          wins the scepter, grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life
          through the perfect sacrifice, the living power of Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text adds, "Thou hatest wickedness." A man's character is not
          complete without a perfect hatred of sin. "Be ye angry, and sin not."
          There can hardly be goodness in a man if he be not angry at sin; he
          who loves truth must hate every false way. How our Lord Jesus hated it
          when the temptation came! Thrice it assailed him in different forms,
          but ever it was, "Get thee behind me, Satan." How he hated it when he
          saw it in others; none the less fervently because he showed his hate
          oftener in tears of pity than in words of rebuke; yet what language
          could be more stern, more Elijah-like, than the words, "Woe unto you,
          scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and
          for a pretense make long prayer." He hated wickedness so much that he
          bled that he might wound it to the heart; he died that it might die;
          he was buried that he might bury in his tomb; and he rose that he
          might for ever trample it beneath his feet. Christ is in the Gospel,
          my brethren, and you all know low utterly that Gospel is opposed to
          wickedness in every shape. No matter how wickedness may array itself
          in fair garments, and imitate the language of holiness, the precepts
          of Jesus, like his famous scourge of small cords, chase wickedness out
          of the temple, and will not let it have peaceful lodging in the
          Church. So too, in the heart where Jesus reigns, what war there is
          between Christ and Belial? And when our Redeemer shall come to be our
          judge, in those thundering words, "Depart, ye cursed," which are,
          indeed, but al prolongation of his life-teaching concerning sin, then
          shall it be seen, I say, that he hated wickedness. As warm as is his
          love to sinners, so hot is his hatred of sin; as perfect as is the
          righteousness which he completed, so perfect shall be the destruction
          of every form of wickedness. Oh thou glorious champion of right, and
          destroyer of wrong, for this cause hath God, even thy God, anointed
          thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, beloved, we must dwell for one moment upon another thought
          supplied by the text. The character of this joy is hinted at by way of
          comparison -- "God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of
          gladness above thy fellows." And who are his fellows? Suppose his
          fellows to be the kings and princes of this world, for the psalm is
          descriptive of Christ in his royalty. Well, is he not anointed with
          gladness above them all? Kings rejoice in their dominions, their
          extent and population: our King looks from shore to shore, and from
          the river even to the ends of the earth, and of his dominion there is
          no end. Princes delight in the fame and honor which their office and
          deeds may bring them; but before the Lord Jesus Christ the fame of
          monarchs dwindles into nothing. His name shall endure for ever;
          throughout all generations the people shall praise him. Monarchs
          delight in the riches and treasure which their dominions yield; Christ
          receiveth a wealth of love and homage from his people, before which
          the riches of Croesus become poverty itself. "The daughter of Tyre
          shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall
          entreat thy favor." Kings are wont to rejoice in the victories they
          have achieved. He that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from
          Bozrah, travelling in the greatness of his strength, hath more joy
          than they. They boast the sureness of their throne; but "thy throne, O
          God, is for ever and ever." The inward thought of some kings may be
          that they are invincible in power, and that their will is law; but at
          the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, and his enemies shall become
          as the fat of rams; into smoke shall they consume, yea, into smoke
          shall they consume away. Good kings rejoice in the beneficence of
          their rule, and the happiness of their subjects; our King may surely
          glory in the favors which he has scattered from his scepter. But time
          would hail us if we were to complete the contrast here. Kings of the
          earth, ye may take off your crowns, and remain uncrowned in the
          presence of lying Jesus, for on his head are many crowns. O ye lords
          and mighty men, ye may lay down your dignities and honors, for ye are
          unhonoured and undignified in the presence of him who is above his
          fellows!
        </p>
        <p>
          My brethren, where shall his fellows be found? Search ye among the
          wise, and who shall match the gladness of incarnate wisdom, for man's
          wisdom bringeth sorrow. Go ye, and travel among the famous, and who
          shall be compared with his illustrious name, where else is there a
          name so full of joy? Search out the mighty, who hath an arm like his?
          Go ye, and search among the good and excellent, who have blessed their
          kind by philanthropy; who among them is so anointed as the Man of
          Nazareth? As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my
          beloved among the sons. Standing as high above all the rest of men as
          the heavens are above the earth; he is, indeed, anointed with the oil
          of gladness above his fellows. I find that some interpreters read it
          -- "The oil of gladness for his fellows." The rendering is probably
          incorrect, but it bears a very truthful, sweet, and comfortable
          thought in it. If the saints are his fellows, and he is not ashamed to
          call them brethren, then the oil of gladness was first poured on his
          head, that it might descend even to the skirts of his garments, and
          that all the saints might be made partakers of his joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have said enough, we think, on this first point; here is the
          material for much meditation. Search, my brethren, and learn how the
          Lord, even our God, has glolified his Son Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Turn we now to THE GLADNESS AFFORDED BY THE CHURCH. "All thy
          garments smell of myrrh, and cassia, and aloes, out of the ivory
          palaces, whereby they have made thee glad." His garments have been
          saturated with very precious and fragrant odours; this is the work of
          his Church. In the phrase, "ivory palaces" the allusion is to certain
          costly structures which some Oriental kings erected, plated within and
          without with ivory. We read of Ahab that he built an ivory house; and
          it was a solemn threat from the lip of Amos, "the houses of ivory
          shall perish." These ivory houses relate, I suppose, either to the
          courts of glory, or, more consistently with our interpretation this
          morning, to the hearts of believers; or, better still, to the
          churches, which are like palaces of ivory, both for glory and majesty,
          for richness, and for purity. The saints' graces, their love, their
          praise, their prayers, their faith, are like myrrh, cassia, and aloes,
          and the Savior's garments are so perfumed therewith, that when he
          rides in his triumphal chariot he scatters sweet odours all around. It
          is a great and certain truth, that Christ finds an intense
          satisfaction in his Church. "He will rejoice over thee with joy; he
          will rest in his love; he will joy over thee with singing." In his
          people, as the objects of his choice, he finds satisfaction; tis true
          there is nothing in them naturally; they are by nature heirs of wrath,
          even as others; but having set his love upon them, having determined
          to make them his people, he takes a delight in the objects of his
          choice because of that choice. Nothing in us could have been the
          origin of the Saviours first delight in us. Now, doubtless, that we
          are his workmanship, he takes a delight in the works of his own hands;
          but when we were like broken potsherds, thrown away upon the dunghill
          of the fall, if he saw anything in us it must have been in his own
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, dear friends, as men always take a deep interest in that which
          has cost them dearly, so since that triumphant day when Jesus
          stretched out his hands upon the tree and paid the price for his
          people, he has found an infinite solace and delight in them. He sees
          in every believer's face a memento of his groans; he looks into the
          eye of every penitent, and sees his own tears there; he hears the cry
          of every mourner, and there hears his own groans over again; he
          beholds the reward of his soul's travail in every regenerate heart,
          and hence, as the purchase of his blood, we make him glad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, as his workmanship, as he sees us day by day more conformed to
          his image, he rejoices in us. Just as you see the sculptor with his
          chisel fetching out the statue which lies hidden in the block of
          marble, taking off a corner here, and a chip there, and a piece here
          -- see how he smiles when he brings out the features of the form
          divine -- so our Savior, as he proceeds with his graving tool, working
          through the operation of the Spirit, and making us like unto himself,
          finds much delight in us. The painter makes rough drafts at first, and
          lays on the colors roughly; some do not understand what he is doing,
          and for three or four sittings the portrait is much unlike the man it
          aims at representing; but the painter can discern the features in the
          canvass; he sees it looming through that mist and haze of color; he
          knows that beauty will yet beam forth from yonder daubs and blotches.
          So Jesus, though we are yet but mere outlines of his image, can
          discover his own perfection in us where no eye but his own, as the
          Mighty Artist, can perceive it. Dear friends, it is for this reason,
          because we are the work of his hands, that he taketh delight in us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Know ye not that we are his brethren -- and brothers should delight in
          brothers. Nay, we are his spouse -- and where should the husband find
          his comfort but in his bride? We are his body -- shall not the head be
          content with the members? We are one with him, vitally, personally,
          everlastingly one; and it is little marvel, therefore, if we have a
          mutual joy in each other, so that his garments smell of myrrh, aloes,
          and cassia, out of the ivory palaces of his Church, wherein he hath
          been made glad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us think how we can make him glad. Brethren, our love to Christ --
          oh! we think it so cold, so little, and so, indeed, we must
          sorrowfully confess it to be, but it is very sweet to Christ. We can
          never compare our love to Christ with his love to us, and yet he does
          not despise it. Hear his own eulogy of his Church in the Song, "Thou
          hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my
          heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck. How fair is
          thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine!
          and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!" "Thou art
          beautiful, O my love, as Tirza, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an
          army with banners. Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have
          overcome me." See, see, my brethren, his delight in you. When you lean
          your head on his bosom, you not only receive, but you give him joy;
          when you gaze with love upon his beauteous face, you not only receive
          comfort, but give delight. Our praise, too, gives him joy, when from
          our hearts we sing his name, and when gratefully, though silently, we
          breathe a song up to his throne. As princes are delighted with
          incense, so is Christ delighted with the praise of his people. And our
          gifts, too, delight him. As the son of our good Queen accepts rich
          tokens of kindness from the people of his land, so our Lord Jesus is
          charmed with the offerings of his people. He loves to see us lay our
          time, our talents, our substance upon his altar, not for the value of
          what we give, but for the sake of the motive from which the gift
          springs. He takes far more delight in what we do for him than our
          Queen's son could take in splendid arches, or in the glorious
          pageantry of yesterday. To Christ the shouts of his people are better
          than the cheers of the most enthusiastic populace, and to him the
          lowly offerings of his saints are more acceptable than thousands of
          gold and silver. Forgive your enemy, and you make Christ glad;
          distribute of your substance to the poor, and he rejoices; be the
          means of saving souls, and you give him to see of the travail of his
          soul; preach his gospel, and you are a sweet savor unto him; go among
          the ignorant and among the hopeless, and try to lift them up, and you
          have given him satisfaction. I tell you, brother, it is in your power
          this very day to break the alabaster box and pour the precious
          ointment on his head, as did the woman of old, whose memorial is to
          this day set forth. You can anoint him above all his fellows with the
          oil of gladness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I see a great procession. It is Jesus Christ riding alone
          through the tens of thousands of souls whom he has redeemed with his
          own blood. I think I see him looking to the right hand and to the left
          as he rides along the centuries. See how every windows of every age
          are crowded! Glorified spirits look down from the housetops of heaven:
          the Church militant looks up from the streets of earth, multitudes
          upon multitudes of souls that love him, and call him King, salute him
          as their Redeemer. I notice that, as he goes along in this great
          procession, his eyes are bright with joy. We liked to see the Prince
          and Princess happy yesterday but their joy could be nothing compared
          with that of Christ as he rides along in triumph. How the multitudes
          delight him; the ten thousand times ten thousand -- who shall tell how
          many Christ has redeemed? Their number is beyond all human count; so
          many are they that, as they clap their hands and shout to his name, I
          hear a voice like many waters, or like great thunders, while they cry
          "Hallelujah, Sweet Prince! ride on triumphantly! and reign for ever
          and ever!" There is one thing Christ feels as he looks upon the crowd
          around him, which our Prince could not feel yesterday. He knows that
          everyone of these would lay down their lives for him. Of all those
          whom Jesus bought with blood; among those who are renewed in heart;
          there is not one who would not bleed for him. To the stake they walk,
          and sing amidst the flames. To the dungeon they go, and praise him
          while they rot in darkness. They are dragged at the heels of horses,
          they are stoned, they are sawn in sunder, they wander about in
          sheep-skins and in goat-skins, and they glory in all these things that
          they may show their love to Christ. Every eye in the vast throng which
          gathers about the triumphal chariot of Christ beams with intense love
          to him; and when they shout, each one shouts louder than his fellow;
          each one in the whole throng feels he owes more to the great King than
          anyone else; there is something special about each face the King looks
          on, and as he remembers the special circumstances, he perceives the
          reason for that special love. Either it is much forgiven, or else it
          is much trial averted, or much strength conferred by which to perform
          labor. I am sure that when you and I are in that throng loolking upon
          him, we may truly say --
        </p>
        <p>"Then loudest of the crowd I'll sing,</p>
        <p>While heaven's resounding mansions ring</p>
        <p>With shouts of sovereign grace."</p>
        <p>
          Ye did well to applaud your Prince yesterday, but what had he ever
          done for you? What debt did you owe to him? Owed he not far more to
          you? But our King as he rides along in the midst of the joyful hosts
          of the blood-bought, has this upon his mind -- "I bought all these
          souls with my blood." He recollects, as he looks upon them, where they
          would have been but for his grace, and the very pangs of hell must add
          joy to his soul, when he remembers that he saved them from passing
          into the pit. He recollects, too, what they once were -- how full of
          sin, what enemies to God, how they crucified him, how they trampled on
          his precious blood, and now he sees them bowing, before him, too glad
          to catch but a glimpse of him as he rides by, too happy to be as the
          dust of his feet if he will but honor them by treading upon them that
          he might be lifted the higher. O my brethren, we love the Lord Jesus
          Christ, and our hearts give him a reception such as never was accorded
          to earthly Prince. Pile the arches! pile the arches! Let hearts pour
          forth their life-blood, if in no other way the banners can be dyed
          red! Strew the streets; strip off your garments if in no other way the
          pageant can be made illustrious! bring forth the royal diadem, and let
          every saint renounce wealth and comfort if by no other means Jesus can
          be crowned! Empty heaven, if by no other way Jesus can be attended
          with guards of honor. Come, all ye sons and daughters of his great
          family, and offer yourselves a living sacrifice, if there can be no
          other incense! We are all prepared -- I speak for the sacramental host
          of God's elect -- we are all prepared by his grace to follow him
          through floods and through flames! We are prepared to give him all the
          honor that heart can conceive. We are prepared to kiss his feet as
          well as to crown his head. Bring forth the royal diadem to-day and
          crown him Lord of all; and each day as he rides along, till he shall
          deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father, let him be crowned
          King of kings and Lord of lords.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now for another text, but not another sermon. It is in the fourth
          verse of the first chapter of the Song of Solomon: -- "WE WILL BE GLAD
          AND REJOICE IN THEE."
        </p>
        <p>
          God has made the king glad, and his saints make him glad; let us be
          glad too. But let us mind that our gladness is of the right sort. "We
          will rejoice and be glad in thee." That man is glad in his farm; that
          other in his merchandise; that one yonder in his wealth; that woman in
          her jewels; that other in her beauty; "We will rejoice and be glad in
          thee." But in what? We will rejoice, more especially, in his love to
          us. You remember Jesus Christ said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of
          Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?" Interpreters read that two
          ways. Some think he meant, "Lovest thou me more that thou lovest these
          nets, and this fishery, and this thine earthly calling and these thy
          friends?" I think I hear Jesus Christ speaking this morning, and he
          says, "My people, I love you more than these." He points to spirits
          that once stood around his throne, angels that have sinned; they fell
          like lightning from heaven, and there they lie in flames, and Christ
          says, "I loved you more than these; I let these perish, but I saved
          you." Pointing to the kings and princes of this world, the great, the
          mighty, and the learned men, and to all the nations that sit in
          darkness, he says, "I love you more than these; I gave Ethiopia and
          Seba for you." Then taking a higher range he joints to heaven. There
          sit the angels before the throne, and he says, "I loved you more than
          these; I left their company for yours." He bids you listen to their
          harps and to their songs, and he says, "I loved you more than these; I
          left all these melodies that I might be able to meet your groans."
          Yea, he points to his own throne, so bright with glory that mortal
          eyes scarce dare to rest upon it, and he says, "I loved you more than
          these, for I left the glory of my throne that I might redeem you with
          my blood." Saint, will you not join with me? Shall we not both say,
          "Savior, blessed be thine unexampled love! We rill rejoice and be glad
          in thee!"
        </p>
        <p>
          But some interpreters read the text -- "Lovest thou me more than
          these?" -- "Lovest thou me more than these others love me?" Jesus
          speaks to-day to us, "I have loved thee more than these; thy mother
          loved thee; strong were her pangs when thou wast born, and anxious her
          cares when she nursed thee at her bosom; but I have loved thee more
          than these, and thy brethren loved thee, and thy sisters; born of the
          same parents they watched over thee with delight, and they have been
          ready to help thee in thy time of need, but I have loved thee more
          than these: and thy husband loved thee, loved thee as his own soul, he
          has cherished thee, and has been ready to lay down his life to give
          thee back health when thou hast been sick; but I have loved thee more
          than these: thy children, too, have loved thee; they have climbed thy
          knee and smiled upon thee for all thy kindness to them, and they have
          strengthened thine old age, and thou hast leaned upon them, as upon a
          staff, when thou hast been tottering with weakness; but I have loved
          thee more than these: and thou hast had a joyous companion, a dear
          friend who has been with thee from thy youth up, and has never lifted
          his heel against thee; and thou hast had thine intimates and thy
          familars who went up to the house of God with thee, and talked
          cheerfully by the way, but I have loved thee more than these," I think
          I hear him say to me -- "There are some in this congregation who would
          pluck out their own eyes to give them to thee; they love thee, for
          thou art their spiritual father, but I have loved thee more than
          theses." And he points to all the good men that have ever tried to
          teach you, to all the comforters who have given you joy, to all the
          helpers that have aided you on the road to immortality; and he says,
          "I have loved you more than these." Well, if his love be matchless
          like this, we will rejoice and be glad in him. I have nothing, else to
          rejoice in, the Lord knoweth. I cannot rejoice in myself, there are so
          many sins and so many doubts; but I will rejoice and be glad in him if
          he loves me like this. He has finished the work for me, given me a
          perfect righteousness, washed me in his blood, taken off his robe to
          clothe me, given his life that he may make me live, entered the grave
          to bring me out of it, and said that I shall shortly be enthroned with
          him above the sky. I will rejoice and be glad in him. When King
          Solomon was crowned, all the people rejoiced; and shall we be mourners
          when Christ sits upon his throne? Let the heaviest heart begin to
          leap; and if you have to bear your burdens to-morrow, yet do throw
          them off to-day. "We will rejoice and be glad in thee." I should not
          like one Christian to go down these aisles this morning without some
          light of heaven's brightness on his cheek -- without some note of
          heaven's music in his ear. "Oh!" says the Christian, "Yes. I will; the
          cross is heavy, but I will hope beneath it; the furnace is hot, but I
          will sing in it; the way is rough, but I will tread it with light
          footsteps, for I will rejoice and be glad in him who has loved me and
          given himself for me." Well, you see, there is a glad Christ in
          heaven, and here is a glad Church on earth; there is Christ anointed
          by his Father, here are his people sharing that anointing; here is
          Christ giving you joy, and you giving Christ joy. Belt the world with
          happiness; fire zodiac with joy. Lift up the ladder of your songs;
          while the bottom rests on earth, let the top reach to heaven; and ye
          angels of God, hold fellowship to-day with God and with us through the
          joy and peace which God the Father gives us, while we rejoice and are
          glad in him.

          I would you all understood this subject, but some of you are strangers
          to it altogether! Remember, there is no joy anywhere but in Christ. It
          is all poor mockery which you get elsewhere. Jesus Christ is to be
          had, and whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have
          everlasting life.
        </p>
        <p>The Lord give you his benediction, for Jesus' sake. Amen.</p>
