        <p>Delivered by</p>

        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "And Jesus saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of
          men." -- Matthew 4:19.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHEN CHRIST CALLS US by his grace we ought not only to remember what
          we are, but we ought also to think of what he can make us. It is,
          "Follow me, and I will make you." We should repent of what we have
          been, but rejoice in what we may be. It is not "Follow me, because of
          what you are already." It is not "Follow me, because you may make
          something of yourselves;" but, "Follow me, because of what I will make
          you." Verily, I might say of each one of us as soon as we are
          converted, "It doth not yet appear what we shall be." It did not seem
          a likely thing that lowly fishermen would develop into apostles; that
          men so handy with the net would be quite as much at home in preaching
          sermons and in instructing converts. One would have said, "How can
          these things be? You cannot make founders of churches out of peasants
          of Galilee." That is exactly what Christ did; and when we are brought
          low in the sight of God by a sense of our own unworthiness, we may
          feel encouraged to follow Jesus because of what he can make us. What
          said the woman of a sorrowful spirit when she lifted up her song? "He
          raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from
          the dunghill, to set them among princes." We cannot tell what God may
          make of us in the new creation, since it would have been quite
          impossible to have foretold what he made of chaos in the old creation.
          Who could have imagined all the beautiful things that came forth from
          darkness and disorder by that one fiat, "Let there be light?" And who
          can tell what lovely displays of everything that is divinely fair I
          lay yet appear in a man's formerly dark life, when God's grace has
          said to him, "Let there be light?" O you who see in yourselves at
          present nothing that is desirable, come you and follow Christ for the
          sake of what he can make out of you. Do you not hear his sweet voice
          calling to you, and saying, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of
          men?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, next, that we are not made all that we shall be, nor all that we
          ought to desire to be, when we are ourselves fished for and caught.
          This is what the grace of God does for us at first; but it is not all.
          We are like the fishes, making sin to be our element; and the good
          Lord comes, and with the gospel net he takes us, and he delivers us
          from the life and love of sin. But he has not wrought for us all that
          he can do, nor all that we should wish him to do, when he has done
          this; for it is another and a higher miracle to make us who were fish
          to become fishers -- to make the saved ones saviours -- to make the
          convert into a converter -- the receiver of the gospel into an
          imparter of that same gospel to other people. I think I may say to
          every person whom I am addressing -- If you are saved yourself, the
          work is but half done until you are employed to bring others to
          Christ. You are as yet but half formed in the image of your Lord. You
          have not attained to the full development of the Christ-life in you
          unless you have commenced in some feeble way to tell to others of the
          grace of God: and I trust that you will find no rest to the sole of
          your foot till you have been the means of leading many to that blessed
          Savior who is your confidence and your hope. His word is -- Follow me,
          not merely that you may be saved, nor even that you may be sanctified;
          but, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men." Be following
          Christ with that intent and aim; and fear that you are not perfectly
          following him unless in some degree he is making use of you to be
          fishers of men. The fact is, that every one of us must take to the
          business of a mancatcher. If Christ has caught us, we must catch
          others. If we have been apprehended of him, we must be his constables,
          to apprehend rebels for him. Let us ask him to give us grace to go
          a-fishing, and so to cast our nets that we may take a great multitude
          of fishes. Oh that the Holy Ghost may raise up from among us some
          master-fishers, who shall sail their boats in many a sea, and surround
          great shoals of fish!
        </p>
        <p>
          My teaching at this time will be very simple, but I hope it will be
          eminently practical; for my longing is that not one of you that love
          the Lord may be backward in his service. What says the Song of Solomon
          concerning certain sheep that come up from the washing? It says,
          "Every one beareth twins, and none is barren among them." May that be
          so with all the members of this church, and all the Christian people
          that hear or read this sermon! The fact is, the day is very dark. The
          heavens are lowering with heavy thunder-clouds. Men little dream of
          what tempests may soon shake this city, and the whole social fabric of
          this land, even to a general breaking up of society. So dark may the
          night become that the stars may seem to fall like blighted fruit from
          the tree. The times are evil. Now, if never before, every glow-worm
          must show its spark. You with the tiniest farthing candle must take it
          from under the bushel, and set it on a candlestick. There is need of
          you all. Lot was a poor creature. He was a very, very wretched kind of
          believer; but still, he might have been a great blessing to Sodom had
          he but pleaded for it as he should have done. And poor, poor
          Christians, as I fear many are, one begins to value every truly
          converted soul in these evil days, and to pray that each one may
          glorify the Lord. I pray that every righteous man, vexed as he is with
          the conversation of the wicked, may be more importunate in prayer than
          he has ever been, and return unto his God, and get more spiritual
          life, that he may be a blessing to the perishing people around him. I
          address you, therefore, at this time first of all upon this thought.
          Oh that the Spirit of God may make each one of you feel his personal
          responsibility!
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is for believers in Christ, in order to their usefulness,
          something for them to do. "Follow me." But, secondly, here is
          something to be done by their great Lord and Master: "Follow me, and I
          will make you fishers of men." You will not grow into fishers of
          yourselves, but this is what Jesus will do for you if you will but
          follow him. And then, lastly, here is a good illustration, used
          according to our great Master's wont; for scarcely without a parable
          did he speak unto the people. He presents us with an illustration of
          what Christian men should be -- fishers of men. We may get some useful
          hints out of it, and I pray the Holy Spirit to bless them to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, I will take it for granted that every believer here
          wants to be useful. If he does not, I take leave to question whether
          he can be a true believer in Christ. Well, then, if you want to be
          really useful, here is SOMETHING FOR YOU TO DO TO THAT END: "Follow
          me, and I will make you fishers of men."
        </p>
        <p>
          What is the way to become an efficient preacher? "Young man," says
          one, "go to college." "Young man," says Christ, "follow me, and I will
          make you a fisher of men." How is a person to be useful? "Attend a
          training-class," says one. Quite right; but there is a surer answer
          than that -- Follow Jesus, and he will make you fishers of men. The
          great training-school for Christian workers has Christ at its head;
          and he is at its head, not only as a tutor, but as a leader: we are
          not only to learn of him in study, but to follow him in action.
          "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men." The direction is very
          distinct and plain, and I believe that it is exclusive, so that no man
          can become a fisherman by any other process. This process may appear
          to be very simple; but assuredly it is most efficient. The Lord Jesus
          Christ, who knew all about fishing for men, was himself the Dictator
          of the rule, "Follow me, if you want to be fishers of men. If you
          would be useful, keep in my track."
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand this, first, in this sense: be separate unto Christ.
          These men were to leave their pursuits; they were to leave their
          companions; they were, in fact, to quit the world, that their one
          business might be, in their Master's name, to be fishers of men. We
          are not all called to leave our daily business, or to quit our
          families. That might be rather running away from the fishery than
          working at it in God's name. But we are called most distinctly to come
          out from among the ungodly, and to be separate, and not to touch the
          unclean thing. We cannot be fishers of men if we remain among men in
          the same element with them. Fish will not be fishers. The sinner will
          not convert the sinner. The ungodly man will not convert the ungodly
          man; and, what is more to the point, the worldly Christian will not
          convert the world. If you are of the world, no doubt the world will
          love its own; but you cannot save the world. If you are dark, and
          belong to the kingdom of darkness, you cannot remove the darkness. If
          you march with the armies of the wicked one, you cannot defeat them. I
          believe that one reason why the church of God at this present moment
          has so little influence over the world is because the world has so
          much influence over the church. Nowadays we hear Nonconformists
          pleading that they may do this and they may do that -- things which
          their Puritan forefathers would rather have died at the stake than
          have tolerated. They plead that they may live like worldlings, and my
          sad answer to them, when they crave for this liberty, is, "Do it if
          you dare. It may not do you much hurt, for you are so bad already.
          Your cravings show how rotten your hearts are. If you have a hungering
          after such dog's meat, go, dogs, and eat the garbage. Worldly
          amusements are fit food for mere pretenders and hypocrites. If you
          were God's children you would loathe the very thought of the world's
          evil joys, and your question would not be, 'How far may we be like the
          world?' but your one cry would be, 'How far can we get away from the
          world? How much can we come out from it?'" Your temptation would be
          rather to become sternly severe, and ultra-Puritanical in your
          separation from sin, in such a time as this, than to ask, "How can I
          make myself like other men, and act as they do?" Brethren, the use of
          the church in the world is that it should be like salt in the midst of
          putrefaction; but if the salt has lost its savor, what is the good of
          it? If it were possible for salt itself to putrefy, it could but be an
          increase and a heightening of the general putridity. The worst day the
          world ever saw was when the sons of God were joined with the daughters
          of men. Then came the flood; for the only barrier against a flood of
          vengeance on this world is the separation of the saint from the
          sinner. Your duty as a Christian is to stand fast in your own place
          and stand out for God, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh,
          resolving like one of old that, let others do as they will, as for you
          and your house, you will serve the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, ye children of God, you must stand out with your Lord outside
          the camp. Jesus calls to you to-day, and says, "Follow me." Was Jesus
          found at the theater? Did he frequent the sports of the racecourse?
          Was Jesus seen, think you, in any of the amusements of the Herodian
          court? Not he. He was "holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from
          sinners." In one sense no one mixed with sinners so completely as he
          did when, like a physician, he went among them healing his patients;
          but in another sense there was a gulf fixed between the men of the
          world and the Savior which he never essayed to cross, and which they
          could not cross to defile him. The first lesson which the church has
          to learn is this: Follow Jesus into the separated state, and he will
          make you fishers of men. Unless you take up your cross and protest
          against an ungodly world, you cannot hope that the holy Jesus will
          make you fishers of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          A second meaning of our text is very obviously this: abide with
          Christ, and then you will be made fishers of men. These disciples whom
          Christ called were to come and live with him. They were every day to
          be associated with him. They were to hear him teach publicly the
          everlasting gospel, and in addition they were to receive choice
          explanations in private of the word which he had spoken. They were to
          be his body-servants and his familiar friends. They were to see his
          miracles and hear his prayers; and, better still, they were to be with
          himself, and become one with him in his holy labor. It was given to
          them to sit at the table with him, and even to have their feet washed
          by him. Many of them fulfilled that word, "Where thou dwellest I will
          dwell:" they were with him in his afflictions and persecutions. They
          witnessed his secret agonies; they saw his many tears; they marked the
          passion and the compassion of his soul, and thus, after their measure,
          they caught his spirit, and so they learned to be fishers of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Jesus' feet we must learn the art and mystery of soul-winning to
          live with Christ is the best education for usefulness. It is a great
          boon to any man to be associated with a Christian minister whose heart
          is on fire. The best training for a young man is that which the
          Vaudois pastors were wont to give, when each old man had a young man
          with him who walked with him whenever he went up the mountainside to
          preach, and lived in the house with him, and marked his prayers and
          saw his daily piety. This was a fine instruction. Was it not? But it
          will not compare with that of the apostles who lived with Jesus
          himself, and were his daily companions. Matchless was the training of
          the twelve. No wonder that they became what they were with such a
          heavenly tutor to saturate them with his own spirit! And now to-day
          his bodily presence is not among us; but his spiritual power is
          perhaps more fully known to us than it was to those apostles in those
          two or three years of the Lord's corporeal presence. There be some of
          us to whom he is intimately near. We know more about him than we do
          about our dearest earthly friend. We have never been able quite to
          read our friend's heart in all its twistings and windings, but we know
          the heart of the Well Beloved. We have leaned our head upon his bosom,
          and have enjoyed fellowship with him such as we could not have with
          any of our own kith and kin. This is the surest method of learning how
          to do good. Live with Jesus, follow Jesus, and he will make you
          fishers of men. See how he does the work, and so learn how to do it
          yourself. A Christian man should be bound apprentice to Jesus to learn
          the trade of a Savior. We can never save men by offering a redemption,
          for we have none to present; but we can learn how to save men by
          warning them to flee from the wrath to come, and setting before them
          the one great effectual remedy. See how Jesus saves, and you will
          learn how the thing is done: there is no learning it anyhow else. Live
          in fellowship with Christ, and there shall be about you an air and a
          manner as of one who has been made in heart and mind apt to teach, and
          wise to win souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          A third meaning, however, must be given to this "Follow me," and it is
          this: "Obey me, and then you shall know what to do to save men." We
          must not talk about our fellowship with Christ, or our being separated
          from the world unto him, unless we make him our Master and Lord in
          everything. Some public teachers are not true at all points to their
          convictions, and how can they look for a blessing? A Christian man
          anxious to be useful, ought to be very particular as to every point of
          obedience to his Master. I have no doubt whatever that God blesses our
          churches even when they are very faulty, for his mercy endureth for
          ever. When there is a measure of error in the teaching, and a measure
          of mistake in the practice, he may still vouchsafe to use the
          ministry, for he is very gracious. But a large measure of blessing
          must necessarily be withheld from all teaching which is knowingly or
          glaringly faulty. God can set his seal upon the truth that is in it,
          but he cannot set his seal upon the error that is in it. Out of
          mistakes about Christian ordinances and other things, especially
          errors in heart and spirit, there may come evils which we never looked
          for. Such evils may even now be telling upon the present age, and may
          work worse mischief upon future generations. If we desire as fishers
          of men to be largely used of God we must copy our Lord Jesus in
          everything, and obey him in every point. Failure in obedience may lead
          to failure in success. Each one of us, if he would wish to see his
          child saved, or his Sunday-school class blessed, or his congregation
          converted, must take care that, bearing the vessels of the Lord, he is
          himself clean. Anything we do that grieves the Spirit of God must take
          away from us some part of our power for good. The Lord is very
          gracious and pitiful; but yet he is a jealous God. He is sometimes
          sternly jealous towards his people who are living in neglects of known
          duty, or in associations which are not clean in his sight. He will
          wither their work, weaken their strength, and humble them until at
          last they say, "My Lord, I will take thy way after all. I will do what
          thou biddest me to do, for else thou wilt not accept me." The Lord
          said to his disciples, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the
          gospel to every creature: he that believeth and is baptized shall be
          saved;" and he promised them that signs should follow, and so they did
          follow them, and so they will. But we must get back to apostolic
          practice and to apostolic teaching: we must lay aside the commandments
          of men and the whimseys of our own brains, and we must do what Christ
          tells us, as Christ tells us, and because Christ tells us. Definitely
          and distinctly, we must take the place of servants; and if we will not
          do that, we cannot expect our Lord to work with us and by us. Let us
          be determined that, as true as the needle is to the pole, so true will
          we be, as far as our light goes, to the command of our Lord and
          Master. Jesus says -- "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
          By this teaching he seems to say -- "Go beyond me, or fall back behind
          me, and you may cast the net; but it shall be night with you, and that
          night you shall take nothing. When you shall do as I bid you, you
          shall cast your net on the right side of the ship, and you shall
          find."
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, I think that there is a great lesson in my text to those who
          preach their own thoughts instead of preaching the thoughts of Christ.
          These disciples were to follow Christ that they might listen to him,
          hear what he had to say, drink in his teaching, and then go and teach
          what he had taught them. Their Lord says, "What I tell you in
          darkness, speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach
          ye upon the housetops." If they will be faithful reporters of Christ's
          message, he will make them "fishers of men." But you know the boastful
          method nowadays is this: "I am not going to preach this old, old
          gospel, this musty Puritan doctrine. I will sit down in my study, and
          burn the midnight oil, and invent a new theory; then I will come out
          with my brand-new thought, and blaze away with it." Many are not
          following Christ, but following themselves, and of them the Lord may
          well say, "Thou shalt see whose word shall stand, mine or theirs."
          Others are wickedly prudent, and judge that certain truths which are
          evidently God's word had better be kept back. You must not be rough,
          but must prophesy smooth things. To talk about the punishment of sin,
          to speak of eternal punishment, why, these are unfashionable
          doctrines. It may be that they are taught in the Word of God, but they
          do not suit the genius of the age. We must pare them down. Brothers in
          Christ, I will have no share in this. Will you? O my soul, come not
          thou into their secret! Certain things not taught in the Bible our
          enlightened age has discovered. Evolution may be clean contrary to the
          teaching of Genesis, but that does not matter. We are not going to be
          believers of Scripture, but original thinkers. This is the
          vain-glorious ambition of the period. Mark you, in proportion as the
          modern theology is preached the vice of this generation increases. To
          a great degree I attribute the looseness of the age to the laxity of
          the doctrine preached by its teachers. From the pulpit they have
          taught the people that sin is a trifle. From the pulpit these traitors
          to God and to his Christ have taught the people that there is no hell
          to be feared. A little, little hell, perhaps, there may be; but just
          punishment for sin is made nothing of. The precious atoning sacrifice
          of Christ has been derided and misrepresented by those who were
          pledged to preach it. They have given the people the name of the
          gospel, but the gospel itself has evaporated in their hands. From
          hundreds of pulpits the gospel is as clean gone as the dodo from its
          old haunts; and still the preachers take the position and name of
          Christ's ministers. Well, and what comes of it? Why, their
          congregations grow thinner and thinner; and so it must be. Jesus says,
          "Follow me, I will make you fishers of men;" but if you go in your own
          way, with your own net, you will make nothing of it, and the Lord
          promises you no help in it. The Lord's directions make himself our
          leader and example. It is, "Follow me, follow me. Preach my gospel.
          Preach what I preached. Teach what I taught, and keep to that." With
          that blessed servility which becomes one whose ambition it is to be a
          copyist, and never to be an original, copy Christ even in jots and
          tittles. Do this, and he will make you fishers of men; but if you do
          not do this, you shall fish in vain.
        </p>
        <p>
          I close this head of discourse by saying that we shall not be fishers
          of men unless we follow Christ in one other respect; and that is, by
          endeavoring, in all points, to imitate his holiness. Holiness is the
          most real power that can be possessed by men or women. We may preach
          orthodoxy, but we must also live orthodoxy. God forbid that we should
          preach anything else; but it will be all in vain, unless there is a
          life at the back of the testimony. An unholy preacher may even render
          truth contemptible. In proportion as any of us draw back from a living
          and zealous sanctification we shall draw back from the place of power.
          Our power lies in this word, "Follow me." Be Jesus-like. In all things
          endeavor to think, and speak, and act as Jesus did, and he will make
          you fishers of men. This will require self-denial. We must daily take
          up the cross. This may require willingness to give up our reputation
          -- readiness to be thought fools, idiots, and the like, as men are apt
          to call those who are keeping close to their Master. There must be the
          cheerful resigning of everything that looks like honor and personal
          glory, in order that we may be wholly Christ's, and glorify his name.
          We must live his life and be ready to die his death, if need be. O
          brothers, sisters, if we do this and follow Jesus, putting our feet
          into the footprints of his pierced feet, he will make us fishers of
          men. If it should so please him that we should even die without having
          gathered many souls to the cross, we shall speak from our graves. In
          some way or other the Lord will make a holy life to be an influential
          life. It is not possible that a life which can be described as a
          following of Christ should be an unsuccessful one in the sight of the
          Most High. "Follow me," and there is an "I will" such as God can never
          draw back from: "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus much on the first point. There is something for us to do: we are
          graciously called to follow Jesus. Holy Spirit, lead us to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But secondly, and briefly, there is SOMETHING FOR THE LORD TO DO.
          When his dear servants are following him, he says, "I will make you
          fishers of men;" and be it never forgotten that it is he that makes us
          follow him; so that if the following of him be the step to being made
          a fisher of men, yet this he gives us. 'Tis all of his Spirit. I have
          talked about catching his spirit, and abiding in him, and obeying him,
          and hearkening to him, and copying him; but none of these things are
          we capable of apart from his working them all in us. "From me is thy
          fruit found," is a text which we must not for a moment forget. So,
          then, if we do follow him, it is he that makes us follow him; and so
          he makes us fishers of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, further, if we follow Christ he will make us fishers of men by
          all our experience. I am sure that the man who is really consecrated
          to bless others will be helped in this by all that he feels,
          especially by his afflictions. I often feel very grateful to God that
          I have undergone fearful depression of spirits. I know the borders of
          despair, and the horrible brink of that gulf of darkness into which my
          feet have almost gone; but hundreds of times I have been able to give
          a helpful grip to brethren and sisters who have come into that same
          condition, which grip I could never have given if I had not known
          their deep despondency. So I believe that the darkest and most
          dreadful experience of a child of God will help him to be a fisher of
          men if he will but follow Christ. Keep close to your Lord and he will
          make every step a blessing to you. If God in providence should make
          you rich, he will fit you to speak to those ignorant and wicked rich
          who so much abound in this city, and so often are the cause of its
          worst sin. And if the Lord is pleased to let you be very poor you can
          go down and talk to those wicked and ignorant poor people who so often
          are the cause of sin in this city, and so greatly need the gospel. The
          winds of providence will waft you where you can fish for men. The
          wheels of providence are full of eyes, and all those eyes will look
          this way to help us to be winners of souls. You will often be
          surprised to find how God has been in a house that you visit: before
          you get there, his hand has been at work in its chambers. When you
          wish to speak to some particular individual, God's providence has been
          dealing with that individual to make him ready for just that word
          which you could say, but which nobody else but you could say. Oh, be
          you following Christ, and you will find that he will, by every
          experience through which you are passing, make you fishers of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further than that, if you will follow him he will make you fishers of
          men by distinct monitions in your own heart. There are many monitions
          from God's Spirit which are not noticed by Christians when they are in
          a callous condition; but when the heart is right with God and living
          in communion with God, we feel a sacred sensitiveness, so that we do
          not need the Lord to shout, but his faintest whisper is heard. Nay, he
          need not even whisper. "Thou shalt guide me with thine eye." Oh, how
          many mulish Christians there are who must be held in with kit and
          bridle, and receive a cut of the whip every now and then! But the
          Christian who follows his Lord shall be tenderly guided. I do not say
          that the Spirit of God will say to you, "Go and join yourself unto
          this chariot," or that you will hear a word in your ear; but yet in
          your soul, as distinctly as the Spirit said to Philip, "Go and join
          yourself to this chariot," you shall hear the Lord's will. As soon as
          you see an individual, the thought shall cross your mind, "Go and
          speak to that person." Every opportunity of usefulness shall be a call
          to you. If you are ready, the door shall open before you, and you
          shall hear a voice behind you saying, "This is the way; walk ye in
          it." If you have the grace to run in the right way you shall never be
          long without an intimation as to what the right way is. That right way
          shall lead you to river or sea, where you can cast your net, and be a
          fisher of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, too, I believe that the Lord meant by this that he would give
          his followers the Holy Ghost. They were to follow him, and then, when
          they had seen him ascend into the holy place of the Most High, they
          were to tarry at Jerusalem for a little while, and the Spirit would
          come upon them and clothe them with a mysterious power. This word was
          spoken to Peter and Andrew; and you know how it was fulfilled to
          Peter. What a host of fish he brought to land the first time he cast
          the net in the power of the Holy Ghost! "Follow me, and I will make
          you fishers of men."
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, we have no conception of what God could do by this company
          of believers gathered in the Tabernacle to-night. If now we were to be
          filled with the Holy Ghost there are enough of us to evangelize
          London. There are enough here to be the means of the salvation of the
          world. God saveth not by many nor by few. Let us seek a benediction;
          and if we seek it let us hear this directing voice, "Follow me, and I
          will make you fishers of men." You men and women that sit before me,
          you are by the shore of a great sea of human life swarming with the
          souls of men. You live in the midst of millions; but if you will
          follow Jesus, and be faithful to him, and true to him, and do what he
          bids you, he will make you fishers of men. Do not say, "Who shall save
          this city?" The weakest shall be strong enough. Gideon's barley cake
          shall smite the tent, and make it lay along. Samson, with the jawbone,
          taken up from the earth where it was lying bleaching in the sun, shall
          smite the Philistines. Fear not, neither be dismayed. Let your
          responsibilities drive you closer to your Master. Let horror of
          prevailing sin make you look into his dear face who long ago wept over
          Jerusalem, and now weeps over London. Clasp him, and never let go your
          hold. By the strong and mighty impulses of the divine life within you,
          quickened and brought to maturity by the Spirit of God, learn this
          lesson from your Lord's own mouth: "Follow me, and I will make you
          fishers of men." You are not fit for it, but he will make you fit. You
          cannot do it of yourselves, but he will make you do it. You do not
          know how to spread nets and draw shoals of fish to shore, but he will
          teach you. Only follow him, and he will make you fishers of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish that I could somehow say this as with a voice of thunder, that
          the whole church of God might hear it. I wish I could write it in
          stars athwart the sky, "Jesus saith, Follow me, and I will make you
          fishers of men." If you forget the precept, the promise shall never be
          yours. If you follow some other track, or imitate some other leader,
          you shall fish in vain. God grant us to believe fully that Jesus can
          do great things in us, and then do great things by us for the good of
          our fellows!
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The last point you might work out in full for yourselves in your
          private meditations with much profit. We have here A FIGURE FULL OF
          INSTRUCTION. I will give you but two or three thoughts which you can
          use. "I will make you fishers of men." You have been fishers of fish:
          if you follow me, I will make you fishers of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          A fisher is a person who is very dependent, and needs to be trustful.
          He cannot see the fish. One who fishes in the sea must go and cast in
          the net, as it were, at a peradventure. Fishing is an act of faith. I
          have often seen in the Mediterranean men go with their boats and
          enclose acres of sea with vast nets; and yet, when they have drawn the
          net to shore, they have not had as much result as I could put in my
          hand. A few wretched silvery nothings have made up the whole take. Yet
          they have gone again and cast the great net several times a day,
          hopefully expecting something to come of it. Nobody is so dependent
          upon God as the minister of God. Oh, this fishing from the Tabernacle
          pulpit! What a work of faith! I cannot tell that a soul will be
          brought to God by it. I cannot judge whether my sermon will be
          suitable to the persons who are here, except that I do believe that
          God will guide me in the casting of the net. I expect him to work
          salvation, and I depend upon him for it. I love this complete
          dependence, and if I could be offered a certain amount of preaching
          power, by which I could save sinners, which should be entirely at my
          own disposal, I would beg the Lord not to let me have it, for it is
          far more delightful to be entirely dependent upon him at all times. It
          is good to be a fool when Christ is made unto you wisdom. It is a
          blessed thing to be weak if Christ becomes more fully your strength.
          Go to work, you who would be fishers of men, and yet feel your
          insufficiency. You that have no strength, attempt this divine work.
          Your Master's strength will be seen when your own has all gone. A
          fisherman is a dependent person, he must look up for success every
          time he puts the net down; but still he is a trustful person, and
          therefore he casts in the net joyfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          A fisherman who gets his living by it is a diligent and persevering
          man. The fishers are up at dawn. At day-break our fishermen off the
          Doggerbank are fishing, and they continue fishing till late in the
          afternoon. As long as hands can work men will fish. May the Lord Jesus
          make us hard-working, persevering, unwearied fishers of men! "In the
          morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand; for
          thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that."
        </p>
        <p>
          The fisherman in his own craft is intelligent and watchful. It looks
          very easy, I dare say, to be a fisherman, but you would find that it
          was no child's play if you were to take a real part in it. There is an
          art in it, from the mending of the net right on to the pulling it to
          shore. How diligent the fisherman is to prevent the fish leaping out
          of the net! I heard a great noise one night in the sea, as if some
          huge drum were being beaten by a giant; and I looked out, and I saw
          that the fishermen of Mentone were beating the water to drive the fish
          into the net, or to keep them from leaping out when they had once
          encompassed them with it. Ah, yes! and you and I will often have to be
          watching the corners of the gospel net lest sinners who are almost
          caught should make their escape. They are very crafty, these fish, and
          they use this craftiness in endeavoring to avoid salvation. We shall
          have to be always at our business, and to exercise all our wits, and
          more than our own wits, if we are to be successful fishers of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fisherman is a very laborious person. It is not at all an easy
          calling. He does not sit in an armchair and catch fish. He has to go
          out in rough weathers. If he that regardeth the clouds will not sow, I
          am sure that he that regardeth the clouds will never fish. If we never
          do any work for Christ except when we feel up to the mark, we shall
          not do much. If we feel that we will not pray because we cannot pray,
          we shall never pray, and if we say, "I will not preach to-day because
          I do not feel that I could preach," we shall never preach any
          preaching that is worth the preaching. We must be always at it, until
          we wear ourselves out, throwing our whole soul into the work in all
          weathers, for Christ's sake.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fisherman is a daring man. He tempts the boisterous sea. A little
          brine in his face does not hurt him; he has been wet through a
          thousand times, it is nothing to him. He never expected when he became
          a deep-sea fisherman that he was going to sleep in the lap of ease. So
          the true minister of Christ who fishes for souls will never mind a
          little risk. He will be bound to do or say many a thing that is very
          unpopular; and some Christian people may even judge his utterances to
          be too severe. He must do and say that which is for the good of souls.
          It is not his to entertain a question as to what others will think of
          his doctrine, or of him; but in the name of the Almighty God he must
          feel, "If the sea roar and the fullness thereof, still at my Master's
          command I will let down the net."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, in the last place, the man whom Christ makes a fisher of men is
          successful. "But," says one, "I have always heard that Christ's
          ministers are to be faithful, but that they cannot be sure of being
          successful." Yes, I have heard that saying, and one way I know it is
          true, but another way I have my doubts about it. He that is faithful
          is, in God's way and in God's judgment, successful, more or less. For
          instance, here is a brother who says that he is faithful. Of course, I
          must believe him, yet I never heard of a sinner being saved under him.
          Indeed, I should think that the safest place for a person to be in if
          he did not want to be saved would be under this gentleman's ministry,
          because he does not preach anything that is likely to arouse, impress,
          or convince anybody. This brother is "faithful:" so he says. Well, if
          any person in the world said to you, "I am a fisherman, but I have
          never caught anything," you would wonder how he could be called a
          fisherman. A farmer who never grew any wheat, or any other crop -- is
          he a farmer? When Jesus Christ says, "Follow me, and I will make you
          fishers of men," he means that you shall really catch men -- that you
          really shall save some; for he that never did get any fish is not a
          fisherman. He that never saved a sinner after years of work is not a
          minister of Christ. If the result of his life-work is nil, he made a
          mistake when he undertook it. Go thou with the fire of God in thy hand
          and fling it among the stubble, and the stubble will burn. Be thou
          sure of that. Go thou and scatter the good seed: it may not all fall
          in fruitful places, but some of it will. Be thou sure of that. Do but
          shine, and some eye or other will be lightened thereby. Thou must,
          thou shalt succeed. But remember this is the Lord's word -- "Follow
          me, and I will make you fishers of men." Keep close to Jesus, and do
          as Jesus did, in his spirit, and he will make you fishers of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps I speak to an attentive hearer who is not converted at all.
          Friend, I have the same thing to say to you. You also may follow
          Christ, and then he can use you, even you. I do not know but that he
          has brought you to this place that you may be saved, and that in after
          years he may make you speak for his name and glory. Remember how he
          called Saul of Tarsus, and made him the apostle of the Gentiles.
          Reclaimed poachers make the best gamekeepers; and saved sinners make
          the ablest preachers. Oh, that you would run away from your old master
          to-night, without giving him a minute's notice; for if you give him
          any notice, he will hold you. Hasten to Jesus, and say, "Here is a
          poor runaway slave! My Lord, I bear the fetters still upon my wrists.
          Wilt thou set me free, and make me thine own?" Remember, it is
          written, "Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out." Never
          runaway slave came to Christ in the middle of the night without his
          taking him in; and he never gave one up to his old master. If Jesus
          make you free you shall be free indeed. Flee away to Jesus, then, on a
          sudden. May his good Spirit help you, and he will by-and-by make you a
          winner of others to his praise! God bless you. Amen.

          "Every word is weighted with precious truth, and truth so simply and
          convincingly put that none can fail to understand God's way of
          salvation. Powerful illustrations, apt and original similes, and the
          one affectionate desire to win for Christ and to Christ, make it a
          gospel treasury of priceless worth." -- The Christian.
