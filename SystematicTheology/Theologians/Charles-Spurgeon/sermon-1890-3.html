        <p>To the Bishops of the Province of Egypt.</p>
        <p>
          Zephyrinus, archbishop of the city of Rome, to the most beloved
          brethren who serve the Lord in Egypt.
        </p>
        <p>
          So great trust have we received from the Lord, the Founder of this
          holy seat and of the apostolic church, and from the blessed Peter,
          chief of the apostles, that we may labour with unwearied affection for
          the universal Church which has been redeemed by the blood of Christ,
          and aid all who serve the Lord, and give help to all who live piously
          by apostolic authority. All who will live piously in Christ must needs
          endure reproaches from the impious and aliens, and be despised as
          fools and madmen, that they may be made better and purer who lose the
          good things of time that they may gain those of eternity. But the
          contempt and ridicule of those who afflict and scorn them will be cast
          back upon themselves, when their abundance shall change to want, and
          their pride to confusion.
