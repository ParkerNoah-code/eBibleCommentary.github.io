          The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine; The
          God of my rock, in him will I trust;<br />My shield, and the horn of
          my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge; My saviour, thou savest me
          from violence.<br />I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be
          praised: So shall I be saved from mine enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the waves of death compassed me,<br />The floods of ungodliness
          made me afraid.<br />The cords of Sheol were round about me:<br />The
          snares of death came upon me.<br />In my distress I called upon the
          LORD,<br />Yea, I called unto my God:<br />And he heard my voice out
          of his temple,<br />And my cry came into his ears.<br />Then the earth
          shook and trembled,<br />The foundations of heaven moved<br />And were
          shaken, because he was wroth.<br />There went up a smoke out of his
          nostrils,<br />And fire out of his mouth devoured:<br />Coals were
          kindled by it.<br />He bowed the heavens also, and came down;<br />And
          thick darkness was under his feet.<br />And he rode upon a cherub, and
          did fly:<br />Yea, he was seen upon the wings of the wind.<br />And he
          made darkness pavilions round about him,<br />Gathering of waters,
          thick clouds of the skies.<br />At the brightness before him coals of
          fire were kindled The LORD thundered from heaven,<br />And the Most
          High uttered his voice.<br />And he sent out arrows, and scattered
          them;<br />Lightning, and discomfited them.<br />Then the channels of
          the sea appeared,<br />The foundations of the world were laid bare,<br />By
          the rebuke of the LORD,<br />At the blast of the breath of his
          nostrils<br />He sent from on high, he took me;<br />He drew me out of
          many waters;<br />He delivered me from my strong enemy,<br />From them
          that hated me;<br />For they were too mighty for me.<br />They came
          upon me in the day of my calamity:<br />But the LORD was my stay.<br />He
          brought me forth also into a large place:<br />He delivered me,
          because he delighted in me.<br />The LORD rewarded me according to my
          righteousness: According to the cleanness of my hands hath he
          recompensed me. For I have kept the ways of the LORD,<br />And have
          not wickedly departed from my God.<br />For all his judgements were
          before me:<br />And as for his statutes, I did not depart from them. I
          was also perfect toward him,<br />And I kept myself from mine
          iniquity.<br />Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my
          righteousness; According to my cleanness in his eyesight.<br />With
          the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful,<br />With the perfect
          man thou wilt shew thyself perfect; With the pure thou wilt shew
          thyself pure;<br />And with the perverse thou wilt shew thyself
          froward. And the afflicted people thou wilt save:<br />But thine eyes
          are upon the haughty,<br />That thou mayest bring them down.
        </p>
        <p>
          For thou art my lamp, O LORD:<br />And the LORD will lighten my
          darkness.<br />For by thee I run upon a troop:<br />By my God do I
          leap over a wall.<br />As for God, his way is perfect:<br />The word
          of the LORD is tried;<br />He is a shield unto all them that trust in
          him.<br />For who is God, save the LORD?<br />And who is a rock, save
          our God?<br />God is my strong fortress:<br />And he guideth the
          perfect in his way.<br />He maketh his feet like hinds' feet:<br />And
          setteth me upon my high places.<br />He teacheth my hands to war;<br />So
          that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.<br />Thou hast also given me
          the shield of thy salvation: And thy gentleness hath made me great.<br />Thou
          hast enlarged my steps under me,<br />And my feet have not slipped.<br />I
          have pursued mine enemies,<br />And destroyed them;<br />Neither did I
          turn again till they were consumed.<br />And I have consumed them,<br />And
          smitten them through that they cannot arise:<br />Yea, they are fallen
          under my feet.<br />For thou hast girded me with strength unto the
          battle: Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. Thou
          hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, That I might cut
          off them that hate me.<br />They looked, but there was none to
          save;<br />Even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.<br />Then did
          I beat them small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the
          mire of the streets, and did spread them abroad.<br />Thou also hast
          delivered me from the strivings of my people; Thou hast kept me to be
          the head of the nations:<br />A people whom I have not known shall
          serve me.<br />The strangers shall submit themselves unto me:<br />As
          soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me.<br />The strangers shall
          fade away,<br />And shall come trembling out of their close places.
        </p>
        <p>
          The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock;<br />And exalted be the God
          of the rock of my salvation: Even the God that executeth vengeance for
          me,<br />And bringeth down peoples under me,<br />And that bringeth me
          forth from mine enemies:<br />Yea, thou liftest me up above them that
          rise up against me: Thou deliverest me from the violent man.<br />Therefore
          I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the nations, And will sing
          praises unto thy name.<br />Great deliverance giveth he to his
          king:<br />And sheweth lovingkindness to his anointed,<br />To David
          and to his seed, for evermore.
