        <p>(Being Vision III of the Rhapsody of 'Zion Redeemed')</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Appeals to Zion</p>
        <p>JEHOVAH</p>
        <p>
          Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the
          LORD: look unto the rock whence ye were hewn, and to the hole of the
          pit whence ye were digged. Look unto Abraham your father, and unto
          Sarah that bare you: for when he was but one I called him, and I
          blessed him, and made him many.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the LORD hath comforted Zion: he hath comforted all her waste
          places, and hath made her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like
          the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein,
          thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.
        </p>

        <p>JEHOVAH</p>
        <p>
          Attend unto me, O my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation; for a
          law shall go forth from me, and I will make my judgement to rest for a
          light of the peoples. My righteousness is near, my salvation is gone
          forth, and mine arms shall judge the peoples; the isles shall wait for
          me, and on mine arm shall they trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for
          the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old
          like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner:
          but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be
          abolished.
        </p>
        <p>(No response)</p>
        <p>JEHOVAH</p>
        <p>
          Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart
          is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye dismayed at
          their revilings.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat
          them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my
          salvation unto all generations.

        <p>THE CELESTIAL HOSTS</p>
        <p>
          Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD;<br />Awake, as in
          the days of old,<br />The generations of ancient times!<br />Art thou
          not it that cut Rahab in pieces,<br />That pierced the dragon?<br />Art
          thou not it which dried up the sea,<br />The waters of the great
          deep;<br />That made the depths of the sea<br />A way for the redeemed
          to pass over?
        </p>
        <p>
          And the ransomed of the LORD shall return,<br />And come with singing
          unto Zion;<br />And everlasting joy shall be upon their heads:<br />They
          shall obtain gladness and joy,<br />And sorrow and sighing shall flee
          away.
        </p>
        <p>JEHOVAH</p>
        <p>
          I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou art
          afraid of man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be
          made as grass; and hast forgotten the LORD thy Maker, that stretched
          forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and fearest
          continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor, when he
          maketh ready to destroy? And where is the fury of the oppressor? The
          captive exile shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not die and go
          down into the pit, neither shall his bread fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          For I am the LORD thy God, which stilleth the sea, when the waves
          thereof roar: the LORD of hosts is his name. And I have put my words
          in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I
          may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say
          unto Zion, Thou art my people.
        </p>

        <p>THE CELESTIAL HOSTS</p>
        <p>
          Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem,<br />Which hast drunk at the hand
          of the LORD the cup of his fury; Thou hast drunken the bowl of the cup
          of staggering, and drained it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is none to guide her<br />Among all the sons whom she hath
          brought forth;<br />Neither is there any that taketh her by the
          hand<br />Of all the sons that she hath brought up.
        </p>
        <p>
          These two things are befallen thee;<br />Who shall bemoan thee?<br />Desolation
          and destruction,<br />And the famine, and the sword,<br />How shall I
          comfort thee?
        </p>
        <p>
          Thy sons have fainted,<br />They lie at the top of all the streets,<br />As
          an antelope in a net;<br />They are full of the fury of the LORD,<br />The
          rebuke of thy God.
        </p>
        <p>JEHOVAH</p>
        <p>
          Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with
          wine: Thus saith thy Lord, the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the
          cause of his people: Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of
          staggering, even the bowl of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more
          drink it again: and I will put it into the hand of them that afflict
          thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and
          thou hast laid thy back as the ground, and as the street, to them that
          go over.

        <p>THE CELESTIAL HOSTS</p>
        <p>
          Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion;<br />Put on thy beautiful
          garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: For henceforth there shall no
          more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shake thyself from the dust;<br />Arise, sit thee down, O
          Jerusalem:<br />Loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive
          daughter of Zion.
        </p>
        <p>JEHOVAH</p>
        <p>
          For thus saith the LORD, Ye were sold for nought, and ye shall be
          redeemed without money. For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went
          down at the first into Egypt to sojourn there: and the Assyrian
          oppressed them without cause. Now therefore, what do I here, saith the
          LORD, seeing that my people is taken away for nought? They that rule
          over them do howl, saith the LORD, and my name continually all the day
          is blasphemed. Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they
          shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak: Behold it is I!
        </p>

        <p>The Awakening</p>
        <p>CHORUS OF WATCHMEN</p>
        <p>
          How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him That bringeth
          good tidings, that publisheth peace,<br />That bringeth good tidings
          of good, that publisheth salvation: That saith unto Zion, Thy God
          reigneth!
        </p>
        <p>
          The voice of thy Watchmen! they lift up the voice,<br />Together do
          they sing,<br />For they shall see, eye to eye,<br />How the LORD
          returneth to Zion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Break forth into joy, sing together,<br />Ye waste places of
          Jerusalem:<br />For the LORD hath comforted his people,<br />He hath
          redeemed Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          The LORD hath made bare his holy arm<br />In the eyes of all the
          nations;<br />And all the ends of the earth<br />Shall see the
          salvation of our God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence,<br />Touch no unclean
          thing;<br />Go ye out of the midst of her;<br />Be ye clean, ye that
          bear the vessels of the LORD.
        </p>
        <p>
          For ye shall not go out in haste,<br />Neither shall ye go by
          flight;<br />For the LORD will go before you,<br />And the God of
          Israel will be your rearward.
