        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.202)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, June 27, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens</p>
        <p>
          "And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking
          unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest
          thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks." -- Acts
          26:14.
        </p>
        <p>
          HOW MARVELLOUS the condescension which induced the Saviour to take
          notice of such a wretch as Saul! Enthroned in the highest heavens,
          amidst the eternal melodies of the redeemed, and the seraphic sonnets
          of the cherubim and all the angelic hosts, it was strange that the
          Saviour should stoop himself from his dignity to speak to a
          persecutor. Engaged as he is both day and night in pleading the cause
          of his own church before his Father's throne, it is condescension
          indeed which could induce him, as it were, to suspend his
          intercessions, in order that he might speak personally to one who had
          sworn himself his enemy. And what grace was it that could lead the
          Saviour's heart to speak to such a man as Saul, who had breathed out
          threatenings against his church? Had he not haled men and women to
          prison; had he not compelled them in every synagogue to blaspheme the
          name of Jesus Christ? and now Jesus himself must interpose to bring
          him to his senses! Ah, had it been a thunderbolt which quivered in its
          haste to reach the heart of man, we should not have marvelled, or had
          the lips of the Saviour been heaving with a curse we should not have
          been astonished. Had he not himself in his own lifetime cursed the
          persecutor? Did he not say, whosoever shall offend one of the least of
          these my little ones, it here better for him that a millstone were
          hanged about his neck, and that be were cast in the sea? But now the
          man that is cursed by that language, is yet to be blessed by him whom
          he had persecuted; who though he had stained his hand in blood, and
          had now the commission in his hands to drag others to prison, though
          he had kept the clothes of those who had stoned Stephen, yet the
          Master, the King of heaven, must himself speak from the upper skies to
          bring him to feel the need of a Saviour, and to make him partaker of
          precious faith. I say this is marvellous condescension and matchless
          grace. But, beloved, when we come to recollect the Saviour's character
          it is but little wonderful that he should do this for he has done far
          more than this. Did he not in person leave the starry thrones of
          heaven, and come down to earth to suffer, and bleed and die? But when
          I think of Bethlehem's manger, of the cruel garden of Gethsemane, and
          the yet more shameful Calvary, I do not wonder that the Saviour should
          do any act of grace or condescension. That being done, what can be
          greater? If he hath stooped from heaven into hades, what greater stoop
          can he accomplish? If his own throne must be left empty, if his own
          crown must he relinquished, if his Godhead must be veiled in flesh,
          and the splendours of his deity clothed in the rags of manhood, what
          wonder, I say, that he should stoop to speak even to Saul of Tarsus,
          to bring his heart to himself? Beloved, some of us do not wonder
          either, for although we have not had greater grace than the apostle
          himself we have had no less. The Saviour did not speak out of heaven
          to us with a voice that others might hear, but he spoke with a voice
          that our conscience heard. We were not blood-thirsty, it may be,
          against his children, but we had sins both black and heinous; yet he
          stopped us. Not content with wooing us or with threatening us, not
          content with sending his ministers to us and giving us his word to
          warn us of duty, be would come himself. And you and I, beloved, who
          have tasted of this grace, can say it was matchless love that saved
          Paul, but not love unexampled; for he hath saved us also, and made us
          partakers of the same grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          I intend, this morning, to address myself more particularly to those
          who fear not the Lord Jesus Christ, but on the contrary, oppose him. I
          think I may be quite certain that I have none here who go the length
          of desiring to see the old persecution of the church revived. I do not
          think there is an Englishman, however much he may hate religion, who
          would wish to see the stake again in Smithfield, and the burning pile
          consuming the saints. There may be some who hate them as much, but
          still not in that fashion; the common sense of the age reviles against
          the gibbet, the sword, and the dungeon. The children of God, in this
          country at least, are quite safe from any political persecution of
          that kind, but it is highly probable that I have here this morning
          some who go to the full length of their tether, and who endeavor as
          much as lieth in them to provoke the Lord to anger by opposing his
          cause. You will perhaps recognize yourselves if I try to paint a
          picture. It is seldom that you ever go into the house of God, in fact
          you have a contempt for all the gatherings of the righteous; you have
          a notion that all saints are hypocrites, that all professors are
          cants, and you do not at times blush to say so. However, you have a
          wife, and that wife of yours has been impressed under the sound of the
          ministry; she loves to go to the house of God, and heaven and her
          heart alone know what grief and agony of mind you have caused her. How
          often have you taunted and jeered her on account of her profession!
          You cannot deny but that she is a better woman for it; you are obliged
          to confess that although she cannot go with you in all your sports and
          merriments, yet as far as she can go she is a loving and affectionate
          wife to you. If any one should find fault with her, you would right
          manfully defend her character; but it is her religion that you hate;
          and it is but lately that you threatened to lock her up on Sunday. You
          say it is impossible for you to live in the house with her if she will
          go up to the house of God. Moreover there is a little child of yours,
          you had no objection to that child going to the Sunday-school, because
          she was out of your way on the Sunday when you were smoking your pipe
          in your shirt sleeves; you did not want to be bothered with your
          children, you said, and therefore you were glad to pack them off to
          the Sunday-school, but that child has had her heart touched; and you
          cannot help seeing that the religion of Christ is in her heart,
          therefore you do not like it, you love the child, but you would give
          anything if she were not what she is; you would give anything if you
          could crush the last spark of religion out of her. But perhaps I can
          put your case yet. You are a master; you occupy a respectable
          position, you have many men under you, you cannot bear a man to make a
          profession of religion. Other masters you know have said to their men,
          "Do as you like, so long as you are a good servant, I do not care
          about your religious views." But mayhap you are a little the reverse;
          although you would not turn a man away because of his religion you
          give him a jeer every now and then, and if you trip him up in a little
          fault, you say, "Ah! that is your religion, I suppose you learned that
          at chapel;" grieving the poor man's soul, while he endeavors as far as
          he can to discharge his duty to you. Or, you are a young man, employed
          in a warehouse or a shop, and there is one of your shopmates who has
          lately taken to religion, he is to be found on his knees in prayer --
          what fine fun you have made of him lately, haven't you? You and others
          have joined in like a pack of hounds after a poor hare and he being of
          rather a timid turn of mind, perhaps is silent before you, or if he
          speaks, the tear is in his eye, because you have wounded his spirit.
          Now this is the selfsame spirit that kindled the firebrand of old;
          that stretched the saint upon the rack; that cut his body in pieces,
          and sent him to wander about in sheep skins and in goat skins. If I
          have not exactly hit your character yet, I may do it before I have
          done. I wish to address myself especially to those of you, who in word
          or deed or in any other manner, persecute the children of God; or if
          you do not like so hard a word as "persecute," laugh at them, opposing
          them, and endeavor to put an end to the good work in their hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall in the name of Christ, first put the question to you, "Saul,
          Saul, why persecutest thou me?" In the second place, I shall in
          Christ's name expostulate with you, "It is hard for thee to kick
          against the pricks;" and then if God shall bless what is said to the
          touching of your heart, it may be that the Master shall give you a few
          words of comfort, as he did the apostle Paul, when he said, "Rise and
          stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose,
          to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou
          hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In the first place, then, we will consider THE QUESTION, WHICH
          JESUS CHRIST PUT OUT OF HEAVEN TO PAUL, has been put to you this
          morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, notice what a personal question it was, "Saul, Saul, why
          persecutest thou me?" When I preach to you, I am obliged to address
          you all as an assembly; it is not possible for me, except on rare
          occasions, to single out an individual, and describe his character,
          although under the hand of the Spirit it is sometimes done; but in the
          main I am obliged to describe the character as a whole, and deal with
          it in the mass. But not so our Master; he did not say out of heaven.
          "Saul, why does the synagogue persecute me? Why do the Jews hate my
          religion?" No; it was put more pertinently than that -- "Saul, Saul,
          why persecutest thou me?" If it had been put in general terms, it
          would have glanced off from the heart of the apostle; it could have
          been like an arrow which had missed the mark, and barely grazed the
          skin of the man in whose heart it was intended to find a home; but
          when it came personally -- "Why persecutest thou me?" -- there was no
          getting off it. I pray the Lord to make the question personal to some
          of you. There be many of us here present who have had personal
          preaching to our souls. Do you not remember, dear brother in Christ,
          when you were first pricked in the heart, how personal the preacher
          was? I remember it well. It seemed to me that I was the only person in
          the whole place, as if a black wall were round about me, and I were
          shut in with the preacher, something like the prisoners at the
          Penitentiary, who each sit in their box and can see no one but the
          chaplain. I thought all he said was meant for me; I felt persuaded
          that some one knew my character, and had written to him and told him
          all, and that he had personally picked me out. Why, I thought he fixed
          his eyes on me; and I have reason to believe he did, but still he said
          he knew nothing about my case. Oh, that men would hear the word
          preached, and that God would so bless them in their hearing, that they
          might feel it to have a personal application to their own hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          But note again -- the Apostle received some information as to the
          persecuted one. If you had asked Saul who it was he persecuted, he
          would have said, "Some poor fishermen, that had been setting up an
          impostor; I am determined to put them down. Why, who are they? They
          are the poorest of the world; the very scum and draff of society; if
          they were princes and kings we perhaps might let them have their
          opinion; but these poor miserable ignorant fellows, I do not see why
          they are to be allowed to carry out their infatuation, and I shall
          persecute them. Moreover, most of them are women I have been
          persecuting -- poor ignorant creatures. What right have they to set
          their judgment up above the priests? They have no right to have an
          opinion of their own, and therefore it is quite right for me to make
          them turn away from their foolish errors." But see in what a different
          light Jesus Christ puts it. He does not say, "Saul, Saul, why didst
          thou persecute Stephen?" or "Why art thou about to drag the people of
          Damascus to prisons?" No -- "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" Did
          you ever think of it in that light? You have got a poor man who works
          for you, who wears a fustian jacket. He is nobody. You may laugh at
          him. He will not tell anybody, or even if he does, you will not be
          called to book about it, because he is nobody. You dare not laugh so
          at a duke or an earl. You would mind your behavior if you were in such
          company as that; but because this is a poor man, you think you have a
          license given you to laugh at his religion. But remember, that beneath
          the fustian jacket there is Jesus Christ himself. Inasmuch as you have
          done this unto one of the least of his brethren, you have done it unto
          him. Has the thought ever struck you, that when you laughed you were
          laughing, not at him, but at his Master? Whether it struck you or not
          it is a great truth, that Jesus Christ takes all the injuries which
          are done to his people as if they had been done to him. You locked
          your wife out the other night, did you, because she would frequent the
          house of God? When she stood there shivering in the midnight air, or
          entreating you to let her in, if your eyes had been wide open, you
          would have seen the Lord of life and glory shivering there, and he
          might have said to you, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" And
          then you would have seen it to have been a very much greater sin than
          you imagine it now to be. You laughed at a little child the other day,
          because the child sang its simple hymn, and evidently sang it from its
          heart. Did you know, -- or if you did not know it then, know it now,
          -- did you know that you were laughing at Christ; that when you mocked
          her you were mocking her Master, and that Jesus Christ has set down
          that laugh in his great book, as an indignation done to his own real
          person. "Why persecutest thou me?" If ye could see Christ enthroned in
          heaven, reigning there in the splendours of his majesty, would ye
          laugh at him? If ye could see him sitting on his great throne coming
          to judge the world, would ye laugh at him? Oh! as all the rivers run
          into the sea, so all the streams of the churches suffering ran into
          Christ. If the clouds be full of rain they empty themselves upon the
          earth, and if the Christian's heart be full of woes it empties itself
          into the breast of Jesus. Jesus is the great reservoir of all his
          people's woes, and by laughing at his people you help to fill that
          reservoir to its brim. and one day will it burst in the fury of its
          might and the floods shall sweep you away, and the sand foundation
          upon which your house is builded shall give way, and then what shall
          ye do when ye shall stand before the face of him whose person ye have
          mocked and whose name ye have despised?
        </p>
        <p>
          We will put the question in another way; it is a very reasonable one,
          and seems to demand an answer. "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
          "Saul," the Master might have said, "what have I done to hurt thee?
          When I was on earth did I say a word against thy character -- did I
          damage thy reputation -- did I injure thy person -- did I ever grieve
          thee -- did I ever say a hard word against thee? What hurt have I ever
          done thee? Why art thou so provoked against me? If I had been thy
          bitterest enemy, and had spit in thy face, thou couldest not have been
          more wroth with me than now. But why, man, wilt thou be angry against
          one who has never hurt thee -- who has never done thee a displeasure?
          Oh! why persecutest thou me? Is there anything in my character that
          deserves it? Was I not pure, and holy, and separate from sinners? Did
          I not go about doing good? I raised the dead, I healed the lepers. I
          fed the hungry. I clothed the naked; for which of these works dost
          thou hate me? Why persecutest thou me?" The question comes home to you
          in the same manner this morning. Ah! man, why dost thou persecute
          Christ? He puts it to thee. What hurt has he ever done thee? Has
          Christ ever despoiled you, robbed you, injured you in any way
          whatever? Has his gospel in any way whatever taken away the comforts
          of life from you, or done you any damage? You dare not say that. If it
          were the Mormonism of Joe Smith, I wonder not that you should
          persecute it, though, even then, you would have no right to do so, for
          that might take the wife of your bosom from you. If it were a filthy
          and lustful system that would undermine the foundations of society,
          you might think yourself right in persecuting it. But has Christ ever
          taught his disciples to rob you, to cheat you, to curse you? Does not
          his doctrine teach the very reverse, and are not his followers, when
          they are true to their Master and themselves, the very reverse of
          this? Why hate a man who has done you no injury? Why hate a religion
          that does not interfere with you? If you will not follow Christ
          yourself, how does it injure you to let others do so? You say it
          injures your family; prove it, sir. Has it injured your wife? Does she
          love you less than before? Is she less obedient? You dare not say
          that. Has it hurt your child? Is your child less reverent to his
          father because he fears God? Is he less fond of you because he loves
          his Redeemer best of all? In what respect has Christ ever hurt any of
          you? He has fed you with the bounties of his providence. The clothes
          you wear to-day are the gifts of his bounty. The breath in your
          nostrils he has preserved to you, and will you curse him for this? It
          was but the other day that an avenging angel seized the axe, and the
          Master said, "Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?" And Jesus
          came and put his hand upon the auger's arm, and said, "Stay, stay yet
          another year until I have digged about it and dunged it." Your life
          was spared by him, and you curse him for this; you blaspheme him
          because he has spared your life, and spend the breath which his own
          grace has given you, in cursing the God that allows you to breathe.
          You little know from how many dangers Christ in his providence
          protects you. You can little guess how numerous the mercies which,
          unseen by you, are poured into your lap every hour. And yet, for
          mercies innumerable, for grace that cannot be stopped by your
          iniquity, for love that cannot be overpowered by your injuries, do you
          curse the Saviour for all this? Base ingratitude! Truly, ye have hated
          him without a cause; ye have persecuted him, though he has loved you,
          and has done nought to injure you.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let me picture the Master to you once more, and methinks you will
          never, never persecute him again, if you do but see him. Oh, if you
          could but see the Lord Jesus, you must love him; if you did but know
          his worth you could not hate him! He was more beautiful than all the
          sons of men. Persuasion sat upon his lips, as if all the bees of
          eloquence had brought their honey there, and made his mouth the hive.
          He spoke and so did he speak, that if a lion had heard him, it would
          have crouched and licked his feet. Oh, how roving was he in his
          tenderness! Remember that prayer of his when the iron was piercing his
          hand -- "Father, forgive them." You never heard him, all his life
          long, once saying an angry word to those who persecuted him. He was
          reviled, but he reviled not again. Even when he was led like a lamb to
          the slaughter, he was dumb before his shearers, and he opened not his
          mouth. But though fairer than the sons of men, both in person and in
          character, yet he was the Man of Sorrows. Grief had ploughed his brow
          with her deepest furrows. His cheeks were sunken and hollow with
          agony. He had fasted many a day, and often had he thirsted. He toiled
          from morning to night; then spent all night in prayer; then rose again
          to labour -- and all this without reward -- with no hope of getting
          anything from any man. He had no house, no home, no gold, no saver.
          Foxes had holes and the birds of the air had nests, but he, the Son of
          Man, had not where to lay his head. He was the persecuted man, hunted
          by his enemies from place to place, with scarce a friend to help him.
          Oh, had ye seen him; had ye seen his loveliness and his misery united,
          had ye seen his kindness, and yet the cruelty of his enemies, your
          hearts must have melted -- you would have said, "No, Jesus, I cannot
          persecute thee! No, I will stand between thee and the burning
          sunshine. If I cannot be thy disciple, yet at any rate I will not be
          thy opposer. If this cloak can shelter thee in thy midnight
          wrestlings, there it is; and if this waterpot can draw thee water from
          the well, I will let it down and thou shalt have enough; for if I love
          thee not, since thou art so poor, so sad and so good, I cannot hate
          thee. No, I will not persecute thee!" But though I feel certain, if
          you could see Christ, you must say this, yet have you really
          persecuted him in his disciples, in the members of his spiritual body,
          and I therefore put to you the question, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest
          thou me?" God help you to answer that question, and the answer must be
          shame and confusion of face.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. This shall bring me to the second point -- EXPOSTULATION. "It is
          hard for thee to kick against the pricks." There is a figure here;
          there is an allusion to the ox goad. When the ox was yoked for
          ploughing, if he did not move on in as sprightly a manner as was
          desired, the husbandman pricked him with a long rod that ended with an
          iron point. Very likely, as soon as the ox felt the goad, instead of
          going on, he struck out as hard as he could behind him. He kicked
          against the goad, sending the iron deep into his own flesh. Of course
          the husbandman who was guiding him kept his goad there still, and the
          more frequently the ox kicked, the more he was hurt. But go he must.
          He was in the hand of man, who must and will rule the beast. It was
          just his own option to kick as long as he pleased, for he did no harm
          to his driver, but only to himself. You will see that there is a
          beauty in this figure, if I pull it to pieces, and ask you a question
          or two.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is hard for you to kick against the goad; for, in the first place,
          you do not really accomplish your purpose. When the ox kicks against
          the goad it is to spite the husbandman for having goaded him onward;
          but instead of hurting the husbandman it hurts itself. And when you
          have persecuted Christ in order to stop the progress of his gospel,
          let me ask you, have you ever stopped it at all? No; and ten thousand
          like you would not be able to stop the mighty onward rush of the host
          of God's elect. If thou thickest, O man, that thou canst stop the
          progress of Christ's church, go thou and first bind the sweet
          influences of the Pleiades, and bid the universe stand still instead
          of circling round those fair stars! Go, stand by the winds, and bid
          them cease their wailing, or take thy station upon a hoary cliff, and
          bid the roaring sea roll back when its tide is marching on the beach;
          and when thou hast stopped the universe, when sun, moon, and stars
          have been obedient to thy mandate, when the sea hath heard thee and
          obeyed thee, then come forth and stop the omnipotent progress of the
          church of Christ. But thou canst not do it. "The kings of the earth
          set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord,
          and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder,
          and cast away their cords from us." But what said the Almighty? He did
          not even get up to combat with them. "He that sitteth in the heavens
          shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall he speak
          unto them in his wrath and vex them in his sore displeasure. Yet have
          I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion." The church cares not for all
          the noise of the world. "God is our refuge and strength, a very
          present help in trouble. Therefore, will not we fear, though the earth
          be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the
          sea; Though waters thereof roar, and be troubled, and though the
          mountains shake with the swelling thereof." Ah, in your hosts ye have
          not prevailed, and think ye, O puny man, that one by one, ye shall be
          able to conquer? Your wish may be strong enough, but your wish can
          never be accomplished. You may desire it anxiously, but you shall
          never attain thereto.
        </p>
        <p>
          But put it as a personal matter, have you ever succeeded in stopping
          the work of grace in the heart of any one? You tried to laugh it out
          of your wife, but if she really was converted, you never would laugh
          it out of her. You may have tried to vex your little child; but if
          grace be in that child, I defy you and your master the devil to get it
          out. Ay, young man, you may laugh at your shopmate, but he will beat
          you in the long run. He may sometimes be abashed, but you never will
          turn him. If he is a hypocrite you will, and perhaps there will be no
          great loss, but if he be a true soldier of Christ, he can bear a great
          deal more than the laugh of an emptyheaded being like yourself. You
          need not for a moment flatter yourself that he will be afraid of you.
          He will have to endure a greater baptism of suffering than that, and
          he will not be cowed by the first shower of your poor, pitiful,
          malicious folly. And as for you, sir merchant, you may persecute your
          man, but see if you will get him to yield. Why, I know a man whose
          master had tried very hard to make him go against his conscience; but
          he said, "No, sir." And the master thought, "Well, he is a very
          valuable servant; but I will beat him if I can." So he threatened that
          if he did not do as he wished he would turn him away. The man was
          dependent on his master. and he knew not what he should do for his
          daily bread. So he said to his master honestly at once, "Sir, I don't
          know of any other situation, I should be very sorry to leave you, for
          I have been very comfortable. but if it comes to that, sir, I would
          sooner starve than submit my conscience to any one." The man left, and
          the master had to go after him to bring him back again. And so it will
          be in every case. If Christians are but faithful they must win the
          day. It is no use your kicking against them; you cannot hurt them.
          They must, they shall be conquerors through him that hath loved them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is another way of putting it. When the ox kicked against the
          goad, he got no good by it. Kick as he might, he was never benefited
          by it. If the ox had stopped and nibbled a blade of grass or a piece
          of hay, why, then he would have been wise, perhaps, in standing still.
          but to stand still simply to be goaded and to kick, simply to have
          iron stuck into your flesh, is a rather foolish thing. Now, I ask you,
          what have you ever got by opposing Christ? Suppose you say you don't
          like religion, what have you ever got by hating it? I will tell you
          what you have got. You have got those red eyes sometimes on the Monday
          morning, after the drunkenness of the Sunday night. I will tell you
          what you have got, young man. You have got that shattered
          constitution, which, even if you had now turned it to the paths of
          virtue, must hang about you till you leave it in your grave. What have
          you got? Why, there are some of you who might have been respectable
          members of society, who have got that old broken hat, that old ragged
          coat, that drunken, slouched manner about you, and that character that
          you would like to let down and run away from, for it is no good to
          you. That is what you have got by opposing Christ. What have you got
          by opposing him? Why, a house without furniture -- for through your
          drunkenness you have had to sell everything of value you had. You have
          got your children in rags. and your wife in misery, and your eldest
          daughter, perhaps, running into shame, and your son rising up to curse
          the Saviour, as you yourself have done. What have you got by opposing
          Christ! What man in all the world ever got anything by it? There is a
          serious loss sustained, but as for gain, there is nothing of the sort.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you say, though you have opposed Christ, still you are moral.
          Again I will put it to you -- Have you ever got anything even then by
          opposing Christ? Has it made your family any the happier, do you
          think? Has it made you any the happier yourself? Do you feel after you
          have been laughing at your wife, or your child or your man, that you
          can sleep any the sounder? Do you feel that to be a thing which will
          quiet your conscience when you come to die? Remember, you must die;
          and do you think that when you are dying, it will afford you any
          consolation to think that you did your best to destroy the souls of
          other people? No. you must confess it is a poor game. You are getting
          no good by it, but you are doing yourself a positive injury. Ah,
          drunkard, go on with your drunkenness, remember that every drunken fit
          leaves a plague behind it -- that you will have to feel one day. It is
          pleasant to sin to-day, but it will not be pleasant to reap the
          harvest of it tomorrow the seeds of sin are sweet when we sow them,
          but the fruit is frightfully bitter when we come to house it at last.
          The wine of sin tasteth sweet when it goeth down, but it is as gall
          and vinegar in the bowels. Take heed, ye that hate Christ and oppose
          his gospel for as certainly as the Lord Jesus Christ is the Son of
          God, and his religion is true, you are heaping on your head a load of
          injury, instead of deriving good. "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
          me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."
        </p>
        <p>
          But kick as the ox might, it had to go forward at last. We have seen a
          horse stand still in the street, and the driver, who had not very much
          patience with him, has so belaboured him, that we wondered how the
          poor horse could stand still under such a torrent of blows; but we
          have observed at last that the horse is obliged to go on, and we
          wondered what he got by standing still. It is just the same with you.
          If the Lord means to make a Christian out of you, you may kick against
          Christianity, but he will have you at last. If Jesus Christ intends
          your salvation you may curse him, but he will make you preach his
          gospel one day, if he likes to do so. Ah, if Christ had willed it,
          Voltaire who cursed him, might have made a second apostle Paul. He
          could not have resisted sovereign grace, if Christ had so determined.
          If anyone had told the apostle Paul when he was going to Damascus,
          that he would one day become a preacher of Christianity, he would no
          doubt, have laughed at it as ridiculous nonsense; but the Lord had the
          key of his will, and he wound it up as he pleased. And so it will be
          with you -- if he has determined to have you as one of his followers
          --
        </p>
        <p>"If, as the eternal mandate ran</p>
        <p>Almighty grace arrest that man," --</p>
        <p>
          Almighty grace will arrest you; and the bloodiest of persecutors will
          be made the boldest of saints. Then why persecutest thou me? Perhaps
          you are despising the very Saviour you will one day love; trying to
          knock down the very thing that you will one day try to build up.
          Mayhap you are persecuting the men you will call your brothers and
          sisters. It is always well for a man not to go so far that he cannot
          go back respectably. Now do not go too far in opposing Christ. for one
          of these times it may be you will be very glad to come crouching at
          his feet. But there is this sad reflection, if Christ does not save
          you, still you must go on. You may kick against the pricks, but you
          cannot get away from his dominion; you may kick against Christ, but
          you cannot cast him from his throne, you cannot drag him out of
          heaven. You may kick against him, but you cannot prevent his
          condemning you at last. You may laugh at him, but you cannot laugh
          away the day of judgment. You may scoff at religion; but all your
          scoffs cannot put it out. You may jeer at heaven; but all your jeers
          will not take one single note from the harps of the redeemed. No, the
          thing is just the same as if you did not kick; it makes no difference
          except to yourself: Oh how foolish must you be, to persevere in a
          rebellion which is harmful to none but your own soul, which is not
          injurious to him whom you hate, but which, if he pleases, he can stop,
          or if he doth not stop, he can and will revenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now I close up by addressing myself to some here, whose
          hearts are already touched. Do you this morning feel your need of a
          Saviour? Are you conscious of your guilt in having opposed him, and
          has the Holy Spirit made you willing now to confess your sins? Are you
          saying! "Lord, have mercy upon me a sinner?" Then I have GOOD NEWS for
          you. Paul, who persecuted Christ, was forgiven. He says he was the
          very chief of sinners, but he obtained mercy. So shall you. Nay, more,
          Paul not only obtained mercy, he obtained honor. He was made an
          honored minister to preach the gospel of Christ, and so may you. Yes
          if thou repentest, Christ may make use of you to bring others to him.
          It strikes me with wonder when I see how many of the very greatest of
          sinners have become the most useful of men. Do you see John Bunyan
          yonder? He is cursing God. He goes into the belfry and pulls the bell
          on Sunday, because he likes the bellringing, but when the church door
          is open, he is playing bowls upon the village green. There is the
          village tap, and there is no one that laughs so loud there as John
          Bunyan. There are some people going to the meeting house; there is no
          one curses them so much as John. He is a ringleader in all vice. If
          there is a hen roost to be robbed, Jack's your man. If there is any
          iniquity to be done, if there be any evil in the parish, you need not
          guess twice, John Bunyan is at the bottom of it. But who is it stands
          there in the deck before the magistrate? Who is it I heard just now --
          "If you let me out of prison today, I will preach the gospel tomorrow,
          by the help of God?" Who was it that lay twelve years in prison, and
          when they said he might go out if he would promise not to preach,
          replied, "No, I will be here till the moss grows on mine eyelids, but
          I must and will preach God's gospel as soon as I have liberty?" Why,
          that is John Bunyan, the very man who cursed Christ the other day. A
          ringleader in vice has become the glorious dreamer, the very leader of
          God's hosts. See, what God did for him, and what God did for him he
          will do for you, if now you repent and seek the mercy of God in Christ
          Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>"He is able, he is willing, doubt no more."</p>
        <p>
          Oh! I trust I have some here who have hated God, but who are
          nevertheless God's elect; some that have despised him, but who are
          bought with blood; some that have kicked against the pricks, but yet
          almighty grace will bring them onward. There are some here, I doubt
          not, who have cursed God to his face, who shall one day sing
          hallelujahs before his throne; some that have indulged in lusts all
          but bestial, who shall one day wear the white robe, and move their
          fingers along the golden harps of the glorified spirits in heaven.
          Happy is it to have such a gospel to preach to such sinners! To the
          persecutor, Christ is preached. Come to Jesus whom thou hast
          persecuted.
        </p>
        <p>"Come, and welcome, sinner, come."</p>
        <p>
          And now bear with me one moment if I address you yet again. The
          probability stares me in the face that I may have but very few more
          opportunities of addressing you upon subjects that concern your soul.
          My hearer, I shall arrogate nothing to myself, but this one thing --
          "I have not shunned to declare the whole counsel of God," and God is
          my witness with how many sighs, and tears, and prayers, I have labored
          for your good. Out of this place I believe thousands have been called;
          among you whom I now see there is a large number of converted persons;
          according to your own testimony you have had a thorough change, and
          you are not now what you were. But I am conscious of this fact, that
          there are many of you who have attended here now almost these two
          years, who are just what you were when you first came. There are some
          of you whose hearts are not touched. You sometimes weep, but still
          your lives have never been changed; you are yet "in the gall of
          bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity." Well, sirs, if I never
          address you again, there is one favor that I would crave of you. If
          you will not turn to God, if you are determined to be lost, if you
          will not hear my rebuke nor turn at my exhortation, I ask this one
          favor at least let me know, and let me have this confidence, that I am
          clear of your blood. I think you must confess this. I have not shunned
          to preach of hell with all its horrors, until I have been laughed at,
          as if I always preached upon it. I have not shunned to preach upon the
          most sweet and pleasing themes of the gospel, till I have feared lest
          I should make my preaching effeminate, instead of retaining the
          masculine vigor of a Boanerges. I have not shunned to preach the law;
          that great commandment has wrung in your ears, "Thou shalt love the
          Lord thy God, and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." I have
          never feared the great, nor have I courted their smile; I have rebuked
          nobility as I would rebuke the peasantry, and to everyone of you I
          have dealt a portion of meat in due season. I know that this much can
          be said of me -- "Here stands one that never feared the face of man
          yet;" and I hope never wilt. Amidst contumely, and rebuke, and
          reproach, I have sought to be faithful to you and to my God. If then,
          you will be damned, let me have this one thing as a consolation for
          your misery, when I shall think of so frightful a thought -- that you
          are not damned for the want of calling after; you are not lost for the
          want of weeping after, and not lost, let me add, for the want of
          praying after. In the name of him who shall judge the quick and dead
          according to my Gospel, and of him that shall come in the clouds of
          heaven, and by that fearful day when the pillars of this earth shall
          totter, and the heavens shall fall about your ears -- by that day when
          "Depart, ye cursed," or "Come, ye blessed," must be the dread
          alternative, I charge you, lay these things to heart, and as I shall
          face my God to account for my honesty to you, and my faithfulness to
          him, so remember, you must stand before his bar, to give an account of
          how you heard, and how you acted after hearing; and woe unto you if,
          having been lifted up like Capernaum with privileges, you should be
          cast down like Sodom and Gomorrah, or lower still than they, because
          you repented not.
        </p>
        <p>Oh! Master! turn sinners to thyself; for Jesus sake! Amen.</p>
