        <p>"I will rejoice in thy salvation." -- Psalm 9:4.</p>
        <p>
          I DESIRE to continue the topic of the morning, only we will look at
          another side of the same important matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          We spoke this morning, as you have not forgotten, upon these words,
          "Your own salvation." I trust most of us -- would God I could hope all
          of us -- were earnest about our own personal salvation. To those who
          are earnest this second text will be the complement of the first. They
          desire that their own salvation shall be secure; it is their own
          salvation when they obtain it; but here is the guide as to what is the
          right salvation -- what our own salvation ought to be. It is not our
          own in another sense; it is God's. "I will rejoice in thy salvation."
          While it becomes our own by an act of faith, it is not our own so that
          we can claim any merit or take any part of the glorying to ourselves.
          The only salvation that is worth being our own is that which is God's.
          "I will rejoice in thy salvation." Having this morning somewhat at
          length explained what salvation is, showing that it was not a mere
          deliverance from wrath to come, but from the present wrath of God, and
          yet more essentially from sin, from the power of evil within us, there
          is no need that we should go over that again, I trust; but we shall
          begin by noticing the speciality which is in the text, dwelling upon
          the divine salvation. "I will rejoice in thy salvation." So, then, we
          look at once at: --
        </p>
        <p>I. A DIVINE SALVATION.</p>
        <p>
          The salvation we have already spoken of is God's, and it is God's
          salvation in many ways. It was his in the planning. None but himself
          could have planned it. In his infinite wisdom he devised it. The
          salvation which is revealed in the person of Jesus Christ, in the
          gospel is every part of it in all its architecture the fruit of divine
          skill. We may say, "Or with whom took he counsel, and who instructed
          him, and who taught him knowledge?" In every part the divine hand may
          be seen; it is of God's planning and ordaining, or ever the earth was.
          So is it of God's providing. You have salvation wrapped up in the gift
          of the person of Jesus Christ. All of it lies in Christ. Because he
          died, our sin is put away. Because he lives, we shall live also. And
          Christ is the pure gift of God. All salvation is in him, and,
          therefore, all salvation is thus procured by God. It is God's
          salvation. And what is more, God not only plans and procures, but he
          also applies salvation. I believe in free agency, but I never yet met
          with a Christian man who was able to say that he came to Christ of his
          own free will without being drawn by the Spirit of God. Whatever our
          doctrinal view may be, the experimental fact is the same in every
          case. All believers will confess that they are God's workmanship,
          created anew in Christ Jesus. "No man can come unto me except the
          Father which hath sent me draw him." There is a want of power. "Ye
          will not come unto me that ye might have life." There is a want of
          will, and the Spirit of God, therefore, applies the salvation which
          God has planned, and which God has provided. And as the first
          application of this salvation is of God, so is it all the way through.
          I do not believe, dear brethren, that our religion is like the action
          of a clock wound up at first by a superior hand, and then left to go
          alone. No! every day the Holy Ghost must continue to work upon us, and
          in us, to will and to do according to God's good pleasure. And if you
          and I should ever get right up to the gate of pearl, and should hear
          the songs of the blessed within that gate, we should not be able to
          take the last step, but should turn back to our sin and folly even, if
          he that began a good work in us should cease to carry it on. He is
          Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending. "Salvation is of the
          Lord," from first to last. He makes the rough draft of it, in
          conviction, upon our conscience; he goes on to complete the picture;
          and if there be one touch in the picture that is not of God, it is a
          blot upon it. If there be anything of the flesh, it will have to be
          wiped out; it is not consistent with the work of God. Of God is it in
          all respects. Now we know that this salvation is of God, not only
          because we are told that he planned it, and provided it, and applies
          it, but because it has the marks of God upon it. There is a certain
          line of poetry; I know it is Shakespeare's. Well, you know, I cannot
          quite tell you why, but yet I am sure no one ever wrote exactly in
          that way. I am reading the Psalms through, and I read and I say, "That
          is David's." I observe certain critics who say, "No, this belongs to
          the time of the captivity." I am certain it does not. And why? Because
          there is a Davidic ring about it, you know. The son, of Jesse, and he
          alone, could have said such things. Now in salvation there are the
          marks of divine authorship. I once saw a painting by Titan at Venice,
          and he had written, "Fecit, fecit Titian." He claimed it twice over,
          as if to make sure that someone else should not claim it. And God has
          put it three times over that there should be no doubt whatever that
          salvation is of God, and he must have the glory of it. Now observe the
          marks of God -- what I may call the broad arrow of the King -- set on
          salvation. It is full of mercy. Here is salvation for the blackest of
          sinners -- salvation for all manner of sin -- forgiveness for all
          manner of sin -- salvation so full of grace that only God could have
          conceived it. "Who is a pardoning God like thee?" But this salvation
          is equally congenial with justice, for God never absolutely forgives a
          sin. There is always punishment for sin in every case. Jesus Christ,
          the Substitute, comes in and satisfies Justice before the word is
          spoken to the sinner, "Thy transgression is blotted out." In the
          salvation which God has provided on the cross by the death of his dear
          Son there is as much justice as there is mercy; and there is an
          infinity of both. Now this is God-like. Man, if he brings out one
          quality, usually clouds another with it; but God exhibits his
          character in harmonious completeness -- as merciful as if he were not
          just, and as just as if he were not gracious. In the gospel, on this
          account, five see also divine wisdom. Whatever some may say about the
          doctrine of substitution, Christ is still the power of God and the
          wisdom of God. The way, so simple, yet so sublime, by which God is
          just, and yet the justifier of him that believeth, exhibits the
          infinite wisdom of the Most High.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I won't keep you by mentioning all the divine attributes. It is
          certain they all shine in the gospel, nor can any tell which of the
          letters best is writ -- the power, the wisdom, or the grace. They are
          all there, proving the salvation to be of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And there is one other matter. True salvation is of God because it
          draws toward God. If thou hast God's salvation, thou art being drawn
          towards thy heavenly Father, nearer and nearer every day. The ungodly
          forget God; the awakened seek God; but the saved rejoice in God. Ask
          thyself this question, Couldst thou live without God? The ungodly man
          would be happier without God than he is with. It would be the best
          piece of news in the newspaper to thousands, if we could publish it
          to-morrow, that God was dead. To ungodly men it would be like ringing
          the bells of universal Joy; they would run riot after their own will.
          And where would the believer be? He would be an orphan. His sun would
          be blotted out; his hopes would be dead and buried. Judge by this
          whether thou art saved. If thou art saved, thou art drawn to God, thou
          seekest to be like God, thou desirest to honour God. If there be none
          of these things in thee, then I charge thee see to it, for thou art in
          the gall of bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity. God have mercy
          upon thee! I need not further say that the salvation is of God, and
          God must have all the glory of it. All on earth who are saved, and all
          in heaven who are saved, will ascribe their salvation entirely to the
          ever blessed God, and join with Jonah, who in the very depths of the
          sea made this, his confession of faith, "Salvation is of the Lord."
          But now, secondly, our text (having noticed the divine salvation in
          it) has: --
        </p>
        <p>II. AN OUTSPOKEN AVOWAL.</p>
        <p>
          "I will rejoice in thy salvation." Here is someone springing out from
          the common crowd and saying, "I have heard of God's salvation; I will
          rejoice in it! I will rejoice in it! Some despise it. They hear it,
          and they turn a deaf ear. When they have listened to it longest, they
          are most weary of it. But I will rejoice in thy salvation." Here is a
          distinguished character, who is made so, doubtless, by distinguishing
          grace. Oh! I hope there are many of us here who could stand up and say
          -- if this were the time and place -- "Let others say what they will,
          and count the cross a thing to mock at, and Jesus Christ to be
          forgotten, I am his servant; I will rejoice in his salvation." There
          are some that rest in another salvation. We all did so once. But he
          who speaks in the text throws aside self-righteousness as filthy rags.
          He puts it all aside, and says, "I will rejoice in thy salvation." If
          I were righteous, I would not say so. Had I a perfect holiness, I
          would not mention it in comparison with the righteousness of Christ;
          but being an unworthy sinner, without a single merit of my own, I will
          not be so foolish as to patch up a fictitious righteousness, but I
          will rejoice in thy salvation. You see them there! -- those
          worshippers of the scarlet woman -- they are resting in their priest!
          He puts on millinery, blue, pink, scarlet, white, and I know not what
          -- all kinds of little toys to please fools with. And there be some
          that rejoice in that salvation that comes from an "infallible" sinner
          -- that comes from a sham priest of God. But we are looking to Christ,
          who stands before the eternal throne and pleads the merits of his own
          blood. We say: --
        </p>
        <p>"Let all the forms that men devise</p>
        <p>Assault our faith with treacherous art,</p>
        <p>We'll Can them vanity and lies</p>
        <p>And bind the gospel to our heart."</p>
        <p>
          "I will rejoice in thy salvation." There may be some tonight to whom I
          shall speak who are rejoicing in God's salvation through his abundant
          grace who have very little else to rejoice in. You are very poor. Ah!
          how welcome you are to this house! How glad I am that you have come. I
          feel it always a joy that the people have the gospel preached to them.
          Well, you have no broad acres, you have no gold rings on your fingers;
          you come in the garb of toil. Never mind, my brother, lay hold on
          eternal life and say, "I will rejoice in thy salvation." Perhaps you
          are sick to-night -- your poor weak body could scarcely drag itself up
          to the assembly of God's people. Well, well, it is a heavy thing to
          have to suffer so, but if you cannot rejoice in a hale body, yet
          rejoice in his salvation. Look to-night to Jesus; put your trust in
          him alone, and you will have a sufficient well-spring of joy, if you
          have nothing else. Possibly some of you who lay hold on Christ and
          rejoice in him will have hard times of it at home your father will
          mock at you, your mother will not sympathise with you; your workmates
          to-morrow, if they hear that you are converted, will laugh, and jest,
          and jeer at you. What say you? Are you a coward? Will you back out of
          it because it demands a sacrifice? Oh! if it be so, then you are
          indeed unworthy of the name, and you count yourself so; but if you are
          what you should be, you will say, "Let them; laugh at me as they will,
          and spit upon me as they please, I will rejoice in thy salvation."
        </p>
        <p>"If on my face for thy dear name,</p>
        <p>Shame and reproach may be;</p>
        <p>I'll hail reproach and welcome shame,</p>
        <p>For thou'lt remember me."</p>
        <p>
          It takes some pluck, but we ought to have it in the cause of Christ.
          Your mean, miserable wretches that will only go out to follow Christ
          in sunny weather, and get them gone again when a cloud darkens the
          sky, deserve well the wrath that comes upon them. They are like the
          Nautilus, very well on the placid sea, but the first billow that
          arises they furl their sails and drop into the deep, and are seen no
          more. Oh! beware, beware, beware of a sunny-weather religion; beware
          of a religion that will not stand the fire; but be you such that, if
          all the world forsook Christ, you would say, "I will rejoice in his
          salvation"; and if you were turned out of doors, if you were turned
          out of the world itself, and thought not fit, to live, you would yet
          be content to have it so, if you might be numbered with the people of
          God, and be permitted to rejoice in his salvation. Does this, as I try
          to speak it, awaken a holy emotion in any soul here? Is there someone
          who has been a stranger to my Lord who to-night can say, "I desire to
          rejoice in his salvation"? I cannot forget, when I sat as a young lad
          under the gallery of a little place of worship, hearing the gospel
          simply preached -- the blessed moment when I was led to resolve to
          follow Christ. I have never been ashamed of having done so. I have
          never had to regret it. He is a blessed Master. He has handled me
          roughly lately, but he is a blessed Master. I would follow at his
          heels if only like a dog, for it is better to be his dog than to be
          the devil's darling. He is a blessed Master. Let him say what he will,
          and do what he will. Oh! is there no young man here, no youth, no
          child, no girl; is there no gray-headed one who will say, "I will
          rejoice in thy salvation" O eternal Spirit, come and touch some heart,
          and make this, their spiritual birthright, that they may say, "I -- I
          -- I will rejoice in thy salvation."
        </p>
        <p>
          But we must pass on, for time presses. We have, in the third place, to
          consider in the text: --
        </p>
        <p>III. A DELIGHTFUL EMOTION.</p>
        <p>
          We have noticed the divine salvation, and the outspoken avowal; now we
          will notice the delightful emotion. "I will rejoice in thy salvation."
          It is an unfortunate thing that Christianity gets associated with
          melancholy. I will not forbid the banns, for they are not very near of
          kin, but I wish they were further apart every day. It is a good thing
          for the melancholy to become a Christian; it is an unfortunate thing
          for the Christian to become melancholy. If there is any man in the
          world that has a right to have a bright, clear face and a flashing
          eye, it is the man whose sins are forgiven him, and who is saved with
          God's salvation. In order for any man, however, to rejoice in God's
          salvation, he must, first of all, know it. There must be an
          intelligent apprehension of what it is. Next, he must grasp it by an
          act of faith as his own. Then, having grasped it, he must study it to
          know the price at which it was bought, and all the qualities -- the
          divine qualities that follow from it. Then he must hold it fast, and
          seek to get out the sweetness from it. What is there in God's
          salvation that should make us rejoice? I do not know what to select,
          for it is all joy and all rejoicing. It is enough to make our heart to
          ring with joy to think that there should be a salvation at all for
          such poor souls as we are. We may well hang out all the streamers of
          our spirits, and strew the streets of our soul with flowers, for King
          Jesus has come to dwell there. Ring every bell; give him a glorious
          welcome. Let all the soul be glad when Jesus enters and brings
          salvation with him, for the salvation of Christ is so suitable that we
          may well rejoice in it. Dear brother, if you are saved, I know the
          salvation of Christ suited you. It did me -- exactly -- it was made on
          purpose for me. I am as sure of it as if there were no other sinner to
          be saved. It was the gospel that brought power to the weak, nay, it
          brought life to the dead; it brought everything to those that had
          nothing; it is just the sort of gospel for a penniless, bankrupt
          sinner like myself. We rejoice in the suitability of the gospel; we
          rejoice in the freeness of it. We have nothing to pay; we have no
          price to pay, neither of promise, nor of anything that was our own.
          Salvation was freely given to us in Christ Jesus. Let us rejoice in
          it, then. Oh! rejoice in the richness of that salvation. When the Lord
          pardoned our sins, he did not pardon half of them, and leave some of
          them on the book, but with one stroke of the pen he gave a full
          receipt for all our debts. When we went down into the fountain filled
          with blood, and washed, we did not come up half-clean, but there was
          no spot nor wrinkle upon us -- we were white as driven snow. Glory be
          to God for such a rich salvation as this. And he did not in that day
          save us with a perhaps and a chance salvation that set us on a rock,
          and say, "Keep yourself there -- you must depend upon yourselves", but
          this was the covenant he made with us, "A new heart also will I give
          thee, and a right spirit will I put within thee." It was a complete
          salvation, which would not permit a failure. The salvation, which is
          given to the soul that believes is on this wise, "I give unto my sheep
          eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck
          them out of my hand." "The water that I shall give him shall be a well
          of water springing up unto everlasting life." I believe the
          perseverance of the saints to be the very gem of the gospel. I could
          not hold the truth of Scripture if this could be disproved to me, for
          every page seems to have this upon it, if nothing else, that "the
          righteous shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall
          wax stronger and stronger." In this my soul rejoices, that I have a
          salvation to preach to you which, if you receive it, will effectually
          save you if your hearts are given to Christ, and will keep you, and
          preserve you, and bring you into the eternal kingdom of his glory. I
          will rejoice in the certain and abiding character of that salvation.
          Oh! there is enough in the salvation of Christ to make heaven full of
          bliss; there is enough to make us full of praise. Let us take up the
          theme; let us talk by the way to one another about it; let us talk to
          sinners about it; let us recommend religion by our cheerfulness.
          Levity be far from us, but happiness let it be the happiest sphere in
          which we live if we have little else to rejoice in, we have enough
          here. Whatever may be our condition or prospects, we may still rejoice
          in God's salvation, and let us not fail to be filled with this most
          blissful emotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I must close. The text has in it a word of the future which we
          must not quite overlook. Here is a joyful gospel, "I will rejoice in
          thy salvation." You may read it if you like, "I shall" -- "I shall" or
          "I will" -- it would be quite right. The Hebrew has no present. It
          seems to have given up all tenses -- like God himself who was, and is,
          and is to come. I shall rejoice in thy salvation. Now here is:
        </p>
        <p>IV. A BLESSED PROSPECT.</p>
        <p>
          You may live to grow old; well, we shall never grow weary of Christ.
          If we are his people, we shall never have any cause to part from him;
          "I will rejoice in thy salvation." I could bring up to this platform
          an aged brother whom all of you would know, who has infirmities and
          has age creeping upon him, but there is not a happier soul in this
          house than he; and when I had made him speak to you, I could bring you
          many more aged women too, and I would ask them what they think of
          Christ, and I am sure they would say with greater emphasis than I can,
          "I will rejoice in thy salvation." I almost wish my grandfather were
          alive and behind me to-night, for on one occasion I preached with him
          in the pulpit, and when I came to speak of experience he pulled my
          coat-tail and came to the front, and said,"My grandson can tell you
          that he believes it, but I can tell you experimentally," and on the
          old gentleman went with it. Well, many an aged Christian can tell you
          he has rejoiced in God's salvation. He does rejoice, and, instead of
          age making the joy of his youth to become dim, it has mellowed and
          sweetened the fruit, which was sweet even at the first. Oh! that we
          may, when these hairs grow hoar with years, and the snows of many
          winters lie white upon our head, may we still rejoice in God's
          salvation. But then, whether we reach old age or not, there is one
          thing that is certain -- we shall assuredly die, and when we come to
          die, what shall we do? I know what you are thinking of. You say, "I
          should groan." Ay, sinner, you are thinking of the friend that is
          wiping away the clammy sweat from the brow and those closed eyes. Now
          those may never occur. We often hear them mentioned in reference to
          dying beds, but they are not so constantly there as to be, necessary.
          And if they were there' if we did lose sight itself before life fails
          -- what then? Why, the vision of the Christ, who is our salvation, and
          in whom we rejoice, shall then be more gloriously clear and radiantly
          beautiful, because the sights and sounds of earth have vanished from
          us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, instead of looking at these outward parts of dying, think of
          this, "I will rejoice in thy salvation." When I parted from our dear
          brother, Cook, a few days ago, he could not say much. He was very,
          very weak, but what he did say was just this, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is
          all." Well, I talked, and read, and prayed, and so on, and when we had
          done, he simply said, "The blood -- the blood, the blood -- that is
          all my hope." Why, he looked as calm in prospect of dying as any of
          you do in sitting here, and was as delighted with the hope of being
          where Jesus is as ever bride was at the coming of the marriage day. It
          was delightful to see the blessed calm and peace that was upon that
          man of God. And when I come to die, whoever I may be, however little
          my standing in the Church of God is, if I am in Christ, I will rejoice
          in his salvation; I will make the dark valley ring with his praises; I
          will make the river of death itself to roll back as the Red Sea did of
          old, with my triumphant songs; I will enter heaven with this upon my
          heart and upon my lip,'I will rejoice in thy salvation! Worthy is the
          Lamb that was stain to receive honour, and power, and dominion, and
          glory for ever and ever!" And, brethren, if that is what we may do in
          dying, this is what we shall do for ever and ever, "I will rejoice in
          thy salvation." Millions of ages, throughout all the cycles of years
          that interpose ere Christ delivers up the kingdom to God, even the
          Father, and then onward, even through eternity, this always shall be
          our own ground of rejoicing, "I will rejoice in thy salvation."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I cannot come and stand at the door and speak to everyone as the
          congregation withdraws, but if it were possible I should like to stand
          there and shake the hand of everyone that has been in the house
          to-night, and say, "Well, friend, how fares it with you?" Can you say,
          'I will rejoice in thy salvation?'" If I cannot do that, I wish it
          were possible to speak in the silent shades of night to you when you
          awoke, so that you might hear a voice ringing in your ears, "Do you
          rejoice in God's salvation?" Perhaps some of you may have come a long
          distance across the sea. You may be by-and-by on shipboard again. It
          may be that you will be in peril, or it may be that afterwards you
          shall be in sickness. Well, may this evening's congregation in this
          day of July rise up before your minds, and if you forget the preacher
          (and that will not matter), yet if you hear a voice that says, "Can
          you rejoice in God's salvation?" I hope that, even if it is twenty
          years to come, it may then be as the voice of God to your soul, and
          bring you to the Saviour. But better far would it be if you would come
          to him tonight and you may. May the Spirit of God bring you! Whosoever
          believeth on the Lord Jesus Christ hath everlasting life. The whole of
          the gospel is wrapped up in Christ's message, which he has sent by his
          apostles, "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." To you
          each this -- this -- is the word, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,
          and thou shalt be saved, and thy house." God add his own blessing, for
          Christ's sake. Amen.
