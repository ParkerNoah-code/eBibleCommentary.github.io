          |Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee,
          meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.| --
          Matthew 21:5.
        </p>
        <p>
          IT IS NOT OUR INTENTION to preach alone from this verse, but from the
          combined narrative of our Savior's triumphant entry into the city of
          Jerusalem, as contained in the four evangelists.
        </p>
        <p>
          When our Lord was here on earth, he was a humble man before his foes,
          a weary man and full of woes, and only now and then did some glimpses
          of his native royalty burst forth from him; he had now and then a day
          in which his regal rights were assumed and his royal position was
          claimed. He is gone from us now as to his actual presence, but he is
          with us spiritually, and his spiritual presence here is not unlike
          what his bodily presence was in the days of his flesh. For the most
          part, the glory of his gospel presence is unobserved, except among his
          own disciples, and when perceived by others he is still despised and
          rejected of men. He moves up and down among our assemblies, hearing
          our prayers and accepting our praises, but still his honor as a prince
          lies concealed from the eyes of the many who know him not as king by
          right divine. Yet, as in those days, he had his times of clearer
          display and his hours of partial manifestation, even so he has now. He
          gives to his church her glory periods, her days of thanksgiving, her
          court days, and her times of exultation; and I pray God that he may
          grant such times as these to his church now, that in the midst of
          these dull years he may gird his sword upon his thigh, and ride forth
          gloriously in his majesty. Oh, that the streets of his Jerusalem could
          be gladdened by the holy pomp and sacred splendor of his gracious and
          triumphal presence, beloved, the world doth well to salute righteous
          kings with all homage; our nation doth well to honor their
          well-beloved queen, whom may God long preserve! but shall Christ the
          King of kings be without his homage? I must confess I am jealous for
          him, jealous with a burning jealousy that the streets should blaze
          with splendor for the Queen of Britain, and that so little should be
          done in honor of the King immortal, eternal. Lo, the shouts of the
          multitude rend the skies for earthly princes, and I grudge them not;
          but, should there be no upliftings of joyful voices for the Prince of
          Peace? Why this lethargy in his church? Why such slender zeal for the
          Chief among, ten thousand? Why should not earth and heaven ring with
          His praises? If I might say so much as a sentence to-day that should
          lead the tribes to speak a word to bring the King back again to his
          own; if I might excite in any soul a fervent desire that Christ's
          kingdom should more speedily come, and his throne should be exalted
          more on high in the midst of his people, I should be thrice happy. To
          that end shall I endeavor to speak this day. Oh, for the anointing of
          the Holy Ghost to aid me therein.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our points of consideration this morning will he, first, that Christ
          hath even now his glorious days among men; and secondly, that when
          those glorious days come honors are paid to him similar to those
          described by the evangelists on the occasion of his entrance into
          Jerusalem. In the third place I shall remind you that he is wont on
          such occasions to perform the same mighty deeds; and in the close of
          our discourse we shall have to observe that even on those brilliant
          occasions, |all is not gold that glitters.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, here is a very pleasant consideration, that THE LORD
          JESUS HAS, EVEN NOW, BRIGHT AND GLORIOUS DAYS OF SPECIAL MANIFESTATION
          IN HIS CHURCH. He has ridden into his Jerusalem again and again in the
          history of the gospel. We call these times revivals; and in yet more
          scriptural language they are known as |times of refreshing from the
          presence of the Lord.| They usually occur -- (and I shall try to
          follow the narrative in all the remarks I make), they usually occur
          after the Lord has visited his beloved and quickened them. He came
          into Jerusalem after he had raised Lazarus from the dead. His
          omnipotent voice had said, |Lazarus, come forth!| and Lazarus came
          forth, and the grave clothes were loosed from him; then and for that
          cause did the people come to meet our Lord with palm branches. First
          doth the Lord speak to his Church and he saith to her, |Come forth out
          of the grave of thy sloth and thine indifference.| He saith, |Loose
          her, take away the bands of her sloth and her conventionalism, and set
          her free,| and then when he hath restored among his church a people
          whom he loves, and granted to them renewed vigor of spiritual life in
          the power of his resurrection, then it is that the sign of the glory
          of the Son of Man is revealed. I despair, beloved, of any revival
          being of the slightest value which does not begin with the church of
          God. It never can originate outside and work into the interior, this
          is not the rule of spiritual life; it must commence with the spiritual
          in the midst of the church, it must next quicken the mass of the
          discipleship, and then it shall spread to those who are without, and
          in ever widening circles its power shall be felt. But, revival must
          begin at home. Hear ye this ye professors, and take heed lest ye
          hinder Christ of his glory. Hear this ye who profess to be members of
          his church, and beware lest ye be like the damp wood which will not
          kindle, and therefore no fire burneth among the sons of men. Oh, let
          not the Well-beloved find his worst hindrances in his own household;
          let not the glory of Christ be obscured most by those who stand
          nearest to him, and ought therefore to be most jealous for his holy
          name. Yet so I fear full often it is; the children Ephraim being armed
          and carrying bows turn back in the day of battle, and so Israel's God
          is dishonored. Lazarus must arise; our death must be shaken off, and
          then shall the Lord Jesus greatly triumph.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord was pleased to ride in state when his disciples were obedient
          to him. Note well their implicit obedience, for it is a sure prophecy
          of glorious displays in the church. He said to two of his disciples,
          |Go,| and they went; and others of them having his commission
          performed their errands without hesitation. Alas! I fear the
          disobedience of the church often hinders the advance of the gospel.
          The disciples do not at this day, as they did then, the things which
          Jesus commanded them. One of them saith, |I will follow Paul, another
          I will follow Cephas| -- would God we laid aside all party leadership,
          and were only led by the master himself! One saith, |This institution
          is venerable if it be not scriptural,| and another saith, |I believe
          this ritual to be impressive and instructive, even if it be not
          ordained of God;| and so men excuse their will-worship. Oh, that we
          could lay all these things aside, and recognize that the law of the
          house is the law which the Master makes, and not the law which the
          servant may invent. It is time that we laid our perverse likes and our
          dislikes, our whims and our fancies, our opinions and even our more
          sober judgments, at the foot of him who is the only King of Zion; for
          be assured of this, his sacred majesty will not manifest its glory to
          disobedient disciples, except it be in a way of terror. Take heed,
          then, O ye who stand in his courts by your profession, and are his
          servants in name, that ye labor to do his will on earth as it is done
          in heaven, cheerfully, speedily, exactly, and with reverence to his
          every word, for otherwise he will veil his glory, and do but few
          mighty works among you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another indication of our Lord giving us glory days will be found in
          the prompt and cheerful sacrifice which his disciples will make. On
          the day of his entrance into Jerusalem, the owner of the ass and its
          colt cheerfully surrendered them when he heard that the Lord had need
          of them: the disciples who brought the ass did not spare their own
          contributions, for they took their garments and piled them on the ass;
          and others would not be debarred from their share of homage, for they
          spread their garments in the way, counting it their greatest honor to
          be bare-backed for Christ. All hands contributed, for all hearts were
          warm. The willing offerings of the people carpeted the road for the
          Son of David when he went through his metropolis to his cathedral.
          None appeared before him empty; there was no withholding on that day.
          A generous spirit had seized upon all his followers, and mark this
          word, for there is more of solemn truth in it than some will think,
          Christ Jesus hath often taken away the power of his Spirit from the
          church because of the covetousness of many professors, who have
          grudged the cause of God what they ought spontaneously and cheerfully
          to have offered. They have said of sacrifice to the Lord, |what a
          weariness it is!| They have robbed God in tithes and in offerings.
          They have counted the free-will offering to be a tax, when they ought
          to have considered it to be an honor and a privilege to be allowed to
          give to the Lord's cause. God has been insulted by miserly gifts and
          penurious contributions. What they would have been ashamed to offer to
          the meanest among princes they have presented to the Lord. How often
          have I blushed as I have heard in prayer that text, |Prove me now
          herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows
          of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room
          enough to receive it.| Why have you blushed? say you. Because seldom
          or never do I hear that text quoted correctly, its point is
          dexterously turned aside. What is the proof which the Lord puts before
          his people in that text? How doth he say, |Prove me now?| By your
          prayers? No. By your good works? No. But the text is, |Bring ye all
          the tithes into the store-house that there may be meat in mine house,
          and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts,| and so on. That
          is the peculiar test to which God brings his people, and in that test,
          alas, how many fail therein. They buy him no sweet cane with money,
          neither is he filled with their sacrifices. They will give their words
          in plenty, their lip homage in floods, but if it, comes to their
          substance they will have none of it. How few Christians have ever read
          this text and understood it, |Sell what thou hast and give alms.|
          Their almsgiving has never come to that; they have given but the
          cheese parings and the candle ends to Christ; they never knew they had
          given them, they made no sacrifice to do so. Many do not give to Jesus
          so much in a year as it costs to clean their shoes. Christ's cause
          costs them not half the hire of the most menial servant in their
          kitchens. Is not this a crying evil, to be answered for by those who
          are guilty of it? How can we expect the kingdom to come and the cause
          of Christ to grow while in these days of unreal profession Christ's
          followers deny him his due, and straiten the exchequer of his church.
          If no garments strew the road, and no man gives up his colt, how shall
          the prince celebrate a triumph?
        </p>
        <p>
          But we must pass on from that; those three things are, however, very
          significant signs of Christ's glory days; a quickened people, an
          obedient discipleship, and a general self-sacrifice. Let us see these,
          and we shall be sure that one of Christ's glory days has come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the glory of Christ is seen when Jesus Christ is publicly
          proclaimed as King. Evermore, beyond doubt, we acknowledge Christ to
          be King in the church; I hope all believers are sound upon that point:
          but in what holes and corners doth the church whisper out the truth,
          which he hath told us in the closet. Years ago, many of the churches
          were quite content to hide their light under any bushel, meeting in
          the queerest courts, and lanes, and alleys, where nobody but an angel
          and themselves could ever find them out. This content with obscurity
          is contrary to the genius of the gospel; let moles and bats seek out
          the hidden places and dwell therein; the children of light are not
          ashamed, but make it their glory that these things are not done in a
          corner. It is a grand day for the kingdom of Christ when the King is
          proclaimed in the streets, when the great trumpet is sounded, when the
          disciples stand in the highways, and the voice of wisdom is lifted up
          in the chief places of concourse, at the going in of the gates. Then
          are things well ordered when Zion lifts up her voice, yea, lifts it up
          with strength, and saith unto the cities of Judah, |Behold your God.|
          Our commission as preachers is to every creature, and, therefore, the
          more public the teaching of the gospel the better. Truly, there was
          grace in the earth when in popish times God was loved by men in quiet,
          and when Christ was worshipped by little knots in secret; but that was
          a grander day when Luther stood out in the open air and said that
          Christ was King, and salvation was by his blood. Then, when all over
          Europe the crowds began to gather in the fields, or beneath the gospel
          oak, or in the public squares, to listen to the men who not in a
          corner, not with bated breath, but aloud and boldly, before them all
          declared that antichrist must come to an end and that the Lord Jesus
          Christ must be exalted, and faith in him must be declared to be the
          salvation of the sons of men, oh, it was then that Christ and his
          church behests a glorious day. Blessed be God for the Reformation, but
          we must not rest in faded laurels, we need new victories. We desire
          the blessings of the gospel to be extended; and we ought to pray that
          the gospel may have free course and be glorified, that every street
          may ring with its charming music, that every alley and court may
          brighten with salvation, ay, and that not a house in London may he
          left without knowing that |Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God
          the Father.| It is a notable day when in the great gatherings of the
          people the Lord Jesus is declared to be the Lord of all.
        </p>
        <p>
          On such days, one part of the glory consists in many going forth to
          meet Christ. I wish I might live to see the facts of the gospel
          narrative fulfilled spiritually before our eyes. The people in
          Jerusalem took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet Jesus,
          glad that he was coming into the city, willing to swell the pomp of
          his entrance; and even thus God moves often on bright days upon the
          mass of the people making them willing to receive the gospel. There
          are times when the preacher feels that he is sowing on stony ground,
          but on other days when God's Spirit is abroad, the soil seems broken
          up, friable, ready to receive the grain, and the seed suddenly springs
          up, and a speedy harvest is produced. Pray, my brethren, that God
          would move our fellow countrymen to go forth to meet King Jesus. Pray
          that there may come a great cave of religious thought over the minds
          of the people. God can cause it; he has the keys of human hearts, and
          can secretly guide them according to his will. Pray that there may be
          a great religious movement among the people, for then we may look for
          one of the days of the Son of Man, as the days of heaven upon earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, too, as another sign, we shall see enthusiasm prevailing on all
          sides. When Christ rode through Jerusalem, it was not possible for men
          to be cold at the sight of his majesty. Those who hated burned with
          malignity, but those who loved him were full of flaming affection
          towards him. It is one speciality of Christ's character that men can
          scarcely be indifferent in his presence; he that is not with him is
          against him. What enthusiasm there was in the crowd that day when the
          city rang again. The children climbed the trees and threw down the
          branches; their parents waved them in triumph and then cast them in
          the roadway that the Savior might ride over them. The shouts were loud
          and long, the day was full of gladness to the many. Ah, and it is a
          mark of Christ's presence when the church becomes enthusiastic. We
          sometimes hear complaints about revivals being too exciting, perhaps
          the censure is deserved, but I would like to see a little of the
          fault. This age does not generally sin in the direction of being too
          excited concerning divine things. We have erred so long on the other
          side that, perhaps, a little excess in the direction of fervor might
          not be the worst of all calamities; at any rate, I would not fear to
          try it. Doubtless our Lord's presence, like the rising of the sun
          scatters heat as well as light on all sides. Oh to be scorched by that
          sun, to be parched with that heat. Blessed would they be who should be
          guilty of too great a love for him, convicted of too consuming a zeal
          for the glory. I would gladly die of that heavenly malady.
        </p>
        <p>
          On that triumphal day, beloved brethren, where there was no
          enthusiasm, there was inquiry, for all the city was moved, saying,
          |Who is this?| When our Lord grants revivals to his church, the
          congregations and the multitude outside begin to ask, |Wherefore this
          stir? what meaneth all this? Who is this Christ, and what is his
          salvation?| This spirit of inquiry is eminently desirable. It is just
          now a matter to be sought for by importunate prayer. Would God that
          all this vast metropolis were stirred by the inquiry, |Who is this?|
          and that everywhere men said, |What is this gospel about which so much
          noise is made?| May the Lord in his mercy move men's hearts as the
          trees of the wood are shaken with the wind. This is that shaking which
          the prophet saw in the valley of vision when bone came together to its
          bone, before the breath of the Spirit made the slain to live. Be
          instant day and night O ye chosen men of God, and pray that like
          Nineveh in the days of Jonah this whole city may be moved by the
          preaching of the word.
        </p>
        <p>
          The strange thing about the matter was that when Jesus entered
          Jerusalem, all his enemies were quiet. He rode publicly through the
          streets where Herod and Pilate held their courts, yet they did not
          attempt to molest him. The Romans were very jealous of their
          authority, they were always prompt to seize upon any person who
          pretended to be a king, and yet not a solitary pretorian guard laid
          his rough hand upon the King of the Jews, neither did Herod's men of
          war appear upon the scene. It does not appear that any information was
          carried to head quarters concerning this singular procession, neither
          was it laid to the Lord's charge by his enemies on his trial. As for
          the scribes and Pharisees, they did no more than bark a little, but
          bite they could not, for they feared the people. That day every foeman
          cowered down before the Lord, like dogs when a lion roareth. When he
          entered the temple he was unattended by armed followers, he took with
          him no sword, but simply a scourge made of small curds, and yet with
          that slight weapon he chased out the buyers and sellers, overturning
          their tables, and overthrowing the seats of them that sold doves; and
          yet it does not appear that any resistance was made to him; he was
          Lord of the hour. Against him durst not a dog move his tongue; in the
          presence of the King of Zion the enemy was as still as a stone till he
          and his people had passed through the city, and the day of the royal
          pomp was over. In like manner it is remarkable that, in times when the
          Lord is blessing his church, he restrains the wrath of his enemies or
          causes it to praise him. He hath power to make the proudest humble
          themselves, and the most stout-hearted bow their necks, and he uses
          that power to the glory of his name.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I am thus describing what the glorious days of Christ are when
          they dawn upon us, surely you, my dear fellow members, are all
          pleading with God and earnestly praying, |O king of grace, Grant us
          one of these royal days in this church;| and you, the members of other
          churches, are crying, |would God that Jesus would come to our town in
          that fashion, and that he would rule in our church, after that
          manner.| Let us pray for it unanimously and continually, and let us be
          of good cheer, for Jesus loves his church and he will give her what
          her heart is set upon. Let us plead with him for it, and we shall yet
          see the day in which the many shall cry, |Blessed is he that cometh in
          the name of the Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But, time could fail us if we lingered here, and therefore we pass
          to the second head, which is this, that ON THESE GLORY DAYS OF JESUS
          CHRIST IN HIS CHURCH, LIKE HONORS ARE PAID TO HIM NOW AS THEN.
        </p>
        <p>
          And first, he is at this time as loudly praised and as greatly
          rejoiced in among his people as he was then. They clapped their hands
          and called him |Blessed;| and the whole multitude of his disciples
          rejoiced with an exceeding loud voice, and cried, |Hosanna, Hosanna.|
          Oh, beloved, we are dull enough when Christ is away; how can the
          children of the bridechamber rejoice when the bridegroom is gone from
          them; but when his Spirit comes with power into our midst how can we
          fast? Oh, then our hearts rejoice, and leap along in glee like the
          long frozen brooks when the soft breath of spring hath set them free.
          Send us but a revival, O God, and Ready-to-halt shall leap upon his
          crutches, and Much-afraid, and Fearing, and Despondency, shall sing
          with holy mirth. No joy is like the joy of Christ's presence with his
          people. Oh, that we might have it! Bickerings soon cease, murmurings
          come to an end, complaints of one another, and of God's providence are
          all hushed; the sense that Jesus Christ is with his people drowns
          every note of sorrow, and every heart is tuned to loudest notes of
          thankfulness. O thou, my soul, bless God the Lord, and all that in me
          is be stirred up, his holy name to magnify and bless, on that
          auspicious day, when the power of Jesus Christ is revealed in the city
          of his choice. It is a gladsome time, a time of singing, a time of
          shouting, a time of exultation, and of intense delight when we go
          forth to meet our King Solomon to crown him anew. I need not say to
          you, should he favor us with such a delightful period, let us rejoice
          and be glad in him, for you would be sure to do it. When the Lord
          turns again the captivity of Sion, then is our mouth filled with
          singing and our tongue with laughter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The point that I shall dwell upon here would be that Christ's peculiar
          honor lay not only in the joy and rejoicing which flowed around him,
          but in the multitude who felt the contagion of that joy. It was said
          by those who saw the pageant of last week that the great sight of all
          was the multitude; the thing to look at and to wonder at was the crowd
          the dense, far-reaching, eager, surging crowd. And, surely, in
          Christ's glory days the thing which brings him much honor is the
          crowd, the multitude; for when he makes bare his arm, and his gospel
          is preached with power, the multitude are sure to listen to his
          gospel, and men say, |Behold the whole world is gone after him.| It
          may seem strange and unaccountable, but so it is, that the very gospel
          which is opposed by men has a strange attraction for their ears, they
          cannot help hearing it; and though to this day there is an opposition
          in the human heart to the truth as it is in Jesus, yet is it a
          remarkable fact that men love to hearken to it. The numerical strength
          of Christ's church lies still in the multitude; the common people hear
          him gladly. Though it was known that Christ was coming, the princes
          did not go to meet him, the priests did not go to meet him; there were
          no long files of Jewish nobility to greet their King; but the people
          went in their thousands, the masses cheered him. I dare say the
          Pharisees called them the mob, the rabble, the unwashed. Yes, and let
          it stand for fact, |this man receiveth sinners;| he is the people's
          King, the helper of the poor and needy. The poor of this world have
          been rich in faith in him. In the old days of persecution, and of
          burning, who were the men that played the man most nobly at the stake?
          Here and there a bishop and a noble did so, but the rank and file of
          the heroes were from the poor or the middle class. There was one great
          man, with an unworthy right hand that recanted, and yet did well at
          the last; but the poor weavers of Colchester, and the cobblers of Bow,
          never recanted at all, but gloried in being made a burnt-offering for
          the truth. Wherever the gospel has been mainly upheld by the great
          ones of the earth it has had little success. Take, for instance, Spain
          and Italy, the converts of the Reformation there nearly all belonged
          to the higher ranks, and ere long its doctrines became extinct, but it
          lived among German peasants and British artisans. The valiant of
          Israel still come from the loom, the smithy, the plough, and the
          bench. Wherever the gospel entrenches itself among the common people,
          the devil himself cannot destroy it: it is then like a lion in its own
          forest, and none can drive it forth. The priests and the mighty ones
          may uphold what cause they will, but if the people are for King Jesus,
          his advocates have no need to blush. It is this day the glory of
          Christ that he doth save the poor and the needy, and that he is the
          prince of the multitude. |I have exalted,| saith the Lord, |one chosen
          out of the people| -- Jesus is the people's Christ, the people's man.
          He still hath honor out of the mouth of those whom others despise, for
          he hath chosen the base things of the world and the things that are
          not to bring to nought the things that are. Here was a part of
          Christ's glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, observe, that, on that day it was Christ's glory that he
          received all sorts of homage from all kinds of people. As I have
          already said, he who had a beast that Christ might ride upon
          cheerfully surrendered it: he who had no beast had at least a garment,
          and he gave it; and he who was so poorly clad, that his best garment
          when spread in the way might seem rather to insult than to honor the
          king, gave a branch from the tree. He who could brought a palm, which
          probably he had to purchase with money; but those who could not buy
          palm branches, climbed the trees that were common and grew by the
          highway, and threw the branches down. I suppose these were branches of
          olives, for they were hard by the Mount of Olives: let the fatness of
          the earth honor him! There were also branches of the figtree, for
          Bethphage was the house of figs: let the sweetness of the earth honor
          him! Doubtless there were branches of the cedars: let the honor and
          strength of the earth adore him! There were branches of the myrtle:
          let all earth's honor and victory glorify him! I do not read that
          Christ rejected so much as one attempt to do him honor. He rebuked no
          disciple and silenced no child. Oh, in the day when Christ is glorious
          all his people try to serve him, each one brings his portion; the
          prince brings much, but the peasant brings his share, and the Lord
          accepts them all. No Christian when the Lord is abroad shirks his duty
          or forgets to bring his sacrifice, nor doth the Lord reject so much as
          one honest gift of a sincere heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, on that day, oh, it was a sweet thing to notice and delightful to
          remember, it will always be so when Christ is glorious, the little
          ones were conspicuous. Did not the boys in the Temple cry |Hosanna!
          Hosanna!| and their throats here not hoarse half so soon as their
          fathers' were. They kept up the mirth of that gladsome day -- a joyful
          holiday was it for them. Even thus where there is true grace working
          powerfully in a church I always expect to see young converts, boys and
          girls will be brought to Christ in any true revival, and where they
          are not, methinks we have good reason to suspect that the movement is
          not genuine, for had it been the work of the Spirit of God, the little
          ones would have been suffered to come unto him as well as those of
          older growth. Oh, may such honors be heaped on Christ in this
          Tabernacle! Would God I could hear the little ones say, |Hosanna!|
          while their fathers and their mothers join the song. The Lord grant
          that the Sabbath-school may send up a noble regiment for the King's
          army. Oh, that on all sides, you men with wealth, and you men with
          none, you with great gifts, and you with few, you with much time and
          leisure, and you with scarce an hour to call your own, you aged men
          and you youngsters, would unite in magnifying the Redeemer. Oh, that I
          could see you all strewing somewhat in the way of Christ to glorify
          him in the midst of his church.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But, I must not dwell there, though the theme is very tempting,
          but notice that when Christ comes into the church HE EXECUTES THE SAME
          DEEDS AS HE DID THEN.
        </p>
        <p>
          What was the first thing he did that we observe? He was seated on the
          colt, and as he rode along and heard the shouts of the people, I have
          no doubt that a smile was over his face, and when he saw the little
          ones in all their ardor, he looked at them with love; but, on a
          sudden, just as he came where he could see Jerusalem, though it was
          the day of his triumph he stopped, and all around could see that some
          mighty emotion was swelling his heart to bursting, and at last the
          tears coursed adown those cheeks, and he burst into this lament, |O
          that thou hadst known, even thou, in this thy day.| I know that
          everywhere Christ is in the church in the power of his Spirit,
          compassion for souls becomes very prominent. Christ weeps through his
          people's eyes, and yearns through his children's hearts. He makes them
          pitiful and full of compassion. They cannot bear it that men should be
          damned, it grieves them that the day of a gracious visitation should
          come, and yet so many should reject Christ. Oh, my brethren, you who
          live near to Christ, and feel a sympathy with him, ask the Lord to
          give you heart-ache over dying souls; ask him to make you feel an
          anguish because men will not come unto him that they might have life,
          but will persist in committing spiritual suicide, by putting far from
          them life eternal. Oh, that we might see a holy passion for souls in
          the church. For that would be a blessed sign of rich grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, on that very same occasion, there was conspicuous
          the judgments of Christ, for his compassion did not permit him to keep
          back the tidings of future punishment. He said, |If thou hadst known,
          even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy
          peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. For the days shall come
          upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and
          compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side. And shall lay thee
          even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not
          leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the
          time of thy visitation.| I have noted that in genuine revivals, the
          preachers of Gods truth are not backward in preaching the
          threatenings, as well as the promises. We are told that men are drawn
          to Christ by love, and the statement is true; but, at the same time,
          |knowing the terrors of the Lord,| we are to persuade men, and not to
          keep back from them the evil tidings. Even Christ with weeping eyes
          and tender heart does not hesitate to tell Jerusalem of its coming
          destruction, and I believe it is a token that Christ is in the church
          when those terrible things of his are not kept back to please the
          popular taste; when there is no trying to cut them down and moderate
          them, in order to make the wrath to come look less terrible than it
          is. It must be thundered out again and again, |except ye repent, ye
          shall all likewise perish.| It must be told the sinner that if he
          goeth on in his iniquity, he shall be driven away from hope and
          salvation, |where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not
          quenched.| Christ is not present in an unfaithful church, and this is
          a point upon which some churches are very apt to grow unfaithful. We
          must deliver the whole truth, even the dark side of it as well as that
          which smiles with mercy and Christ is not present unless it be so. The
          sympathy of Jesus led him, as it should lead us, to be lovingly honest
          with the sons of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, you notice in the reading that our Lord, when he rode through the
          streets of his metropolis, went straight away to the cathedral gate,
          and when he entered there he began to purge the temple. With the
          scourge in his hand he smote right and left, and he overthrew the
          tables of those that were changing the shekels, and he cast out the
          cages of doves that were stored there for merchandise. Even thus doth
          Christ do. No church can remain long impure with Jesus in her midst;
          his presence brings reformation, things tolerated before become
          intolerable where he is. While a church is without the Spirit of God
          it will keep in its old way, it will plead precedent, it will endure
          grievous abuses, it will make excuses for this, and excuses for that;
          but, let the Lord once come, and out the hawkers and hucksters must
          go, tables, money-bags, doves, and all. He will not have them in his
          house of prayer; bag and baggage they must go when he comes in, and he
          only in his truth and power must reign in the midst of his own church.
          I do not believe we shall thoroughly purify any church by Acts of
          Parliament, nor by reformation associations, nor by agitation, nor by
          any merely human agency. No hand can grasp the scourge that can drive
          out the buyers and sellers, but that hand which once was fastened to
          the cross. Let the Lord do it and the work will be done, for it is not
          of man, nor shall man accomplish it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, when Christ had purged the church, the next thing was to heal
          the sick who came to him in the temple. The place which might not be a
          mart was allowed to be an hospital. So the glory days of Christ are
          always notable for the great cures that he works; the sons of men
          receive lasting benefits, and are relieved of grievous maladies. Eyes
          are opened, understandings are enlightened. Infirmities are removed,
          the lame walk. Wills are subdued; hearts are cleansed; and natures are
          changed. Where Jesus comes, salvation follows with all the train of
          blessings which it includes.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, then, we find that that day his foes were all confounded. They
          came to meet him with their questions, but he soon answered them; and
          what did they say the one to the other? |Perceive ye how we prevail
          nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.| O master, give us to
          see such times as these: our soul now longeth for them. Cause thou our
          enemies to lament, and say, |We thought we had put down these old
          doctrines, but we have prevailed nothing, behold the multitude is
          moved by them.| The devil thought in England years ago that the gospel
          light was put out; he had lulled the Church of England and Dissenters
          too into a deep sleep, and Arianism and all sorts of errors had spread
          all over the land: but the Lord touched the heart of Whitefield, and
          Wesley, and the godly ones; the Spirit of God came down, the multitude
          heard the Gospel gladly, and many an enemy of Christ as he stood at
          his window and saw the streets thronged to hear those men as they
          never had been thronged before, and heard the song borne on the
          distant breezes of the wide open spaces outside the towns and
          villages, said, |Why, after all, no have not put this thing down:
          though we fancied we had destroyed it.| There is hope of this
          celestial tree; if it be cut down it will sprout again; at the scent
          of water it will bud. This child is not dead, but sleepeth. A certain
          vainglorious party of Pretenders to intellect and culture tell us now
          that the old Puritanic faith is nearly extinct; there are only a few
          of us ignorant people who now hold the same truths as John Owen, John
          Bunyan, Goodwin, and Charnock; but all the elite of the world, those
          who have all the |sweetness and light| to themselves, the thinkers,
          the mental gentility have all been sensible enough to give their votes
          for something more suitable to the times. In the name of God, we shall
          show them the difference yet, and by his Spirit He will din their ears
          with the gospel ram's horn till they and their Jericho come down in a
          common ruin. The evangelical doctrine which shook Europe will shake it
          yet again, and England shall yet know that the self-same truth, for
          which her martyrs died and for which her Puritans fought on many a
          wellcontested field, shall break the rationalism and ritualism of this
          land in pieces yet, and all else that standeth in the way of the true
          gospel of the living God. We are not afraid nor discouraged, but we
          cry mightily unto the King that we may once more lift up a shout
          because of his presence, for then human philosophy shall be ashamed,
          and old Rome shall know, and all the cubs of the beast of Rome shall
          know, that the Lord liveth, and his invincible truth shall win the
          day.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Now lastly, I said that even on the occasion, when Christ came
          into Jerusalem, ALL WAS NOT GOLD THAT GLITTERED, and so we must not
          expect it to be in any revival of religion. They said, |Hosanna!
          Hosanna! Hosanna!| till the heavens rang again, but there was an
          undercurrent, there were Pharisees and men of other classes with them,
          grizzling and snarling, trying there and then to devise a plan by
          which to destroy the Lord, and there was Judas at that very time
          plotting, planning, ready to sell his Master. However, what did that
          signify? The worst thing of all was this, that those same tongues
          which were that day crying |Hosanna!| -- oh, shame to our humanity
          that we should have to mention it! -- those same tongues which cried
          |Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord,| within that
          self-same week said, |crucify him! crucify him!| I say not all, but
          some. It was the mob of Jerusalem that brought him in as their King,
          but when they found that he would not assume the throne, and that he
          spoke of a spiritual kingdom, and not an earthly one, then they were
          instant with loud voices, saying, |Let him be crucified! let him be
          crucified!| Expect not, therefore, when many hearts are impressed with
          the gospel, that all will be steadfast towards Christ. Do not reckon
          that every pious feeling will end in genuine conversion. The florist
          does not expect all his slips to become shrubs. Look ye at the trees
          which, in a few short days, will be smothered with blossoms and
          glorious with beauty; do you expect those blossoms all to become
          fruit? No gardener thinks that such a thing can be. He understands
          that full many of those flowers will wither, will be blown off in the
          March gales, or smitten by the evening's frost. He looks for fruit
          proportionate to the blossoming, but not to a fruit that shall be
          equal to the full promise of the bloom. And so, think not ill of
          Christ's great days, because they seem to inexperienced eyes greater
          on the surface than they are. Thank God there is a residuum of
          reality, be thankful for that; but, do not be disappointed, much less
          scoff, because it is not all that you had hoped it was. If some be
          saved we are glad; if I had a thousand professed converts, and only a
          hundred of them turned out to be genuine, I would be more grateful
          than if all my converts were genuine, and there was only half a dozen
          of them. Large dealers look for some losses and bad debts, and yet
          hope to gain much in the long run. So long as I do but get the number
          of real converts, I will forget, and my heart shall outlive, the
          disappointment of having expected more. Go on; brethren, go on
          praying, hoping, working, for the Lord will bless his people, the Lord
          will bless his people with peace. Amen and amen.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a very large number of friends from a distance desire occasionally
          to attend the Tabernacle, but do not like to encounter the crowds at
          the doors, the deacons have resolved to issue early admission tickets,
          which will admit the holder before the general public, during the
          month of issue. They will be purchasable at the price of one shilling,
          and can be had by letter, enclosing twelve penny stamps, and one
          half-penny stamp for postage, of Mr. C. Blackshaw, Tabernacle,
          Newington Butts.
