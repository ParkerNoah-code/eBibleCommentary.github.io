        <p>(In every succession, p.764.)</p>
        <p>
          Here our author mentions that he noted the succession of Bishops at
          Rome, but he gives his list with no remark about Rome in particular.
          He adds that |in every succession and in every city (i.e., in every
          See) a primitive accordance with the law and the Gospel is
          maintained.| How can our excellent Lightfoot give it a colour wholly
          gratuitous in these words: |He interested himself in the succession of
          the Roman See, intent, like Irenæus in the next generation, on showing
          the permanence of the orthodox tradition, through the continuity of
          the Roman episcopate.| Irenæus, who, above all the Westerns, is
          identified with the Orient!
        </p>
        <p>
          Where is the evidence of any such idea or |intent|? As for Irenæus,
          his testimony has been sufficiently illustrated before, with proof
          that his words have not the slightest reference to the continuity of
          the Roman more than any other See, save only as the influx of visitors
          from other Sees helped to give it orthodoxy by their concurrent
          testimony.
