          1. He had indeed been already accustomed to lie against God, for the
          purpose of leading men astray. For at the beginning, when God had
          given to man a variety of things for food, while He commanded him not
          to eat of one tree only, as the Scripture tells us that God said to
          Adam: "From every tree which is in the garden thou shalt eat food; but
          from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, from this ye shall not
          eat: for in the day that ye shall eat of it, ye shall die by death;"
          he then, lying against the Lord, tempted man, as the Scripture says
          that the serpent said to the woman: "Has God indeed said this, Ye
          shall not eat from every tree of the garden?" And when she had exposed
          the falsehood, and simply related the command, as He had said, "From
          every tree of the garden we shall eat; but of the fruit of the tree
          which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat
          of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die:" when he had [thus]
          learned from the woman the command of God, having brought his cunning
          into play, he finally deceived her by a falsehood, saying, "Ye shall
          not die by death; for God knew that in the day ye shall eat of it your
          eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."
          In the first place, then, in the garden of God he disputed about God,
          as if God was not there, for he was ignorant of the greatness of God;
          and then, in the next place, after he had learned from the woman that
          God had said that they should die if they tasted the aforesaid tree,
          opening his mouth, he uttered the third falsehood, "Ye shall not die
          by death." But that God was true, and the serpent a liar, was proved
          by the result, death having passed upon them who had eaten. For along
          with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death, because
          they did eat in disobedience; and disobedience to God entails death.
          Wherefore, as they became forfeit to death, from that [moment] they
          were handed over to it.

          2. Thus, then, in the day that they did eat, in the same did they die,
          and became death's debtors, since it was one day of the creation. For
          it is said, "There was made in the evening, and there was made in the
          morning, one day." Now in this same day that they did eat, in that
          also did they die. But according to the cycle and progress of the
          days, after which one is termed first, another second, and another
          third, if anybody seeks diligently to learn upon what day out of the
          seven it was that Adam died, he will find it by examining the
          dispensation of the Lord. For by summing up in Himself the whole human
          race from the beginning to the end, He has also summed up its death.
          From this it is clear that the Lord suffered death, in obedience to
          His Father, upon that day on which Adam died while he disobeyed God.
          Now he died on the same day in which he did eat. For God said, "In
          that day on which ye shall eat of it, ye shall die by death." The
          Lord, therefore, recapitulating in Himself this day, underwent His
          sufferings upon the day preceding the Sabbath, that is, the sixth day
          of the creation, on which day man was created; thus granting him a
          second creation by means of His passion, which is that [creation] out
          of death. And there are some, again, who relegate the death of Adam to
          the thousandth year; for since "a day of the Lord is as a thousand
          years," he did not overstep the thousand years, but died within them,
          thus bearing out the sentence of his sin. Whether, therefore, with
          respect to disobedience, which is death; whether [we consider] that,
          on account of that, they were delivered over to death, and made
          debtors to it; whether with respect to [the fact that on] one and the
          same day on which they ate they also died (for it is one day of the
          creation); whether [we regard this point], that, with respect to this
          cycle of days, they died on the day in which they did also eat, that
          is, the day of the preparation, which is termed "the pure supper,"
          that is, the sixth day of the feast, which the Lord also exhibited
          when He suffered on that day; or whether [we reflect] that he (Adam)
          did not overstep the thousand years, but died within their limit, --
          it follows that, in regard to all these significations, God is indeed
          true. For they died who tasted of the tree; and the serpent is proved
          a liar and a murderer, as the Lord said of him: "For he is a murderer
          from the beginning, and the truth is not in him." <br />
