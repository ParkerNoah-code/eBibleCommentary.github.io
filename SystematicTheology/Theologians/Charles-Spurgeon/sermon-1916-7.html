          |They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the
          sun light on them, nor any heat.| -- Revelation 7:16.
        </p>
        <p>
          WE cannot too often turn our thoughts heavenward, for this is one of
          the great cures for worldliness. The way to liberate our souls from
          the bonds that tie us to earth is to strengthen the cords that kind us
          to heaven. You will think less of this poor little globe when you
          think more of the world to come. This contemplation will also serve to
          console us for the loss, as we call it, of those who have gone before.
          It is their gain, and we will rejoice in it. We cannot have a richer
          source of consolation than this, that they who have fallen asleep in
          Christ have not perished; they have not lost life, but they have
          gained the fullness of it. They are rid at all that molests us here,
          and they enjoy more than we as yet can imagine. Cheer your hearts, ye
          mourners, by looking up to the gate of pearl, by looking up -- to
          those who day without night surround the throne of their Redeemer. It
          will also tend to quicken our diligence if we think much of heaven.
          Suppose I should miss it after all! What if I should not so run that I
          may obtain! If heaven be little, I shall be but a little loser by
          losing it; but if it be indeed such that the half could never be told
          us, then, may God grant us diligence to make our calling and election
          sure, that we may be certain of entering into this rest, and may not
          be like the many who came out of Egypt, but who perished in the
          wilderness and never entered into the promised land. All things
          considered, I know of no meditation that is likely to be more
          profitable than a frequent consideration of the rest which remaineth
          for the people of God. I ask, then, for a very short time that your
          thoughts may go upward to the golden streets.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, first, we shall think a little of the blessedness of the saints
          as described in the simple words of our text; then we will say a few
          words as to how they came by that felicity; and thirdly, draw some
          practical lessons from it. First, then, we have here: --
        </p>
        <p>I. A DESCRIPTION OF THE BLESSEDNESS OF THE GLORIFIED.</p>
        <p>
          We have not the full description of it here; but we have here a
          description of certain evils from which they are free. You notice they
          are of two or three kinds -- first, such as originate within -- |They
          shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more| -- they are free from
          inward evils; secondly, such as originate without -- |Neither shall
          the sun light on them, nor any heat.| They are altogether delivered
          from the results of outward circumstances. Take the first: |They shall
          hunger no more, neither thirst any more.| We are never so to strain
          Scripture for a spiritual sense as to take away its natural sense, and
          hence we will begin by saying this is no doubt to be understood
          physically of the body they will have in glory. Whether there will be
          a necessity for eating and drinking in heaven, we will not say, for we
          are not told, but anyhow it is met by the text, |The Lamb that is in
          the midst of the throne shall feed them| -- if they need food -- |and
          lead them to living fountains of water| if they need to drink.
          Whatever may be the necessities of the future, those necessities shall
          never cause a pang. Here, the man who is hungry may have to ask the
          question, |What shall I eat?|; the man who is thirsty may have to say,
          |What shall I drink?|; and we have all to ask, |Wherewithal shall we
          be clothed?| But such questions shall never arise there. They are
          abundantly supplied. Children of God have been hungry here: the great
          Son of God, the head of the household was hungry before them; and they
          need not wonder if they have fellowship with him in this suffering.
          Children of God have had to thirst here: their great Lord and Master
          said, |I thirst|; they need not wonder, therefore, if in his
          affliction they have to take some share. Should not they who are to be
          like their head in heaven be conformed unto him on earth? But up
          yonder there is no poverty, and there shall be no accident that shall
          place them in circumstances of distress. |They shall hunger no more,
          neither thirst any more.|
        </p>
        <p>
          While we take this physically, there is no doubt that it is to be
          understood mentally. Our minds are also constantly the victims of
          hungerings and thirstings. There are on earth various kinds of this
          hunger and thirst -- in a measure evil, in a measure also innocent.
          There are many men that in this world are hungering after wealth, and
          the mouth of avarice can never be filled. It is as insatiable as the
          horse-leech, and for ever cries, |Give, give!| But such hunger was
          never known in heaven, and never can be, for they are satisfied there;
          they have all things and abound. All their enlarged capacities can
          desire they already possess, in being near the throne of God and
          beholding his glory; there is no wealth which is denied them. Here,
          too, some of the sons of men hunger after fame, and oh! what have not
          men done to satisfy this? It is said that breaks through stone walls;
          certainly ambition has done it. Death at the cannon's mouth has been a
          trifle, if a man might win the bubble reputation. But in heaven there
          is no such hunger as that Those who once had it, and are saved, scorn
          ambition henceforth. And what room would there be for ambition in the
          skies? They take their crowns and cast them at their Saviour's feet.
          They have their palm-branches, for they have won the victory, but they
          ascribe the conquest to the Lamb, their triumph to his death. Their
          souls are satisfied with his fame. The renown of Christ has filled
          their spirit with everlasting contentment. They hunger no more, nor
          thirst any more, in that respect. And oh! what hunger and thirst there
          has been on earth by those of tender and large heart for a fit object
          of love! I mean not now the common thing called |love,| but the
          friendship which is in man's heart, and sends out its tendrils wanting
          something to which to cling. We must -- we are born and created for
          that very purpose -- we must live together, we cannot develop
          ourselves alone. And oftentimes a lonely spirit has yearned for a
          brother's ear, into which to pour its sorrows; and doubtless many a
          man has been brought to destruction and been confined to the lunatic
          asylum whose reason might have been saved had there been some
          sympathetic spirit, some kind, gentle heart that would have helped to
          bear his burden. Oh! the hunger and the thirst of many a soul after a
          worthy object of confidence. But they hunger and they thirst, up
          there, no more. Their love is all centred on their Saviour. Their
          confidence, which they reposed in him on earth, is still in him. He is
          their bosom's Lord, their heart's Emperor, and they are satisfied,
          and, wrapped up in him, they hunger and they thirst no more.
        </p>
        <p>
          And how many young spirits there are on earth that are hungering after
          knowledge who would fain get the hammer and break the rock, and find
          out the history of the globe in the past. They would follow
          philosophy, if they could, to its source, and find out the root of the
          matter. Oh! to know, to know, to know! The human mind pants and
          thirsts for this. But there they know even as they are known. I do not
          know that in heaven they know all things -- that must be for the
          Omniscient only -- but they know all they need or really want to know;
          they are satisfied there. There will be no longer searching with a
          spirit that is ill at ease. They may, perhaps, make progress even
          there, and the scholar may become daily more and more wise; but there
          shall never be such a hungering and thirsting as to cause their mental
          faculties the slightest pang. They shall hunger no more, neither
          thirst any more. Oh! blessed land where the seething ocean of man's
          mind is hushed, and sleeps in everlasting calm! Oh! blessed country
          where the hungry spirit, that crieth every hour for bread, and yet for
          more, and yet for more, and spends its labour for that which
          satisfieth not, shall be fed with the bread of angels, and be
          satisfied with favour and full of the goodness of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, dear friends, surely the text also means our spiritual hungering
          and thirsting. |Blessed is the man that hungers and thirst to-day
          after righteousness, for he shall be filled.| This a kind of hunger
          that we ought to desire to have; this is a sort of thirst that the
          more you have of it will be the indication of the possession of more
          grace. On earth it is good for saints to hunger and to thirst
          spiritually, but up there they have done even with that blessed hunger
          and that blessed thirst. Today, beloved, some of us are hungering
          after holiness. Oh! what would I not give to be holy, to be rid of
          sin, of every evil thing about me! My eyes -- ah! adieu sweet light,
          if I might also say, |Adieu sin! |My mouth -- ah! well would I be
          content to be dumb if I might preach by a perfect life on earth! There
          is no faculty I know of that might not be cheerfully surrendered if
          the surrender of it would deprive us of sin. But they never thirst for
          holiness in heaven, for this excellent reason, that they are without
          fault before the throne of God. Does it not make your mouth water? Why
          this is the luxury of heaven to be perfect. Is not this -- the heaven
          of heaven, to be clean rid of the root and branch of sin, and not a
          rag or bone, or piece of a bone of our old depravity left -- all gone
          like our Lord, made perfect without spot or wrinkle, or any such
          thing. And here, too, brethren and sisters, we very rightly hunger and
          thirst after full assurance and confidence. Many are hungering after
          it; they hope they are saved, and they thirst to be assured that they
          are. But there is no such thirst as that in heaven, for, having
          crossed the golden threshold of Paradise, no saint ever asks himself,
          |Am I saved?| They see his face without a cloud between; they bathe in
          the sea of his love; they cannot question that which they perpetually
          enjoy. So, too, on earth I hope we know what it is to hunger and
          thirst for fellowship with Christ. Oh! when he is gone from us -- if
          he do but hide his face from us, how we cry, |My soul desires thee in
          the night|! We cannot be satisfied unless we have the love of God shed
          abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost. But in heaven they have no
          such thing. There the shepherd is always with the Sheep, the King is
          ever near them, and because of his perpetual presence their hungering
          and their thirsting will be banished for ever. Thus much upon those
          evils, then, that would arise from within. As they are perfect,
          whatever comes from within is a source of pleasure to them, and never
          of pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, dear friends, the evils that come from without: let us think
          of them. We no doubt can appreciate in some measure, though not to the
          degree which we should if we were in Palestine in the middle of summer
          -- we can appreciate the words, |Neither shall the sun light on them,
          nor any heat.| This signifies that nothing external shall injure the
          blessed. Take it literally. There shall be nothing in the surroundings
          of heavenly saints that shall cause glorified spirits any
          inconvenience. I think we may take it mainly in relation to the entire
          man glorified; and so let us say that on earth the sun lights on us
          and many heats in the form of affliction. What heats of affliction
          some here have passed through! Why there are some here who are seldom
          free from physical pain. There are many of the best of God's children
          that, if they get an hour without pain, are joyful indeed. There are
          others that have had a great fight of affliction Through poverty they
          have fought hard. They have been industrious, but somehow or other God
          has marked them out for the scant tables and the thread-worn garments.
          They are the children of poverty, and the furnace heat is very hot
          about them. With others it has been repeated deaths of those they have
          loved. Ah! how sad is the widow's case! How deep the grief of the
          fatherless! How great the sorrow of bereaved parents! Sometimes the
          arrows of God fly one after the other; first one falls and then
          another until we think we shall hardly have one left. These are the
          heats of the furnace of affliction. And at other times these take the
          form of ingratitude from children. I think we never ought to repine so
          much about the death of a child as about the ungodly life of a child.
          A dead cross is very heavy, but a living cross is heavier far. Many a
          mother has had a son of whom she might regret that he did not die even
          the very hour of his birth, for he has lived to be the grief of his
          parents, and a dishonour to their name. These are sharp trials --
          these heats -- but you shall have done with them soon. |Neither shall
          the sun light on them, nor any heat.| No poverty, no sickness, no
          bereavement, no ingratitude -- nothing of the kind. They for ever rest
          from affliction. Heat sometimes comes in another form -- in the matter
          of temptation. Oh! how some of God's people have been tried -- tried
          by their flesh! Their constitution, perhaps, has been hot, impulsive,
          and they have been carried off their feet, or would have been but for
          the interposing grace of God, many and many a time. They have been
          tempted, too, in their position, and they of their own household have
          been their enemies. They have been tempted by their peculiar
          circumstances; their feet have almost gone many a time. And they have
          been tempted by the devil; and hard work it is to stand against
          Satanic insinuations. It is hot, indeed, when his fiery darts fly. Oh!
          when we shall have once crossed the river, how some of us who have
          been much tempted will look back upon that old dog of hell, and laugh
          him to scorn because he will not be able even to bark at us again!
          Then we shall be for ever free from him. He worries us now because he
          would devour us, but there, as he cannot devour, so shall he not even
          worry us. | Neither shall the sun | of temptation | light on them, nor
          any heat.| Happy are the people that are in such a case. The heats of
          persecution have often, too, carried about the saints. It is the lot
          of God's people to be tried in this way. Through much tribulation of
          this sort they inherit the kingdom; but there are no Smithfields in
          heaven, and no Bonners to light up the faggots, no Inquisitions in
          heaven, no slanderers there to spoil the good man's name. They shall
          never have the heat of persecution to suffer again. And, once more,
          they shall not have the heat of care. I do not know that we need have
          it, even here; but there are a great many of God's people who allow
          care to get very hot about them. Even while sitting in this place
          to-night while the hymn was going up, |What must it be to be there! |
          the thoughts of some of you have been going away to your business, or
          your home. While we are trying to preach and draw your attention
          upwards, perhaps some housewife is thinking of something she has left
          out which ought to have been looked up before she came away, or
          wondering where she left the key. We make any excuses for care through
          the cares we continually invent, forgetting the words, |Cast all your
          care on him. for he careth for you.| But they have no cares in heaven.
          |They hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun
          light on them, nor any heat.| Ah! good man, there shall be no ships at
          sea by-and-bye-no harvests -- to trouble you as to whether the good
          weather will last! Ah! good woman, you shall have no more children
          that are sickly to fret over, for there you will have all you desire,
          and be in a family circle that is unbroken, for all the brothers and
          sisters of God's family shall by-and-bye be there, and so you shall be
          eternally blest.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have thus opened up as well as we could the words of the text on
          the felicity of the saints. Now, very briefly: --
        </p>
        <p>II. HOW DO THEY COME TO BE HAPPY?</p>
        <p>
          Well, it is quite clear that they did not come to it because they were
          very fortunate people on earth, for if you read another passage of the
          Word of God you will find, |These are they that came out of great
          tribulation.| Those that have had trial and suffering on earth are
          amongst those that have the bliss of heaven. Encourage yourselves, you
          poor and suffering ones. It is quite certain they did not come there
          from their own merit, for we read, they have |washed their robes| --
          they wanted washing. They did not keep them always undefiled. There
          had been spots upon them. They came there not because they deserved to
          be there, but because of the rich grace of God. How did they come
          there then? Well, first, they came there through the lamb that was
          slain. He bore the sun and the heat, and, therefore, the sun doth not
          light on them, nor any heat. The hot sun of Jehovah's justice shone
          full upon the Saviour -- scorched, and burned, and consumed him with
          grief and anguish; and because the Saviour suffered, therefore we
          suffer it no more. All our hopes of heaven are found at the cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          But they came there next because the Saviour shed his blood. They
          washed their robes in it. Faith linked them to the Saviour. The
          fountain would not have cleansed their robes if they had not washed in
          it. Oh! there shall be none come to heaven but such as have by faith
          embraced what God provides. Dear hearer, judge thyself whether thou
          art right, therefore. Hast thou washed thy robe and made it white in
          the Lamb's blood? Is Christ all in all to thee? If not, canst thou
          hope to be there? And they are there in perfect bliss, we are told. No
          sun lights on them, nor any heat, because the Lamb in the midst of the
          throne is with them. How could they be unhappy who see Christ? Is not
          this the secret of their bliss, that Jesus fully reveals himself to
          them?
        </p>
        <p>
          And besides, they have the love of God to enjoy, for the last word of
          the chapter is, |God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.| The
          blood of Jesus applied, the presence of Jesus enjoyed, and the love of
          God fully revealed -- these are the causes of the bliss of the saved
          in heaven. But we must close our meditation with the last point, which
          is: --
        </p>
        <p>III. WHAT THIS TEACHES US.</p>
        <p>
          First, the bliss of the saved in glory teaches us to long for it. It
          is legitimate to long for heaven -- not to long to escape from doing
          our duty here. It is idleness to be always wanting to have done with
          this world -- it is clear sloth -- but to be longing to be where Jesus
          is, is only natural and gracious. Should not the child long to go home
          from the school? Should not the captive pine for liberty? Should not
          the traveller in foreign lands long to see his native country? Should
          not the bride, the married wife, when she has been long away from her
          husband, long to see his face? If you did not long for heaven, surely
          you might question whether heaven belonged to you. If you have ever
          tasted of the joys of the saints, as believers do on earth, you will
          sing with full soul: --
        </p>
        <p>|My thirsty spirit faints</p>
        <p>To reach the land I love</p>
        <p>The bright inheritance of saints,</p>
        <p>Jerusalem above.|</p>
        <p>You may long for this.</p>
        <p>
          And the next lesson is, be patient until you get there. As it will be
          such a blessed place when you arrive, don't trouble about the
          difficulties of the way. You know our hymn: --
        </p>
        <p>|The way may be rough, but it cannot be long.|</p>
        <p>So</p>
        <p>|Let us fill it with hope, and cheer it with song.|</p>
        <p>
          You know how well your horse goes when you turn its head homewards.
          Perhaps you had to flog him a bit before, but when he begins to know
          he is going down the long lane which leads home he will soon lift up
          his ears, and away, away he will go. We ought to have as much sense as
          horses. Our heads are turned towards heaven We are steering towards
          that port -- homeward bound. It may be rough weather but we shall soon
          be in the fair haven where not a wave of trouble shall ever disturb us
          again. Be patient, be patient. The husbandman has waited for the
          precious fruits of the earth; you can well wait for the precious
          things of heaven. You sow in tears, but you shall reap in joy. He has
          promised you a harvest. He who cannot lie has said the seed-time and
          harvest shall never cease They do not cease below; depend upon it,
          they won't cease above. There is a harvest for you who have been
          sowing here below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our first lesson, then, is, long for this, and then be patient in
          waiting. But our next lesson is to be, wait your appointed time. And
          now the next instruction is, make much of faith. They entered heaven
          because they had washed their robes in blood. Make much of the blood
          and much of the faith by which you have washed. Dear hearers, have you
          all got faith? It is, as it were, the key of blessedness. |But all men
          have not faith,| says the Apostle. Hast thou faith? Dost thou believe
          in Christ Jesus? In other words, dost thou trust thyself alone with
          him' Can you sing with our poet: --
        </p>
        <p>|Nothing in my hand I bring</p>
        <p>Simply to thy cross I cling;</p>
        <p>Naked, come to thee for dress,</p>
        <p>Helpless, look to thee for grace.</p>
        <p>Foul, I to the fountain fly,</p>
        <p>Wash me, Saviour, or I die|?</p>
        <p>Make much of the faith that will admit you to heaven.</p>
        <p>
          Once more, our text teaches us this lesson -- Do any of us want to
          know what heaven is on earth? Most of us will say, |Aye| to that. Well
          then, the text tells you how to find heaven on earth. You find it in
          the same way as they find it in heaven. First, be thou washed in the
          blood of Christ, and that will be a great help towards happiness on
          earth. It will give thee peace now, |the peace of God that passeth all
          understanding.| Some people think that heaven on earth is to be found
          in the theatre, and in the ballroom, and in the giddy haunts of
          fashion. Well, it may be heaven to some, but if God has any love to
          you, it won't be heaven to you. Wash your robe, therefore, in the
          Saviour's blood, and there will be the beginning of heaven on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then next, it appears, if you read the connection of our text, that
          those who enjoy heaven serve God day and night in his temple. If you
          want heaven on earth, serve God continually day and night. Having
          washed your robe first, then put it on, and go out to serve God. Idle
          Christians are often unhappy Christians I have met with many a
          spiritual dyspeptic always full of doubts and fears. Is there a young
          man here full of doubts and fears who has lost the light he once
          possessed, and the joy he once had? Dear brother, get to work. In cold
          weather the best way to be warm is not to get before a fire, but to
          work. Exercise gives a healthy glow, even amidst the frost. |I am
          doing something,| says one. Yes, with one hand; use the other hand.
          |Perhaps I should have too many irons in the fire,| says one. You
          cannot have too many. Put them all in, and blow the fire with all the
          bellows you can get. I do not believe any Christian man works too
          hard, and, as a rule, if those who kill themselves in Christ's service
          were buried in a cemetery by themselves, it would be a long while
          before it would get filled. Work hard for Christ. It makes happy those
          who are in heaven to serve God day and night, and it will make you
          happy on earth. Do all you can. Another way is to have fellowship with
          Christ here. Read again this chapter. |He that sitteth on the throne
          shall dwell among them -- he shall feed them.| Oh! if you want to be
          happy, live near to Jesus. Poor men are not poor when Christ lives in
          their house. Truly, sick men have their beds made easy when Christ is
          there. Has he not said, | I will make his bed in all his sickness|?
          Only get fellowship with Jesus, and outward circumstances won't
          distress you. The sun will not light on you, nor any heat. You will be
          like the shepherd on Salisbury Plain, who said it was good weather,
          though it rained hard. |It is weather,| said he, |that pleases me.|
          |How so?| said a traveller to him. |Well, sir,| he said, |it pleases
          God, and what pleases God pleases me.| |Good day!| said one to a
          Christian man. |I never had a bad day since I was converted,| said he.
          |They are all good now since Christ is my Saviour.| Do you not see,
          then, that if your wishes are subdued, if you do not hunger any more,
          or thirst any more as you used to do, and if you always live near to
          Christ, you will begin to enjoy heaven on earth. Begin, then, the
          heavenly life here below. The Bible says, |For he hath raised us up,
          and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.| The way
          to live on earth, according to many, is to live on earth, but to look
          upward to heaven. That is a good way of living, but I will tell you a
          better, and that is to live in heaven, and look down on earth. The
          Apostle had learned that when he said, |Our conversation is in
          heaven.| It is good to be on earth, and look up to heaven; it is
          better for the mind to be in heaven, and to look down upon earth. May
          we learn that secret. The Lord lead us into it. Then when faith is
          strong, and love is ardent, and hope is bright, we shall sing, with
          Watts: --
        </p>
        <p>|The men of grace have found</p>
        <p>Glory begun below;</p>
        <p>Celestial fruits on earthly ground</p>
        <p>From faith and hope may grow.|</p>
        <p>
          The Lord grant you a participation in this bliss, beloved, and an
          abundant entrance into that bliss for ever, for Jesus Christ's sake.
          Amen.<br />
