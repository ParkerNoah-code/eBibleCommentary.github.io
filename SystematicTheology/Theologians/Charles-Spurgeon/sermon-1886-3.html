        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1890)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, March 7th, 1886, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth." -- John 17:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          OUR LORD JESUS prayed much for his people while he was here on earth.
          He made Peter the special subject of his intercession when he knew
          that he was in extraordinary danger. The midnight wrestlings of the
          Son of man were for his people. In the sacred record, however, much
          more space is taken up by our Lord's intercessions as he nears the end
          of his labors. After the closing supper, his public preaching work
          being ended, and nothing remaining to be done but to die, he gave
          himself wholly unto prayer. He was not again to instruct the
          multitude, nor to heal the sick, and in the interval which remained,
          before he should lay down his life, he girded himself for special
          intercession. He poured out his soul in life before he poured it out
          unto death.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this wonderful prayer, our Lord, as our great High Priest, appears
          to enter upon that perpetual office of intercession which he is now
          exercising at the right hand of the Father. Our Lord ever seemed, in
          the eagerness of his love, to be anticipating his work. Before he was
          set apart for his life-work, by the descent of the Holy Ghost upon
          him, he must needs be about his Father's business; before he finally
          suffered at the hands of cruel men, he had a baptism to be baptized
          with, and he was straitened till it was accomplished; before he
          actually died, he was covered with a bloody sweat, and was exceeding
          sorrowful even unto death; and in this case, before he in person
          entered within the veil, he made intercession for us. He never tarries
          when the good of his people calls for him. His love hath wings as well
          as feet: it is true of him evermore, "He rode upon a cherub, and did
          fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind." O beloved, what a
          friend we have in Jesus! so willing, so speedy to do for us all that
          we need. Oh that we could imitate him in this, and be quick of
          understanding to perceive our line of service, and eager of heart to
          enter upon it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This chapter, which ought to be universally known as the Lord's
          Prayer, may be called the holy of holies of the word of God. Here we
          are admitted to that secret place where the Son of God speaks with the
          Father in closest fellowship of love. Here we look into the heart of
          Jesus, as he sets out in order his desires and requests before his
          Father on our behalf. Here inspiration lifts her veil, and we behold
          truth face to face. Our text lies somewhere near the middle of the
          prayer; it is the heart of it. Our Lord's desire for the
          sanctification of his people pervades the whole prayer; but it is
          gathered up, declared, and intensified in the one sentence that I have
          read to you: "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth." How
          invaluable must the blessing of sanctification be when our Lord, in
          the highest reach of his intercession, cries: "Sanctify them!" In
          sight of his passion, on the night before his death, our Savior lifts
          his eyes to the great Father, and cries in his most plaintive tones,
          "Father, sanctify them." The place whereon we stand is holy ground,
          and the subject whereof we speak demands our solemn thought. Come,
          Holy Spirit, and teach us the full meaning of this prayer for
          holiness!
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I call your attention to what it is the Savior asks --
          "sanctify them;" and then, for whom he asks it -- it is for those whom
          his Father had given him. Thirdly, we shall note of whom he asks it:
          he asks this sanctification of God the Father himself, for he alone it
          is who can sanctify his people. Lastly, we will enquire how is this
          blessing to be wrought? -- "Sanctify them through thy truth;" and our
          Lord adds an explanatory sentence, which was a confession of his own
          faith towards the word of the Lord, and an instruction to our faith in
          the same matter. "Thy word is truth."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. At the beginning, then, consider WHAT HE ASKED. What is this
          inestimable blessing which our Savior so earnestly requests at the
          Father's hand? He first prays, "Holy Father, keep them;" and again,
          "Keep them from the evil;" but this negative blessing of preservation
          from evil is not enough: he seeks for them positive holiness, and
          therefore he cries, "sanctify them." The word is one of considerable
          range of meaning: I am not able to follow it through all its shades,
          but one or two must suffice.
        </p>
        <p>
          It means, first, dedicate them to thy service; for such must be the
          meaning of the word further down, when we read, "For their sakes I
          sanctify myself." In the Lord's case it cannot mean purification from
          sin, because our Savior was undefiled; his nature was unblemished by
          sin, and his actions were unspotted. No eye of man, nor glance of
          fiend, could discover fault in him, and the search of God only
          resulted in the declaration that in him God was well pleased. Our
          Lord's sanctification was his consecration to the fulfillment of the
          Divine purpose, his absorption in the will of the Father. "Lo, I come
          to do thy will, O God." In this sense our interceding Lord asks that
          all his people may by the Father be ordained and consecrated unto holy
          service. The prayer means, "Father, consecrate them to thine own self;
          let them be temples for thine indwelling, instruments for thy use."
          Under Jewish law the tribe of Levi was chosen out of the twelve, and
          ordained to the service of the Lord, instead of the firstborn, of whom
          the Lord had said, "All the firstborn of the children of Israel are
          mine: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I
          sanctified them for myself." (Numbers 8:17.) Out of the tribe of Levi
          one family was taken and dedicated to the priesthood. Aaron and his
          sons are said to have been sanctified. (Leviticus 8:30.) A certain
          tent was sanctified to the service of God, and hence it became a
          sanctuary; and the vessels that were therein, whether they were
          greater, like the altar, and the holy table, and the ark of the
          covenant, or whether they were of less degree, like the bowls and the
          snuff-dishes of the candlestick, were all dedicated or sanctified.
          (Numbers 7:1.) None of these things could be used for any other
          purpose than the service of Jehovah. In his courts there was a holy
          fire, a holy bread, and a holy oil. The holy anointing oil, for
          instance, was reserved for sacred uses. "Upon man's flesh it shall not
          be poured;" and again, "Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell
          thereto, shall even be cut off from his people." These sanctified
          things were reserved for holy purposes, and any other use of them was
          strictly forbidden. Bullocks and lambs and sheep and turtle-doves, and
          so forth, were given by devout offerers, brought to the holy place,
          and dedicated unto God; henceforth they belonged to God, and must be
          presented at his altar. This is one part of the meaning of our Lord's
          prayer. He would have each of us consecrated unto the Lord, designated
          and ordained for divine purposes. We are not the world's, else might
          we be ambitious; we are not Satan's, else might we be covetous; we are
          not our own, else might we be selfish. We are bought with a price, and
          hence we are his by whom the price is paid. We belong to Jesus, and he
          presents us to his Father, and begs him to accept us and sanctify us
          to his own purposes. Do we not most heartily concur in this
          dedication? Do we not cry, "Father, sanctify us to thy service?" I am
          sure we do if we have realized our redeemed condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved brethren, if the sprinkling of the blood, of which we spake
          last Sabbath-day, has really taken effect upon us, we belong, from
          this time forth, unto him that died for us, and rose again. We regard
          ourselves as God's men, the liveried servants of the great King --
          that livery the robe of righteousness. We were as sheep going astray,
          but we have now returned unto the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls;
          and henceforth we are his people and the sheep of his pasture. If any
          should ask, "To whom belongest thou?" we answer, "I belong to Christ."
          If any enquire, "What is thine occupation?" we reply with Jonah, "I
          fear God." We are not now at our own disposal, neither can we hire
          ourselves out to inferior objects, mercenary aims, or selfish
          ambitions; for we are engaged by solemn contract to the service of our
          God. We have lifted up our hand unto the Lord, and we cannot draw
          back. Neither do we wish to withdraw from the delightful compact and
          covenant; we desire to keep it even unto the end. We seek no liberty
          to sin, nor license for self; rather do we cry, "Bind the sacrifice
          with cords, even unto the horns of the altar. Sanctify us, O Lord. Let
          us know, and let all the world know, that we are thine, because we
          belong to Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to this, those who belonged to God, and were dedicated to
          his service, were set apart and separated from others. There was a
          special service for the setting-apart of priests; certain rites were
          performed at the sanctifying of dedicated places and vessels. You
          remember with what solemn service the Tabernacle was set up, and with
          what pomp of devotion the Temple itself was set apart for the divine
          service. The Sabbath-day, which the Lord hath sanctified, is set apart
          from the rest of time. To man it is a dies non, because it is the
          Lord's-day. The Lord would have those who are dedicated to him to be
          separated from the rest of mankind. For this purpose he brought
          Abraham from Ur of the Chaldees, and Israel out of Egypt. "The people
          shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations." The
          Lord saith of his chosen, "This people have I formed for myself; they
          shall shew forth my praise." Before long this secret purpose is
          followed by the open call: "Come out from among them, and be ye
          separate; touch not the unclean thing, and I will be a Father unto
          you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters." The church of Christ is
          to be a chaste virgin, wholly set apart for the Lord Christ: his own
          words concerning his people are these, "They are not of the world,
          even as I am not of the world."
        </p>
        <p>
          By the election of grace from before the foundation of the world this
          distinction commences, and the names are written in heaven. Thereupon
          follows a redemption peculiar and special, as it is written; "These
          were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to
          the Lamb." This redemption is followed by effectual calling wherein
          men are made to come forth from the old world into the kingdom of
          Christ. This is attended with regeneration, in which they receive a
          new life, and so become as much distinguished from their fellow-men as
          the living are from the dead. This separating work is further carried
          on in what is commonly known as sanctification, whereby the man of God
          is removed farther and farther from all fellowship with the unfruitful
          works of darkness, and is changed from glory unto glory, into an
          ever-growing likeness of his Lord, who was "holy, harmless, undefiled
          separate from sinners."
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who are sanctified in this sense have ceased to be unequally
          yoked together with unbelievers; they have ceased to run with the
          multitude to do evil; they are not conformed to this present evil
          world; they are strangers and pilgrims upon the earth. The more
          assuredly this is true of them the better. There are some, in these
          apostate days, who think that the church cannot do better than to come
          down to the world to learn her ways, follow her maxims, and acquire
          her "culture." In fact, the notion is that the world is to be
          conquered by our conforming to it. This is as contrary to Scripture as
          the light is to the darkness. The more distinct the line between him
          that feareth God and him that feareth him not, the better all round.
          It will be a black day when the sun itself is turned into darkness.
          When the salt has lost its savor, and no longer opposes putrefaction,
          the world will rot with a vengeance. That text is still true, "Ye are
          of God, little children, and the whole world lieth in the wicked one."
          The seed of the woman knows no terms with the serpent brood but
          continual war. Our Lord saith that in this matter he came not to send
          peace on the earth, but a sword. "Because ye are not of the world, but
          I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you."
          If the church seeks to cultivate the friendship of the world, she has
          this message from the Holy Ghost by the pen of the apostle James: "Ye
          adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the
          world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the
          world is the enemy of God." He charges all who would please the world
          with the black and filthy crime of spiritual adultery. The heart which
          ought to be given to Christ and purity must not wander forth wantonly
          to woo the defiled and polluted things of this present evil world.
          Separation from the world is Christ's prayer for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Put these two things together, dedication to God and separation unto
          him, and you are nearing the meaning of the prayer. But, mark you, it
          is not all separation that is meant; for, as I told you in the reading
          there are some who "separate themselves," and yet are sensual, not
          having the Spirit. Separation for separation's sake savours rather of
          Babel than of Jerusalem. It is one thing to separate from the world,
          and another thing to be separate from the church. Where we believe
          that there is living faith in Jesus, and the indwelling of the Holy
          Ghost, we are not called to division, but to unity. For actual and
          manifest sin we must separate ourselves from offender -- ; but we err
          if we carry on this separation where it is not authorized by the word
          of God. The Corinthians and Galatians were far from being perfect in
          life, and they had made many mistakes in doctrine, yea, even upon
          vital points; but inasmuch as they were truly in Christ, Paul did not
          command any to come out of those churches, and to be separate
          therefrom; but he exhorted them to prove each man his own work, and he
          labored to bring them all back to the one and only gospel, and to a
          clearer knowledge of it. We are to be faithful to truth; but we are
          not to be of a contentious spirit, separating ourselves from those who
          are living members of the one and indivisible body of Christ. To
          promote the unity of the church, by creating new divisions, is not
          wise. Cultivate at once the love of the truth and the love of the
          brethren. The body of Christ will not be perfected by being rent.
          Truth should be the companion of love. If we heartily love even those
          who are in some measure in error, but who possess the life of God in
          their souls, we shall be the more likely to set them right. Separation
          from the world is a solemn duty, indeed it is the hard point, the crux
          and burden of our religion. It is not easy to be filled with love to
          men and yet for God's sake, and even for their own sake, to be
          separated from them. The Lord teach us this.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, this word "sanctification" means what is commonly
          understood by it, namely, the making of the people of God holy.
          "Sanctify them," that is, work in them a pure and holy character.
          "Lord, make thy people holy," should be our daily prayer. I want you
          to notice that this word here used in the Greek is not that which is
          rendered "Purify;" but it has another shade of meaning. Had it meant
          "purify," it would hardly have been used in reference to our Lord as
          it is in the next verse.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has a higher meaning than that. O brethren, if you are called
          Christians, there must be no room for doubt as to the fact that you
          are purged from the common sins and ordinary transgressions of
          mankind, else are you manifestly liars unto God, and deceivers of your
          own souls. They that are not moral, they that are not honest, they
          that are not kind, they that are not truthful, are far from the
          kingdom. How can these be the children of God who are not even decent
          children of men? Thus we judge, and rightly judge, that the life of
          God cannot be in that man's soul who abides wilfully in any known sin,
          and takes pleasure therein. No; purification is not all. We will take
          it for granted that you who profess to be Christians have escaped from
          the foul pollution of lust and falsehood; if you have not done so,
          humble yourselves before God, and be ashamed; for you need the very
          beginnings of grace. "They that are Christ's have crucified the
          flesh." But sanctification is something more than mere morality and
          respectability; it is not only deliverance from the common sins of
          men, but also from the hardness, deadness, and carnality of nature: it
          is deliverance from that which is of the flesh at its very best, and
          admittance into that which is spiritual and divine. That which is
          carnal cometh not into communion with the spiritual kingdom or Christ:
          we need that the spiritual nature should rise above that which is
          merely natural. This is our prayer -- Lord, spiritualize us; elevate
          us; make us to dwell in communion with God; make us to know him whom
          flesh and blood cannot reveal or discern. May the Spirit of the living
          God have full sovereignty over us and perfect in us the will of the
          Lord, for this is to be sanctified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sanctification is a higher word than purification; for it includes
          that word and vastly more: it is not sufficient to be negatively
          clean; we need to be adorned with all the virtues. If ye be merely
          moral, how does your righteousness exceed that of the scribes and
          Pharisees? If ye pay your lawful debts, give alms to the poor, and
          observe the rites of your religion, what do ye more than others whom
          ye yourselves reckon to be in error?
        </p>
        <p>
          Children of God should exhibit the love of God, they should be filled
          with zeal for his glory, they should live generous, unselfish lives,
          they should walk with God, and commune with the Most High. Ours should
          be a purpose and an aim far higher than the best of the unregenerate
          can understand. We ought to reach unto a life and a kingdom of which
          the mass of mankind know nothing, and care less. Now, I am afraid that
          this spiritual sense of the prayer is one that is often forgotten. Oh
          that God's Holy Spirit might make us to know it by experimentally
          feeling it in ourselves! May "Holiness to the Lord" be written across
          the brow of our consecrated humanity!
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, this prayer of our Lord is most necessary, for without
          sanctification how can we be saved, since it is written, "Without
          holiness no man shall see the Lord?" How can we be saved from sin if
          sin has still dominion over us? If we are not living holy, godly,
          spiritual lives, how can we say that we are redeemed from the power of
          evil?
        </p>
        <p>
          Without sanctification we shall be unfit for service. Our Lord Jesus
          contemplated the sending of each one of us into the world even as the
          Father sent him into the world; but how can he give a mission to
          unsanctified men and women? Must not the vessels of the Lord be clean?
        </p>
        <p>
          Without sanctification we cannot enjoy the innermost sweets of our
          holy faith. The unsanctified are full of doubts and fears; and what
          wonder? The unsanctified often say of the outward exercise of
          religion, "What a weariness it is!" and no wonder, for they know not
          the internal joys of it, having never learned to delight themselves in
          God. If they walk not in the light of the Lord's countenance, how can
          they know the heaven below which comes of true godliness? Oh, it is a
          prayer that needs to be prayed for me, for you, for this church, and
          for the whole church of God! "Father, sanctify them through thy
          truth."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now I want you to notice, in the second place, FOR WHOM THIS
          PRAYER WAS OFFERED. It was not offered for the world outside. It would
          not be a suitable prayer for those who are dead in sin. Our Lord
          referred to the company of men and women who were already saved, of
          whom he said that they had kept God's Word: "Thine they were, and thou
          gavest them me." They were therefore sanctified already in the sense
          of being consecrated and set apart for holy purposes; and they were
          also sanctified in a measure already in the sense of being made holy
          in character; for the immediate disciples of our Lord, with all their
          errors and deficiencies, were holy men. It was for the apostles that
          Jesus thus prayed; so that we may be sure that the most eminent saints
          need still to have this prayer offered for them: "Sanctify them
          through thy truth." Though, my sisters, you may be Deborahs, worthy to
          be called mothers in Israel, yet you need to be made more holy.
          Though, my brethren, you may be true fathers in God, of whom the
          Scripture saith truly that we have "not many," yet you still need that
          Jesus should pray for you: "Sanctify them through thy truth."
        </p>
        <p>
          These chosen ones were sanctified, but only to a degree. Justification
          is perfect the moment it is received, but sanctification is a matter
          of growth. He that is justified, is justified once for all by the
          perfect work of Jesus, but he that is sanctified by Christ Jesus must
          grow up in all things into him who is the Head. To make us holy is a
          life work, and for it we should seek the divine operation every hour;
          for "he that hath wrought us for the self-same thing is God." We would
          rise to the utmost pitch of holy living, and never content ourselves
          with present attainments. Those who are most pure and honorable have
          yet their shortcomings and errors to mourn over. When the Lord turns
          the light strong upon us, we soon see the spots upon our raiment; it
          is indeed when we walk in the light as God is in the light that we see
          most our need of the cleansing blood of Jesus. If we have done well,
          to God be the glory of it; but we might have done better. If we have
          loved much, to God's grace be the praise; but we ought to have loved
          more. If we have believed, and believed steadfastly, we ought to have
          believed to a far higher degree in our Almighty Friend. We are still
          below our capacities; there is a something yet beyond us. O ye
          sanctified ones, it is for you that Jesus prays that the Father may
          still sanctify you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want you to notice more particularly that these believers for whom
          our Lord prayed were to be the preachers and teachers of their own and
          succeeding generations. These were the handful of seed-corn out of
          which would grow the church of the future, whose harvest would gladden
          all lands. To prepare them to be sent out as Christ's missionaries
          they must be sanctified. How shall a holy God send out unholy
          messengers? An unsanctified minister is an unsent minister. An unholy
          missionary is a pest to the tribe he visits; an unholy teacher in a
          school is an injury rather than a blessing to the class he conducts.
          Only in proportion as you are sanctified unto God can you hope for the
          power of the Holy Spirit to rest on you, and to work with you, so as
          to bring others to the Savior's feet. How much may each of us have
          been hampered and hindered by want of holiness! God will not use
          unclean instruments; nay, he will not even have his holy vessels borne
          by unclean hands. "To the wicked, God saith, What hast thou to do to
          declare my statutes?" A whole host may be defeated because of one
          Achan in the camp; and this is our constant fear. Holiness is an
          essential qualificatian to a man's fitness for being used of the Lord
          God for the extension of his kingdom; hence our Lord's prayer for his
          apostles and other workers: "Holy Father, sanctify them."
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, our Lord Jesus Christ was about to pray "that they all
          might be one;" and for this desirable result holiness is needed. Why
          are we not one? Sin is the great dividing element. The perfectly holy
          would be perfectly united. The more saintly men are, the more they
          love their Lord and one another; and thus they come into closer union
          with each other. Our errors and our sins are roots of bitterness which
          spring up and trouble us, and many are defiled. Our infirmities of
          judgment are aggravated by our imperfections of character, and our
          walking at a distance from our God; and these breed coldness and
          lukewarmness, out of which grow disunion and division, sects and
          heresies. If we were all abiding in Christ to the full, we should
          abide in union with each other and with God, and our Lord's great
          prayer for the unity of his church would be fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, our Lord finished his most comprehensive prayer by a
          petition that we might all be with him -- with him where he is, that
          we may behold his glory. Full sanctification is essential to this.
          Shall the unsanctified dwell with Christ in heaven? Shall unholy eyes
          behold his glory? It cannot be. How can we participate in the splendor
          and triumphs of the exalted head if we are not members of his body?
          and how can a holy head have impure and dishonest members? No,
          brethren, we must be holy, for Christ is holy. Uprightness of walk and
          cleanness of heart are absolutely requisite for the purposes of
          Christian life, whether here or hereafter. Those who live in sin are
          the servants of sin; only those who are renewed by the Holy Ghost unto
          truth, and holiness, and love, can hope to be partakers of holy joys
          and heavenly bliss.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I am compelled by shortness of time to be brief upon each point;
          but I must dwell for a little upon the third subject of consideration,
          which is this -- TO WHOM THIS PRAYER IS DIRECTED. "Sanctify them
          through thy truth." No one can sanctify a soul but Almighty God, the
          great Father of spirits. He who made us must also make us holy, or we
          shall never attain that character. Our dear Savior calls the great God
          "Holy Father" in this prayer, and it is the part of the holy God to
          create holiness; while a holy Father can only be the Father of holy
          children, for like begets like. To you that believe in Jesus he gives
          power to become the sons of God, and a part of that power lies in
          becoming holy according to the manner and character of our Father who
          is in heaven. As we are holy, so do we bear the image of that Lord
          from heaven who, as the second man, is the firstborn to whom the many
          brethren are conformed. The holy Father in heaven will own those as
          his children upon earth who are holy. The very nature of God should
          encourage us in our prayers for holiness; for he will not be slow to
          work in us to will and to do according to his perfect will.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, this sanctification is a work of God from its earliest stage.
          We go astray of ourselves, but we never return to the great Shepherd
          apart from his divine drawings. Regeneration, in which sanctification
          begins, is wholly the work of the Spirit of God. Our first discovery
          of wrong, and our first pang of penitence, are the work of divine
          grace. Every thought of holiness, and every desire after purity, must
          come from the Lord alone, for we are by nature wedded to iniquity. So
          also the ultimate conquest of sin in us, and the making us perfectly
          like to our Lord, must be entirely the work of the Lord God, who makes
          all things new, since we have no power to carry on so great a work of
          ourselves. This is a creation; can we create? This is a resurrection;
          can we raise the dead? Our degenerate nature can rot into a still
          direr putrefaction, but it can never return to purity or sweeten
          itself into perfection; this is of God and God alone. Sanctification
          is as much the work of God as the making of the heavens and the earth.
          Who is sufficient for these things? We go not even a step in
          sanctification in our own strength; whatever we think we advance of
          ourselves is but a fictitious progress which will lead to bitter
          disappointment. Real sanctification is entirely from first to last the
          work of the Spirit of the blessed God, whom the Father hath sent forth
          that he might sanctify his chosen ones. See, then, what a great thing
          sanctification is, and how necessary it is that our Lord should pray
          unto his Father, "Sanctify them through thy truth."
        </p>
        <p>
          The truth alone will not sanctify a man. We may maintain an orthodox
          creed, and it is highly important that we should do so, but if it does
          not touch our heart and influence our character, what is the value of
          our orthodoxy? It is not the doctrine which of itself sanctifies, but
          the Father sanctifies by means of the doctrine. The truth is the
          element in which we are made to live in order to holiness. Falsehood
          leads to sin, truth leads to holiness; but there is a lying spirit,
          and there is also the Spirit of truth, and by these the error and the
          truth are used as means to an end. Truth must be applied with
          spiritual power to the mind, the conscience, and the heart, or else a
          man may receive the truth, and yet hold it in unrighteousness. I
          believe this to be the crowning work of God in man, that his people
          should be perfectly delivered from evil. He elected them that they
          might be a peculiar people, zealous for good works; he ransomed them
          that he might redeem them from all iniquity, and purify them unto
          himself; he effectually calls them to a high and holy vocation, even
          to virtue and true holiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every work of the Spirit of God upon the new nature aims at the
          purification, the consecration, the perfecting of those whom God in
          love has taken to be his own. Yea, more; all the events of Providence
          around us work towards that one end: for this our joys and our
          sorrows, for this our pains of body and griefs of heart, for this our
          losses and our crosses -- all these are sacred medicines by which we
          are cured of the disease of nature, and prepared for the enjoyment of
          perfect spiritual health. All that befalls us on our road to heaven is
          meant to fit us for our journey's end. Our way through the wilderness
          is meant to try us, and to prove us, that our evils may be discovered,
          repented of, and overcome, and that thus we may be without fault
          before the throne at the last. We are being educated for the skies,
          meetened for the assembly of the perfect. It doth not yet appear what
          we shall be; but we are struggling up towards it; and we know that
          when Jesus shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as
          he is. We are rising: by hard wrestling, and long watching, and
          patient waiting, we are rising into holiness. These tribulations
          thresh our wheat and get the chaff away, these afflictions consume our
          dross and tin to make the gold more pure. All things work together for
          good to them that love God; and the net result of them all will be the
          presenting of the chosen unto God, not having spot or wrinkle, or any
          such thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have reminded you that the prayer for sanctification is offered
          to the divine Father, and this leads us to look out of ourselves and
          wholly, to our God. Do not set about the work of sanctification
          yourselves, as if you could perform it alone. Do not imagine that
          holiness will necessarily follow because you listen to an earnest
          preacher, or unite in sacred worship. My brethren, God himself must
          work within you; the Holy Ghost must inhabit you; and this can only
          come to you by faith in the Lord Jesus. Believe in him for your
          sanctification, even as you have believed for your pardon and
          justification. He alone can bestow sanctification upon you; for this
          is the gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. This is a great subject, and I have but short time; so I have, in
          the last place, to notice with much brevity HOW SANCTIFICATION IS TO
          BE WROUGHT IN BELIEVERS, "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is
          truth. "Beloved, observe how God has joined holiness and truth
          together. There has been a tendency of late to divide truth of
          doctrine from truth of precept. Men say that Christianity is a life
          and not a creed: this is a part truth, and very near akin to a lie.
          Christianity is a life which grows out of truth. Jesus Christ is the
          way and the truth as well as the life, and he is not properly received
          except he is accepted in that threefold character.
        </p>
        <p>
          No holy life will be produced in us by the belief of falsehood.
          Sanctification in visible character comes out of edification in the
          inner faith of the heart, or otherwise it is a mere shell. Good works
          are the fruit of true faith, and true faith is a sincere belief of the
          truth. Every truth leads towards holiness; every error of doctrine,
          directly or indirectly, leads to sin. A twist of the understanding
          will inevitably bring a contortion of the life sooner or later. The
          straight line of truth drawn on the heart will produce a direct course
          of gracious walking in the life. Do not imagine that you can live on
          spiritual carrion and yet be in fine moral health, or that you can
          drink down poisonous error and yet lift up a face without spot before
          God. Even God himself only sanctifies us by the truth. Only that
          teaching will sanctify you which is taken from God's word, that
          teaching which is not true, nor the truth of God, cannot sanctify you.
          Error may puff you up, it may even make you think that you are
          sanctified; but there is a very serious difference between boasting of
          sanctification and being sanctified, and a very grave difference
          between setting up to be superior to others and being really accepted
          before God. Believe me, God works sanctification in us by the truth,
          and by nothing else.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what is the truth? There is the point. Is the truth that which I
          imagine to be revealed to me by some private communication? Am I to
          fancy that I enjoy some special revelation, and am I to order my life
          by voices, dreams, and impressions? Brethren, fall not into this
          common delusion. God's word to us is in Holy Scripture. All the truth
          that sanctifies men is in God's Word. Do not listen to those who cry,
          "Lo here!" and "Lo there!" I am plucked by the sleeve almost every day
          by crazy persons and pretenders who have revelations. One man tells me
          that God has sent a message to me by him; and I reply, "No, sir, the
          Lord knows where I dwell, and he is so near to me that he would not
          need to send to me by you." Another man announces in God's name a
          dogma which, on the face of it, is a lie against the Holy Ghost. He
          says the Spirit of God told him so-and-so; but we know that the Holy
          Ghost never contradicts himself. If your imaginary revelation is not
          according to this Word, it has no weight with us; and if it is
          according to this Word, it is no new thing. Brethren, this Bible is
          enough if the Lord does but use it, and quicken it by his Spirit in
          our hearts. Truth is neither your opinion, nor mine; your message, nor
          mine. Jesus says, "Thy word is truth." That which sanctifies men is
          not only truth, but it is the particular truth which is revealed in
          God's Word -- "Thy word is truth." What a blessing it is that all the
          truth that is necessary to sanctify us is revealed in the Word of God,
          so that we have not to expend our energies upon discovering truth, but
          may, to our far greater profit, use revealed truth for its divine ends
          and purposes! There will be no more revelations; no more are needed.
          The canon is fixed and complete, and he that adds to it shall have
          added to him the plagues that are written in this Book. What need of
          more when here is enough for every practical purpose? "Sanctify them
          through thy truth: thy word is truth."
        </p>
        <p>
          This being so, the truth which it is needful for us to receive is
          evidently fixed. You cannot change Holy Scripture. You may arrive more
          and more accurately at the original text; but for all practical
          purposes the text we have is correct enough, and our old Authorized
          Version is a sound one. Scripture itself cannot be broken; we cannot
          take from it nor add to it. The Lord has never re-written nor revised
          his Word, nor will he ever do so. Our teachings are full of errors,
          but the Spirit mistaketh not. We have the "Retractations": of
          Augustine, but there are no retractations with prophets and apostles.
          The faith has been delivered once for all to the saints, and it
          standeth fast for ever. "Thy word is truth." The Scripture alone is
          absolute truth, essential truth, decisive truth, authoritative truth,
          undiluted truth, eternal, everlasting truth. Truth given us in the
          word of God is that which is to sanctify all believers to the end of
          time: God will use it to that end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learn, then, my brothers, how earnestly you ought to search the
          Scriptures! See, my sisters, how studiously you should read this Book
          of God! If this is the truth, and the truth with which God sanctifies
          us, let us learn it, hold it, and stand fast in it. To him that gave
          us the Book let us pledge ourselves never to depart from his
          testimonies. To us, at any rate, God's word is truth. "But they argue
          differently in the schools!" Let them argue. "But oratory with its
          flowery speech speaketh otherwise!" Let it speak: words are but air
          and tongues but clay. O God, "thy word is truth." "But philosophers
          have contradicted it!" Let them contradict it. Who are they? God's
          word is truth: we will go no farther while the world stands. But then
          let us be equally firm in our conviction that we do not know the truth
          aright unless it makes us holy. We do not hold truth in a true way
          unless it leads us to a true life. If you use the back of a knife it
          will not cut: truth hath its handle and its blade; see that you use it
          properly. You can make pure water kill a man; you must use every good
          thing aright or it will not be good. The truth, when fully used, will
          daily destroy sin, nourish grace, suggest noble desires, and urge to
          holy acts. O sirs, I do pray that we may by our lives adorn the
          doctrine of God our Savior in all things. Some do not so. I say this
          to our shame and to my own hourly sorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
          The one point of failure to be most deeply regretted would be a
          failure in the holiness of our church members. If you yourselves act
          as others do, what witness do you bear? If your families are not
          graciously ordered; if your business is not conducted upon principles
          of the strictest integrity; if your speech is questionable as to
          purity or truthfulness; if your lives are open to serious rebuke --
          how can God accept you or send a blessing on the Church to which you
          belong? It is all falsehood and deceit to talk about your being the
          people of God when even men of the world shame you. Your faith in the
          Lord Jesus must operate upon your lives to make you faithful and true,
          it must check you here, and excite you there; it must keep you back
          from this, and drive you on to that; it must constantly operate upon
          thought and speech and act, or else you know nothing of its saving
          power. How can I speak more distinctly and emphatically? Do not come
          to me with your experiences, and your convictions, and your
          professions, unless you sanctify the name of God in your lives. O
          brethren, we had better quit our professions if we do not live up to
          them. In the name of him who breathed this prayer just before his face
          was encrimsoned with the bloody sweat, let us cry mightily unto the
          Father, "Sanctify us through thy truth, thy Word is truth." As a
          people, we have stuck unto the Word of the Lord, but are we
          practically obeying it? We have determined as a congregation to keep
          the old ways; and I, for one, as the minister, am solemnly bound to
          the old faith. Oh that we might commend it by our holiness! Nothing is
          truth to me but this one Book, this infallibly inspired writing of the
          Spirit of God. It is incumbent upon us to show the hallowed influence
          of this Book. The vows of God are on us, that by our godly lives we
          should show forth his praises who has brought us out of darkness into
          his marvellous light. This Bible is our treasure. We prize each leaf
          of it. Let us bind it in the best fashion, in the best morocco of a
          clear, intelligent faith; then let us put a golden clasp upon it, and
          gild its edges by a life of love, and truth, and purity, and zeal.
          Thus shall we commend the volume to those who have never looked within
          its pages. Brethren, the sacred roll, with its seven seals, must not
          be held in hands defiled and polluted; but with clean hands and pure
          heart we must hold it forth and publish it among men. God help us so
          to do for Jesus' sake! Amen.
