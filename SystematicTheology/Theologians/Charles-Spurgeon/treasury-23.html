</b></font>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Verse 1. </font><b>
<font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">"The Lord is my shepherd."</font><font color="#008000" face="Verdana">
</font></b><font face="Verdana">What condescension is this, that the 
    infinite Lord assumes towards his people the office and character of a 
    Shepherd! It should be the subject of grateful admiration that the great God 
    allows himself to be compared to anything which will set forth his great 
    love and care for his own people. David had himself been a keeper of sheep, 
    and understood both the needs of the sheep and the many cares of a shepherd. 
    He compares himself to a weak, defenseless, and foolish creature, and he 
    takes God to be his Provider, Preserver, Director, and, indeed, his 
    everything. No man has a right to consider himself the Lord's sheep unless 
    his nature has been renewed; for the scriptural description of unconverted 
    men does not picture them as sheep, but as wolves or goats. A sheep is an 
    object of property, not a wild animal; its owner sets great store by it, and 
    frequently it is bought with a great price. It is well to know, as certainly 
    David did, that we belong to the Lord. There is a noble tone of confidence 
    about this sentence. There is no "if" nor "but," nor even "I hope so;" but 
    he says, "The Lord is my shepherd." We must cultivate the spirit of assured 
    dependence upon our heavenly Father. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The sweetest word of the whole 
    verse, is that monosyllable, "My." He does not say, "The Lord is the 
    shepherd of the world at large, and leads forth the multitude as his flock," 
    but "The Lord is <b>my </b>shepherd;" if he be a Shepherd to no one else, he 
    is a Shepherd to me; he cares for me, watches over me, and preserves me. The 
    words are in the present tense. Whatever be the believer's position, he is 
    even now under the pastoral care of Jehovah. <br/>
 </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The next words are a sort of 
    inference from the first statement—they are weighty and positive—</font><b><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">"I 
    shall not lack."</font><font color="#008000" face="Verdana"> </font></b>
<font face="Verdana">I might lack otherwise, but when the Lord is my 
    Shepherd he is <b>able </b>to supply my needs, and he is certainly <b>
    willing </b>to do so--for his heart is full of love, and therefore "I shall 
    not lack." I shall not lack for TEMPORAL things. Does he not feed the 
    ravens, and cause the lilies to grow? How, then, can he leave his children 
    to starve? I shall not lack my SPIRITUAL needs, I know that his grace will 
    be sufficient for me. Resting in him he will say to me, "As your day so 
    shall your strength be." I may not possess all that I wish for, but I shall 
    not lack any truly good thing. Others, far wealthier and wiser than I, may 
    lack, but "I shall not." "The young lions lack, and suffer hunger, but those 
    who seek the Lord shall not lack any good thing." It is not only "I do not 
    lack," but "I <b>shall </b>not lack." Come what may, if famine should 
    devastate the land, or calamity destroy the city, "I shall not lack." Old 
    age with its feebleness shall not bring me any lack, and even death with its 
    gloom shall not find me destitute. I have all things and abound; not because 
    I have a good store of money in the bank, not because I have skill and wit 
    with which to earn my bread, but because "The Lord is my shepherd." The 
    wicked always lack, but the righteous never. A lost sinner's heart is far 
    from satisfaction, but a gracious spirit dwells in the palace of 
    contentment.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Verse 2. </font><b>
<font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">"He makes me to lie down in green 
    pastures, he leads me beside the still waters."</font><font color="#008000" face="Verdana">
</font></b><font face="Verdana">The Christian life has two elements in it, 
    the contemplative and the active, and both of these are richly provided for. 
    First, the CONTEMPLATIVE. "He makes me to lie down in green pastures." What 
    are these "green pastures" but the Scriptures of truth—always fresh, always 
    rich, and never exhausted? There is no fear of biting the bare ground--where 
    the grass is long enough for the flock to <b>lie </b>down in it. Sweet and 
    full are the doctrines of the gospel; fit food for souls, as tender grass is 
    natural nutriment for sheep. When by faith we are enabled to find rest in 
    the promises, we are like the sheep that lie down in the midst of the 
    pasture; we find at the same moment both provisions and peace, rest and 
    refreshment, serenity and satisfaction. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But observe, "He <b>makes </b>me to 
    lie down." It is the Lord who graciously enables us to perceive the 
    preciousness of his truth, and to feed upon it. How grateful ought we to be 
    for the power to appropriate the promises! There are some distracted souls 
    who would give worlds if they could but do this. They know the blessedness 
    of it, but they cannot say that this blessedness is theirs. They know the 
    "green pastures," but they are not made to "lie down" in them. Those 
    believers who have for years enjoyed a "full assurance of faith" should 
    greatly bless their gracious God.<br/>
 </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The second part of a vigorous 
    Christian's life consists in GRACIOUS ACTIVITY. We not only think, but we 
    act. We are not always lying down to feed, but are journeying onward toward 
    perfection; hence we read, "he leads me beside the still waters." What are 
    these "still waters" but the influences and graces of his blessed Spirit? 
    His Spirit attends us in various operations, like waters—in the plural—to 
    cleanse, to refresh, to fertilize, to cherish. They are "still waters," for 
    the Holy Spirit loves peace, and sounds no 'trumpet of ostentation' in his 
    operations. He may flow into <i>our </i>soul, but not into our neighbor's; 
    and therefore our neighbor may not perceive the divine presence; and though 
    the blessed Spirit may be pouring his floods into one heart, yet he who sits 
    next to the favored one may know nothing of it.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br/>
    Still waters run deep. Nothing more noisy than an empty drum. That silence 
    is golden indeed, in which the Holy Spirit meets with the souls of his 
    saints. Not to raging waves of strife, but to peaceful streams of holy love 
    does the Spirit of God conduct the chosen sheep. He is a dove, not an eagle. 
    He is the dew, not the hurricane. Our Lord leads us beside these "still 
    waters"--we could not go there of ourselves, we need his guidance, therefore 
    it is said, "he <i>leads </i>me." He does not drive us. Moses drives us by 
    the law, but Jesus leads us by his example, and the gentle drawing of his 
    love.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Verse 3. </font><b>
<font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">"He restores my soul."</font><font color="#008000" face="Verdana">
</font></b><font face="Verdana">When the soul grows <b>sorrowful</b>, our 
    Shepherd revives it. When the soul is <b>sinful</b>, he sanctifies it. When 
    the soul is <b>weak</b>, he strengthens it. "He" does it. His ministers 
    could not do it--if our Shepherd did not. His Word would not avail by 
    itself. "He restores my soul." Are any of us low in grace? Do we feel that 
    our spirituality is at its lowest ebb? He who turns the ebb into the flood 
    can soon restore our soul. Pray to him, then, for the blessing—"Restore me, 
    O Shepherd of my soul!"</font><b><font color="#008000" face="Verdana"><br/>
 </font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">"He leads me in 
    the paths of righteousness for his name's sake."</font><font color="#008000" face="Verdana">
</font></b><font face="Verdana">The Christian delights to be obedient, but 
    it is the obedience of love, to which he is constrained by the example of 
    his Master. "He leads me." The Christian is not obedient to some 
    commandments and neglectful of others. He does not pick and choose--but 
    yields to all. Observe, that the plural is used—"the path<i>s</i> of 
    righteousness." Whatever God may give us to do--we would do it, led by his 
    love. Some Christians overlook the blessing of sanctification, and yet to a 
    thoroughly renewed heart this is one of the sweetest gifts of the covenant. 
    If we could be saved from wrath, and yet remain impenitent sinners--we would 
    not be saved as we desire. For we mainly and chiefly pant to be saved from 
    sin and led in the way of holiness. All this is done out of pure free 
    grace--"for his name's sake." It is to the honor of our great Shepherd that 
    we should be a holy people, walking in the narrow way of righteousness. If 
    we be so led and guided we must not fail to adore our heavenly Shepherd's 
    care.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Verse 4.</font><b><font color="#008000" face="Verdana">
</font><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">"Yes, though I walk through the 
    valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; 
    your rod and your staff comfort me."</font><font color="#008000" face="Verdana">
</font></b><font face="Verdana">This unspeakably delightful verse has been 
    sung on many a dying bed, and has helped to make the dark valley bright. 
    Every word in it has a wealth of meaning. "Yes, though I <b>walk</b>," as if 
    the believer did not quicken his pace when he came to die, but still calmly 
    walked with God. To walk indicates the steady advance of a soul which knows 
    its road, knows its end, resolves to follow the path, feels quite safe, and 
    is therefore perfectly calm and composed. The dying saint is not in a 
    flurry, he does not run as though he were alarmed, nor stand still as though 
    he would go no further. He is not confounded nor ashamed, and therefore 
    keeps to his old pace. Observe that it is not walking <i>in </i>the valley, 
    but <i>through </i>the valley. We go through the dark tunnel of death and 
    emerge into the light of immortality! We do not die, we do but sleep--to 
    wake in glory! Death is not the house--but the porch! Death is not our final 
    resting place--but the passage to it. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The dying place is called a <b>
    valley</b>. The storm breaks on the mountain, but the valley is the place of 
    quietude, and thus full often the last days of the Christian are the most 
    peaceful of his whole life. The mountain is bleak and bare, but the valley 
    is rich with golden sheaves, and many a saint has reaped more joy and 
    knowledge when he came to die, than he ever knew while he lived. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And, then, it is not "the valley of 
    death," but "the valley of the <b>shadow </b>of death," for death in its 
    substance has been removed, and only the shadow of it remains. Someone has 
    said that when there is a shadow there must be light somewhere, and so there 
    is. Death stands by the side of the highway in which we have to travel, and 
    the light of heaven shining upon him throws a shadow across our path; let us 
    then rejoice that there is a light beyond. Nobody is afraid of a shadow, for 
    a shadow cannot stop a man's pathway even for a moment. The shadow of a dog 
    cannot bite; the shadow of a sword cannot kill; the shadow of death cannot 
    destroy us. Let us not, therefore, be afraid. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">"I will fear no evil." He does not 
    say there shall not be any evil; he had got beyond even that high assurance, 
    and knew that Jesus had put all evil away; but "I will <b>fear </b>no evil;" 
    as if even his fears, those shadows of evil, were gone for ever. The worst 
    evils of life are those which do not exist--except in our imagination. If we 
    had no troubles but real troubles, we would not have a tenth part of our 
    present sorrows. <b>We feel a thousand deaths in fearing one</b>, but the 
    psalmist was cured of the disease of fearing. "I will fear no evil," not 
    even the Evil One himself! I will not dread the last enemy--death! I will 
    look upon him as a conquered foe, an enemy to be destroyed.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">"For you are with me." This is the 
    joy of the Christian! "You are with me." The little child out at sea in the 
    storm is not frightened like all the other passengers on board the vessel, 
    it sleeps in its mother's bosom; it is enough for it that its mother is with 
    it. And it should be enough for the believer to know that Christ is with 
    him. "You are with me! I have, in having you, all that I can need and 
    desire. I have perfect comfort and absolute security--for you are with me!"
    </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">"Your rod and your staff," by which 
    you govern and rule your flock, the emblems of your sovereignty and of your 
    gracious care—"they comfort me." I will believe that you reign still. The 
    rod of Jesse shall still be over me as the sovereign support of my soul.<br/>
 </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many people profess to receive much 
    comfort from the hope that they shall not die. Certainly there will be some 
    who will be "alive and remain" at the coming of the Lord. But is there so 
    very much of advantage in such an 'escape from death' as to make it the 
    object of Christian desire? A wise man might prefer of the two--to die; for 
    those who shall not die, but who "shall be caught up together with the Lord 
    in the air," will be losers rather than gainers. They will lose that actual 
    fellowship with Christ in the tomb which dying saints will have, and we are 
    expressly told that they shall have no preference beyond those who are 
    asleep. Let us be of Paul's mind when he said that "To die is gain," and 
    think of "departing to be with Christ, which is far better." This 
    twenty-third psalm is not worn out--it is as sweet in a believer's ear now 
    as it was in David's time, let novelty-hunters say what they will.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Verse 5. </font><b>
<font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">"You prepare a table before me in the 
    presence of my enemies."</font><font color="#008000" face="Verdana"> </font>
</b><font face="Verdana">The godly man has his enemies. He would not be like 
    his Lord if he had not. If we were without enemies we might fear that we 
    were not the friends of God, for the friendship of the world is enmity to 
    God. Yet see the quietude of the godly man in spite of, and in the sight of, 
    his enemies. How refreshing is his calm bravery! "You prepare a table before 
    me." When a soldier is in the presence of his enemies, if he eats at all--he 
    snatches a hasty meal, and away he hastens to the fight. But observe, "You 
    prepare a table," just as a servant does when she unfolds the fancy 
    tablecloth and displays the ornaments of the feast on a festive occasion. 
    Nothing is hurried, there is no confusion, no disturbance, the enemy is at 
    the door, and yet God prepares a table, and the Christian sits down and eats 
    as if everything were in perfect peace. Oh! the peace which Jehovah gives to 
    his people, even in the midst of the most trying circumstances!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">"Let earth be all in arms abroad,<br/>
    They dwell in perfect peace."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font color="#008000" face="Verdana"><br/>
</font><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">"You anoint my head with OIL."</font></b><font face="Verdana"> 
    May we live in the daily enjoyment of this blessing, receiving a fresh 
    anointing for every day's duties. Every Christian is a priest, but he cannot 
    execute the priestly office without unction, and hence we must go day by day 
    to God the Holy Spirit, that we may have our heads anointed with oil. A 
    priest without the anointing oil misses the chief qualification for his 
    office; and the Christian priest lacks his chief fitness for service when he 
    is devoid of new grace from on high. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">"My cup runs 
    over."</font><font color="#008000" face="Verdana"> </font></b>
<font face="Verdana">He had not only enough--a cup full; but more than 
    enough--a cup which overflowed. A poor believer may say this as well as 
    those in richer circumstances. "What, all this--and Jesus Christ too!" said 
    a poor cottager as she broke a piece of bread and filled a glass with cold 
    water. Whereas a man may be ever so wealthy, but if he is discontented--his 
    cup cannot run over--it is cracked and leaks. 'Contentment' is the 
    philosopher's magic stone--which turns all it touches into gold! Happy is he 
    who has found it. Contentment is more than a kingdom--it is another word for 
    happiness! </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Verse 6.</font><b><font color="#008000" face="Verdana">
</font><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana">"Surely goodness and mercy shall 
    follow me all the days of my life."</font><font color="#008000" face="Verdana">
</font></b><font face="Verdana">This is a fact as indisputable as it is 
    encouraging; and therefore a heavenly "surely" is set as a seal upon it. 
    This sentence may be read, "<b>only </b>goodness and mercy," for there shall 
    be unmingled mercy in our life history. These twin guardian angels--goodness 
    and mercy--will always be with me at my back and my beck. Just as when great 
    princes go abroad they must not go unattended, so it is with the believer. 
    Goodness and mercy follow him always—"all the days of his life"—the black 
    days as well as the bright days; the days of fasting as well as the days of 
    feasting; the dreary days of winter as well as the bright days of summer. 
    GOODNESS supplies our needs; and MERCY blots out our sins!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana"><b>"And I will dwell 
    in the house of the Lord forever."</b></font><font face="Verdana"> "A 
    servant abides not in the house for ever; but the <i>son </i>abides 
    forever." While I am here on this earth, I will be a child at home with my 
    God. The whole world shall be his house to me! And when I ascend into the 
    'upper chamber', I shall not change my company, nor even change the house; I 
    shall only go to dwell in the upper storey of the house of the Lord forever!<br/>
