          'Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all the peoples, nations, and
          languages, that dwell in all the earth: peace be multiplied unto you.
          It hath seemed good unto me to shew the signs and wonders that the
          Most High God hath wrought toward me. How great are his signs! and how
          mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his
          dominion is from generation to generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my
          palace. I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts upon my
          bed and the visions of my head troubled me. Therefore made I a decree
          to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might
          make known unto me the interpretation of the dream. Then came in the
          magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I
          told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the
          interpretation thereof. But at the last Daniel came in before me,
          whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in
          whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and I told the dream before him,
          saying, O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that
          the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee,
          tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the
          interpretation thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and behold a
          tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great. The
          tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven
          and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth. The leaves thereof
          were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the
          beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven
          dwelt in the branches thereof, and all flesh was fed of it. I saw in
          the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy
          one came down from heaven. He cried aloud, and said thus: "Hew down
          the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter
          his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from
          his branches. Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth,
          even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field;
          and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with
          the beasts in the grass of the earth: let his heart be changed from
          man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times
          pass over him. The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the
          demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may
          know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to
          whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the lowest of men." This
          dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen: and thou, O Belteshazzar,
          declare the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my
          kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but
          thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for a while,
          and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered and said,
          Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation, trouble thee.
          Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that
          hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine adversaries. The
          tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height
          reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth; whose
          leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for
          all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose
          branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation; it is thou, O
          king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown,
          and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.
          And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from
          heaven, and saying, Hew down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless
          leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of
          iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet
          with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the
          field, till seven times pass over him; this is the interpretation, O
          king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my
          lord the king: that thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling
          shall be with the beasts of the field, and thou shalt be made to eat
          grass as oxen, and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven
          times shall pass over thee; till thou know that the Most High ruleth
          in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. And
          whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy
          kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that
          the heavens do rule. Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable
          unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine
          iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if there may be a lengthening
          of thy tranquillity.
        </p>
        <p>
          'All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar. At the end of twelve
          months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon. The king spake
          and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal
          dwelling place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my
          majesty? While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice
          from heaven, saying: "O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: the
          kingdom is departed from thee. And thou shalt be driven from men, and
          thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; thou shalt be made
          to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee; until thou
          know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to
          whomsoever he will." The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon
          Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen,
          and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair was grown
          like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws. And at the end
          of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine
          understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I
          praised and honoured him that liveth for ever; for his dominion is an
          everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation:
          and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he
          doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the
          inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him,
          What doest thou? At the same time mine understanding returned unto me;
          and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned
          unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was
          established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added unto me.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven;
          for all his works are truth, and his ways judgement: and those that
          walk in pride he is able to abase.'
