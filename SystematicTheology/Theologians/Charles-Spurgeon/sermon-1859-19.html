        <p>A Sermon</p>

        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>

          "Strenghten ye the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees." -- Isaiah
          35:8.
        </p>
        <p>
          IT IS THE DUTY of all men to be careful of the sons of sorrow. There
          be some who from their very birth are marked by melancholy as her own.
          The silent shades of sorrow are their congenial haunts; the glades of
          the forest of grief are the only places where their leaf can flourish.
          Others there are who through some crushing misfortune are brought so
          low that they never hold up their heads again, but go from that time
          forth mourning to their graves. Some there be, again, who disappointed
          in their early youth, either in some fond object of their affections,
          or else in some project of their young ambition, never can dare to
          face the world, but shrink from contact with their fellows, even as
          the sensitive plant curls up its tendrils at the touch. In all flocks
          there must be lambs, and weak and wounded sheep; and among the flock
          of men, it seems that there must necessarily be some who should more
          than others prove the truth of Job's declaration, "man is born to
          trouble even as the sparks fly upwards." It is the duty then of those
          of us who are more free than others from despondency of spirit, to be
          very tender to these weak ones. Far be it from the man of courageous
          disposition, of stern resolve, and of unbending purpose, to be hard
          towards those who are timid and despairing. If we have a lion-like
          spirit, let us not imitate the king of beasts in his cruelty to those
          timid fallow deer that fly before him, but let us place out strength
          at their service for their help and protection. Let us with downy
          fingers bind up the wounded heart; with oil and wine let us nourish
          their fainting spirits. In this battle of life, let the unwounded
          warriors bear their injured comrades to the rear, bathe their wounds,
          and cover them from the storm of war. Be gentle with those that are
          desponding. Alas, it is not every man that has learned this lesson.
          There are some who deal with others with rough-handed thoughtlessness.
          "Ah," they say, "if such a one be so foolish as to be sensitive let
          him be." O speak not thus; to be sensitive, timid, and desponding, is
          ill enough in itself, without out being hard and untender towards
          those who are so afflicted. Go ye forth, and do to others as ye would
          that they should do to you; and as ye would that others should in your
          hours of despondency deal with you tenderly and comfortably, so deal
          ye tenderly and comfortably with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But my text, especially commands the minister to deal tenderly with
          those of Christ's people who are in such a condition, and these are
          not a few, for although religion changes the moral temperament of men,
          it does not change the physical. A man who is weak in health before
          conversion will probably be as weak afterwards, and many a spirit that
          has a tendency to despondency, has exhibited that tendency after
          conversion. We do not profess that the religion of Christ will so
          thoroughly change a man as to take away from him all his natural
          tendencies; it will give the despairing something that will alleviate
          that despondency, but as long as that is caused by a low state of
          body, or a diseased mind, we do not profess that the religion of
          Christ will totally remove it. No, rather, we do see every day that
          amongst the best of God's servants, there are those who are always
          doubting, always looking to the dark side of every providence, who
          look at the threatening more than at the promise, are ready to write
          bitter things against themselves, and often put the bitter for sweet,
          and the sweet for bitter, erring against their own spirits and robbing
          themselves of comforts which they might enjoy. To those then, I shall
          have to speak this morning in the words of our text, "Strengthen ye
          the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees."
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a figure used in the text, and I shall keep to it. First, I
          shall attempt to show the importance of hands and knees in going to
          heaven. In the second place, I shall observe the ill effect of having
          weak hands and feeble knees; then note the causes of those weak hands
          and feeble knees; for in so doing I hope I shall be able to apply a
          cure.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. And, now, first, we find in our text hands and knees mentioned. We
          may be quite sure that THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN GETTING TO HEAVEN.
          The hands and knees, we must remember, are those parts of the body in
          which the effects of fear are the most easily seen. Of course the root
          of despondency and fear must lie in the heart; it is that which is
          first moved with terror. But afterwards these extremities, these limbs
          of action, these modes of expressing the will of the heart begin to
          feel the weakness also. The hands hang down in terror, and the knees
          begin to tremble. We are always accustomed to describe a man when he
          is in a great fright, when some overwhelming danger appals him, as
          hanging down his hands or wringing them in despair, and as feeling his
          knees knocking together in the moment of his terror. Just so the
          prophet means, that wherever the Christian displays most his timidity
          and his dismay there we must be careful to apply the remedy of
          comfort. Now, it is the fact that when the Christian's heart begins to
          tremble, his hands of action grow weak, and his knees of prayer begin
          to tremble also; he becomes unable to do and unable to pray. He is
          weak in active service, and he becomes weak also in wrestling with his
          God. Hands and knees are the exhibitors of inward power. Now, there
          are some men whose fears are so great that they have become visible,
          and can no longer be concealed. There was a time when these sons of
          mourning were able to mask their sorrow with an outward cheerfulness,
          but now they cannot. The fear of the heart has glided into their hands
          and descended into their knees; and we see them hiding from us, as the
          hind, when smitten by the arrow, retires from the herd to bleed alone.
          To such as these, ye sons of consolation, are ye sent with words of
          pity and deeds of love.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, note, the hands and knees are of the first importance because
          they represent active duty and supplication. The way to heaven is,
          through faith in Christ; but after we have believed in Christ the
          legitimate tendency of faith is active service. Although the Christian
          shall go to heaven through the blood of Christ, yet as a pilgrim he
          must walk there; and although he overcomes through the blood of the
          Lamb, yet as a warrior he must fight if he would reign. Active service
          is expected of every Christian. Christ does not put his children on a
          bed, and then carry them to heaven along a lazy road; but he gives
          them life and bids that life develope itself; he gives them strength,
          and commands them to use the strength in working out their own
          salvation. While he works in them, they are passive; but he then bids
          them be active and work out what he has beforehand wrought in. He is
          no Christian who does not seek to serve his God. The very motto of the
          Christian should be "I serve." Christ's people are Christ's servants,
          and as the angels in heaven delight to fly at God's behests, so do the
          children of God delight to run in the way of his commands. Hence,
          then, if the knees be weak and the hands be weak, it is little that we
          can do. We cannot run with the weak knee; we cannot labour with the
          weak hand. How can ye, the servants of Christ, how can ye lift the
          heavy burdens which ye have to carry, if your hands be weak and your
          knees totter? How can ye pull down the walls of your enemies if your
          hands tremble? How can ye smite your foemen with the sword of faith if
          your arm be weak? Look well, then, to this, for herein ye suffer
          exceeding loss; if in active service ye lose power and strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the knees may signify power. When a man becomes timid and
          desponding, his closet very soon becomes the chamber of woe. Our
          closets are either Bethels of Bochims, -- the house of God or else the
          house of weeping. Let a man become timid, distrustful, doubting,
          fearing, trembling -- what little power has he when he comes before
          the mercy seat! He would believe in God, but he cannot appropriate the
          promise. He would lay hold of the angel, but all his sinews shrink,
          and he cannot wrestle. He would plead the promise, but his hand
          refuses to clutch it with an iron grasp. And he goes away crying, "Oh
          that I could pray! oh that I could believe in God! oh that I could
          succeed with God in prayer, and become as a prevailing prince. Alas! I
          am as weak as water, and I can do nothing." Herein lies the importance
          of having a strong hand that we may serve God, and of having a strong
          knee that we may wrestle with him in prayer, and get the blessing from
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, again, that we may readily see what the prophet means by hands
          and knees, if we observe that a Christian, although his hopes are in
          heaven, stands upon the earth. It is with the hand of faith that the
          Christian lays hold upon that which is not seen, and endeavours to
          climb upwards to the skies; it is with his foot that he spurns the
          earth and all that it calls good or great. Let the Christian's foot be
          weak, and he cannot then despise the things that are seen: but he will
          be fixing his affection on things on earth and not on things above.
          Let his hand of faith, on the other hand, grow weak, and he cannot lay
          hold of the things that are in heaven. He will find it difficult to
          fix his hold above the stars, and feel that he is surely anchored; and
          very hard to climb the ladder Jacob saw. The foot represents the
          manner in which we deal with earth, we tread upon it boldly and
          courageously, despising its threats, contemning its riches, contemning
          its honours. The weak knee cannot do this; we are then apt to bend,
          and cringe, and fawn before a wicked world to be slaves, where we
          ought to be freemen, and vile where we ought to be noble. Here again
          we see the importance of the hands and the knees.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you will remember also that there are certain parts of the
          spiritual pilgrimage where hands and knees are absolutely required.
          John Bunyan represents Christian as coming to the foot of the hill
          Difficulty, and he says, "I looked then after Christian, to see him go
          up the hill, where I perceived he fell from running to going, and from
          going to clambering upon his hands and knees, because of the steepness
          of the place." Many such a place you and I have had to pass, brother
          Christians. Once we could run along the walls of salvation with
          triumphant faith; at other times we could walk even through the valley
          of the shadow of death with quiet confidence: but we have come to a
          place of trial and of extraordinary difficulty, where all speed failed
          us, and strength did not suffice. Then always on our knees in agony of
          prayer, and always on our hands in simplicity of faith, we climbed our
          weary way, often fearing lest we should fall backward to out
          destruction, but crying out, "Lord, let my knee find a resting place,
          let my hand hold on some projecting crag of promise, that there I may
          get a fast hold, lest I totter and fall. I can but ascend slowly. My
          heart followeth hard after thee, my spirit crieth after thee; Lord,
          help me! help me to climb this way, for back I cannot go." Every
          Christian who knows much about divine experience will understand what
          this means. He will often be brought into such a position that he can
          make but little progress; and he must think it quite enough if he can
          hold his ground against the desperate difficulties of his path. Hands
          and knees, then, in many ways, are essential for a Christian's
          comfort, his help, and his advance in the road to heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, I shall have in the second place to show THE ILL EFFECT OF
          WEAK HANDS AND KNEES.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, first, we have already hinted that one ill fruit of a Christian
          having weak hands and knees is this, that he will not himself be able
          to make much progress in the divine life. Christian men have never
          attained to what they are to be. They have only started on their
          pilgrimage, and after they have gone their furthest, there is a
          yet-beyond towards which they must press with earnest heart, though
          with weary footsteps. How is it that some of you have made but little
          progress on the road to heaven? In looking back on your lives, come of
          you must acknowledge that you do not know much more about Christ now
          than you did six years ago. You do not enjoy greater nearness of
          access to him now than you did then. You are not more diligent in his
          service, or more fearless in his defence, than you were at a period
          which has long since elapsed. Perhaps you are compelled to feel that
          you have made no advance, or even have gone backward. Why is this? Is
          it not because your hands have become weak, your knees have become
          feeble? You have neglected prayer: you have forsaken your closets, you
          have not poured out your hearts before God with that frequency which
          once distinguished you, and you have not the faith you once possessed.
          You have not believed the promise as you ought to have done. You have
          not taken God at his naked word, and trusted to him as he deserved.
          And do you expect ever to make any progress in the road to heaven if
          you doubt your God? Do you imagine that you shall ever go far along in
          the heavenly pilgrimage if you neglect prayer? As well could you
          expect a plant to grow without air and water as to expect your heart
          to grow without prayer and faith. A poor blanched thing may be
          produced in a dark cellar; and so may you maintain a poor, blanched
          miserable existence, if you live absent from your God, and apart from
          that strength which faith can give you, but you can never attain the
          healthy verdure of grace. Oh, man, if thou wouldst grow in grace, if
          thou wouldst comprehend with all saints what are the heights and
          depths, and know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, look well
          to thy knees that they be strong, look well to thy hands that they
          hang not down.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Christians of this age seem to me to be content with themselves,
          though there is infinite reason for the reverse. When I sit down and
          read the biographies of saints who have gone to heaven, I am
          astonished at myself, and I can only weep to think how far I am behind
          these men, and then how much further I must be behind my divine
          Master. Surely the examples of eminent saints should spur us onward.
          If Henry Martin could unreservedly devote his life and energies to
          Christ's service, why may not we? If Martin Luther with holy boldness
          could face the danger, why should not we? If Calvin with clear and
          eagle eye could read the doctrines of the gospel amid the mists of
          error, why should not we? If men of more modern times have been able
          to endure opprobrium and disgrace for Christ's sake, or if they in
          private have been able to reach to the seventh heaven of communion
          with God, and have lived on earth as if they were in paradise, why
          should not we? There is no reason why the least saint in God's family
          should not outrun the greatest. Why look upon the saints of olden time
          as if they were so far above us that we can never equal them? Oh,
          dream not so! What Abraham was you may be. What the mightiest saint of
          that former life was, that ought you to be. You should never rest
          satisfied until you labour to surpass them all; yea, not even them,
          for you have not yet attained to the perfection which is in Christ. I
          know this age is one which is always satisfied if it gets barely
          enough to carry it to heaven. Where is that holy ambition which ought
          to stir the Christian soul to noble deeds? But few of us have felt it.
          We are drivelling dwarfs, content with the small height to which we
          have attained, forgetful of the steeps which tower above our heads.
          Up! Christian, up! The mount of holiness may be steep to climb, but,
          man, the hill of God is a high hill, even as the hill of Bashan. Up!
          up! for it is only on its summit that the calm air of heaven can be
          breathed, and the mists of earth entirely swept away. But weak hands
          and feeble knees, I know, in this age, are the reasons why so few
          Christians attain to any eminence in the ways and works of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, again, weak hands and feeble knees have another ill effect. They
          prevent our doing any great wonder for the good of the world. Oh! what
          work there is to do in this poor world of ours. Imagine the first
          colonist landing in Australia. If it had been revealed to him in a
          vision that, in process of time, the whole of that huge island should
          be ploughed, and sown, and built upon, and inhabited, he would have
          said, "How is this to be done? how can it ever be effected?" And, even
          now, great as has been the progress in that country, if we were
          assured that in a few short years the whole of it would be brought
          under tillage, we should be apt to ask, but how shall it be done? We
          should, however, very readily perceive that there must be strong knees
          to dig, and strong hands to delve and plough, or else the work never
          could be accomplished. Many there must be, and the many must be
          strong, else the work cannot be done. And now, lift up your eyes, this
          day! behold, the whole world lies before you like one huge untilled
          country. Who is to drive the ploughshare of divine grace through all
          the continents of this world? Who is to make this desert blossom like
          the rose? Who shall sow it with the good seed-corn of the kingdom of
          God? Where are the labourers who shall afterwards reap the whitening
          fields? Not weak and feeble knees; they cannot do it. Our knees must
          be strong and our sinews must be well braced, or else so great a work
          can never be accomplished. I believe one reason why the religion of
          Christ makes such little progress at this time, is because most of us
          are so weak. We find, a few centuries after Christ's death, his name
          was preached in every land; there was not one region of the known
          globe which had not heard the marvellous story of the cross. But,
          then, the followers of Christ were men who knew not what it was to
          tremble. They counted not their lives dear unto them; but leaving
          houses, and land, and families, for his name's sake, they went
          everywhere preaching the Word. But at this day we are not strong. We
          must all be assured of a livelihood before we will go forth to preach
          the Word; and, even then, if no one shall smile on us, how soon we
          cease the work. We commence an enterprise, but little difficulties
          appal us. How many does the pastor have to see, of little men and
          little women who come creeping to him, and whining because they find
          difficulties in serving Christ. Is not this because ye have weak hands
          and feeble knees? If ye had the strong knees of the apostles, and the
          mighty hands of the ancient martyrs, nothing could stand against you.
          Let God's children once become strong, and woe unto thee, Babylon, woe
          unto thee, O Rome; down must ye fall, ye castles of the enemy. The
          weakness of God's children is your hope, but their strength is your
          despair. Let them once believe firmly, let them pray earnestly, and
          behold Victory waits upon their banners, and dismay will seize your
          hearts ye enemies of Christ. We are at this time blessing God that
          great doors have been opened for the spread of the gospel. Hindostan,
          China, Japan, many lands we hope shall soon be visited by the
          Christian missionary. But are we not conscious that our opportunities
          are greater than our strength? Must not the Christian church confess
          that she has now a greater field, but she has, perhaps, fewer
          labourers than ever? The harvest is greater, but the labourers are
          fewer. Whence comes it? It comes from this fact, that through the
          church of Christ the weak hand and the feeble knee have become the
          general rule. "Oh," says one, "but surely there might be found some
          men to go out." And so say others as well as you, why are you not the
          man to go? You say others should be thrust into the vineyard, and why
          stand back yourself? That torpor which seizes upon us, has seized upon
          others too. Let us not be hasty in condemning the rest of the church,
          till we have first tested ourselves. Do we not owe our all to Christ?
          Are we not personally his debtors? If we felt this debt, if we felt
          the value of souls, should not each of us give more towards the spread
          of this gospel? should we not pray more agonisingly? and would there
          not be found many of us who would be ready to labour more
          indefatigably. If the minister of Christ be weak, rest assured it is
          because the church itself is not strong. The ministry is but the index
          of the church. If we often fail in our pulpits, because they are not
          filled with fervent men, we may reply to you, if the pews were
          fervent, the pulpit would catch the flame. I am not speaking of water;
          I know that water runs down hill; but I am now speaking of fire, and
          fire ascends. Let the fire begin with you, be you in earnest,
          supplicating, striving, and wrestling with God in prayer, and the fire
          shall ascend to the pulpit, and we too, shall become as earnest as
          yourselves. Let us use no mutual recriminations. The whole church is
          alike at this present moment; it is all weak. There are but few and
          noble exceptions; but few who are strong in prayer, who are mighty in
          serving their God. And hence it is that Satan still retains the
          throne, still darkness broods over the nations, and still men are not
          saved. May God strengthen us, or what shall become of the world we wot
          not.

          Again, weak hands and feeble knees very much dishonour Christ. I would
          say nothing to grieve the heart of any weak believer here present this
          morning, but still we must speak the truth. Want of faith and weakness
          in prayer dishonour Christ. Suppose you have a friend, and you say to
          him, "My friend, I have such confidence in you, that I will trust you
          with the title-deeds of my estate, and with all I have. Nay, more; I
          will trust you with my health, I will trust you with my life. Do what
          you will with me; I have such faith in your goodness and your wisdom
          that I am sure you will not be unkind, and will not err. I trust you."
          There is something honourable in faith to the object in whom it is
          reposed. Now, if you are able, with the strong hand of faith, to bring
          all you have and give it entire unto God, and say, "There, Lord, I
          surrender all to thee; do with me as thou wilt, and with mine too;
          take what thou wilt away; give me what thou pleasest, or withhold what
          thou choosest; I leave all in thy hand; I can trust thee entirely; I
          know thou wilt make no mistake; I know thou wilt not treat me harshly;
          I leave all to thee; without word, or thought, or wish, I surrender
          all." If you can do this, then Christ is glorified; but if your hand
          is weak, and you are hiding away some choice thing that you cannot
          give up to him, if you do not stand fully to the surrender, but keep
          back something from him, then that weak hand brings dishonour upon
          God. So also does the feeble knee. Some one has given you a promise,
          that if you are in need and go to him, he will give whatever you want.
          You go up to his door, you knock timidly; and when he comes to meet
          you, you rush into the street and hide yourself, for you are ashamed
          that he should see you. Driven by necessity, however, you knock again;
          at last he comes, and you stand trembling before him. "Well," says he,
          "what do you want?" "You have given me a promise, sir, that when I am
          in need you will do so-and-so for me, and I really do not believe it:
          I have no confidence in you, and I do not like to ask." There would be
          nothing honorable in that to any man. How far different was the
          example of Alexander's courtier. The king said to him, "I will give to
          thee whatever thou requesteth;" and the man asked such a gift as
          almost emptied Alexander's coffers. "Ay," says the monarch, "it was a
          great thing for him to ask, but it is only a little thing for
          Alexander to give. I like the man's confidence in me, in using my word
          to its fullest extent." Now when the believer goes to his closet and
          bows there with feeble knee, and asks God to bless him and does not
          half believe that he will, he dishonours God. But, when a man goes up
          to his chamber, saying in his heart, "There is something that I want,
          and I am going to get it;" and he falls on his knees, and cries,
          "Lord, thou knowest all things: thou knowest that such a thing is
          necessary to me; there is thy promise; do as thou hast said,' Lord; I
          know thou wilt give it me." And when he rises from his knees, and goes
          down and says to his friend, "The blessing will come; I have asked for
          it; I have prayed the prayer of faith, and God will hear me;" why,
          such a man honours God. I would remind you again of a great proof of
          all this. Look at Mr. Miller, at Ashleydown, near Bristol. Could he
          have built that house for orphans if he had a weak hand and a feeble
          knee? No. But he had a strong hand; he meant to serve his God by
          feeding and clothing orphans. On the other hand he had a strong knee.
          "Lord," he said, "I will do this enterprise -- give me the means to do
          it." And he went to God, and did not doubt that he would do it. And,
          lo! thousands have rolled into his treasury, and he has never known
          lack; and now, seven hundred children live under his care, and are fed
          and clothed to the honour of God. Let us also seek to have strong
          hands and mighty knees, and so shall we honour God. If we do not build
          an orphan house to his name, yet shall we raise our Ebenezer, and
          leave some trophy to the honour of his grace. These are some reasons
          why we should look well to hands and knees.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And, now, the last point was this: THERE ARE CERTAIN CAUSES OF
          WEAK HANDS AND FEEBLE KNEES, and in mentioning them, I shall endeavour
          to correct them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some Christians have weak hands and feeble knees because they are only
          infants. They are young Christians, they have not been converted long.
          God's family is like every other family; we do not expect the new-born
          convert to run alone at first. Perhaps, it will be months, say
          sometimes years, before he will be able to feel his feet. We thank God
          that there is a very comfortable promise for those who are babes in
          Christ, and cannot run alone: -- "He shall carry the lambs in his
          bosom." "I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms," says
          God, by the prophet Hosea. So ye, just born to God, must not despair
          because ye cannot as yet play the man with the promise; if ye cannot
          now wrestle with the angel, remember, God does not require wrestling
          from infants. He will not overdrive his lambs. He will not overdrive
          his lambs. He does not expect long marches from feeble feet. As you
          are but weak, you shall have lighter duties. As you are at present but
          tender, and young, you shall not have heavy labours to perform. But
          seek to grow in grace. Feed upon the unadulterated milk of the Word of
          God, and pray that he would bring you up from babes into young men,
          and from young men into perfect men in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          A more frequent cause, however, of weak hands and feeble knees, is
          starvation, absolute starvation. Is there such a thing known in
          England as starvation? Yes, there is of a spiritual kind. There are
          many houses which are dedicated to the worship of God, that certainly
          never were dedicated to the profit of man. There are places into which
          a Christian might enter all the year round, without ever getting any
          understanding of the doctrines of God at all. Many a minister, in
          these days, of fine language, and of polished rounded periods,
          resembles Nero, who when the city of Rome was starving, sent his
          galleys to Alexandria to bring back sand for the wrestlers, but not
          corn for hungry mouths. We have heard many a discourse that has been
          very fine indeed, as a moral essay, but it has had no food in it for
          the poor hungry mouths of God's people. One has but very little
          opinion of the present race of professing Christians when you see
          their frequent changes. I know men at this day who hear an Arminian
          with the greatest possible delight -- "Such a dear, good, earnest
          man!" And if a Calvinist preaches the next Sunday, who contradicts
          every word the other man said -- "Oh, he is such a precious creature!"
          because he happens to have a great flow of words. And then comes
          another who happens to be a hyper-Calvinist, and who says most
          extraordinary things -- "He is a precious child of God, he preaches
          admirably!" And then there comes afterwards a Pelagian, or almost an
          Arian, and it is just the same -- they take it all in, and delight in
          it. The reason is, because these people never taste the word of God at
          all. They look at it, but so long as they do not taste it and feed on
          it they know nothing of it. If they fed on the Word, they would have
          their senses exercised by reason of the use, and they would be able to
          discern between the good and the evil, the precious and the vile. Many
          of our Calvinistic preachers do not feed God's people. They believe in
          election, but they do not preach it. They think particular redemption
          true, but they lock it up in the chest of their creed, and never bring
          it out in their ministry. They hold final perseverance, but they
          persevere in keeping quiet about it. They think there is such a thing
          as effectual calling, but they do not think they are called
          effectually to preach it. The great fault we find with many is, that
          they do not speak right out what they do believe. You could not know
          if you heard them fifty times what were the doctrines of the gospel,
          or what was their system of salvation. And hence God's people get
          starved. And all the while the only remedy they have for the poor,
          weak, starving child of God, is a long whip. They are always cracking
          this whip with the loud sound of "do this! do that! and do the other!"
          If they would put the whip in the manger and feed God's people, then
          they would be able run the heavenly race. But now it is all whip and
          no corn, and no creature can subsist upon that. No child of God can
          ever grow strong in grace with mere exhortation, if it be not
          associated with good old-fashioned doctrine. I should like to hear all
          our pulpits sounding with the old-fashioned doctrine of John Owen, and
          of such men as Bunyan, and Charnock, and Goodwin, and those men of
          olden times who knew the truth and dared to preach it fully. There
          were giants in those days. In every parish church in the city of
          London, and in this borough, too, you might have found men who were no
          children in divinity, but masterly men, each of them able to declare
          the word of God with the authority of a master in Israel. Now where
          find we such? We labour and we strive, we dig, we toil, we seek to be
          something, and we end in being nothing. And so it must be as long as
          hands are weak and knees are feeble; and so also must this be as long
          as good doctrine is denied us, and truth is kept back in the ministry.
          Feed God's children well; give them comfort; give them much to feed
          upon of the sweet things of the kingdom of God; and then they will
          grow strong, then they will begin to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, again, fear is the great weakness of men's knees; doubt and
          distrust are the great relaxers of the strength of men's hands. He
          that hath faith in God is almost omnipotent; he that hath might in
          prayer (through the Holy Spirit), is quite so. He that believeth God
          with all his heart, there is none in the world that can match with
          him; and he that prayeth to God with all fervency of soul, may
          overcome the divine omnipotence itself, and move the arm that moves
          the world. Give a man faith, and he is in the midst of his enemies,
          like a lion amid a herd of dogs, he sweeps them away. With what an
          easy motion of his gigantic strength he rips them open and lays them
          dead. Nothing can stand against the man who believes. He plants his
          standard in the midst of rocks: he stands up to it and draws his
          sword, and cries, "Come one, come all: this rock shall fly from its
          firm base as soon as I; I am a match for you; I believe, and therefore
          have I spoken; I believe still, and therefore do I speak again; and I
          will not move though hell and earth come against me." But when a man
          becomes doubting and timid, where is his strength? The moment you
          doubt away goes your might. Strong feet make a man mighty, but a
          strong knee makes him mightier still. Christ's soldiers always win
          their battles on their knees. On their feet they may be conquered, but
          on their knees they are invincible. The praying legion is the
          thundering legion. Napoleon sent out his old guard in the last
          extremity of the battle of Waterloo. They had always carried victory
          with them, but they were at last defeated. But the old guard of the
          church of Christ is the legion of prayer. The men that are mighty on
          their knees, these never have been defeated. When they march on in
          steady phalanx,, they are mightier than the push of bayonet, though
          British arms and British hearts should drive the bayonet home. Nothing
          can stand against men that pray. Let the church but once fall on its
          knees, and it shall have might to make the enemy fall on ITS knees --
          not in prayer, but in terror and dismay. Other warriors cry, "Up
          guards and at them!" Our cry is, "Down, guards, on your knees, and at
          them!" There, on your knees you become mighty; you draw near to the
          great seat of God, and then you draw near to the fountain of your
          strength and of your triumph. Fear, then, must be got rid of. We must
          labour with God, that he would be pleased to give us strong faith;
          that we may not doubt the word of God, nor doubt our interest, nor
          doubt his love, nor doubt our perseverance, but may believe and become
          mighty, having no longer weak hands and feeble knees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me add one more thought only; namely this, that sloth may make a
          man weak in his hands an in his feet. Arms become strong by using
          them. The blacksmith gets a brawny hand by constantly using his
          hammer. He who climbs the mountain, or walks many a mile a day,
          becomes strong in his feet. Those who sit still and walk but a little
          while are wearied with a few miles; but those who have tramped through
          continents are not speedily to be wearied. Use makes us strong, but
          sloth enfeebles us. There are many of you who might be stronger if you
          laboured more. What a lazy corporation the church of Christ is! Taking
          it all round there must be, I think, more lazy people in the church of
          Christ than there is to be found in any other body of men. There are
          some that do valiantly and serve God, but how many of you there are
          who are quite content to occupy your seats and hear sermons without
          doing anything for God's cause. I do not hesitate to say that I
          believe there are many of you here who never won a soul to Christ in
          your lives, and scarcely ever tried to do so. You never lay poor souls
          to heart; you never go to God in heart and prayer for your poor
          perishing neighbours. Now and then, if you see a drunken man, you say
          "it is a great pity;" and if you hear of a murder, you say "it is a
          dreadful thing." But very little you care about it. You do not agonize
          and cry for the iniquity of this land. What do you do? You put a
          sixpence in the plate now and then, and that is your gift to God's
          cause; you sing a hymn or join in prayer, and that is your service to
          God. The custom with religious people is, they pay their seat-rent,
          they attend the chapel, and then they have done their duty. And even
          in the ministry itself, you hear of a clergyman speaks of doing his
          duty, when he reads his prayer and when he has done his preaching. But
          we want to have warmer hearts, and more active lives, or else, surely,
          the church must die of sloth. Oh that every one of you would think you
          had something to do for Christ in this life, and that you must do it.
          If your knees are feeble, serve God the best you can with them; if
          your hands hang down, then do the best you can with the hands hanging
          down, and pray God to strengthen them, until you become mighty, and
          then you will be able to do more. But do something every one of you.
          If England expects every one to do his duty, how much more may the
          church demand of every professor that he should be doing something for
          his Master. Do not think it is enough to get good; do good. The candle
          must soon be extinguished that is shut up without fresh air. Give your
          light plenty of air, and it will burn all the brighter; and others
          seeing your light will be able to rejoice in it. You are not to eat
          your morsel alone; if you do you will become weak, for God hath so
          ordained it; that if we keep our religion to ourselves it will become
          feeble. The man who hoards his gold grows no richer, but he who puts
          it out to usury, will grow richer himself and help to enrich other
          men. Do so with your religion; put it out to usury, and you will grow
          richer, water men's souls, and you shall be watered. The most
          practical way for religious people is to do something; visit the sick,
          help the poor, teach the ignorant, succour the distressed; and in all
          these ways you will find that God will bless you, and your hands shall
          become strong, and your knees shall not totter. Above all, cry for the
          Holy Spirit to strengthen you, for without him all is vain.<br />
