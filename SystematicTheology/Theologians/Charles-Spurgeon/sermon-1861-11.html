        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.397)</p>

        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither
          shall the flame kindle upon thee." -- Isaiah 43:2.
        </p>
        <p>
          BEFORE we explain the metaphor of the text, it may be well for us to
          remark that we are not sufficiently grateful, I fear, for the
          preservation which God affords to us from fire. To be startled at the
          dead of night with the alarming cry, and to find one's self and
          children and goods in danger of being immediately consumed, must be no
          small trial. I have felt myself extreme gratitude to God that while
          both on the right hand and on the left the flames have raged, he has
          been pleased to spare to us this temple of our solemnities, this place
          where we delight to worship. And is it not meet that we should each
          and all render to him our hearty thanks for sparing our habitations
          preserving the roof under which we rest, enabling us to go out and to
          come in in perfect safety? Or, probably, I may be addressing some this
          morning who have had escaped from the very midst of the fires. Let
          such not only bless God for preservation in the past, but let them
          celebrate his goodness in plucking them as brands out of the burning.
          Let them be extremely grateful to God that while others this day are
          dying as a black heap of ashes who but yesterday were living men, we
          are still in the land of the dying unburned and unsinged. It was at
          least the trap of many of you, during the past week, and again last
          night, to witness a conflagration of awful grandeur, in which tongues
          of flame, mountains of fire, and pillars of smoke, made a spectacle to
          be gazed at with interest while it produced terrors and apprehensions
          that could awe the wildest mob into silence. With you and me it is a
          common mercy to be preserved day by day, and night by night from the
          devouring element. Yet when the dreadful catastrophe is within view --
          when those we know personally or by repute are sufferers -- and when
          at the same time we look on with a sense of our own present security
          -- then surely we ought to give more than a common expression of
          gratitude to God for mercies that at other times we are too apt to
          paste over unheeded as but the effects of a common Providence. Never
          was a truer sentence uttered than when one said, "These mercies are
          not valued until they are lost, and these preservations are not
          esteemed until they are withdrawn." Let us thank God while we have the
          mercies, lest he be provoked by our ingratitude and take forth his rod
          and scourge us. Then, indeed, might we cry out under the smart, and
          wish and desire that we had our mercies back again. Thus much I could
          not in my conscience withhold at a time when there are judgments
          around us enough to make us tremble, and mercies enough in the little
          circles of home to make us exceedingly grateful. Let us now take the
          text in its real signification. Of course the walking through the fire
          here is put for the severest form of trouble: You have, in the
          commencement of the verse, trouble described as passing through the
          water. This represents the overwhelming influence of trial in which
          the soul is sometimes so covered that it becomes like a man sinking in
          the waves. "When thou goest through the rivers," -- those mountain
          torrents which with terrific force are often sufficient to carry a man
          away. This expresses the force of trouble, the power with which it
          sometimes lifts a man from the foothold of his stability, and carries
          him before it. "When thou passest through the rivers they shall not
          overflow thee." But going through the fire expresses not so much the
          overwhelming character and the upsetting power of trouble as the
          actual consuming and destructive power of trouble and temptation. The
          metaphor is more vivid, not to, say more terrific, than that which is
          employed in the first sentence, and yet vivid and awful though it be,
          it is certainly not too strong a figure to be used as the emblem of
          the tribulations, temptations and afflictions, through which the
          Church and people of God have been called to pass. We may apprise the
          richness of the promise in proportion to the astonishing character of
          the metaphor, and we ought to value the privilege which it confers in
          the precise ratio of the dreadful character of the danger against
          which it preserves us. "When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt
          not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall talk of three things, this morning, as the Holy Ghost may
          enable us; first of all, a terrible pathway, -- walking around the
          fire; secondly, an awful danger, -- the danger of being burned and
          utterly consumed; and thirdly, a double insurance, -- "Thou shalt not
          be burned, neither shall the fire kindle upon thee."
        </p>
        <p>I. First, then, let us speak a little upon this TERRIBLE PATHWAY.</p>
        <p>
          The sacramental host of God's elect has never had an easy road along
          which to journey. I see the fields on fire, the prairie is in a blaze,
          the very heavens are like a furnace, and the clouds seem rather to be
          made of fire than water. Across that prairie lies the pathway to
          heaven, beneath that blazing sky the whole Church of God must make its
          perpetual journey. It started at the first in fire, and its very glory
          at the last shall take place in the midst of the fiery passing away of
          all things. When first there was a Church of God on earth, in the
          person of Abel it was persecuted, Cain lifted up his cruel club to
          slay his brother; and when the children of Seth were the
          representatives of God's chosen, they were without doubt the subject
          of the jeer and gibe of the descendants of Cain. Noah, the preacher of
          righteousness endured during his one hundred and twenty years, the
          hardness of heart and carelessness of an unthinking world; he and his
          family, who were the remnant of the Church in the latter part of those
          days, were constantly exposed to the laughter and persecution of men.
          When God had destroyed the earth with water, and the whole race of man
          was contained within the ark, you would think that then, certainly,
          the Church within the ark would be secure from molestation. But no, we
          find him ready to detect the failings of his parents, and no doubt a
          ringleader of everything that was vile and vicious, just as we have
          reason to hope that some of his brethren adhered to the most true God.
          From that day forward, whether you read through the life of Abraham,
          or Isaac, or Jacob, it still standeth true, "He that is born after the
          flesh persecuteth him that is born after the Spirit." Whether we refer
          you to the history of Israel by the side of the brick-kilns of Egypt,
          or to the host of God constantly beset by the marauders of the
          Amalekites, you find it still to be true that through much tribulation
          the people of God must wade their way to Canaan. And if you look
          further on in history, between David and Saul, between Hezekiah and
          Sennacherib, between the faithful followers of God after the captivity
          who would rebuild the temple, and Sanballat the Horonite; between the
          Maccabees and Antiochus Epiphanes, there must always be preserved a
          deadly feud, to let it be seen that the world must hate God's people,
          and must harass them and seek to hunt them out, while they, on the
          other hand, must steadily pursue their onward march through the midst
          of billows of fire till they come at last to their eternal rest. Find
          me the abode of the Church of God and I can smell the furnace not far
          off. Show me the follower of the God of Abraham and I shall soon find
          the host of enemies ready for the attack. Up till the days of the
          Saviour the kingdom of heaven suffered violence, not only from its
          friends who would take it, but from those enemies who world assault
          it. From the blood of Abel down to the blood of Zecharias the son of
          Barachias, the pathway of the Church hath been a blood-besprinkled
          time. Since that day, what tongue can tell the sufferings of the
          people of God? Since Christ became martyr as well as Redeemer, has
          there been a season in which God's people have not somewhere or other
          been made to feel that they are not of the world, and that the world
          does not love them because they are not of the world? In apostolic
          times, Stephen expires beneath a shower of stones, James is killed
          with a sword, certain others of the saints are vexed; believers are
          scattered abroad. The Roman lion takes up the fight, Herod delights in
          the gore of the Christians, and smears the confessors of that holy
          faith with pitch and sets them in his gardens that they might be
          literally, as they were spiritually, the lights of the world. Let the
          catacombs of Rome witness to their sorrowful lives and let the Capitol
          witness to their terrible deaths. Let the old dungeons, some of which
          still remain, testify to the places where they wore out their dreary
          lives, and let the blood-stained Campus Martius still show where they
          cheerfully surrendered those lives for Christ. Oh! if the lands could
          speak, if the Earth could vomit forth her blood what stories could
          still be told of the way they were slain. Some of them were tortured,
          others sawn asunder, some stoned, and others burnt to death; though of
          them the world was not worthy. All the Roman Emperors, with but few
          exceptions, were persecutors; and the Christian emperors were as bad
          as the Pagan, for the Christian emperors were not Christians, nor were
          they members, as I believe, of a Christian Church. The Christian
          Church, and especially that Church of which we are still members,
          which has never defiled its garments, but which, never having had any
          alliance with the Church of Rome, has never needed to be reformed, --
          that Church under its different names, Paulitians, Novations,
          Albigenses, Lollards, Wyckliffites, Anabaptists, Baptists, has always
          suffered. It matters not what state, what Church, may have been
          dominant, whether it has been Christian or anti-Christian, the pure
          Church of Christ has always been the victim of persecution, and though
          she has persecuted never, but has always maintained inviolate,
          disunion from the state, and an utter hatred of all laws which would
          bind the conscience of man, yet has she been especially destitute,
          afflicted, tormented, and if she hath to-day a little breathing time,
          perhaps it is rather owing to the timidity which has made us keep back
          our sentiments, than to any charity towards ourselves. Find the Church
          of Christ wherever you will, and you shall find her scorned and
          despised of man. Find her in Scotland, and her Covenanters have to
          hide themselves in the midst of the mountain, and read the Word of God
          by the lightning flash, to escape from the dragoons of Claverhouse.
          Find her in England and where was she? Not in the cathedrals of her
          cities, but in the dungeons of her rural towns like Bedford with John
          Bunyan; not among the great and noble who were the persecutors, but
          among the poor and conscientious who were the persecuted. "If you want
          to find the drunkards and sinners of the worst dye," said one of our
          preachers at or before Cromwell's time, "you can find them in Church
          and state, but if you wish to find the men who are holy and who serve
          God, you must look into the felon's dungeons for them, for that is
          where they have been cast by the powers that be." Everywhere from the
          first day until now, it is not respectable to be a follower of Christ.
          If we follow Christ fully and faithfully before God, it is not
          equitable and praiseworthy before men. To take up his cross and to
          perform the ceremonies which he ordains, man hates. To adhere to
          truths which never were and never can be palatable to the carnal mind
          of man, is, and ever has been to excite animosity. The pathway of the
          Church, then, has been one of fire and flame. As it has been so with
          the Church, we may suspect there is some reason for it, and that
          reason has to be found in the great fact that the Church is in an
          enemy's country. She is not among her friends, she is a pilgrim and a
          stranger upon the earth. She is a bird that has lost her place, and
          all the birds round about her are against her, because she is a
          speckled one and belongs not to the common flock. If we were of the
          world, the world would love its own, but "because," said Christ, "ye
          are not of the world but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore
          the world hateth you." "We know," said he, "it hated me before it
          hated you." True Christians are aliens, foreigners, men that speak
          another speech, men who are actuated by different motives, men who
          live for different ends, who are governed by different maxima from the
          rest of the men of this world, therefore it is that their pathway must
          be one of trial and opposition. All things the Christian teaches are
          so dead against the pleasures of the worldling and his gain, that it
          is no wonder he opposes us. Men hate the gospel because the gospel
          does not like them. That Church is never true to her Christ, nor true
          to herself which does not draw upon herself the hatred of ungodly men,
          by a faithful testimony against their sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          It hath fared well with the Church when she hath been persecuted, and
          her pathway hath been through fire. Her feet are shod with iron and
          brass. She ought not to tread on paths strewed with flowers; it is her
          proper place to suffer. Christ redeemed the world with agonies, and
          the Church must teach the world by the example of her anguish. First
          of all, the blood of Christ was shed meritoriously, and afterwards the
          blood of his Church is shed testimonially, to will the world by
          suffering. When you hear of the massacre of Christians in Madagascar,
          weep for their death, but do not be utterly cast down. This is a good
          work. This is the way the Church grows. There is no loss in the army
          of Christ when the best preachers fall and the mightiest evangelists
          are put to death. They are not lost, the blood is well shed and
          gloriously well spent. It is buying victory. It is procuring crowns
          for Jesus Christ. It is after all accomplishing higher results by
          dying than could have been effected by doing. It is under the heaviest
          fire of artillery that the loyal, the brave, and the true do the most
          daring feats of prowess. When one hero falls, from his ashes other
          heroes arise. The post of danger is the post of honor, therefore fresh
          aspirants will be found ready to lead the brigade. Moreover, my
          friends, if the path of fire be always a path of terror, it is often a
          path of progress. Melancholy as it is to mark the ruins of a
          conflagration, while the dying embers smoulder, how often you must
          have observed more majestic edifices raised to replace the structures
          that have been consumed! Thus fearful disasters are made to stimulate
          industry and nourish enterprise.
        </p>
        <p>
          No doubt the sufferings of the Church, and the fact that she has to
          pass through the fire, must be ascribed to the great truth that thus
          her God is glorified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, you and I do not glorify God much; for we have very little
          to suffer. The blood red crown of martyrdom is such an object of
          ambition, or it should be, to the believer that he might almost regret
          that it is not in his power to coin it. We! what do we suffer?
          Somebody slanders our character. What is that? Somebody abuses us in
          the newspaper, what is that? We are accused of one crime and another.
          What can it signify to a man who knows his conscience is right in the
          sight of God? What does he care if all the babbling tongues of all the
          liars in earth and hell should be let loose against him; he can bear
          all that and endure it quietly. It is nothing. When I read the stories
          of the Book of Martyrs, and note how our great reformers fought for
          Christ, and manfully won the victory, I blush for ourselves. Why,
          brethren, we live in such silken times that glory is scarce possible
          to us. We have much to do, but we have nothing to suffer. We cannot
          prove our love to Christ as they did. They indeed were a highly
          honored people who were permitted to glorify Christ even in the very
          fires. Look at it in this light, and the light afflictions you have to
          endure, will seem to be as nothing at all, when you think of the
          weight of glory which they shall bring to your Lord and to yourself.
          But as history confirms the statement that the Church of Christ must
          walk through the fire, so does the history of each individual
          Christian teach him that he must walk through the fire too.
        </p>
        <p>"The path of sorrow and that path alone,</p>
        <p>Leads to the land where sorrow is unknown."</p>
        <p>
          Through much tribulation we must inherit the kingdom. Think it no
          strange thing when the fiery trial shall happen to you. If you have
          the common afflictions of the world do not wonder. You must have them.
          The same thing happeneth both to the evil and to the good. You lose in
          business, you have reverses and disappointments, do not stagger at
          these in the way to heaven. You must have these, they are necessary to
          your spiritual health. Worse than that, you have strange temptations,
          you are placed in a position where you are constantly exposed to sin.
          It must be so. This too, is the pathway of God's people, you must have
          these fiery temptations, that you, being tried in the fire, may come
          forth as "gold seven times purified." You have mental anxieties.
          Neither let these seem a wonder to you. They fall to the lot of all
          the saints of the Most High. Moreover, you will have to endure the
          attacks of Satan, you must go through the valley of the shadow of
          death, and fight with Apollyon as Christian did, you are not to be
          exempted from the hardness of Christian warfare. If you will mount the
          hill, you must climb; if you are to win the crown, you must win it by
          sheer might. Think not this a strange thing. And if in doing good you
          meet with difficulties, let not that stagger you. It is but right and
          natural. I tell you again, if there be any pathway in which there be
          not fire, tremble, but if your lot be hard, thank God for it. If your
          sufferings be great, bless the Lord for them, and if the difficulties
          in your pathway be many, surmount them by faith, but let them not cast
          you down. Be of good courage, and wait on the Lord, setting this
          constantly in your minds that he has not promised to keep you from
          trouble, but to preserve you in it. It is not written, "I will save
          thee from the fire," but "I will save thee in the fire," not "I will
          quench the coals," but "they shall not burn thee," not "I will put out
          the furnace," but "the flames shall not kindle upon thee." Write it
          down and expect it to come true, that in this world thou shalt have
          tribulation. Only follow thy glorious leader, be it through flood or
          flame.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We will now turn to our second point -- there is AN AWFUL DANGER.
        </p>
        <p>
          The promise of the text is based on a prophecy that follows it. As I
          glance my eye down the chapter, I see that it tells us how God taught
          his people by terrible things in the past; and how he hath terrible
          lessons to teach them in the future. If the judgment of Egypt, and of
          Ethiopia, and Seba, are behind us, we have startling destinies that
          rise up to view before us. There is a people to be gathered in, and we
          are to be the agents in gathering them. Fear not, saith the Lord,
          though thou walkest through the fire in fulfilling my mission. God
          speaks to the north, "Give up;" and to the south, "Keep not back.
          Bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth."
          But the manner of Egypt is repeated again. The monarch said, "I will
          not let them go." Jealousy is stirred. The fire burns: the coals
          thereof have a vehement flame. And they that come forth from the
          bondage of this world must walk through the fire, even as those that
          came forth from Egypt had to pass through water. The fire of prophecy
          is no poetic fiction, it is real fire. It will burn. If it doth not
          burn the believer, it is not for want of energy, it is because some
          supernatural restraint is laid on it, or some supernatural protection
          vouchsafed to the saint. My brethren, the Church has had very painful
          experience that persecution is a fire which does burn. How many
          ministers of Christ, when the day of tribulation came, forsook their
          flocks and fled. When King Edward the Sixth was on the throne, there
          were many who professed to be Protestants and preached justification
          by faith. When Mary returned the vicar of Bray was but a specimen of a
          great class, his principles being to keep his living. When again
          Elizabeth was upon the throne, there were plenty who found it to be
          profitable to profess the reformed faith. But when acts of conformity
          were passed afterwards by which those who had hitherto used a
          Christian freedom in the Church of England, were driven out, there
          were some who said they did not love prelacy but hated it, while
          others who had heretofore professed the old Puritanical doctrines,
          finding that their livings were to be lost thereby, held fast to this
          world, and let the things of the next world shift for themselves. Too
          many have forsaken the Church as Demas forsook Paul. Their piety would
          not stand the fire, they could walk with Christ in silvery slippers,
          but they could not go barefoot; they had no objection whatever to
          accompany him to his throne, but they had some slight difficulties
          about going with him to his cross; they would not mind bearing the
          weight of his glory, but the weight of the cross of tribulation was
          much too great for their constitutions. Persecution is a fire which
          does burn.

          Again: I see iniquity raging on every side. Its flames are fanned by
          every wind of fashion. And fresh victims are being constantly drawn
          in. It spreads to every class. Not the palace nor the hovel are safe.
          Not the lofty piles that are raised for merchandise, nor the graceful
          edifice that is constructed for worship. Iniquity, whose contagion is
          fearful as fire, spreads and preys upon all things that are homely and
          comely, things useful and things sacred are not exempt. We must walk
          through the fire. We who are God's witnesses must stand in its very
          midst, to pour the streams of living water upon the burning fuel, and
          if not able to quench it, at least we must strive to prevent its
          spread. There are young men whose youthful lusts, inflammable as they
          are, have not yet ignited. They are in imminent danger. "Fire! fire!"
          we may well cry. We may give the alarm this morning to you, young man
          who are in the midst of ribald companions. I may cry "fire!" to you
          who are compelled to live in a house where you are perpetual tempted
          to evil, I may cry, "fire!" to you who are marked each day, and have
          to bear the sneer of the ungodly -- "fire!" to you who are losing your
          property and suffering in the flesh, for many have perished thereby.
          Oh! may God grant you never may! I see today before my mind's eye the
          blackened skeletons of hundreds of fair professions. Multitudes --
          multitudes have perished in the valley of temptation who once, to all
          human judgment, had bid fair for heaven and made a show in the flesh!
          How many, too, have fallen under the attacks of Satan! This is a fire
          that does burn. Many a man has said, "I will be a pilgrim;" but he has
          met Apollyon on the road and he has turned back. Many a man has put on
          the harness, but he has given up the battle soon, -- put his hand to
          the plough and looked back. There are more pillars of salt than one.
          If Lot's wife were a solitary specimen, it were well, but there have
          been tens of thousands who, like her, have looked back to the plains
          of Sodom, and like her, as they are in their spirit, have stood for
          ever what they were, -- lost souls. We ought not to look upon our
          dangers with contempt. They are dangers, they are trials, we ought to
          look upon our temptations as fires. Oh, they are fires! If you think
          they are not fires you are mistaken. If you enter then, in your own
          strength, saying "Oh I could bear them," you will find that they are
          real fires, which, with forked tongues, shall lick up your blood,
          consume it in an instant, if you have not some better guard than your
          own creature power.

          III. I will not tarry longer here, because I want to get to the pith
          and marrow of the promise. "Though thou walkest through the fire thou
          shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee." Here
          is A DOUBLE INSURANCE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Alexander, an eminent and most admirable American commentator says
          there appears to be some mistake in the translation here, because he
          thinks the two sentences are an anti-climax. "Thou shalt not be
          burned;" and then follows, "neither shall the flame kindle upon thee."
          It strikes me, however, that in the second clause we have the higher
          gradation of a climax. "Thou shalt not be burned," to the destruction
          of thy life, nor even scorched to give thee the most superficial
          injury, for "the flames shall not kindle upon thee." Just as when the
          three holy children came out of the fiery furnace; it is said, "upon
          their bodies the fire had no power, nor was a hair of their head
          singed; neither were their coats changed, nor had the smell of fire
          passed on them. "So the text seems to me to teach that the Christian
          Church under all its trials has not been consumed, but more than that
          -- it has not lost anything by its trials. The Lord's Church has never
          been destroyed yet by her persecutors and her trials. They have
          thought they crushed her, but she lives still. They had imagined that
          they had taken away her life, but she sprang up more vigorous than
          before. I suppose there is not a nation out of which Christ's Church
          has ever been utterly driven. Even Spain, which seemed at last to have
          accomplished it by the most persevering barbarities, finds still a few
          believers to be a thorn in the side of her bigotry; and as for our own
          denomination, in the very country, where by the most frightful
          massacres, it was believed that the sect of Anabaptists had been
          utterly extinguished, our good and esteemed brother Mr. Oncken has
          been the means of reviving it, so that throughout all Germany, and in
          parts of Denmark, and Prussia, and Poland, and even Russia itself, we
          have sprung up into a new, vigorous, and even wonderful existence. And
          in Sweden where, under Lutheran government, the most persecuting
          edicts had been passed against us, we have been astonished to find
          within ten years three hundred churches suddenly spring up, for the
          truth has in it a living seed which is not to be destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I have said that the Church not only does not lose her existence,
          but she does not lose anything at all. The Church has never lost her
          numbers. Persecutions have winnowed her and driven away the chaff; but
          not one grain of wheat has been taken away from the heap. Nay, not
          even in visible fellowship has the Church been decreased by
          persecution. She is like Israel in Egypt; the more they were afflicted
          the more they multiplied. Was a bishop put to death to-day? Ten young
          men came the next morning before the Roman proctor and offered
          themselves to die, having that very night been baptised for the dead
          bishop, having made their confession of faith that they might occupy
          his position. "I fill up the vacancy in the Church, and then die as he
          did." Was a woman strangled or tortured publicly? Twenty women
          appeared the next day and craved to suffer as she suffered, that they
          might honor Christ. Did the Church of Rome in more modern times burn
          one of our glorious reformers -- John Huss -- yet did not Martin
          Luther come forward as if the ashes of Huss had begotten Luther? When
          Wycliffe had passed away, did not the very feet of Wycliffe being
          persecuted help to spread his doctrines, and were there not found
          hundreds of young men who in every market-town in England read the
          Lollard's Scriptures and proclaimed the Lollard's faith? And so depend
          upon it, it shall ever be. Give a dog a bad name and you hang him,
          give a Christian a bad name and you honor him. Do but give to any
          Christian some ill name and before long a Christian denomination will
          take that name to itself, and it will become a title of honor. When
          George Fox was called "Quaker" it was a strange name, one to laugh at,
          but those men of God who followed him, called themselves Quakers too
          and so it lost its reproach. They called the followers of Whitfield
          and Wesley "Methodists," they took the title of Methodists and it
          became a respectful designation. When many of our Baptist forefathers,
          persecuted in England, went over to America to find shelter, they
          imagined that among the Puritans they would have a perfect rest, but
          Puritan liberty of conscience meant, "The right and liberty to think
          as they did, but no toleration to those who differed." The Puritans of
          New England as soon as ever a Baptist made his appearance amongst
          them, persecuted him with as little compunction as the Episcopalians
          had the Puritans. No sooner was there a Baptist, than he was hunted up
          and brought before his own Christian brethren. Mark you, he was
          brought up for fine, for imprisonment, confiscation and banishment
          before the very men who had themselves suffered persecution. And what
          was the effect of this? The effect has been that in America where we
          were persecuted, we are the largest body of Christians. Where the fire
          burnt the most furiously, there the good old Calvinistic doctrine was
          taught, and the Baptist became the more decidedly a Baptist than
          anywhere else, with the most purity and the least dross. Nor have we
          ever lost the firmness of our grip upon the fundamental doctrine, for
          which our forefathers stained the baptismal pool with blood, by all
          the trials and persecutions that have been laid upon us, and never
          shall we.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon the entire Church, at the last, there shall not be even the smell
          of fire. I see her come out of the furnace. I see her advance up the
          hill towards her final glory with her Lord and Master, and the angels
          look at her garments; they are not tattered. Nay, the fangs of her
          enemies have not been able to make a single rent therein. They draw
          near to her, they look upon her flowing ringlets, and they are not
          crisp with heat: they look upon her very feet, and though she has
          trodden the coals they are not blistered, and her eyes have not been
          dried up by the furiousness of the seven times heated flame. She has
          been made more beautiful, more fair, more glorious, by the fires, but
          hurt she has not been, nor can she be. Turn, then, to the individual
          Christian, and remember, that the promise stands alike firm and fast
          with each believer. Christian, if you be truly a child of God, your
          trials cannot destroy you, and what is better still, you can lose
          nothing by them. You may seem to lose for to-day, but when the account
          comes to be settled, you shall not be found to be a farthing the loser
          by all the temptations of the world, of all the attacks of Satan which
          you have endured. Nay, more, you shall be wondrously the gainer. Your
          trials having worked patience and experience, shall make you rich.
          Your temptations have taught you your weakness, and shown you where
          your strength lieth, shall make you strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          From your first trouble, till the last enemy shall be destroyed, you
          shall not lose a fraction, jot, or tittle, by anything or every thing
          which God in his providence, or the world in its fury, of Satan in his
          craftiness, shall ever be able to lay upon you. Upon you, not the
          smell of fire shall have passed. You shall not be burned, neither
          shall your hosen, nor your hats, but like the men that you read of in
          Daniel, you shall be wholly preserved intact from the flame.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall close now, having spoken the general truth by making some
          particular applications of this precious promise. There is a brother
          here who during the last three or four months has had wave upon wave
          of affliction: everything goes against him. He is an upright, honest,
          indefatigable merchant, yet, let him do what he will, his substance
          wastes away like snow before the sun. It appears that for every ship
          of his the wind blows the wrong way, and where others will by the
          venture he loses all.
        </p>
        <p>"He sees each day new straights attend,</p>
        <p>And wonders when the scene shall end."</p>
        <p>
          When I spoke of walking through the fire just now, he said, "Ah! that
          is what I have been doing, I have been walking through it these
          months, to God and my own soul alone is it known how hot the furnace
          is." Brother, will you take home my text this morning. Perhaps God
          sent you here not for the sermon, but for the text. Perhaps you
          strolled here to-day, not being a regular attendant, on purpose that
          this text might comfort you. "When thou goest through the fire, thou
          shalt not be burned." When your troubles are all over, you shall still
          be left, and what is more, "neither the flame shall kindle upon you."
          When the winding up time comes, you shall not be any the loser. While
          you think you have lost substance, you shall find when you read
          Scripture, that you only lose shadows. Your substance was always safe,
          being laid up in the keeping of Christ in Heaven. You shall discover
          in the issue, that these trials of yours were the best things that
          could happen to you. The day shall come when you will say with David,
          "I will sing of judgment and mercy." "Before I was afflicted I went
          astray, but now I have kept thy word." Or perhaps there is some young
          woman here, -- and the case I am about to paint is a very common one
          -- alas, too common in this city. You love the Saviour my sister, but
          you are very poor, and you have to earn your living by that sorriest
          of all means. When the sun rises in the morning he sees you with that
          needle in your hand,
        </p>
        <p>"Sewing at once with a double thread</p>
        <p>A shroud as well as a shirt."</p>
        <p>
          and all day long you have scarcely time to rest for meals, and at
          eventime, when the fingers are worn and the eyes are heavy, you shall
          have need to refrain from sleep because the pittance is so small that
          you can scarcely live upon it. We know hundreds of that class who
          always constrain our pity, because they work go hard for so little
          wage. Peradventure your mother is dead, and your father does not care
          about you. He is a drunken sot, and you would be sorry to meet him
          perhaps in the street. You have no helper, no friends. You do not care
          to tell anybody, you would not like to take anything if charity should
          offer it to you; you feel it the hardest thing all is to be tempted as
          you are. There seems to you to be by the path open the road to plenty,
          and in some degree to delight. But you have said, "No, no," and you
          have loathed the temptation, and you have stood -- and I have known
          how year after year some of you have fought with temptation, and
          struggled on, when sometimes you were well nigh starved; but you would
          not do this great wickedness against God.
        </p>
        <p>
          My sister, I pray you take the encouragement of this text to
          strengthen you for the future battles. You have been going through the
          fires. But you are not consumed yet, and I bless God, upon your
          garments the smell of fire has not passed. Hold on my sister, hold on,
          through all the sorrow thou hast, and all the bitterness which is
          heavy enough to crush thy spirit; hold on, for thy Master sees thee.
          He will encourage and strengthen thee, and bring thee more than
          conqueror through it all in the end. I address, too, this morning,
          some youthful minds. Young men who love Christ, and as soon as they
          get home after attending the house of prayer, the taunting enquiry
          made by their fellow-workmen is -- "You have been to some
          meeting-house, I dare say." How cruel sometimes worldly young men are
          to Christian young men! Cruel, for when there are a dozen worldlings
          and only one Christian they consider it to be honorable for the dozen
          to set upon one. Twelve big tall fellows will sometimes think it a
          fine game to pass from hand to hand some little lad of fifteen, and
          make sport and mockery of him. There is honor, it is said, among
          thieves, but there seems to be no honor at all among worldlings when
          they get a young Christian in this way. Well, young man, you have
          borne with it; you have said, "I will hold my tongue and won't say a
          word," "though your heart was hot within you, and while you were
          musing the fire burned." Remember what I have often said to you, the
          anvil does not get broken even if you keep on striking it, but it
          breaks all the hammers. Do you do the same. Only hold on, and these
          fires shall not consume you. If the fires should burn up your piety,
          it would only prove that your piety was not worth having. If you
          cannot stand a few jokes and jeers, why, you are not builded together
          in that habitation of God which he hath made fire-proof. Bear up and
          in the end you will find that this hard lot of yours, this severe
          discipline, did you a deal of good, and made you a better man than you
          ever would have been if you had been dandled on the lap of piety, and
          kept from the battle. In after years your high and eminent post of
          usefulness may be, perhaps, owing to the severe and harsh discipline
          to which you were put in your younger days. "It is good for a man that
          he bear the yoke in his youth. "Or, mayhap, I am speaking to some one
          who has met with opposition from his own ungodly relations. Remember
          how Jesus said, "I am come to send fire on the earth, and what will I,
          if it be already kindled? From henceforth there shall be five in one
          house divided, two against three and three against two." Perhaps your
          father has threatened you, or what is more bitter still, your husband
          has threatened to discard you. Now indeed you are walking through the
          fires. He rails at your godliness, makes a mock of everything you
          love, and does his best by cruelty to break your heart. My dear sister
          in Christ, you shall not be burned by the fire. If grace be in your
          heart the devil can't drive it out, much less your husband. If the
          Lord has called you by his grace, all the men on earth, and all the
          fiends in hell can reverse the calling, and you shall find in the end
          that you have not suffered any loss; the flame has not kindled upon
          you. You shall go through the fire and bless God for it. From a dying
          bed, or at least through the gates of Paradise you shall look back
          upon the dark path of the way and say it was well, it was well for me
          that I had to carry that cross, and that now I am permitted to wear
          this crown. Who is on the Lord's side this morning of this
          congregation? While Jehovah speaks on high in the thunder, let us
          speak on earth in tones of earnestness. Who is on the Lord's side
          among you? You that are not, be warned. "Tophet is ordained of old. He
          hath made it deep and large. The pile thereof is fire and much wood.
          The breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it."
          You that are on his side, set up your banners to-day. He saith, "Fear
          not, I am with thee; when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt
          not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee." May the Lord
          bless the words we have spoken. Though hastily suggested to our minds,
          and weakly delivered to you, the Lord bless them for Christ's sake.<br />
