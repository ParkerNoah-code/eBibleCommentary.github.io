        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1001)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, July 23rd, 1871, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>"Yea, he is altogether lovely." -- Song of Solomon 5:16.</p>
        <p>
          WHEN THE OLD PURITAN MINISTER had delivered his discourse, and dwelt
          upon firstly, and secondly, and thirdly, and perhaps upon
          twenty-fifthly, before he sat down he usually gave a comprehensive
          summary of all that he had spoken. Every one who carefully noted the
          summary would carry away the essence of the sermon. The summary was
          always looked upon by the Puritan hearer as one of the most valuable
          helps to memory, and consequently a most important part of the
          discourse. In these five words the spouse here gives you her summary.
          She had delivered a tenfold discourse concerning her Lord; she had
          described in detail all his various beauties, and when she had
          surveyed him from head to foot, she gathered up all her commendations
          in this sentence: "Yea, he is altogether lovely." Remember these
          words, and know their meaning, and you possess the quintessence of the
          spouse's portion of the Song of Songs. Now, as in this allegorical
          song, the bride sums up her witness in these words, so may I say that
          all the patriarchs, all the prophets, all the apostles, all the
          confessors, yea, and the entire body of the church have left us no
          other testimony. They all spoke of Christ, and they all commended him.
          Whatever the type, or symbol, or obscure oracle, or open word in which
          they bore witness, that witness all amounted to this: "Yea, He is
          altogether lovely." Yes, and I will add, that since the canon of
          inspiration has closed, the testimony of all saints, on earth and in
          heaven, has continued to confirm the declaration made of old. The
          verdict of each particular saint and of the whole elect host as a
          body, still is this, "Yea, he is altogether lovely." From the sighs
          and the songs which mingle on the dying beds of saints, I hear this
          note supreme above all others, "He is altogether lovely;" and from the
          songs unmingled with groans, which perpetually peal forth from
          immortal tongues before the presence of the Most High, I hear this one
          master note. "Yea, he is altogether lovely." If the whole church
          desired to say with the apostle, "Now of the things which we have
          spoken this is the sum," she need not wait for a brief and
          comprehensive summary, for it lies before her in this golden sentence,
          "Yea, he is altogether lovely."
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at my text in this light I felt much humbling of spirit, and I
          hesitated to preach upon it, for I saith in my heart, "It is high, I
          cannot attain unto it." These deep texts show us the shortness of our
          plumb-line; these ocean verses are so exceeding broad that our skiffs
          are apt to be driven far out of sight of land where our timid spirits
          tremble to spread the sail. Then I comforted myself by the thought
          that though I could not comprehend this text in a measure, nor weigh
          its mountains in scales, or its hills in a balance, yet it was all
          mine own, by the gift of divine grace, and therefore I need not fear
          to enter upon the meditation of it. If I cannot grasp the ocean in my
          span, yet may I bathe therein with sweet content; if I cannot describe
          the king in his beauty, yet may I gaze upon him, since the old proverb
          saith, "A beggar may look at a prince." Though I pretend not so to
          preach from such a heavenly word as that before us, as to spread
          before you all its marrow and fatness, yet may I gather up a few
          crumbs which fall from its table. Poor men are glad of crumbs, and
          crumbs from such a feast are better than loaves from the tables of the
          world. Better to have a glimpse of Jesus, than to see all the glory of
          the earth all the days of our life. If we fail on this subject we may
          do better than if we succeeded upon another; so we will pluck up
          courage, seek divine help, and draw near to this wondrous text, with
          our shoes from off our feet like Moses when he saw the bush aglow with
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This verse has been translated in another way: "He is all desires;"
          and so indeed Jesus is. He was the desire of the ancients, he is the
          desire of all nations still. To his own people he is their all in all;
          they are complete in him; they are filled out of his fullness.
        </p>
        <p>"All our capacious powers can wish,</p>
        <p>In him doth richly meet."</p>
        <p>
          He is the delight of his servants, and fills their expectations to the
          full. But we will not dispute about translations, for, after all, with
          such a text, so full of unutterable spiritual sweetness, every man
          must be his own translator, and into his own soul must the power of
          the message come, by the enforcement of the Holy Ghost. Such a test as
          this is very like the manna which fell in the wilderness, of which the
          rabbis say it tasted after each man's liking. If the flavour in a
          man's mouth was very sweetness, the angel's food which fell around the
          camp was luscious as any dainty he had conceived; whatever he might
          be, the manna was to him as he was. So shall this text be. To you with
          low ideas of Christ the words shall but glide over your ears, and be
          meaningless; but if your spirit be ravished with the precious love of
          Jesus there shall be songs of angels, and more than that, the voice of
          God's own Spirit to your soul in this short sentence, "Yea, he is
          altogether lovely."
        </p>
        <p>
          I am an engraver this morning, and I seek somewhat whereon I may
          engrave this heavenly line. Shall I take unto me ivory or silver?
          Shall I borrow crystal or gold? These are too common to bear this
          unique inscription: I put them all aside. Shall I spell my text in
          gems, with an emerald, a sapphire, a ruby, a diamond, or a pearl for
          each single letter? Nay, these are poor perishable things: we put them
          all away. I want an immortal spirit to be the tablet for my writing;
          nay, I must lay aside my graving tool, and ask the Spirit of God to
          take it: I want a heart prepared of the Holy Ghost, upon whose fleshy
          tablets there shall be written this morning no other sentence than
          this, and this shall suffice for a right royal motto to adorn it well:
          "Yea, he is altogether lovely." Spirit of God, find out the prepared
          heart, and with thy sacred hand write in eternal characters the love
          of Christ, and all his inimitable perfections.
        </p>
        <p>
          In handling our text this morning we shall note three points of
          character, and then we shall show three uses to which we may
          profitably turn it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. We shall consider THREE POINTS OF CHARACTER which are very
          noticeable in these words, and the first which suggests itself is
          this: the words are evidently uttered by one who is under the
          influence of overwhelming emotion. The words are rather a veil to the
          heart than a glass through which we see its emotions. The sentence
          labors to express the inexpressible; it pants to utter the
          unutterable. The person writing these words evidently feels a great
          deal more than any language can possibly convey to us. The spouse
          begins somewhat calmly in her description: "My beloved is white and
          ruddy." She proceeds with due order, commencing at the head, and
          proceeding with the divers parts of the person of the Beloved but she
          warms, she glows, she flames, and at last the heat which had for
          awhile been repressed is like fire within her bones, and she bursts
          forth in flaming words. Here is the live coal from off the altar of
          her heart: "Yea, he is altogether lovely." It is the utterance of a
          soul that is altogether overcome with admiration, and therefore feels
          that in attempting to describe the Well-beloved, it has undertaken a
          task beyond its power. Lost in adoring wonder, the gracious mind
          desists from description, and cries with rapture, "Yea, he is
          altogether lovely." It has often been thus with true saints; they have
          felt the love of Jesus to be overpowering and inebriating. Believers
          are not always cool and calm in their thoughts towards their Lord:
          there are seasons with them when they pass into a state of rapture,
          their hearts burn within them, they are in ecstacy, they mount up with
          wings as eagles, their souls become like the chariots of Amminadib,
          they feel what they could not tell, they experience what they could
          not express though the tongues of men and of angels were perfectly at
          their command. Favored believers are altogether enraptured with the
          sight they have of their all-beauteous Lord. It is to be feared that
          such raptures are not frequent with all Christians, though I should
          gravely question his saintship, who has never experienced any degree
          of holy rapture: but there are some saints to whom a state of
          overwhelming adoration of their Lord has been by no means an unusual
          thing. Communion with Jesus has not only entranced them now and then,
          but it has perfumed all their life with holiness; and if it has not
          caused their faces literally to shine like the face of Moses, it has
          made the spiritual glory to flash from their countenances, and
          elevated them among their fellow Christians to be leaders of the host
          of God, whereat others have admired and wondered. Peradventure, I
          speak to children of God who know very little of what I mean by the
          overwhelming emotions created by a sight of our Lord; they have not so
          seen the Lord as to have felt their souls melting within them while
          the Beloved spake with them; to such I shall speak with sorrowful
          sympathy, being, alas! too much like unto them, but my prayer shall go
          up all the while, "Lord, reveal thyself to us, that we also may be
          compelled to say, Yea, he is altogether lovely.' Show us thy hands and
          thy side till we exclaim with Thomas, My Lord and my God.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          Shall I tell you why it is, my brethren, that many of you but seldom
          enjoy the exceeding bliss of Jesus' presence? The cause may lie partly
          in what is, alas! too common among Christians, a great degree of
          ignorance of the person of the Lord Jesus. Every soul that sees Jesus
          by faith is saved thereby. If I look to Christ with a bleared eye,
          that is ever so weak and clouded with tears, and if I only catch a
          glimpse of him through clouds and mists, yet the sight saves me. But
          who will remain content with such a poor gleam of his glory as that?
          Who wishes to see only "through a glass, darkly"? No, let my eyes be
          cleansed till they become as doves by the rivers of waters, and I can
          see my Lord as he is seen by his bosom friends, and can sing of those
          beauties which are the light and crown of heaven itself. If you do but
          touch the hem of Jesus' garment, you shall be made whole; but will
          this always satisfy you? Will you not desire to get beyond the hem and
          beyond the garment, to himself, and to his heart, and there for ever
          take up your abode? Who desires to be for ever a babe in grace, with a
          half-awakened dreamy twilight consciousness by the Redeemer? Brethren,
          be diligent in the school of the cross, therein is enduring wisdom.
          Study your Savior much. The science of Christ crucified is the most
          excellent of sciences; and to know him and the power of his
          resurrection, is to know that which is best worth knowing. Ignorance
          of Jesus deprives many saints of those divine raptures which carry
          others out of themselves, therefore let us be among those children of
          Zion who are taught of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next to this you shall find the want of meditation to be a very
          serious robber of the wealth of renewed hearts. To believe a thing is,
          as it were, to see the cool crystal sparkling in the cup; but to
          meditate upon it is to drink thereof. Reading gathers the clusters,
          contemplation squeezes forth their generous juice. Meditation is of
          all things the most soul-fattening when combined with prayer. The
          spouse had meditated much in this chapter, for otherwise she had not
          been able to speak in detail concerning her Lord. O saintly hearts,
          imitate ye her example! Think, my brethren, of our Lord Jesus: he is
          God, the Eternal, the Infinite, the ever blessed; yet he became man
          for us -- man of the substance of his mother, like ourselves. Meditate
          upon his spotless character; review the sufferings which he endured on
          Calvary; follow him into the grave, and from the grave to the
          resurrection, and from the resurrection up the starry way to his
          triumphant throne. Let your souls dwell upon each of his offices, as
          prophet, priest, and king; pore over each one of his characters, and
          every scriptural title; pause and consider every phase of him, and
          when you have done this, begin again and yet again. It is good to chew
          the cud by meditation, then shall the sweetness and fatness of divine
          truth come to your soul, and you shall burst forth with such rapturous
          expressions as that of the text, "Yea, he is altogether lovely." The
          most of you are too busy, you have too much to do in the world; but;
          what is it all about? Scraping together dust, loading yourselves with
          thick clay. O that you were busy after the true riches, and could step
          aside awhile to enrich yourselves in solitude, and make your hearts
          vigorous by feeding upon the person and work of your ever blessed
          Lord! You miss a heaven below by a too eager pursuit of earth. You
          cannot know these joyful raptures if meditation be pushed into a
          corner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another reason why little of the Lord's beauty is discerned, is the
          low state of the spiritual life in many a Christian. Many a believer
          is just alive and no more. Do you not know such starveling souls? May
          you not be one such yourself! His eyes are not delighted with the
          beauties of Christ, he is purblind, and cannot see afar off; he walks
          not with Jesus in the garden of pomegranates, he is too feeble to rise
          from the couch of weakness; he cannot feed upon Christ, his appetite
          is gone -- sure sign of terrible decline. For him there are no
          climbings to the top of Amana, no leaping for joy in the temple, no
          dancing before the ark with David; no, if he be but carried to the
          feet of Jesus in an ambulance as a sick man borne of four, it is as
          much as he has yet received. To be strong in the Lord, and in the
          power of his might, to have the wings of eagles with which to mount
          above the clouds of earth, to this many are strangers. But beloved,
          there are noble spirits and better taught, who know something of the
          life of heaven even while here below. The Lord strengthen us with
          grace in our inner man, and then shall we drink deeper draughts of the
          wines on the lees well refined, and then also our eyes being open, we
          shall see Jesus more clearly, and bear fuller witness that he is
          "fairer than the children of men."
        </p>
        <p>
          I am afraid that the visits of Christ to our souls have been
          disesteemed, and the loss of those visits has not caused us
          corresponding sorrow. We did not sufficiently delight in the beauty of
          the Bridegroom when he did come to us; when our hearts were somewhat
          lifted up with his love we grew cold and idle and then he withdrew his
          conscious presence; but, alas! we were not grieved, but we wickedly
          tried to live without him. It is wretched work for a believer to try
          and live without his Savior. Perhaps, dear brethren, some of you have
          tried it until at last you have almost succeeded. You were wont to
          mourn like doves if you had no word from your Master in the morning,
          and without a love-token before you went to rest you tossed uneasily
          upon your bed; but now you are carnal and worldly, and careless, and
          quite content to have it so. Jesus hides his face, the sun is set, and
          yet it is not night with you. O may God be pleased to arouse you from
          this lethargy, and make you mourn your sad estate! Even if an
          affliction should be needful to bring you back from your backsliding
          it would be a cheap price to pay. Awake, O north wind, with all thy
          cutting force, if thy bleak breath may but stir the lethargic heart!
          May the Lord grant us grace so to love Christ that if we have not our
          fill of him, we may be ready to die with hungering and thirsting after
          him. May we never be able to find a place to build our nest upon while
          our wing wanders away from the tree of life. Like the dove of Noah,
          may we drop into the water and be drowned sooner than find rest for
          the sole of our foot except upon the ark, Christ Jesus, our Savior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, if none of these suggestions should hit the mark, and reveal
          the cause why so little is known of rapturous love to Christ, let me
          suggest another. Very often professors' hearts are vain and frivolous;
          they are taken up during the week with their business. This might
          plead some excuse; but when they have little spaces and intervals
          these are filled up with very vanity. Now, if the soul has come to
          look at the mere trifles of this world as all-important, is it any
          marvel that it should be unable to perceive the exceeding preciousness
          of Christ Jesus? Who will care for the wheat when he dotes on the
          chaff? And with this it will often happen that the professor's mind
          has grown proud as well as vain; he does not remember his natural
          poverty and meanness, and consequently does not value the riches of
          Christ Jesus. He has come to think himself an established, experienced
          Christian; he fancies that he is not like those foolish beginners who
          are so volatile and so readily led astray; he has acquired the wisdom
          of years and the stability of experience. O soul, if thou art great,
          Christ will be little; thou canst never see him on the throne until
          thou hast been on the dunghill thyself. If thou be anything, so much
          the less is Christ; for if he be all in all, then there is no room for
          anything else and if thou be something, thou hast stolen just so much
          from the glory of thy Lord Jesus. Lie low in the dust, it is the place
          for thee.
        </p>
        <p>"The more thy glories strike my eyes,</p>
        <p>The humbler I shall lie."</p>
        <p>
          The humbler I am in myself, the more shall I be capable of seeing the
          enchanting beauties of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me just say these two or three words. I believe those are the
          happiest saints who are most overwhelmed with a sense of the
          greatness, goodness, and preciousness of Christ. I believe these to be
          the most useful saints, also, and to be in the Christian church as a
          tower of strength. I pray that you and I, walking with God by faith,
          may nevertheless often have our festival days, our notable seasons,
          when he shall specially bless us with the kisses of his love, and we
          shall drink larger draughts of his love, which is better than wine.
          Oh! to be carried right away with the divine manifestation of the
          chief among ten thousand, so that our souls shall cry out in rapture,
          "Yea, he is altogether lovely." This is one characteristic of the
          text: may it be transferred to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. A second is this, and very manifest it is upon the surface of the
          verse -- here is undivided affection. "He is altogether lovely." Note
          that these words have a world of meaning in them, but chiefly they
          tell us this, that Jesus is to the true saint the only lovely one in
          the world. "He is altogether lovely;" then there is no loveliness
          anywhere else. It is as though the spouse felt that Christ had
          engrossed all the beauty and all the loveworthiness in the entire
          universe. Who among us will say that she erred? Is not Jesus worthy of
          all the admiration and love of all intelligent beings? But may we not
          love our friends and kinsfolk? Ay but in him, and in subservience to
          him; so, and so only, is it safe to love them. Did not our Lord
          himself say, "If any man love father or mother more than me, he is not
          worthy of me"? Yea, and in another place he put it more strongly
          still, for he said, "Except a man hate father and mother," or love
          them not at all in comparison with me, "he is not worthy of me."
          Except these are put on a lower stage than Jesus is we cannot be his
          disciples. Christ must be monarch in the breast; our dear ones may sit
          at his footstool, and we may love them for his sake, but he alone must
          fill the throne of our hearts. I may see excellences in my Christian
          brethren, but I must not forget that there would be none in them if
          they were not derived from him; that their loveliness is only a part
          of his loveliness, for he wrought it in them by his own Spirit. I am
          to acknowledge that Jesus is the monopoliser of all loveliness, the
          engrosser of all that is admirable in the entire universe; and I am,
          therefore, to give him all my love, for "he is altogether lovely."
        </p>
        <p>
          Our text means, again, that in Jesus loveliness of all kinds is to be
          found. If there be anything that is worthy of the love of an immortal
          spirit, it is to be seen in abundance in the Lord Jesus. Whatsoever
          things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are
          just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely,
          whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if
          there be any praise, all can be found without measure in Christ Jesus.
          As all the rivers meet in the sea, so all beauties unite in the
          Redeemer. Take the character of any gracious man, and you shall find a
          measure of loveliness, but it has its bounds and its mixtures. Peter
          has many virtues, but he has not a few failings. John, too, excels,
          but in certain points he is deficient; but herein our Lord transcends
          all his saints, for all human virtues, all divine, are harmoniously
          blended in him. He is not this flower or that, but he is the Paradise
          of perfection. He is not a star here or a constellation there, he is
          the whole heaven of stars, nay, he is the heaven of heavens; he is all
          that is fair and lovely condensed in one.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the text says again that Jesus "is altogether lovely," it
          declares that he is lovely in all views of him. It generally happens
          that to the noblest building there is an unhappy point of view from
          which the architecture appears at a disadvantage; the choicest piece
          of workmanship may not be equally complete in all directions; the best
          human character is deformed by one flaw, if not with more; but with
          our Lord all is lovely, regard him as you will. You shall contemplate
          him from all points, and only find new confirmation of the statement
          that "he is altogether lovely." As the everlasting God before the
          world was made, angels loved him and adored; as the babe at Bethlehem
          or as the man at Bethany; as walking the sea or as nailed to the
          cross; in his grave, dead, and buried, or on his throne triumphant;
          rising as forerunner, or descending a second time to judge the world
          in righteousness; in his shame, despised and spit upon, or in his
          glory, adored and beloved; with the thorns about his brow and the
          nails piercing his hands, or with the keys of death and hell swinging
          at his girdle; view him as you will, and where you will, and when you
          will, "he is altogether lovely." Under all aspects, and in all offices
          and in relations, at all times and all seasons, under all
          circumstances and conditions, anywhere, everywhere, "he is altogether
          lovely."
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is he in any degree unlovely; the commendation forbids the idea it
          he be "altogether lovely," where could you find room for deformity?
          When Apelles painted Alexander, he laid the monarch's finger on an
          unsightly scar; but there are no scars to conceal when you pourtray
          the countenance of Immanuel. We say of our country -- and who among us
          will not say it? -- "With all her faults we love her still;" but we
          love Jesus, and find no strain put upon our heart, for trace of fault
          he has none. There is no need of apologies for Jesus, no excuses are
          required for him. But what is that I see upon his shoulder? It is a
          hard rough cross; and if I follow him I must carry that cross for his
          sake. Is not that cross unsightly? Oh, no! he is altogether lovely,
          cross and all. Whatever it may involve to be a Christian, we count
          even the reproach of Christ to be greater riches than the treasures of
          Egypt. The world will honor a half Christ, but a whole Christ it will
          not acknowledge. The bat's-eyed Socinian saith, "I admire the man
          Christ, but I will not adore Jesus the God." To him the eternal word
          is but half lovely, if lovely at all. Some will have Christ the
          exemplar, but they will not accept him as the vicarious sacrifice for
          sin, the substitute for sinners. Many will have Christ in silver
          slippers -- my lord archbishop's religion -- but they would not listen
          to the gospel from a poor gracious Methodist, or think it worth their
          while to join the unlettered throng whose devout songs rise from the
          village green. Alas! how much we see of crosses of gold and ivory, but
          how little do men love the lowly cross of Jesus! Brethren, we think
          Jesus "altogether lovely" even in poverty, or when hanging naked on
          the cross, deserted and condemned. We see unspeakable beauty in Jesus
          in the grave, all fair with the pallor of death. Jesus bruised as to
          his heel by the old serpent is yet comely. His love to us makes him
          evermore "white and ruddy" to our eye. We adore him anywhere and
          everywhere, and in any place, for we know that this same Christ whose
          heel is bruised breaks also the serpent's head, and he who was naked
          for our sakes, is now arrayed in glory. We know that the despised and
          rejected is also King of kings, and Lord of lords, the "Wonderful,
          Counsellor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father. The Prince of
          Peace." "Yea, he is altogether lovely." There are no flaws in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text intends us to know that Jesus is lovely in the highest
          degree: not lovely positively and then failing comparatively, but
          lovely superlatively, in the highest possible sense. But I leave this
          for your hearts to enlarge upon. I will close this point by saying,
          every child of God acknowledges that Christ Jesus is lovely altogether
          to the whole of himself. He is lovely to my judgment; but many things
          are so, and yet are not lovely to my affections; I know them to be
          right, and yet they are not pleasant: but Jesus is as lovely to my
          heart as to my head, as dear as he is good. He is lovely to my hopes:
          are they not all in him? Is not this my expectation -- to see him as
          he is? But he is lovely to my memory too: did he not pluck me out of
          the net? Lovely to all my powers and all my passions, my faculties and
          feelings. As David puts it, "My heart and my flesh crieth out for the
          living God" -- the whole of the man seeking after the whole of the
          Savior; the whole Savior sweet and inexpressibly precious to the man's
          entire being. May it be so with you and with me. But is it so? Do you
          not set up idols in your hearts? Men of God, do you not need to take
          the scourge of small cords, and purge the temple of your souls this
          morning? Are there not; buyers and sellers where Christ alone ought to
          be? Oh, to love him wholly, and to love him only, so that we have no
          eyes for other beauty, no heart for other loveliness since he fills
          our souls, and is to us "altogether lovely."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The third characteristic of the text is that to which I desire to
          draw the most attention, and that is ardent devotion. I called the
          text a live coal from off the altar and surely it is so. If it should
          drop into our hearts to set them on a blaze, it would be an
          unspeakable mercy. Ardent devotion flames from this sentence. It is
          the language of one who feels that no emotion is too deep when Jesus
          moves the heart. Do any chide you and say you think too much of your
          religion? It cannot be, it cannot be. If the zeal of God's house
          should eat us up until we had no existence except for the Lord's
          glory, we should not have gone too far. If there be corresponding
          knowledge to balance it, there cannot be too much of zeal for God. The
          utterance is that of one whose heart is like a furnace, of which love
          is the fire. "He is altogether lovely" -- it is the exclamation of one
          who feels that no language is too strong to commend the Lord. The
          spouse looked through the Hebrew tongue to find an intense expression,
          and our translators ransacked the English language for a forcible
          word, and they have put it in the most weighty way -- "He is
          altogether lovely." There is no fear of exaggeration when you speak of
          Christ; hyperboles are only sober truth when we depict his
          excellences. We have heard of a portrait painter who owed his
          popularity to the fact that he never painted truthfully, but always
          gave a flatteringly touch or two; here is one who would defy his art,
          for it is impossible to flatter Jesus. Lay on, ye men of eloquence,
          spare no colors, ye shall never depict him too bravely. Bring forth
          your harps, ye seraphs; sing aloud, ye blood-washed ones; all your
          praises fall short of the glory which is due to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the language of one who feels that no service would be too great
          to render to the Lord. I wish we felt as the apostles and martyrs and
          holy men of old did, that Jesus Christ ought to be served at the
          highest and richest rate. We do little, very little: what if I had
          said we do next to nothing for our dear Lord and Master nowadays? The
          love of Christ doth not constrain us as it should. But those of old
          bore poverty and dared reproach, marched weary leagues, passed
          tempestuous seas, bore perils of robbers and of cruel men, to plant
          the cross in lands where as yet Jesus was not known; labors that
          nowadays could not be expected of men, were performed as daily matters
          of commonplace by the Christians of the earliest times. Is Christ less
          lovely, or is his church less loyal? Would God she estimated him at
          his right rate, for then she would return to her former mode of
          service. Brethren, we want to feel, and we shall feel if this text is
          deeply engraven on our hearts, that no gift is too great for Christ,
          though we give him all we have, and consecrate to him all our time and
          ability, and sacrifice our very lives to him. No suffering is too
          great to bear for the sake of the Crucified, and it is a great joy to
          be reproached for Christ's sake. "He is altogether lovely." Then, my
          soul, I charge thee think nothing hard to which he calls thee, nothing
          sharp which he bids thee endure. As the knight of the olden time
          consecrated himself to the Crusade, and wore the red cross on his arm,
          fearing not to meet death at the hands of the Infidel, if he might be
          thought a soldier of the Lord, so we too would face all foes for
          Jesus' sake. We want, only refined and purified, and delivered from
          its earthly grossness, we want the chivalrous spirit once again in the
          church of God. A new crusade fain would I preach: had I the tongue of
          such a one as the old hermit to move all Christendom, I would say,
          "This day Christ, the altogether lovely one, is dishonored: can ye
          endure it? This day idols stand where he should be and men adore them;
          lovers of Jesus, can ye brook it? This day Juggernaut rides through
          the streets on his bloody way, this day God's Christ is still unknown
          to millions, and the precious blood cleanses not the nations, how long
          will ye have it so? We, in England, with ten thousand Christian
          hearts, and as many tongues endowed with eloquence, and purses
          weighted with gold, shall we refuse our gifts, withhold our witness,
          and suffer the Lord to be dishonored? The church is doing next to
          nothing for her great Lord, she falls short both of her duty and of
          the grim need of a perishing world. O for a flash of the celestial
          fire! Oh, when shall the Spirit's energy visit us again! When shall
          men put down their selfishness and seek only Christ? When shall they
          leave their strifes about trifles to rally round his cross! When shall
          we end the glorification of ourselves, and begin to make him glorious,
          even to the world's end? God help us in this matter, and kindle in our
          hearts the old consuming heart-inflaming fire, which shall make men
          see that Jesus is all in all to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Thus I have shown you the characteristics of the text, and now I
          desire to USE IT IN THREE WAYS FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES. As time flies,
          we must use it briefly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first word is to you, Christians. Here is very sweet instruction.
          The Lord Jesus "is altogether lovely." Then if I want to be lovely, I
          must be like him, and the model for me as a Christian is Christ. Have
          you ever noticed how badly boys write at the bottom of the pages in
          their copy-books? There is the copy at the top; and in the first line
          they look at that; in the second line, they copy their own imitation;
          in the third line, they copy their imitation of their imitation, and
          so the writing grows worse and worse as it descends the page. Now, the
          apostles followed Christ; the first fathers imitated the apostles; the
          next fathers copied the first fathers, and so the standard of holiness
          fell dreadfully; and now we are too apt to follow the very lees and
          dregs of Christianity, and we think if we are about as good as our
          poor, imperfect ministers or leaders in the church, that we shall do
          well and deserve praise. But now, my brethren, cover up the mere
          copies and imitations, and live by the first line. Copy Jesus; "he is
          altogether lovely;" and if you can write by the first line, you will
          write by the truest and best model in the world. We want to have
          Christ's zeal, but we must balance it with his prudence and discretion
          we must seek to have Christ's love to God, and we must feel his love
          to men, his forgiveness of injury, his gentleness of speech, his
          incorruptible truthfulness, his meekness and lowliness, his utter
          unselfishness, his entire consecration to his Father's business. O
          that we had all this, for depend upon it whatever other pattern we
          select, we have made a mistake; we are not following the true classic
          model of the Christian artist. Our master model is the "altogether
          lovely" one. How sweet it is to think of our Lord in the double aspect
          as our exemplar and our Savior! The laver which stood in the temple
          was made of brass: in this the priests washed their feet whenever they
          offered sacrifices; so does Christ purify us from sin; but the
          tradition is that this laver was made of very bright brass, and acted
          as a mirror, so that as often as the priests came to it they could see
          their own spots in it. Oh, when I come to my Lord Jesus, not only do I
          get rid of my sins as to their guilt, but I see my spots in the light
          of his perfect character, and I am humbled and taught to follow after
          holiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second use to which we would put the verse is this, here is a very
          gentle rebuke to some of you. Though very gentle, I beseech you to let
          it sink deep into your hearts. You do not see the lowliness of Christ,
          yet "he is altogether lovely." Now, I will not say one hard word! but
          I will tell you sorrowfully what pitiable creatures you are. I hear
          enchanting music, which seems more a thing of heaven than of earth: it
          is one of Handel's half-inspired oratorios. Yonder sits a man, who
          says, "I hear nothing to commend." He has not the power to perceive
          the linked sweetnesses, the delicious harmonies of sounds. Do you
          blame him? No, but you who have an ear for music, say, "How I pity
          him: he misses half the joy of life!" Here, again, is a glorious
          landscape, hills and valleys, and flowing rivers, expansive lakes and
          undulating meadows. I bring to the point of view a friend, whom I
          would gratify, and I say to him, "Is not that a charming scene?"
          Turning his head to me, he says, "I see nothing." I perceive that he
          cannot enjoy what is so delightful to me; he has some little sight,
          but he sees only what is very near, and he is blind to all beyond.
          Now, do I blame him? Or if he proceed to argue with me, and say, "You
          are very foolish to be so enthusiastic about a non-existent landscape,
          it is merely your excitement," shall I argue with him? Shall I be
          angry until him? No, but I shed a tear, and whisper to myself, "Great
          are the losses of the blind." Now, you who have never heard music in
          the name of Jesus, you are to be greatly pitied, for your loss is
          heavy. You who never saw beauty in Jesus, and who never will for ever,
          you need all our tears. It is hell enough not to love Christ! It is
          the lowest abyss of Tartarus, and its fiercest flame, not to be
          enamoured of the Christ of God. There is no heaven that is more heaven
          than to love Christ and to be like him, and there is no hell that is
          more hell than to be unlike Christ and not to want to be like him, but
          even to be averse to the infinite perfections of the "altogether
          lovely." The Lord open those blind eyes of yours, and unstop those
          deaf ears, and give you the new and spiritual life, and then will you
          join in saying, "Yea, he is altogether lovely."
        </p>
        <p>
          The last use of the text is, that of tender attractiveness. "Yea, he
          is altogether lovely." Where are you this morning, you who are
          convinced of sin and want a Savior, where have you crept to? Are you
          hidden away where my eyes cannot reach you? At any rate, let this
          sweet thought reach you. You need not be afraid to come to Jesus, for
          "he is altogether lovely." It does not say he is altogether terrible
          -- that is your misconception of him; it does not say he is somewhat
          lovely, and sometimes willing to receive a certain sort of sinner; but
          "he is altogether lovely," and therefore he is always ready to welcome
          to himself the vilest of the vile. Think of his name. It is Jesus, the
          Savior. Is not this lovely? Think of his work. He is come to seek and
          to save that which was lost. This is his occupation. Is not that
          lovely? Think of what he has done. He hath redeemed our souls with
          blood. Is not that lovely? Think of what he is doing. He is pleading
          before the throne of God for sinners. Think of what he is giving at
          this moment -- he is exalted on high to give repentance and remission
          of sins. Is not this lovely? Under every aspect Christ Jesus is
          attractive to sinners who need him. Come, then, come and welcome,
          there is nothing to keep you away, there is everything to bid you
          come. May this very Sabbath day in which I have preached Christ, and
          lifted him up, be the day in which you shall be drawn to him, never
          again to leave him, but to be his for ever and for ever. Amen.

        <p>PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON -- Solomon's Song 5.</p>
        <p>
          MR. SPURGEON begs earnestly to thank a friend, who desires to be
          anonymous, for £500 towards buildings for the Pastors' College, to
          commemorate the thousandth Sermon, as also Mr. Thomas Ness for £10,
          and a Sermon-reader for a guinea. This last donor believes that at
          least a thousand readers might send a guinea each at once, to
          celebrate the occasion, and to aid in erecting rooms in which
          preachers would be trained, whose theme would be the gospel of Jesus.
          Mr. Spurgeon is thankful for the timely aid. Some £3,000 more will
          probably be required for the buildings.<br />
