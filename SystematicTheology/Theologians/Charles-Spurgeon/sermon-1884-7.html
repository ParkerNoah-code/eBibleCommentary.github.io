          "I know thy works: behold I have set before thee an open door, and no
          man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my
          word, and hast not denied my name. Because thou hast kept the word of
          my patience, I will also keep thee from the hour of temptation, which
          shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth."
          -- Revelation 3:8,10.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS is a message to the angel of the church at Philadelphia, and it
          is full of instruction to churches and ministers at this present time
          "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
          churches." The Philadelphian church was not great, but it was good: it
          was not powerful, but it was faithful. The Spirit says, "Thou hast a
          little strength." Every band of believers has some strength: weak as
          we are in ourselves, the very fact of our possessing faith proves that
          we have a portion of strength. Still that strength is a matter of
          degrees and certain churches have a little strength -- but only a
          little. I suppose that the Philadelphian church had but little
          strength in the following respects: -- the number of its members would
          be small, and it had therefore but little strength for undertaking any
          extensive enterprize which would call for numerous bands of workers.
          The brethren needed all their strength concentrated on their home
          work, for they were few, and the miss of one or two from home
          evangelization and edification would be greatly felt. A church may
          have a very short muster-roll, and yet it may be very dear to God, who
          thinks more of quality than of quantity, more of obedience than of
          numbers. They had also little strength in the direction of talent.
          They were not like that famous church at Corinth, where everybody
          could teach everybody, but where nobody cared to learn of any one.
          They had but small ability to speak with tongues, or work miracles, or
          teach the word; but they adhered faithfully to what they had been
          taught by the apostles of the Lord: they were not brilliant, but they
          were sound. Churches with few men of learning or eloquence in them may
          yet be greatly approved of the Lord, who cares more for grace than
          learning, more for faith than talent. In all probability they were,
          like most of the churches of that day, possessed of very little
          pecuniary strength. They could do but little where money would be
          required. They were a company of poor people with no man of means
          among them; and there are many such churches that are peculiarly
          precious to the heart of God, who cares nothing for gold, and
          everything for sincerity. Possibly they were little, too, in those
          things which go side by side with grace: I mean in knowledge, and in
          power to utter what they knew. This was a pity; but as it was their
          misfortune and not their fault, they were not blamed for it. The Lord
          does not blame us for having little strength, but for having little
          love, little faith, little zeal, little consecration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Philadelphian saints, like the limpet, which has but little
          strength, stuck firmly to the rock, and they are commended for it.
          They had little strength, but they kept God's word, and they did not
          deny his name. Possibly if they had felt stronger they might have
          presumptuously quitted the word of the Lord for the opinions of men,
          as the Galatians did, and then they would have lost their reward. May
          every church of the Lord Jesus Christ, whether it have little strength
          or much, be concerned to be steadfast in the faith -- loyal to King
          Jesus -- firm in the truths which Christ has taught us by the Holy
          Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, dear friends, as this expression was used to the angel of the
          church at Philadelphia, whom I suppose to be the minister of the
          church, I do not feel that I shall be doing any violence to the text
          if I take it in reference to each individual; and I have no doubt that
          there will be individual Christians present at this time who, though
          they have but little strength, have kept God's word. If so, they will
          receive a reward for it, according to the grace of God. They have been
          firm and steadfast in their confession of the faith once delivered
          unto the saints, and the Lord who gave them the grace to be so will
          give them yet more grace as the recompense of their fidelity. We will
          speak upon the text to-night with a view to that, and we shall notice,
          first, that there is a word of praise: God praises this faithful
          messenger of the church. Secondly, he gives him a word of prospect. He
          says, "I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it:
          for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word." And then,
          thirdly, we shall speak upon a word of promise which is in the text in
          the tenth verse: "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I
          also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon
          all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth." Oh that my
          words might call out some faithful ones in these evil days. We need
          pillars in the house of our God. Where are they to be found?
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First I would remind you that our text has in it A WORD OF PRAISE.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not think that we should be so slow as we sometimes are in
          praising one another. There is a general theory abroad that it is
          quite right and proper to point out to a brother all his
          imperfections, for it will be a salutary medicine to him, and prevent
          his being too happy in this vale of tears. Is it supposed that we
          shall cheer him on to do better by always finding fault with him? If
          so, some people ought to be very good by this time, for they have had
          candid friends in plenty. Find fault with a brother and he will be
          kept from growing too proud; and he will, no doubt, go forward
          blessing you very much for your kind consideration in promoting his
          humility. Remember also that it is so much to the increase of
          brotherly love to have a clear eye to see the imperfections of our
          friends. Does anyone in his senses think so? I should suppose that
          after having given a sufficient trial to that manner of procedure, it
          would be quite as well at times to try another, and to rejoice in
          everything which we see of grace in our brethren, and sometimes to
          thank God in their hearing for what we perceive in them that we are
          sure is the fruit of the Spirit. If they are what they should be, they
          will not think so much of our little praises as to be unduly exalted
          thereby; but they will be sometimes so encouraged as to be nerved to
          higher and nobler things. If a man deserves my commendation, I am only
          paying a debt when I give it to him, and it is dishonest to withhold
          it under the pretence that he would not use the payment rightly. Men
          who deserve praise can bear it, and some of them even need it. I
          should not wonder that the kindly words of God's people may be but a
          rehearsal of that "Well done, good and faithful servant" which will
          one day sound in their ears; and be a useful rehearsal, too, helping
          them on their weary way. Good men have many conflicts, let us minister
          to their comfort. At any rate, the great Head of the church did not
          think it unwise to say to the church at Philadelphia that he thought
          well of it because it had kept his word. Let us give honour to whom
          honour is due, and encourage those who are aiming to do right.
        </p>
        <p>
          What had these Philadelphian believers done that they should be
          praised? What they did was this -- they kept the word of God: "Thou
          hast kept my word, and thou hast not denied my name." What does this
          mean?
        </p>
        <p>
          Does it not mean, first, that they had received the word of God; for
          if they had not heard it and held it they could not have kept it. It
          was theirs, they heard it and had no wish to hear anything else. It
          was theirs, they read it and searched it and made it their own. They
          hoarded up divine knowledge in their memories, preserved it in their
          affections, used it in their experience, and practised it in their
          lives. They were not ashamed of revealed truth, but, on the contrary,
          they took it for their possession, their heritage, their treasure,
          their all. I trust that many of us can say that the doctrines of grace
          are our jewels, our estate, yes, our very life. God has put us in
          trust with the gospel, and we will sooner part with all that we have
          than be false to our trust. It is no small privilege so to be taught
          of the Holy Ghost as to have a taste for the gospel, a deep attachment
          to the truths of the covenant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we may be sure that they loved the word of God. They had an
          intense delight in it. They appreciated it: they fed upon it. They
          stored it up as bees store away honey, and they were as ready to
          defend it as bees are to guard their stores. They meditated upon it;
          they sought to understand it; they took delight in everything which
          came from the mouth of God. Men do not keep things which they consider
          to be value-less: if men in our day had a higher opinion of the truth
          they would be more valiant for it. People are always ready to part
          with that for which they have no esteem, and for this very reason many
          are quite willing to give up the Bible to critics and philosophers,
          those footpads and burglars of faith. But he that keeps God's word, we
          may be sure, is deeply in love with it. Oh, dear child of God, you may
          be very little in Israel; but if you love the word of God there is a
          something about you in which God takes delight. He sees you at your
          Bible-reading, he marks you in your endeavours to get at the meaning
          of his word, he notes you when you sit down and meditate upon his
          divine thoughts, and he takes pleasure in your eagerness to know what
          the will of the Lord is. He says, "I know thy works"; and though you
          may be one of little influence and little ability, yet he is pleased
          with you because you are pleased with his word.
        </p>
        <p>
          More, however, is meant than simply loving the word, though that is no
          small thing. It means that they believed it, believed it most
          thoroughly, and so kept it. I am afraid that there are great truths in
          God's word which we do not intelligently believe, but take for
          granted. We say, "Yes, yes; these doctrines are in the Creed;" and we
          put them up on the top shelf, and by that very act we lay them aside
          and do not heartily believe in them for ourselves. We grow very vexed
          if anybody denies them; but if there is no controversy over them we
          forget them. Is this wise? We call our opponents heterodox, and our
          zeal for orthodoxy comes to the front; and yet, after all, it may be
          that we have never exercised a personel faith about those doctrines,
          so as to think them out for ourselves. It is a grand thing to work
          your passage to a truth, to mine your way to the golden ore by digging
          and clearing. True believers may be likened to those mites in the
          cheese which eat their way into it, and penetrate into the centre by
          feeding upon all that lies in their way as they advance. We eat our
          way into the word of God, we live upon what we learn, tunnelling
          through the truth with receptive minds. The truth is too great for us
          ever to absorb it all, but daily and hourly we live upon it. We so
          believe it, as to treat it as a matter of fact, valuable for everyday
          use; this is the surest way to keep in, even to the end. Now, dear
          child of God, as I have said before, you may have but very little
          strength, you may often be tempted and tried, and cast down; but if
          you believe the word, there is more for the pleasing of God in a
          childlike faith than there is in the most glittering profession or in
          the most showy deeds. Faith is the Koh-i-noor among jewels, -- the
          queen of the virtues. Believe you God's word, and you have wrought a
          god-like work. Believe it when others contradict it, and you are a
          conquerer over them all. Believe it when circumstances seem to make it
          questionable; believe it when your own heart fails you; believe it
          when your sin and corruption rise within you like a fountain of foul
          waters: thus shall you give glory to the God of truth. Still hold on
          to the promise made to you in the word of God, and to the
          manifestation of God which is seen in Christ Jesus, and you will be
          doing your God the honour which he deserves at your hands, and he will
          say, "I know thy works; for thou hast a little strength, but thou hast
          kept my word."
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, in addition to the inner possession and the hearty belief
          of the truth, we must be ready to adhere to it at all times. That,
          perhaps, is the central thought here, -- "Thou hast kept my word."
          Why, there are great folk among us that never care to believe
          according to God's word at all. They have thought out what they
          believe; their theology is made out of their own substance, as spiders
          spin their webs out of their own bowels. But, surely, in everything
          which concerns the doctrines of our most holy faith, we must make
          reference to a "Thus, saith the Lord." It is not what I think; it is
          not what some greater man may think; it is not what may be the
          consensus of all the enlightened minds of the period; the decision
          lies with what the Lord has spoken. God's thoughts are as high above
          ours as the heavens are above the earth; dare we drag them down and
          sit in judgment on them? If the thought of the age happens to be
          right, well and good; but it is not upon temporary opinion that we
          rest. Our faith stands not in the wisdom of man, but in the power of
          God. What is taught in Holy Scripture is sure truth to us, and every
          other statement must bow to it. Chillingworth said what ought to be
          true, though I am afraid that it is not -- "The Bible and the Bible
          alone is the religion of Protestants." I should like to see a few more
          of such Protestants. Many say that we ought to keep "abreast of the
          times," whatever that may mean; and that there is a certain "spirit of
          the age," to which we should be subject. This to me is treason against
          sovereign truth. I know of one only spirit to whom I desire to be
          subject, and that is the Spirit of all the ages, who never changes. By
          his teaching we are not only nineteen centuries behind the present
          age, but we come in at the back of all the ages of human history. If
          we have but little strength, we mean to let the times and the spirits
          go where they like, we shall keep to the Holy Spirit and to his
          eternal teachings. Supposing that we have not such big heads as some
          have, and cannot excogitate or multiply sophisms and inventions as
          they do, it will be no small thing to be commended at the last, in
          these terms -- "Thou hast a little strength, but thou hast kept my
          word." Brother, cling to God's word; cling to infallible and immutable
          revelation! Whatever novelty comes up, keep to the word of Jesus!
          Whatever discovery may be made by the wise men of the age, let Christ
          be wisdom unto you. Regard the new teachers no more than you would the
          wise men of Gotham, for those who oppose themselves to God's word are
          fools. Let them cry "Lo here, or lo there," but believe them not. Here
          is your anchorage. The Book is our ultimatum.
        </p>
        <p>"Within this sacred volume lies</p>
        <p>The mystery of mysteries;</p>
        <p>Happiest they of human race</p>
        <p>To whom our God hath given grace</p>
        <p>To read, to mark, to think, to pray,</p>
        <p>To know the right, to learn the way;</p>
        <p>But better they had ne'er been born</p>
        <p>Who read to doubt, or read to scorn."</p>
        <p>
          That which is not in Holy Scripture is not to be received as matter of
          faith in the Christian church; but that which is there is to be
          received and held with that stern steadfastness, that incorruptible
          faith, which no more changes than the unchanging truth which it has
          grasped. Woe be to the man who is first a Calvinist, then an Arminian,
          then a Palagian, then a Unitarian; never finding rest for the sole of
          his foot; keeping nothing because he has nothing to keep. This
          Philadelphian church had won the commendation, "Thou hast kept my
          word." Dear hearer, see that you win it too.
        </p>
        <p>
          And no doubt also it was intended in this sense -- that they had
          obeyed the word of God. "Thou hast a little strength:" there are very
          few of you, but you have been observant of all precepts and
          ordinances. Some think it a great thing to be members of a popular
          sect, but when the great curtain rolls up, and all things are seen as
          they are, and not as they seem, do you not think that that church will
          be most commended which was truest to the teaching of the Holy Spirit
          in everything? Christian chivalry should make you feel it better to be
          a member of a church of six doing the Lord's work conscientiously than
          to be a member of a church of six millions which has turned aside from
          it. I could not be in communion with a church whose chief guide and
          authority is another book than God's word, and whose acknowledged Head
          is other than the Lord Jesus Christ. I had sooner stand alone then
          yield with a crowd to an Act of Parliament which was passed to dictate
          to me the form in which I may worship God. There shall come a day when
          it will be found that the minorities have generally saved both the
          world and the church. A straggling few may reckon themselves to be the
          majority when they stand alone with God, for HE counts for more than
          all the myriads of the earth put together. The faithful, staunch,
          God-fearing men that would not budge an inch, or change a letter, or
          shape a syllable, to please all the kings and princes of the earth,
          shall be found to praise and honour in the day of the Lord's
          appearing. These are the men that Christ shall stoop from his throne
          to honour: they that have trifled with his word shall be lightly
          esteemed: they that have wilfully broken one of the least of his
          commandments, and have taught men so, shall be least in the kingdom of
          heaven. Blessed and happy shall he be who followeth the Lamb
          whithersoever he goeth. Blessed shall he be who only wanted to know
          the Lord's will that he might do it unquestioningly, caring nothing
          what the will of other people might be in the matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall put it home to you, dear friends, again. You may have but
          little strength, but do you keep God's word? You may never become more
          numerous, or more influential; but do let it be true of you, that you
          have kept God's word. Be students of God's word and adherents of it.
          Take no notice of anything I say if it cannot be supported by the word
          of divine truth. Take equally little notice of what any man says, be
          he orator, thinker, bishop, or whatever he may be. There is no value
          in all the brass counters which circulate among the many; they are
          current with the world, but the Kingdom of God does not know them. The
          words of men are trifling in value; it takes a mass of them to come to
          the value of a farthing; but any one word of the Lord is worth a mint
          of gold. If a doctrine be of God, if it has come out of the loving
          lips of the Lord Jesus, hold it fast, as for dear life. Let men call
          you bigot, but never mind, hold you on with all your might, and your
          Lord will smile upon you.

          Thus have I explained what the Philadelphians did. They did it under
          great disadvantages, but that only helped to increase the weight of
          praise measured out to them. They had little talent, but they kept
          God's word. Oh, that men who have ten talents would not be so anxious
          to be original in their teaching! Oh, that they would cease to display
          their own thought, their own cleverness, and individuality. If you
          have little talent, it is a pity you have not more; but still it is
          for your praise if you quit yourselves like men, and stand fast in the
          faith. It may be, you have little strength of mind; but I hope even
          then grace enables you to be firm for truth. In other things you may
          be easily persuaded, and readily talked over; but be you doubly stanch
          in the things of God. There make your mark, and put your foot down.
          Let it be seen that you do not go to be stirred in those vital points,
          till your friends say of you, "Oh, you can twist William anywhere, but
          not in his religion. On that point he is a regular Puritan; there is
          no moving him." May it always be so; even if you have but little
          strength, see to it that you keep Christ's word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Possibly you have not much strength as to influence: your sphere may
          be very narrow, and your power in it very slight. That does not
          matter; but it does matter that you be faithful to your Lord. If you
          have kept God's word you may be wielding an influence far beyond what
          you imagine. Good men in the dark days of Popery found out the truth,
          but they only lived, perhaps, in some quiet village, or shut up in a
          monastery, and the most they could do was to write down what they knew
          and so keep it. We have met with instances where they wrote out part
          of the word of God, and hid it away in a wall; and afterwards, when
          the wall was pulled down, the priceless record was discovered and
          used. Truth does not die through being buried. Some taught the gospel
          very quietly in their own family circle, and so kept it. Some would
          get a few copies of the New Testament, and go about and sell them in
          their baskets; and so they kept the truth. Those men of old time whose
          influence upon their own age seemed so little, nevertheless prepared
          the way for those braver spirits who, by-and-by, shone forth like the
          stars of the morning. Hold fast God's word and never mind what comes
          of it for the moment; God's seed may not grow in a day, but it will
          grow. If you only influence one child, who can tell what that child
          may be? If you only help to strengthen one solitary Christian woman,
          who knows what may come to pass by her means? We see the telegraph
          wires, but we do not see what messages they may carry. The ropes hang
          down in our belfry, but the glorious chime is aloft. We cannot see the
          big bells, but it is ours to pull the ropes that are near our hand,
          and do what God bids us to do, and music will come of it somewhere.
          Above all, if we have but little strength of any kind, let us keep
          God's word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, why should God's word be kept in this way? What is there to
          praise about keeping God's word? I answer, because it is a holy thing
          to treasure up God's word. I have gone into the churches on the
          Continent, and I have seen gold and silver plate in the sacristy,
          understood to be worth one or two or three millions of money. These
          were said to be the treasures of the church. Why, these are the
          treasures of men, and they shall pass away. The solid truth of
          revelation, the doctrine of the Holy Ghost, a divine experience given
          to you by that Holy Ghost -- all this is the treasure of the church,
          and you are doing a holy thing when you guard it against every
          adversary. To this purpose are saints sent into the world -- to keep
          this treasure of the church against all adversaries. Truth is the
          jewel for which all believers must be ready to die. Solomon made
          shields of gold, which were borne before the king when he went into
          the house of the Lord; but Rehoboam took away the shields of gold, and
          put shields of brass in their place. It is to be feared many are doing
          the same at this moment. Let us bear our protest: the gold is good
          enough for us. Do not throw away the best for the sake of getting
          something that may be newer, but that must be far inferior. I hold one
          single sentence out of God's word to be of more certainty, and of more
          power, than all the discoveries of all the learned men of all the
          ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          I might have seen the Alexandrian library burned without losing a
          night's rest, for the mass of its contents must have been mere
          rubbish; but were there one single verse of the New Testament which it
          were possible to blot out from human memory and record, one might be
          willing to lay down his life to save the glorious sentence. The mind
          of man sends forth pure water and impure, and it is hard to discern
          between the two; but from the heart of God there wells up, undiluted
          and unmingled, a stream of living truth which is more for man's
          benefit than all else out of heaven. Warriors guard kings, and crowns,
          and thrones; but the living truth of the living God is infinitely more
          worthy of our watch. Oh for ten thousand valiant men to stand about
          the bed of the truth, each man with his sword upon his thigh because
          of fear in the night. Therefore, as it is a holy thing, a heavenly
          thing, a priceless thing, keep you God's word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, it is a wise thing, for you that have but little strength, to
          keep God's word. The feebler you are the more closely should you keep
          to the Scriptures. Remember what Solomon says, -- "The conies are a
          feeble folk," but he puts them down as wise people, for they have
          their habitation in the rocks. If a disputer can once get you away
          from the Bible, he can swallow you alive; but if you will keep to
          Scripture, and handle this weapon, "It is written; it is written," the
          disputer may be the arch-fiend himself, but he cannot possibly get the
          victory over you. Your wisdom is not to try to gain keenness of mind
          that you may emulate the critic, but to lay hold upon God's word, and
          cling to it, for therein shall be your safety and your victory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, dear friends, we ought to hold fast to the truth of God,
          because, if we have little strength, it is there that we shall get
          more strength. We shall never grow stronger by leaving the eternal
          word. Nay, but as we cling to God in feebleness, the divine strength
          of the word is infused into our souls. Besides, God's word is a
          supporting thing, and he who quits it leaves his chief helper. He that
          receives it shall live, but without it there is no spiritual life.
          Therefore let us hold it. If men would take away from us certain
          dainties which are sweet but which are not needful, we might be
          content to let them spoil us of such superfluities; but if they come
          to take away bread and water from the poor and needy, then we cannot
          have it. For this we must stand up and fight to the death. The word
          that cometh out of Christ's mouth is the daily manna of our heavenly
          life, and it behoves every Christian, however feeble or however
          strong, to keep the word of God with all his might against all comers,
          since it is his life. I am at this pass, I can sooner die than yield
          the gospel. I may be a fool, and an old-fashioned bigot, but I am not
          a turncoat, and I cannot quit the word of the Lord. If I must be the
          last of the Puritans, I will not be ashamed of it. My Lord will revive
          his buried truth as sure as he is God: the present madness will cease
          with its own short hour.
        </p>
        <p>So much, then, with regard to this word of praise.</p>
        <p>
          II. I will not be long on the next point, while I just remind you that
          there is A WORD OF PROSPECT: -- "Behold, I have set before thee an
          open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength,
          and hast kept my word."
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems to me to mean just this, -- "You have been faithful;
          therefore I will use you. You have been steadfast; therefore I will
          employ you." For a considerable period of human life, it may be, God
          does not give to all of us a field of usefulness, but he provides a
          field of trial. There are some to whom he early opens the gate of
          usefulness, because he sees in them a spirit that will bear the
          temptation of success; but in many other cases it is questionable
          whether they could bear promotion, and therefore the Lord permits them
          to be tried in different ways until he sees that they are found
          faithful, and then he puts them into his service, and gives them an
          opportunity of bearing witness for him. Now, dear friend, perhaps
          hitherto you have been perfectly satisfied with holding the truth with
          all your might, and being faithful to it in private and in your own
          daily life. I want to suggest to you that if you have done this for
          some time the era has now arrived when you may go forward to somewhat
          more. There are opportunities before you now which were not there
          before: these are placed before you especially because you have been
          tried, and have been proved faithful. If you will now begin to talk to
          others about that which you love so well, you will be astonished to
          find how gladly they will receive it from you. You have been a
          receiver yourself until now, and that is well and good; but, now that
          you have become filled, overflow to others, and let them receive of
          your joy. "How do I know that they will accept it?" say you. I know it
          from this fact -- that, as a general rule, the man that keeps God's
          word has an open door before him. If you have been vacillating and
          shifty and tricky, and have believed everything and nothing, nobody
          will take any particular notice of what you say, except it be to shut
          the door against your uncertain prattle. But when they have observed
          how you stand to the truth, how solid, and how steadfast you are, they
          will give over disputing with you, and come to inquire what your views
          really are. People do not care about knocking their heads against
          brick walls, or fighting against pillars of iron; and when they see
          that you are firm and unmoved, they will say, "We must let him have
          his own way." When a man begins his Christian life in a kind of
          dubious, half-hearted way, his friends do not know whether he is
          really going to carry it out or not: at any rate, as he endeavours to
          avoid all persecution, they do not know what to think of him, and they
          feel encouraged to treat him as one who can be pressed and squeezed at
          pleasure. If there is a secret entrance to heaven he prefers it; he
          means to go round about and climb over the wall somewhere, or sneak in
          at the back gate. This poor creature has no power or influence; he is
          rather ridiculous than useful. Nobody ever respects him. Nobody cares
          a button about him. The devil himself does not trouble him much, for
          he knows that he will do no harm to his kingdom, let him talk as he
          likes. But the man who says, "I am going straight for glory, and if
          anybody is in my way so much the worse for him, for I am bound to take
          the right road;" such a man will find a pretty clear track. Mr. Moody
          would say, "Make a bee line for heaven." A bee knows the nearest way.
          and keeps to it with all its force. Let me hear each one of you say,
          "I am not going to take any corners, or twists, or windabouts; but,
          straight away, what God bids me to do I am going to do; what he bids
          me believe I am going to believe; and if there is anything to be
          suffered for it, all right. I have added it all up, and I count the
          reproach of Christ to be greater riches then all the treasures of
          Egypt." This is the right kind of resolution. God help you to keep to
          it. Before you, my brother, the Lord God has set an open door. Go
          ahead! Do not be afraid. People will be willing to hear what you have
          to say, and, what is more, people will be converted by what you say,
          for God has set before you this open door, and no man can shut it. It
          is amazingly easy to go through a door when it is wide open, and it
          will be very easy to you -- much easier than you think, now that you
          have been schooled by God's Spirit into steadfastness of character,
          just to say in God's name, dependent upon God's strength, what he has
          taught you. You will bring many to Christ, because you yourself abide
          in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, brother, you did not reckon that such usefulness would ever fall
          to your lot; did you? Cheer up, and get to work. Wake up to holy
          energy. In the Sunday-school there are little children that you will
          be the means of bringing to Christ if you take a class; and out at the
          street corners there are folks that you will turn to the Saviour if
          you have but the courage to stand up and preach. Out in the villages,
          or in the crowded city hearts await you. I say not this of you all,
          but only of confirmed and faithful ones. If you feel, "I never can
          give up the Bible; I never can forsake the truths that I have learnt
          from it: they are stamped on my heart, they are cut into the very
          centre of my soul," then you are the man who may safely go forth to
          publish the truth. There is an open door before you which no man can
          shut. Gird up your loins and enter it. Rush to the front. Victory lies
          before you. God means to use you. You are a vessel fit for the
          Master's use, and there never was a vessel fit for his use that he did
          not use one day or other. The hour needs its man quite as much as the
          man needs the hour. Take time by the forelock and honour your God. The
          Lord help you to keep his word, and then to go in for public
          testimony.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Our last point was to be A WORD OF PROMISE; for, according to the
          tenth verse, it is written, "Because thou hast kept the word of my
          patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which
          shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth."
          Those who keep God's word, shall themselves be kept from temptation.
          The Lord returns into his servants' bosoms that which they render to
          him: he gives keeping for keeping.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I shall speak for myself and for you, and I know that we can bear
          witness that this promise is true. One says to me, "Are you not
          perplexed about the prevalence of modern thought -- the new phase of
          divinity that has come up of late, and the general progress that is
          being made towards a new theology? Does it not trouble you?" Not a
          bit. Modern ideas do not affect me in the slightest. If all men that
          live or ever shall live should throw up the old Calvinism, there
          remains one that will hold it, for this reason -- that he could not
          hold any other. I must be crushed out of existence before my
          convictions of the truth of the doctrines of grace in the
          old-fashioned form can ever be taken from me. I am miserable,
          wretched, lost if the doctrines of grace be not true. I am joyous,
          glad, strong, happy if these doctrines be true. I cannot give them up,
          therefore; and especially because as I read, and the more I read, I
          perceive these things to be written in the word of God, and therefore
          I must hold them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this church we feel very little of the temptation which tries all
          the world: very seldom are any of our friends unsettled in their
          minds, or tormented with these hornets of heresy. "Alas," said one
          minister to me, "I see some of my best people becoming sceptical; are
          you not worried by seeing the thoughtful ones drifting off into new
          views?" "No, not at all." "Why not?" "Because the grace of God keeps
          our people to their moorings. They know what they believe and they
          have no desire to change" If a man does not believe the doctrines of
          grace, he comes to hear me once, and he says, "I am not going there
          any more." He talks to some of you, and you are so dogmatic, and
          firmly rooted, he calls you pig-headed, and says it is no use arguing
          with such bigots; and so he goes to argue somewhere else. This is
          exactly as we would have it. When a bushel is full of wheat the good
          corn keeps the chaff out of the measure. This is the Lord's way of
          delivering those who keep his word: thus he shuts them away from the
          temptation that comes upon others. He seems to say, "Dear child, since
          you will not go beyond my written word, you shall not be tempted to go
          beyond it. I will cause the enemies of the truth to leave you alone.
          You shall be offensive to them, or they to you, and you shall soon
          part company." Remember how Mr. Bunyan pictures it. When Talkative
          came up to gossip with Christian and Hopeful, he chattered away upon
          all sorts of topics, and they were wearied with him. To get rid of
          him, Christian said to Hopeful, "Now we will talk a little about
          experimental godliness and when they began to speak about what they
          had tasted and handled of divine truth, Mr. Chatterbox dropped behind.
          He did not like spiritual conversation, neither do any of the breed.
          The holy pilgrims were not so rude as to tell him to go; they only
          talked about heavenly things, which he did not understand, and he went
          of his own accord. I believe that result is sure to follow holy
          conversation and sound preaching. Keep to the truth, and the modern
          school will give you a wide berth. But if any of you try the
          double-shuffle in religion -- the plan of trying to believe a little
          of everything and not much of anything -- if you try to hold with the
          hare and run with the hounds, you will be tempted to deadly error, and
          it will serve you right. In the temptation you will fall, for indeed
          you are fallen already. Keep the word of God, and the word of God will
          keep you. You will be shielded from half the temptations that fret and
          worry professors if you take your place and keep it against all
          comers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or perhaps the text may mean that if the temptation shall come you
          shall be preserved from it. The deliberately-formed conviction that
          the word of God is the standard of our faith, and the unwavering habit
          of referring everything to it and standing and falling by it, may not
          deliver us from every error, but they will save us from that which is
          the nurse and matrix of every error -- that is, the habit of trusting
          to our own understanding, or relying upon the understandings of our
          fellow-men. I value more a solid confidence in the word of God than
          even the knowledge that comes out of it; for that faith is a saving
          habit, a sanctifying habit, in every way a strengthening and
          confirming and preserving habit. May God grant to us that whatever
          form of temptation may come upon the face of the earth, we may stand
          fast for his truth, so that none of us may perish like Judas, the son
          of perdition.
        </p>
        <p>
          All this I have spoken to the people of God, but I am not ignorant
          that there are some here who do not know God's word, nor love it. They
          have never embraced it, and to them no blessing can came through it.
          But why should you not receive it? Does it not strike you as being
          reasonable that, if God has spoken, his creatures ought to believe
          what he has spoken -- that after he has laid down the law there should
          remain no room for questioning?
        </p>
        <p>"This is the judge that ends the strife,</p>
        <p>When wit and reason fail."</p>
        <p>
          Come you, then, and search the Scriptures, for in them you think you
          have eternal life, and they are they which testify of Christ and let
          it not be said that you will not come unto him that you might have
          life. As God bears testimony in his word to his own dear Son, believe
          that testimony; accept the Saviour whom he has given, and find
          immediate salvation: find it to-night. Go out of the place saying, "I
          believe it." "He that believeth hath everlasting life," for "this is
          life eternal, to know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom
          thou hast sent." I warrant you if you get faith into your soul, and
          the word becomes your joy and comfort, you will never let it go. You
          will sing as we did just now, and as I sang very heartily --
        </p>
        <p>"Let all the forms that men devise</p>
        <p>Assault my soul with treacherous art</p>
