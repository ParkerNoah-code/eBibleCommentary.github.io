        <p>On Faith.</p>
        <p>
          We have collected together extracts from the Law and the Prophets
          relating to those things which have been declared concerning our Lord
          Jesus Christ, that we may prove to your love that this Being is
          perfect reason, the Word of God; He who was begotten before the light;
          He who is Creator together with the Father; He who is the Fashioner of
          man; He who is all in all; He who among the patriarchs is Patriarch;
          He who in the law is the Law; among the priests, Chief Priest; among
          kings, the Ruler; among prophets, the Prophet; among the angels,
          Archangel; in the voice of the preacher, the Word; among spirits, the
          Spirit; in the Father, the Son; in God, God; King for ever and ever.
          For this is He who was pilot to Noah; He who was guide to Abraham; He
          who was bound with Isaac; He who was in exile with Jacob; He who was
          sold with Joseph; He who was captain of the host with Moses; He who
          was the divider of the inheritance with Jesus the son of Nun; He who
          in David and the prophets announced His own sufferings; He who put on
          a bodily form in the Virgin; He who was born in Bethlehem; He who was
          wrapped in swaddling-clothes in the manger; He who was seen by the
          shepherds; He who was glorified by the angels; He who was worshipped
          by the Magi; He who was pointed out by John; He who gathered together
          the apostles; He who preached the kingdom; He who cured the lame; He
          who gave light to the blind; He who raised the dead; He who appeared
          in the temple; He who was not believed on by the people; He who was
          betrayed by Judas; He who was apprehended by the priests; He who was
          condemned by Pilate; He who was pierced in the flesh; He who was
          hanged on the tree; He who was buried in the earth; He who rose from
          the place of the dead; He who appeared to the apostles; He who was
          carried up to heaven; He who is seated at the right hand of the
          Father; He who is the repose of those that are departed; the recoverer
          of those that are lost; the light of those that are in darkness; the
          deliverer of those that are captive; the guide of those that go
          astray; the asylum of the afflicted; the bridegroom of the Church; the
          charioteer of the cherubim; the captain of the angels; God who is from
          God; the Son who is from the Father; Jesus Christ the King for
          evermore. Amen.<br />
