            <p align="justify">
              This sacred ode, which bears simply the title of "A Psalm,"
              follows fitly upon the last, and is evidently an integral part of
              the series of royal psalms. If Psalm 97 described the publication
              of the gospel, and so the setting up of the kingdom of Heaven—the
              present Psalm is a sort of Coronation Hymn, officially proclaiming
              the conquering Messiah as Monarch over the nations, with blast of
              trumpets, clapping of hands, and celebration of triumphs. It is a
              singularly bold and lively song.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              The critics have fully established the fact that similar
              expressions occur in Isaiah—but we see no force in the inference
              that therefore it was written by him; on this principle half the
              books in the English language might be attributed to Shakespeare.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              The fact is that these associated Psalms make up a mosaic, in
              which each one of them has an appropriate place, and is necessary
              to the completeness of the whole, and therefore we believe them,
              to be each and all the work of one and the same mind.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              Paul, if we understand him aright, ascribes Psalm 95 to David, and
              as we believe that the same writer must have written the whole
              group, we ascribe this also to the son of Jesse. However that may
              be, the song is worthy to rank among the most devout and soul
              stirring of sacred lyrics.

              We had a new song before (Psalm 96:1-13) because the Lord
              <i>was </i>coming—but now we have another new song because he
              <i>has </i> come, and seen and conquered. Jesus, our King, has
              lived a marvelous life, died a marvelous death, risen by a
              marvelous resurrection, and ascended marvelously into Heaven. By
              his divine power he has sent forth the Holy Spirit doing marvels,
              and by that sacred energy his disciples have also wrought
              marvelous things and astonished all the earth.

              because they are accomplished by means to all appearance most
              inadequate; they are due not to physical but to moral power—the
              energy of goodness, justice, truth; in a word, to the power of his
              holy arm. His holy influence has been the sole cause of success.
              Jesus never stoops to use policy, or brute force; his unsullied
              perfections secure to him a real and lasting victory over all the
              powers of evil, and that victory will be gained as dexterously and
              easily as when a warrior strikes his adversary with his right hand

              Even its thunders will not be too grand for such a theme. Handel,
              in some of his sublime choruses, would have been glad of its aid
              to express his lofty conceptions, and assuredly the inspired
              psalmist did well to call in such infinite uproar.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              The sea is his, let it praise its Maker. Within and upon its bosom
              it bears a wealth of goodness, why should it be denied a place in
              the orchestra of nature? Its deep bass will excellently suit the
              mystery of the divine glory.

              The land should be in harmony with the ocean. Its mountains and
              plains, cities and villages, should prolong the voice of jubilee
              which welcomes the Lord of all. Nothing can be more sublime than
              this verse; the muses of Parnassus cannot rival the muse of Zion,
              the Castallan fount never sparkled like that "fount of every
              blessing" to which sacred bands are accustomed to ascribe their
              inspiration. Yet no song is equal to the majesty of the theme when
              Jehovah, the King, is to be extolled.

              Stiller music such as made the stars twinkle with their soft kind
              eyes suited his first coming at Bethlehem—but his second advent
              calls for trumpets, for he is a judge; and for all earth's
              acclamations, for he has put on his royal splendor. The rule of
              Christ is the joy of nature. All things bless his throne, yes, and
              the very coming of it. As the dawn sets the earth weeping for joy
              at the rising of the sun, until the dewdrops stand in her eyes, so
              should the approach of Jesus' universal reign make all creation
              glad.

              This is the joy of it. No tyrant and no weakling is he, to oppress
              the good or to indulge the vain. His law is good, his action
              right, his government the embodiment of justice. If ever there was
              a thing to rejoice in upon this poor, travailing earth—it is the
              coming of such a deliverer, the ascension to the universal throne
