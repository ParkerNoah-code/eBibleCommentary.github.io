        >Their armies are far superior to mine! Their numbers are too great for
        my reckoning! Let us here recall to our memory the innumerable multitude
        which beset our Divine Redeemer. The legions of our sins, the armies of
        fiends, the crowd of bodily pains, the host of spiritual sorrows, and
        all the allies of death and hell—set themselves in battle against the
        Son of Man. O how precious to know and believe that he has routed their
        hosts, and trodden them down in his anger! They who would have troubled
        us—he has removed into captivity, and those who would have risen up
        against us—he has laid low. The dragon lost his sting when he dashed it
        into the soul of Jesus.
        <p align="justify">
          Upon this note an old writer remarks, "Let us learn from this, that in
          times of sore trouble, men will not use fine words in prayer—but will
          offer a prayer which is pruned of all luxuriance of wordy speeches."

          Thus you may plainly see how God has wrought in his church in old
          time, and therefore should not discourage yourselves for any sudden
          change; but with David, acknowledge your sins to God, declare unto him
          how many there be that vex you and rise up against you. Let the wicked
          idolaters brag that they will prevail against you and overcome you,
          and that God has given you over, and will be no more your God. Let
          them put their trust in Absalom, with his large golden locks; and in
          the wisdom of Ahithophel, the wise Counselor; yet say you, with David,
          <font color="#818100"
            >You, O Lord, are my defender, and the lifter up of my head. </font
          >Persuade yourselves, with David, that the Lord is your defender, who
          has compassed you round about, and is, as it were, a
          <font color="#818100">shield </font>that covers you on every side. It
          is he only that may and will compass you about with glory and honor.
          It is he who will thrust down those proud hypocrites from their seat,
          and exalt the lowly and meek. It is he which will
          <font color="#818100">smite </font>your "enemies on
          <font color="#818100">the cheek bone</font>," and burst all their
          teeth in sunder. He will hang up Absalom by his own long hair; and
          Ahithophel through desperation, shall hang himself. The bands shall be
          broken, and you shall be delivered; for this belongs unto the Lord, to
          save his from their enemies, and to bless his people, that they may
          safely proceed in their pilgrimage to heaven without fear.

        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Absalom's faction, like a snowball, strangely gathered in its motion.
          David speaks of it as one amazed; and well he might, that a people he
          had so many ways obliged, should almost generally revolt from him, and
          rebel against him, and choose for their head such a silly, giddy young
          fellow as Absalom was.<i> How slippery and deceitful are the many! </i
          >And how little fidelity and constancy is to be found among men! David
          had had the hearts of his subjects as much as ever any king had, and
          yet how suddenly he had lost them! As people must not trust too much
          to princes (Psalm 146:3), so princes must not build too much upon
          their interest in the people. Christ, the Son of David, had many
          enemies, when a great multitude came to seize him, when the crowd
          cried, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" how were they then increased who
          troubled him! Even good people must not think it strange if the stream
          goes against them, and the powers that threaten them grow more and
          more formidable. <i>Matthew Henry.</i>

        The lie against the saint and the libel upon his God.
        <p align="justify">
          David complains before his loving God of the worst weapon of his
          enemies' attacks, and the bitterest drop of his distresses. "Oh!" says
          David,
          <font color="#818100"
            >many there be that say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. </font
          >Some of his distrustful friends said this sorrowfully—but his enemies
          exultingly boasted of it, and longed to see their words proved by his
          total destruction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This was the most unkind cut of all, when they declared that his God
          had forsaken him. Yet David knew in his own conscience that he had
          given them some ground for this exclamation, for he had committed sin
          against God in the very light of day. Then they flung his crime with
          <i> Bathsheba </i>into his face, and they said, "Go up, you bloody
          man; God has forsaken you and left you!" Shimei cursed him, and swore
          at him to his very face, for he was bold because of his backers, since
          multitudes of the men of Belial thought of David in like fashion.
          Doubtless, David felt this infernal suggestion to be staggering to his
          faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If all the trials which come from heaven, all the temptations which
          ascend from hell, and all the crosses which arise from earth, could be
          mixed and pressed together—they would not make a trial so terrible as
          that which is contained in this verse. It is the most bitter of all
          afflictions to be led to fear that God will never rescue us! And yet
          remember our most blessed Savior had to endure this in the deepest
          degree when he cried, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" He
          knew full well what is was to walk in darkness and to see no light.
          This was the curse of the curse. This was the wormwood mingled with
          the gall. To be deserted by his Father—was worse than to be the
          despised of men. Surely we should love him who suffered this bitterest
          of temptations and trials for our sake. It will be a delightful and
          instructive exercise for the loving heart to mark the Lord in his
          agonies as here portrayed, for there is here, and in very many other
          Psalms—far more of David's Lord than of David himself!

          When the believer questions the power of God, or his interest in it,
          his joy gushes out as blood out of a broken vein. This verse is a sore

        <p align="justify">
          A child of God startles at the very thought of despairing of help from
          God; you cannot vex him with anything so much as if you persuade him
          that,
          <font color="#818100">There is no help for him in God. </font>David
          comes to God, and tells him what his enemies said of him, as Hezekiah
          spread Rabshakeh's blasphemous letter before the Lord; they say,
          <i> "There is no help for me in you;" </i>but, Lord, if it is so, I am
          undone. They say to my soul, <i>"There is no salvation" </i>(for so
          the word is) <i> "for him in God;" </i>but, Lord, do you say unto my
          soul, <i>"I am your salvation" </i>(Psalm 35:3), and that shall
          satisfy me, and in due time silence them. <i>Matthew Henry.</i>
        </p>
        <font color="#818100"> <p align="justify">Selah.</p></font>This is a
        musical pause; the precise meaning of which is not known. Some think it
        simply a <i>rest</i>, a <i> pause </i>in the music; others say it means,
        "Lift up the strain—sing more loudly—pitch the tune upon a higher
        key—there is nobler matter to come, therefore retune your harps!"
        <i>Harp </i>strings soon get out of order and need to be adjusted to
        their proper tightness, and certainly our <i>heart </i>strings are
        evermore getting out of tune, Let "Selah" teach us to pray,<br />
        "O may my heart in tune be found <br />
        Like David's harp of solemn sound."
        <p align="justify">
          At least we may learn that wherever we see "Selah," we should look
          upon it as a note of <i>observation</i>. Let us read the passage which
          precedes and follows it with greater earnestness, for surely there is
          always something excellent where we are required to rest and pause and
          meditate, or when we are required to lift up our hearts in grateful
          song. "SELAH."
        </p>
        <font color="#818100"> <p align="justify">Selah.</p></font>Much has been
        written on this word, and still its meaning does not appear to be wholly
        determined.<i> </i>The word occurs seventy-three times in the Psalms,
        and three times in the book of Habakkuk. It is never translated in our
        version—but in all these places the original word <i>Selah </i>is
        retained. It occurs only in poetry, and is supposed to have had some
        reference to the singing of the poetry, and to be probably a musical
        term. In general, also, it indicates a <i>pause </i>in the sense, as
        well as in the musical performance. Gesenius supposes that the most
        probable meaning of this musical term or note is <i>silence </i>or
        <i> pause</i>, and that its use was, in chanting the words of the Psalm,
        to direct the singer <i>to be silent, to pause a little</i>, while the
        instruments played an interlude or harmony. Perhaps this is all that can
        now be known of the meaning of the word, and this is enough to satisfy
        every reasonable enquiry. It is probable, if this was the use of the
        term, that it would commonly correspond with the sense of the passage,
        and be inserted where the sense made a pause suitable; and this will
        doubtless be found usually to be the fact. <i>Albert Barnes, </i>1868.

          <font color="#818100">You, O Lord, are a <i>shield </i>for me. </font
          >The word in the original signifies more than a shield; it means a
          buckler round about, a protection which shall surround a man entirely,
          a shield above, beneath, around, without and within. Oh! what a shield
          is God for his people! He wards off the fiery darts of Satan from
          beneath, and the storms of trials from above, while, at the same
          instant, he speaks peace to the tempest within the bosom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          You are <font color="#818100">my glory. </font>David knew that though
          he was driven from his capital in contempt and scorn, he would yet
          return in triumph, and by faith he looks upon God as honoring and
          glorifying him. O for grace to see our future glory—amid present
          shame! Indeed, there is a present glory in our afflictions, if we
          could but discern it; for it is no small thing to have fellowship with
          Christ in his sufferings. David was honored when he made the ascent of
          Olivet, weeping, with his head covered; for he was in all this made
          like unto his Lord. May we learn, in this respect, to glory in
          tribulations also!

        is contained in this verse! —defense for the defenseless, glory for the
        despised, and joy for the comfortless. Truly we may well say, "there is
        none like the God of Jeshurun."

        There is a lifting up of the head by elevating to office, as with
        Pharaoh's butler; this we trace to the divine appointment. There is a
        lifting up in honor after shame, in health after sickness, in gladness
        after sorrow, in restoration after a fall, in victory after a temporary
        defeat; in all these respects the Lord is the lifter up of our head.

        <font color="#818100">I cried unto the Lord with my voice</font>. Why
        does he say, "with my voice?" Surely, silent prayers are heard. Yes—but
        good men often find that, even in secret, they pray better aloud than
        they do when they utter no vocal sound. Perhaps, moreover, David would
        think thus, "My cruel enemies clamor against me; they lift up their
        voices, and, behold, I lift up mine, and my cry outsoars them all." They
        clamor—but the cry of my voice in great distress pierces the very skies,
        and is louder and stronger than all their tumult; for there is one in
        the sanctuary who harkens to me from the seventh heaven, and he has
        <font color="#818100">heard me out of his holy hill. </font>Answers to

        often heard persons say in prayer, "You are a prayer hearing and a

        excellent divine has well remarked, "This quietude of a man's heart by
        faith in God, is a higher sort of work than the natural resolution of
        manly courage, for it is the gracious operation of God's Holy Spirit
        upholding a man above nature, and therefore the Lord must have all the
        glory of it."
        <p align="justify">
          Would you be secured in evil times? Get grace and fortify this
          garrison; a good conscience is a Christian's fort royal. David's
          enemies lay round about him; yet, says he,
          <font color="#818100">I laid me down and slept. </font>A good
          conscience can sleep in the mouth of a cannon; grace is a Christian's
          coat of armor, which fears not the arrow or bullet. True grace may be
          shot at—but can never be shot through; grace puts the soul into
          Christ, and there it is safe, as the bee in the hive, as the dove in

          in the midst of them—yet shall they not hurt me; I shall be free in my

        >The psalmist will trust, <i>despite appearances. </i>He will not be
        afraid though ten thousands of people have set themselves against him
        round about. Let us here limit our thoughts to this one idea, "despite
        appearances." What could look worse to human sight than this array of
        ten thousands of people? Ruin seemed to stare him in the face; wherever
        he looked an enemy was to be seen. What was one against ten thousand? It
        often happens that God's people come into circumstances like this; they
        say, "All these things are against me!" They seem scarcely able to count
        their troubles; they cannot see a loophole through which to escape;
        things look very black indeed; it is great faith and trust which says
        under these circumstances, "I will not be afraid."

          At such seasons as these, the reasonable men of the world, those who
          walk by <i>sight </i>and not by <i>faith</i>, will think it reasonable
          enough that the Christian should be afraid. Weak believers are now
          ready to make excuses for us, and we are only too ready to make them
          for ourselves; instead of rising above the weakness of the flesh, we
          take refuge under it, and use it as an excuse. But let us think
          prayerfully for a little while, and we shall see that it should not be
          thus with us. To trust only when appearances are favorable, is to sail
          only with the wind and tide, to believe only when we can see. Oh! let
          us follow the example of the psalmist, and seek that unreservedness of
          faith which will enable us to trust God, come what will, and to say as
          he said,

          David's only hope is in his God—but that is so strong a confidence,
          that he feels the Lord has but to <i>arise—</i>and he is saved. It is
          enough for the Lord to stand up, and all is well. He compares his
          <i> enemies </i>to wild beasts, and he declares that God has broken
          their jaws, so that they could not injure him;

          him with their mouths; God has broken their teeth, and let them say
          what they will, their toothless jaws shall not be able to devour him.

        <font color="#818100">Salvation belongs to the Lord</font>. This verse
        contains the sum and substance of Calvinistic doctrine. Search Scripture
        through, and you must, if you read it with a candid mind, be persuaded
        that the doctrine of salvation by grace alone is the great doctrine of
        the word of God. This is a point concerning which we are daily fighting.
        Our opponents say, "Salvation belongs to the free will of man; if not to
        man's merit—yet at least to man's will." But we hold and teach that
        salvation from first to last, in every iota of it, belongs to the Most
        High God. It is God who <i>chooses </i>his people. He <i> calls </i>them
        by his grace; he <i>quickens </i>them by his Spirit, and
        <i> keeps </i>them by his power. It is not of man, neither by man; "not
        of him that wills, nor of him that runs—but of God who shows mercy." May
        we all learn this truth experimentally, for our proud flesh and blood
        will never permit us to learn it in any other way.
        <p align="justify">
          In the last sentence the peculiarity and speciality of salvation are
          plainly stated:
          <font color="#818100">Your blessing is upon your people. </font
          >Neither upon Egypt, nor upon Tyre, nor upon Nineveh; your blessing is
          upon your chosen, your blood—bought, your everlastingly beloved
          people.
        </p>
        <font color="#818100"> <p align="justify">Selah:</p></font>Lift up your
        hearts, and pause, and meditate upon this doctrine! "Your blessing is
        upon your people." Divine, discriminating, distinguishing, eternal,
        infinite, immutable love, is a subject for constant adoration. Pause, my
        soul, at this <i>Selah</i>, and consider your own interest in the
        salvation of God; and if by humble faith you are enabled to see Jesus as
        your by his own free gift of himself to you, if this greatest of all
        blessings be upon you, rise up and sing,
        <p align="justify">
          "Rise, my soul! adore and wonder! <br />
          Ask, 'O why such love to me?' <br />
          Grace has put me in the number <br />
          Of the Savior's family!<br />
          Hallelujah! Thanks, eternal thanks, to Thee!"

          <p align="justify">Salvation belongs to the Lord.</p></font
        >There is a parallel passage in Jonah 2:9,
        <i>"Salvation is of the Lord." </i>The mariners might have written upon
        their ship, instead of Castor and Pollux, or the like device,
        <i>Salvation is the Lord's; </i>the Ninevites might have written upon
        their gates, <i>Salvation is the Lord's!</i> It is the argument of both
        the Testaments, the staff and support of heaven and earth. They would
        both sink, and all their joints be severed, if salvation was not of the
        Lord.

        >The saints are blessed before they are crowned. This seems a paradox to
        flesh and blood. What, reproached and maligned—yet blessed! A man that
        looks upon the children of God with a carnal eye, and sees how they are
        afflicted, and like the ship in the gospel, which was covered with waves
        (Mt 8:24), would think they were far from blessedness. Paul brings a
        catalogue of his sufferings (2 Co 11:24-26), "Thrice was I beaten with
        rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck," etc. And those
        Christians of the first magnitude, of whom the world was not worthy,
        "Had trials of cruel mockings and scourgings, they were sawn asunder,
        they were slain with the sword." Heb 11:36,37. What! and were all these
        during the time of their sufferings, blessed? A carnal man would think,
        if this be to be blessed—then God deliver him from it. But, however
        sense would give their vote, our Savior Christ pronounces the godly man
        blessed; though a mourner, though a martyr—yet blessed. Job on the
        ash-heap was blessed Job. The saints are blessed when they are cursed.
        Shimei did curse David (2 Sa 16:5), "He came forth and cursed him;" yet
        when he was <i>cursed </i>David—he was <i>blessed </i>David. The saints
        though they are <i>bruised</i>—yet they are <i>blessed</i>. Not only
        they <i>shall </i>be blessed—but they <i>are </i>so. Psalm 119:1.
        "Blessed <i>are </i>the undefiled." Psalm 3:8. "Your blessing
        <i>is </i>upon your people." <i>Thomas Watson. </i>
        <p align="justify">
          Salvation of God from first to last. They were blessed
          <i> in </i>Christ, <i>through </i>Christ, and shall be blessed
          <i>with </i> Christ. The blessing rests upon their persons, comforts,
          trials, labors, families, etc. It flows from grace, is enjoyed by
          faith, and is insured by oath, etc.
