          The inspired penman of this psalm, whoever he was, in exhorting the
          Jews to praise God in solemn assembly, states two grounds why God
          should be praised; the one, that he sustains by his power the world
          which he created, the other, that he had of his free grace adopted the
          Church into a gracious relationship with himself. As many take God's
          praises into their lips in a hypocritical manner, he exhorts the
          people at the same time to be sincere, serious, and devoted in the
          service, and to show by the tenor of their life that they had not been
          chosen in vain. The more effectually to guard them against hypocrisy,
          he mentions that their fathers from the beginning had been of a
          stubborn spirit, and chargeable with ingratitude to God; and he takes
          notice of the dreadful punishment which fell upon them, and which
          might well deter their children from following in the footsteps of
          their rebelliousness.
