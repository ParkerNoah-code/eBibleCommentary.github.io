        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.53)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, November 11, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds." --
          Psalm 147:3.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next verse finely declares the power of God. "He telleth the
          number of the stars; he calleth them by their names." Perhaps there is
          nothing which gives us a nobler view of the greatness of God than a
          contemplation of the starry heavens. When by night we lift up our eyes
          and behold him who hath created all these things; when we remember
          that he bringeth out their host by number, calleth them all by their
          names, and that by the greatness of his power not one falleth, then
          indeed we adore a mighty God, and our soul naturally falls prostrate
          in reverential awe before the throne of him who leads the host of
          heaven, and marshals the stars in their armies. But the Psalmist has
          here placed another fact side by side with this wondrous act of God;
          he declares that the same God who leadeth the stars, who telleth the
          number of them, and calleth them by their names, healeth the broken in
          heart and bindeth up their wounds. The next time you rise to some idea
          of God, by viewing the starry floor of his magnificent temple above,
          strive to compel your contemplation to this thought, that the same
          mighty hand which rolls the stars along, puts liniments around the
          wounded heart; that the same being who spoke worlds into existence,
          and now impels those ponderous globes through their orbits, does in
          his mercy cheer the wounded, and heal the broken in heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will not delay you by a preface, but will come at once to the two
          thoughts: first, here is a great ill -- a broken heart; and secondly,
          a great mercy -- "he healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their
          wounds."
        </p>
        <p>
          Man is a double being: he is composed of body and soul, and each of
          the portions of man may receive injury and hurt. The wounds of the
          body are extremely painful, and if they amount to a breaking of the
          frame the torture is singularly exquisite. Yet God has in his mercy
          provided means whereby wounds may be healed and injuries repaired. The
          soldier who retires from the battle-field, knows that he shall find a
          hand to extricate the shot, and certain ointments and liniments to
          heal his wounds. We very speedily care for bodily diseases; they are
          too painful to let us slumber in silence: and they soon urge us to
          seek a physician or a surgeon for our healing. Oh, if we were as much
          alive to the more serious wounds of our inner man; if we were as
          deeply sensible of spiritual injuries, how earnestly should we cry to
          "the Beloved Physician," and how soon should we prove his power to
          save. Stabbed in the most vital part by the hand of our original
          parent, and from head to foot disabled by our own sin, we yet remain
          insensible as steel, careless and unmoved, because, though our wounds
          are known they are not felt. We should count that soldier foolish, who
          would be more anxious to repair a broken helmet than an injured limb.
          Are not we even more to be condemned, when we give precedence to the
          perishing fabric of the body, and neglect the immortal soul? You,
          however, who have broken hearts, can no longer be insensible; you have
          felt too acutely to slumber in indifference. Your bleeding spirit
          cries for consolation: may my glorious Master give me a word in season
          for you. We intend to address you upon the important subject of broken
          hearts, and the great healing provided for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Let us commence with THE GREAT ILL -- a broken heart. What is it?
          We reply, there are several forms of a broken heart. Some are what we
          shall call naturally broken, and some are spiritually so. We will
          occupy a moment by mentioning certain forms of this evil, naturally
          considered; and verily our task would be a dreary one, if we were
          called upon to witness one tithe of the misery endured by those who
          suffer from a broken heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          There have been hearts broken by desertion. A wife has been neglected
          by her husband who was once the subject of her attachment, and whom
          even now she tenderly loves. Scorned and despised by the man who once
          lavished upon her every token of his affection, she has known what a
          broken heart means. A friend is forsaken by one upon whom he leaned,
          to whose very soul he was knit, so that their two hearts had grown
          into one; and he feels that his heart is broken, for the other half of
          himself is severed from him. When Ahithophel forsakes David, when the
          kind friend unto whom we have always told our sorrows betrays our
          confidence, the consequence may possibly be a broken heart. The
          desertion of a man by his fellows, the ingratitude of children to
          their parents, the unkindness of parents to their children, the
          betrayal of secrets by a comrade, the changeableness and fickleness of
          friends, with other modes of desertion which happen in this world,
          have brought about broken hearts. We know not a more fruitful source
          of broken hearts than disappointment in the objects of our affections
          -- to find that we have been deceived where we have placed our
          confidence. It is not simply that we leaned upon a broken reed, and
          the reed has snapped -- that were bad enough -- but in the fall we
          fell upon a thorn which pierced our hearts to its center. Many have
          there been who have gone to their graves, not smitten by disease, not
          slain by the sword, but with a far direr wound that the sword could
          ever give, a more desperate death than poison could ever cause. May
          you never know such agony.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have also seen hearts broken by bereavement. We have known tender
          wives who have laid their husbands in the tomb, and who have stood by
          the grave-side until their very heart did break for solitary anguish.
          We have seen parents bereaved of their beloved offspring one after
          another; and when they have been called to hear the solemn
          words,"Earth to earth, dust to dust, ashes to ashes," over the last of
          their children, they have turned away from the grave, bidding adieu to
          joy, longing for death, and abhorring life. To such the world becomes
          a prison, cheerless, cold, unutterably miserable. The owl and bittern
          seem alone to sympathize with them, an aught of joy in the wide world
          appears to be but intended as a mockery to their misery. Divine grace,
          however, can sustain them even here.
        </p>
        <p>
          How frequently might this be supposed to occur to our brave countrymen
          engaged in the present war. Do not they feel, and feel acutely, the
          loss of their comrades? You will perhaps imagine that the slaughter
          and death around them prevent the tender feelings of nature. You are
          enough mistaken, if so you dream. The soldier's heart may never know
          fear, but it has not forgotten sympathy. The fearful struggle around
          renders it impossible to pay the usual court and homage at the gates
          of sorrow, but there is more of real grief ofttimes in the hurried
          midnight funeral than in the flaunting pageantry of your pompous
          processions. Were it in our power to walk among the tents, we should
          find abundant need to use the words of our text by way of cordial to
          many a warrior who has seen all his chosen companions fall before the
          destroyer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, ye mourners! seek ye a balm for your wounds -- let me proclaim it
          unto you. Ye are not ignorant of it, I trust, but let me apply that in
          which you already place your confidence. The God of heaven knows your
          sorrows, repair you to his throne, and tell your simple tale of woe.
          Then cast your burden on him, he will bear it -- open your heart
          before him, he will heal it. Think not that you are beyond hope. You
          would be if there were no God of love and pity; but while Jehovah
          lives, the mourner need not despair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Penury has also contributed its share to the number of the army of
          misery. Pinching want, a noble desire to walk erect, without the
          crutch of charity, and inability to obtain employment, have at times
          driven men to desperate measures. Many a goodly cedar hath withered
          for lack of moisture, and so hath many a man pined away beneath the
          deprivations of extreme poverty. Those who are blessed with
          sufficiency can scarcely guess the pain endured by the sons of want,
          especially if they have once been rich. Yet, oh! child of suffering,
          be thou patient, God has not passed thee over in his providence.
          Feeder of sparrows, he will also furnish you with what you need. Sit
          not down in despair; hope on, hope ever. Take up arms against a sea of
          troubles, and your opposition shall yet end your distresses. There is
          One who careth for you. One eye is fixed on you, even in the home of
          your destitution, one heart beats with pity for your woes, and a hand
          omnipotent shall yet stretch you out the needed help. The darkest
          cloud shall yet scatter itself in its season, the blackest gloom shall
          have its morning. He, if thou art one of his family, with bands of
          grace will bind up thy wounds, and heal thy broken heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiplied also are the cares where disappointment and defeat have
          crushed the spirits. The soldier fighting for his country may see the
          ranks broken, but he will not be broken in heart, so long as there
          remains a single hope for victory. His comrade reels behind him, and
          he himself is wounded, but with a shout he cries, "On! on!" and scales
          the ramparts. Sword in hand, still he goes, carrying terror among the
          foe, himself sustained by the prospect of victory. But let him once
          hear the shout of defeat where he hoped for triumph; let him know that
          the banner is stained in the earth, that the eagle has been snatched
          from the standard; let him once hear it said, "They fly, they fly!"
          let him see the officers and soldiers flying in confusion; let him be
          well assured that the most heroic courage and the most desperate valor
          are of no avail, then his heart bursteth under a sense of dishonor,
          and he is almost content to die because the honor of his country has
          been tarnished, and her glory has been stained in the dust. Of this,
          the soldiers of Britain know but little -- may they speedily carve out
          a peace for us with their victorious swords! Truly, in the great
          conflict of life we can bear any thing but defeat. Toils on toils
          would we endure to climb a summit, but if we must die ere we reach it,
          that were a brokenness of heart indeed. To accomplish the object on
          which we have set our minds, we would spend our very heart's blood;
          but once let us see that our life's purpose is not to be accomplished;
          let us, when we hope to grasp the crown, see that it is withdrawn, or
          other hands have seized it, then cometh brokenness of heart. But let
          us remember, whether we have been broken in heart by penury or by
          defeat, that there is a hand which "bindeth up the broken in heart,
          and healeth all their wounds;" that even these natural breakings are
          regarded by Jehovah, who, in the plenitude of his mercy, giveth a balm
          for every wound to every one of his people. We need not ask, "Is there
          no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there?" There is a balm,
          there is a physician who can heal all these natural wounds, who can
          give joy to the troubled countenance, take the furrow from the brow,
          wipe the tear from the eye, remove the agitation from the bosom, and
          calm the heart now swelling with grief; for he "healeth the broken in
          heart, and bindeth up their wounds."
        </p>
        <p>
          But all that we have mentioned of woe and sorrow which the natural
          heart endures, is not sufficient to explain our text. The heart
          broken, not by distress or disappointment, but on account of sin, is
          the heart which God peculiarly delights to heal. All other sufferings
          may find a fearful center in one breast, and yet the subject of them
          may be unpardoned and unsaved; but if the heart be broken by the Holy
          Ghost for sin, salvation will be its ultimate issue, and heaven its
          result. At the time of regeneration, the soul is subject to an inward
          work, causing at the time considerable suffering. This suffering does
          not continue after the soul has learned the preciousness of a
          Saviour's blood; but while it lasts it produces an effect which is
          never forgotten in after life. Let none suppose that the pains we are
          about to describe are the constant companions of an heir of heaven
          during his entire existence. They are like the torture of a great
          drunkard at the time of his reformation, rendered needful, not by the
          reformation, but by his old habits. So this broken heart is felt at
          the time of that change of which the Bible speaks, when it says:
          "Except a man be born again, he can not see the kingdom of God." The
          fruit of the Spirit is afterwards joy and peace; but for a season we
          must, if saved, endure much mental agony.
        </p>
        <p>
          Are any of you at the present moment disturbed in mind, and vexed in
          spirit, because you have violated the commands of God? And are you
          anxious to know whether these feelings are tokens of genuine
          brokenness and contrition? Hear me, then, while I briefly furnish you
          with tests whereby you may discern the truth and value of your
          repentance.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. We can not conceive it possible that you are broken in heart if the
          pleasures of the world are your delight. We may consent to call you
          amiable, estimable, and honorable, even should you mix somewhat in the
          amusements of life; but it would be a treason to your common sense to
          tell you that such things are consistent with a broken heart. Will any
          venture to assert that you gay reveler has a broken heart? Would he
          not consider it an insult should you suggest it? Does the libidinous
          song now defiling the ear proceed from the lips of a broken-hearted
          sinner? Can the fountain, when filled with sorrow, send forth such
          streams as these? No, my friends; the wanton, the libidinous, the
          rioting, and the profane, are too wise to lay claim to the title of
          broken-hearted persons, seeing that their claim would be palpably
          absurd. They scorn the name, as mean and paltry, unworthy of a man who
          loves free living, and counts religion cant.
        </p>
        <p>
          But should there be one of you so entirely deceived by the evil spirit
          as to think yourself a partaker in the promises, while you are living
          in the lusts of the flesh, let me solemnly warn you of your error. He
          who sincerely repents of sin will hate it, and find no pleasure in it;
          and during the season when his heart is broken, he will loathe, even
          to detestation, the very approach of evil. The song of mirth will then
          be as a dirge in his ear. "As he that poureth vinegar upon niter, so
          is he that singeth songs to a sad heart." If the man who makes merry
          with sin be broken-hearted, he must be a prince of hypocrites, for he
          feigns to be worse than he is. We know right well that the wounded
          spirit requires other cordials than this world can afford. A soul
          disturbed by guilt must be lulled to a peaceful rest by other music
          than carnal pleasures can afford it. The tavern, the house of vice,
          and the society of the profligate, are no more to be endured by a
          contrite soul than the jostling of a crowd by a wounded man.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Again, we will not for one moment allow that a self-righteous man
          can have a broken heart. Ask him to pray, and he thanks God that he is
          every way correct. What need has he to weep because of the iniquity of
          his life? for he firmly believes himself to be well-deserving, and far
          enough removed from guilt. He has attended his religious duties; he is
          exceedingly strict in the form of his devotions; or if he cares not
          for such things, he is, at any rate, quite as good as those who do. He
          was never in bondage to any man, but can look to heaven without a tear
          for his sin. Do not conceive that I am painting an imaginary case, for
          there are unfortunately too many of these proud, self-exalting men.
          Will they be angry with me when I tell them that they are no nearer
          heaven than those whom we reproved a few moments ago? or will they not
          be equally moved to wrath if I were so much as to hint that they need
          to be broken in heart for their sin? Nevertheless, such is the case;
          and Pharisees shall one day learn with terror, that self
          -righteousness is hateful to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what is a broken heart? I say, first, that a broken heart implies
          a very deep and poignant sorrow on account of sin. A heart broken --
          conceive of that. If you could look within and see every thing going
          on in this great mystery called man, you would marvel at the wonders
          thereof; but how much more astonished would you be to see its heart
          not merely divided in twain, but split into atoms. You would exclaim,
          "What misery must have done this! What a heavy blow must have fallen
          here!" By nature the heart is of one solid piece, hard as a nether
          millstone; but when God smites it, it is broken to pieces in deep
          suffering. Some will understand me when I describe the state of the
          man who is feeling a sorrow for sin. In the morning he bends his knee
          in prayer, but he feels afraid to pray. He thinks it is blasphemy for
          him to venture near God's throne; and when he does pray at all, he
          rises with the thought: "God can not hear me, for he heareth not
          sinners." He goes about his business, and is, perhaps, a little
          diverted; but at every interval the same black thoughts roll upon him:
          "Thou art condemned already." Mark his person and appearance. A
          melancholy has rested upon him. At night he goes home, but there is
          little enjoyment for him in the household. He may smile, but his smile
          ill conceals the grief which lurks underneath. When again he bends the
          knee, he fears the shadows of the night; he dreads to be on his bed,
          lest it should be his tomb; and if he lies awake, he thinks of death,
          the second death, damnation, and destruction; or if he dreams, he
          dreams of demons, and flames of hell. He wakes again, and almost feels
          the torture of which he dreamed. He wishes in the morning it were
          evening, and at evening it were light. "I loathe my daily food," says
          he: "I care for nothing; for I have not Christ. I have not mercy, I
          have not peace." He has set off running on the road to heaven, and he
          puts his fingers in his ears, and will hear of nothing else. Tell him
          of a ball or concert! -- it is nothing to him. He can enjoy nothing.
          You might put him in a heaven, and it would be a hell to him. Not the
          chants of the redeemed, not the hallelujahs of the glorified, not the
          hymns of flaming cherubs, would charm woe out of this man, so long as
          he is the subject of a broken heart. Now, I do not say that all must
          have the same amount of suffering before they arrive at heaven. I am
          speaking of some who have this especial misery of heart on account of
          sin. They are utterly miserable. As Bunyan has said: "They are
          considerably tumbled up and down in their souls." And conceive, that
          "as the Lord their God liveth, there is but a step between themselves
          and eternal death." Oh, blessings on the Lord forever! if any of you
          are in that condition, here is the mercy! Though this wound be not
          provided for in earthly pharmacy, though there be found no physician
          who can heal it, yet "he healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up
          their wounds." It is a blessing to have a broken heart at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, when a man has a broken heart, he not only feels sorrow for
          sin, but he feel himself utterly unable to get rid of it. He who
          believes himself able to save himself has never known the meaning of a
          broken heart. Those who imagine that reformation can atone for the
          past, or secure righteousness for the future, are not yet savingly
          brought to know themselves. No, my friends, we must be humbled in the
          dust, and made to look for all in Christ, or else we shall be deceived
          after all. But are you driven out of yourself; are you like the
          wounded soldier crying for some one else to carry you to the hospital
          of mercy, and longing for the aid of a mightier than yourself? then be
          of good cheer, there shall be found a great deliverance for you. So
          long as you trust in ceremonies, prayers, or good works, you shall not
          fine eternal grace; but when stripped of all strength and power, you
          shall gain a glorious salvation in the Lord Jesus. If morality can
          join the pieces of a broken heart, the cement shall soon cease to
          bind, and the man shall again be as vile as ever. We must have a new
          heart and a right spirit, or vain will be all our hopes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Need I give any other description of the character I desire to
          comfort. I trust you are discovered. Oh! my poor brother, I grieve to
          see thee in distress, but there is pardon through Jesus -- there is
          forgiveness even for thee. What though your sins lie like a millstone
          on your shoulder, they shall not sink you down to hell. Arise! He, my
          gracious Lord, calleth thee. Throw thyself at his feet, and lose thy
          griefs in his loving and cheering words. Thou art saved if thou canst
          say,
        </p>
        <p>"A guilty, weak, and helpless worm,</p>
        <p>On Christ's kind arms I fall;</p>
        <p>He is my strength and righteousness,</p>
        <p>My Jesus, and my all."</p>
        <p>
          II. We have spoken a long time on the great ill of a broken heart; our
          second thought will be the GREAT MERCY -- "He healeth the broken in
          heart."
        </p>
        <p>
          First, he only does it. Men may alleviate suffering, they may console
          the afflicted and cheer the distressed; but they can not heal the
          broken in heart, nor bind up their wounds. It is not human eloquence,
          or mortal wisdom; it is not the oration of an Apollos, nor the
          wondrous words of a prince of preachers; it is the "still small voice
          " of God which alone confers the "peace which passeth all
          understanding." The binding of the heart is a thing done immediately
          by God, ofttimes without any instrumentality whatever; and when
          instrumentality is used, it is always in such a way that the man does
          not extol the instrument, but renders grateful homage to God. In
          breaking hearts, God uses man continually; repeated fiery sermons, and
          terrible denunciations do break men's hearts; but you will bear me
          witness when your hearts were healed God only did it. You value the
          minister that broke you heart; but it is not often that we ascribe the
          healing to any instrumentality whatever. The act of justification is
          generally apart from all means: God only does it. I know not the man
          who uttered the words that were the means of relieving my heart: "Look
          unto me and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth." I do not
          recollect what he said in the sermon, and I am sure I do not care to
          know. I found Jesus there and then, and that was enough for me. When
          you get your wounds healed, even under a minister, it seems as if it
          were not the minister who spoke; you never heard him speak like it in
          all you life before. You say, "I have often heard him with pleasure,
          but he has outdone himself; before, he spoke to my ear, but now, to my
          heart. We are some of us rejoicing in the liberty of Christ, and
          walking in all the joy of the Spirit; but it is to God we owe our
          deliverance, and we are grateful neither to man nor book, so much as
          to the great Physician who has taken pity on us. O that Jesus would
          walk through this Bethesda now. O, poor, sick dying man! does guilt
          weigh heavy on thy soul, turn not to any helper, save to him that
          sitteth on the throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he only can do it. I defy any of my brethren to bind up a broken
          heart. I have often labored to do it, but could never effect it. I
          have said a word to console the mourner, but I have felt that I have
          done but little, or have perhaps put the wrong mixture in the cup. He
          only can do it. Some of you seek mercy through baptism, or the Lord's
          Supper, or regular attendance at the house of prayer. Some of you,
          again, have certain forms and observances to which you attach saving
          value. As the Lord liveth, none of these things bind up the broken in
          heart apart from the Holy Spirit; they are empty wind and air; you may
          have them and be lost. You can have no peace and comfort unless you
          have immediate dealings with God, who alone, as the great Physician,
          healeth the broken in heart. Ah! there are some of you who go to your
          ministers with broken hearts, and say, "What shall I do?" I have heard
          of a preacher who told his anxious hearer, "You are getting
          melancholy; you had better go to such and such a place of amusement;
          you are getting too dreary and melancholy by half." O, to think of a
          nurse in a hospital administering poison, when she ought to be giving
          the true medicine! If he deserves to be hung who mixes poison with his
          drugs, how much more guilty is that man who tells a soul to seek for
          happiness where there is none, who sends it to a carnal world for joy,
          when there is none to be found except in God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then again, God only may do it. Suppose we could heal your broken
          heart, it would be good for nothing. I do beseech the Lord that I may
          never get a broken heart healed, except it is by God. A
          truly-convinced sinner will always rather keep his heart broken than
          have it healed wrongly. I ask you, who are suffering, whether you
          would not rather keep your broken heart as it is, than allow a bad
          physician to cure it for you, and so deceive you, and send you to hell
          at last? I know your cry is, "Lord, let me know the worst of my case;
          use the lancet; do not be afraid of hurting me; let me feel it all;
          cut the proud-flesh away rather than let it remain." But there are not
          a few who get their wounds glossed over by some pretended good works
          or duties. O, my hearer, let no man deceive you! Be not content with a
          name to live while you are really dead. Bad money may pass on earth,
          but genuine gold alone will be received in heaven. Can you abide the
          fire?
        </p>
        <p>
          In vain your presumption when God shall come to examine you; you will
          not pass muster unless you have had a real healing from his hand. It
          is easy enough to get religious notions and fancy yourself safe, but a
          real saving work is the work of God, and God alone. Seek not to the
          priest; he may console, but it is by deluding you. Seek not to your
          own self; for you may soothe yourself into the sleep of perdition. See
          that thine heart be washed in the blood of Jesus; be careful that the
          Holy Spirit has his temple in it; and may God, of his great and
          sovereign grace, look to thee that thou deceivest not thyself.
        </p>
        <p>
          But next, God will do it. That is a sweet thought. "He healeth the
          broken in heart;" he WILL do it. Nobody else can; nobody else may; but
          he WILL. Is thy heart broken? He WILL heal it; he is sure to heal it;
          for it is written -- and it can never be altered, for what was true
          three thousand years ago, is true now -- "he healeth the broken in
          heart." Did Saul of Tarsus rejoice after three days of blindness? Yes,
          and you shall be delivered also. O, it is a theme for eternal
          gratitude, that the same God who in his loftiness and omnipotence
          stooped down in olden times to soothe, cherish, relieve, and bless the
          mourner, is even now taking his journeys of mercy among the penitent
          sons of men. O, I beseech him to come where thou art sitting, and put
          his hand inside thy soul, and if he finds there a broken heart to bind
          it up. Poor sinner, breathe thy wish to him; let thy sigh come before
          him, for "he healeth the broken in heart." There thou liest wounded on
          the plain. "Is there no physician?" thou criest; "is there none?"
          Around thee lie thy fellow-sufferers, but they are helpless as
          thyself. Thy mournful cry cometh back without an answer, and space
          alone hears thy groan. Ah! the battle-field of sin has one kind
          visitor; it is not abandoned to the vultures of remorse and despair. I
          hear footsteps approaching; they are the gentle footsteps of Jehovah.
          In his hands there are no thunders, in his eyes no anger, on his lips
          no threatening. See how he bows himself over the mangled heart! Hear
          how he speaks! "Come, now, and let us reason together," saith the
          Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;
          though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool." And if the
          patient dreads to look in the face of the mighty being who addresses
          him, the same loving mouth whispers, "I, even I, am he that blotteth
          out thy transgressions, for my names sake." See how he washes every
          wound with sacred water from the side of Jesus; mark how he spreads
          the ointment of forgiving grace, and binds around each wound the fair
          white linen, which is the righteousness of saints. Doth the mourner
          faint under the operation? he puts a cordial to his lips, exclaiming,
          "I have loved thee with an everlasting love." Yes, it is true -- most
          true -- neither dream nor fiction, "HE HEALETH THE BROKEN IN HEART,
          AND BINDETH UP THEIR WOUNDS."
        </p>
        <p>
          How condescending is the Lord of heaven, thus to visit poor forlorn
          man. The queen has kindly visited the hospitals of our soldiers to
          cheer, by her royal words, her loyal defenders, by this she has done
          herself honor, and her soldiers love her for it. But when the God of
          the whole earth, the infinite Creator, stoops to become a servant to
          his own creatures, can you conceive the majestic condescension which
          bows itself in mercy over the miserable heart, and with loving finger
          closes the gaping wounds of the spirit. Oh, sin-sick sinner! the King
          of heaven will not despise thee, but thou too shalt find him thy
          Comforter, who healeth all thy diseases. Mark, moreover, how tenderly
          he does it. You remember that passage in the Psalms: "Loving kindness
          and tender mercies." God's mercies are "tender mercies;" when he
          undertakes to bind up the broken in heart, he always uses the softest
          liniment. He is not like your army surgeon, who hurries along and says
          "A leg off here, an arm off there;" but he comes gently and
          sympathizingly. He does not use roughness with us; but with downy
          fingers he putteth the wound together, and layeth the plaster on; yea,
          he doth it in such a soft and winning way, that we are full of wonder
          to think he could be so kind to such unworthy ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he does it securely, so that the wound can not open again. If he
          puts on his plaster, it is heaven's court-plaster, and it never fails.
          If he heals, he heals effectually. No man who is once saved of God
          shall ever be lost. If we receive mercy by faith, we shall never lose
          it. When God heals once, he heals forever. Although some who teach
          false doctrine do assert that children of God may be lost, they have
          no warrant in Scripture, nor in experience, for we know that he
          keepeth the saints. He who is once forgiven, can not be punished. He
          who is once regenerated, can not perish. He who is once healed, shall
          never find his soul sick unto death. Blessings on his name, some of us
          have felt his skill, and known his mighty power; and were our hearts
          broken now, we would not stop a moment, but go at once to his feet,
          and we would cry, "O thou that bindest the broken in heart, bind ours;
          thou that healest wounds, heal ours, we beseech thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, my hearers and readers, a parting word with you. Are you
          careless and ungodly? Permit your friend to speak with you. Is it true
          that after death there is a judgment? Do you believe that when you
          die, you will be called to stand before the bar of God? Do you know
          that there is a hell of eternal flame appointed for the wicked? Yes --
          you know and believe all this -- and yet you are going down to hell
          thoughtless and unconcerned -- you are living in constant and fearful
          jeopardy of your lives -- without a friend on the other side the
          grave. Ah, how changed will your note be soon! You have turned away
          from rebuke, you have laughed at warning, but laughter will then give
          place to sighs, and your singing to yells of agony. Bethink thee, oh
          my brother man, ere thou dost again peril thy life. What wilt thou do
          if thy soul is required of thee? Canst thou endure the terrors of the
          Almighty? Canst thou dwell in everlasting burnings? Were thy bones of
          iron, and thy ribs of brass, the sight of the coming judgment would
          make thee tremble; forbear then to mock at religion, cease to
          blaspheme you Maker, for remember, you will soon meet him face to
          face, and how will you then account for your insults heaped upon his
          patient person? May the Lord yet humble thee before him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I am seeking the distressed one, and I am impatient to be the
          means of his comfort. It may be my words are now sounding in the ear
          of my weary wounded fellow-countrymen. You have been long time tossing
          on the bed of languishing, and the time for thought had been blessed
          to your soul by God. You are now feeling the guilt of your life, and
          are lamenting the sins of your conduct. You fear there is no hope of
          pardon, no prospect of forgiveness, and you tremble lest death should
          lead your guilty soul unforgiven before its Maker. Hear, then, the
          word of God. Thy pains for sins are God's work in thy soul. He
          woundeth thee that thou mayest seek him. He would not have showed thee
          thy sin if he did not intend to pardon. Thou art now a sinner, and
          Jesus came to save sinners, therefore he came to save thee; yea, he is
          saving thee now. These strivings of soul are the work of his mercy;
          there is love in every blow, and grace in every stripe. Believe, O
          troubled one, that he is able to save thee unto the uttermost, and
          thou shalt not believe in vain. Now, in the silence of your agony,
          look unto him who by his stripes healeth thee. Jesus Christ has
          suffered the penalty of thy sins, and has endured the wrath of God on
          thy behalf. See you, yonder crucified Man on Calvary, and mark thee
          that those drops of blood are falling for thee, those nailed hands are
          pierced for thee, and that opened side contains a heart within it,
          full of love to thee.
        </p>
        <p>"None but Jesus! none but Jesus</p>
        <p>Can do helpless sinners good!"</p>
        <p>
          It is simple reliance on him which saves. The negro said, "Massa, I
          fall flat on de promise;" so if you fall flat on the promise of Jesus,
          you shall not find him fail you; he will bind up your heart, and make
          an end to the days of your mourning. We shall meet in heaven one day,
          to sing hallelujah to the condescending Lord; till then, may the God
          of all grace be our helper. Amen.
        </p>
        <p>"The mighty God will not despise</p>
        <p>The contrite heart for sacrifice;</p>
        <p>The deep-fetched sigh, the secret groan,</p>
        <p>Rises accepted to the throne.</p>
        <p>He meets, with tokens of his grace,</p>
        <p>The trembling lip, the blushing face;</p>
        <p>His bowels yearn when sinners pray;</p>
        <p>And mercy bears their sins away.</p>
        <p>When filled with grief, o'erwhelmed with shame;</p>
        <p>He, pitying, heals their broken frame;</p>
        <p>He hears their sad complaints, and spies</p>
        <p>His image in their weeping eyes."<br /></p>
