          1. When, however, they are confuted from the Scriptures, they turn
          round and accuse these same Scriptures, as if they were not correct,
          nor of authority, and [assert] that they are ambiguous, and that the
          truth cannot be extracted from them by those who are ignorant of
          tradition. For [they allege] that the truth was not delivered by means
          of written documents, but viv√¢ voce: wherefore also Paul declared,
          "But we speak wisdom among those that are perfect, but not the wisdom
          of this world." And this wisdom each one of them alleges to be the
          fiction of his own inventing, forsooth; so that, according to their
          idea, the truth properly resides at one time in Valentinus, at another
          in Marcion, at another in Cerinthus, then afterwards in Basilides, or
          has even been indifferently in any other opponent, who could speak
          nothing pertaining to salvation. For every one of these men, being
          altogether of a perverse disposition, depraving the system of truth,
          is not ashamed to preach himself.

          2. But, again, when we refer them to that tradition which originates
          from the apostles, [and] which is preserved by means of the succession
          of presbyters in the Churches, they object to tradition, saying that
          they themselves are wiser not merely than the presbyters, but even
          than the apostles, because they have discovered the unadulterated
          truth. For [they maintain] that the apostles intermingled the things
          of the law with the words of the Saviour; and that not the apostles
          alone, but even the Lord Himself, spoke as at one time from the
          Demiurge, at another from the intermediate place, and yet again from
          the Pleroma, but that they themselves, indubitably, unsulliedly, and
          purely, have knowledge of the hidden mystery: this is, indeed, to
          blaspheme their Creator after a most impudent manner! It comes to
          this, therefore, that these men do now consent neither to Scripture
          nor to tradition.

          3. Such are the adversaries with whom we have to deal, my very dear
          friend, endeavouring like slippery serpents to escape at all points.
          Where-fore they must be opposed at all points, if per-chance, by
          cutting off their retreat, we may succeed in turning them back to the
          truth. For, though it is not an easy thing for a soul under the
          influence of error to repent, yet, on the other hand, it is not
          altogether impossible to escape from error when the truth is brought
          alongside it.<br />
