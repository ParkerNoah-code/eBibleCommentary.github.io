          4. Exult before Jehovah all the earth; make a loud noise, and rejoice,
          and sing praise.5. Sing to Jehovah upon the harp, upon the harp, and
          with the voice of a psalm. 6. With trumpets, and sound of the cornet,
          sing before Jehovah the King.7. Let the sea roar, and the fullness
          thereof; the world, and those who dwell therein. 8. Let the floods
          clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together, 9. Before Jehovah:
          for he cometh to judge the earth; with righteousness shall he judge
          the world, and the people with uprightness.

          4 Exult before Jehovah all the earth Here he repeats the exhortation
          with which he had begun, and by addressing it to the nations at large,
          he indicates that when God should break down the middle wall of
          partition all would be gathered to the common faith, and one Church
          formed throughout the whole world. When he speaks of musical
          instruments the allusion is evidently to the practice of the Church at
          that time, without any intention of binding down the Gentiles to the
          observance of the ceremonies of the law. The repetition made use of is
          emphatical, and implies that the most ardent attempts men might make
          to celebrate the great work of the world's redemption would fall short
          of the riches of the grace of God. This is brought out still more
          forcibly in what follows, where feeling is ascribed to things
          inanimate. The whole passage has been elsewhere expounded, and it is
          unnecessary to insist further upon it.<br />
