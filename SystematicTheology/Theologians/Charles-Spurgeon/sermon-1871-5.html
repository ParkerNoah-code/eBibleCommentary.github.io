        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.972)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Evening, November 20th, 1870 by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |King David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the
          Lord.| -- 2 Kings 11:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHEN DAVID HAD FOUGHT with an adversary, and overcome him, he took
          away his armor and his weapons, and as other victorious heroes were
          wont to do, he bore them home as mementoes of his prowess, the
          trophies of the battle. These were placed in the house of the Lord.
          Perhaps David at the same time dedicated in like manner the shield and
          the sword which he had himself used in battle. After Solomon had built
          the temple, these trophies, which seem to have been very numerous,
          were hung up there. So they adorned the walls. So they illustrated the
          velour of noble sires. So they served to kindle emulation, I doubt
          not, in the breasts of true-hearted sons. Thus it was while
          generations sprung up and passed away; till at length other days
          dawned, darker scenes transpired, and sadder things filled up the
          chronicles of the nation. You will all of you remember the crisis to
          which my text refers. Athaliah, daughter of Ahab, wife of Jehoram,
          king of Judah, the usurping queen of Judah, had played the tyrant for
          well-nigh seven years. The endurance of the people had been tried to
          the uttermost; a just recompense was in store, and a well-concerted
          plan ready for execution. The time had come when she should be put to
          death, and the young prince who had been hidden away should be
          proclaimed king. It was arranged that he should be proclaimed in the
          temple court, yet the men that were to be the body-guard were not
          armed with weapons, for fear an alarm might be given, and the matter
          discovered too soon. But these weapons that were hung up of old in the
          temple were taken down, and the Levites and other friends were armed
          with them. When Athaliah came in and saw the young king surrounded by
          his body-guard, thus strangely equipped with the old weapons of former
          days ready to protect him, she rent her clothes, and cried, |Treason,
          Treason:| but her doom was sealed, escape was impossible, she was
          slain. To such good account there and then was the good old armor
          turned. This simple fact appears to me to suggest a striking moral.
        </p>
        <p>
          The matter I shall speak to you about to-night will lie under four
          heads. We will give them to you as they occur to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. And the first is this, IT IS WELL FOR US TO HANG ALL OUR TROPHIES
          IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD.
        </p>
        <p>
          We, too, are warriors. Every genuine Christian has to fight. Every
          inch of the way between here and heaven we shall have to fight, for as
          hitherto every single step of our pilgrimage has been one prolonged
          conflict. Sometimes we have victories, a presage of that final
          victory, that perfect triumph we shall enjoy with our Great Captain
          for ever.
        </p>
        <p>|Oh! I have seen the day</p>
        <p>When with a single word,</p>
        <p>God helping me to say</p>
        <p>'My trust is in the Lord,'</p>
        <p>My soul has quelled a thousand foes,</p>
        <p>Fearless of all that could oppose.|</p>
        <p>
          When we have these victories it behoves us to be especially careful
          that in all good conscience we hang up the trophies thereof in the
          house of the Lord. The reason for this lies here: it is to the Lord
          that we owe any success we have ever achieved. We have been defeated
          when we have gone in our own strength; but when we have been
          victorious it has always been because the strength of the Lord was put
          forth for our deliverance. You never fought with a sin, with a
          temptation, or with a doubt, and overthrew it, except by the Spirit's
          aid. You never won a soul for Jesus, you never spoke a valiant word
          that repelled an error, you never did an enterprising deed which
          really told well for the success of the kingdom, but God was in it all
          -- virtually, nay, actually enabling you; and he did it of his own
          good will. What is it but a simple matter of justice that he who
          wrought the wonder should have the honor of it? It would have been a
          crying shame if Miriam had sung to the praise of Moses and Aaron at
          the Red Sea. They were but the outward instruments of the people's
          coming out of Egypt. As she took her timbre!, she rightly said, in the
          hymn that Moses had given her for the occasion: |Let us sing unto the
          Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously.| So in every struggle that
          transpires in our hearts, in every combat waged in the world, ascribe
          the power to him to whom it belongs, |The right hand of the Lord is
          exalted; the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly.| As before the
          fight in his name we set up our banner, so after the fight in his name
          again we give the conquering banner to the breeze. |All glory be unto
          him that won the victory.|
        </p>
        <p>
          This will save us from pride and self-sufficiency. Scarcely can God
          trust us with a victory, lest we begin fingering it with our own
          hands, as if our own ingenuity, our own wisdom, or our own strength
          had done marvels. As of old, Israel sacrificed to her net when a great
          draught of fish was taken, or to her drag when a great harvest had
          been threshed out, so are we too apt to sacrifice to our own ability,
          our own industry, our own superiority in one respect or another, and
          think that there is some virtue or merit in us to which the Almighty
          has awarded the palm. Instead of looking only to God we begin to look
          in some degree to ourselves. You cannot do otherwise than put the
          honor somewhere. If you do not ascribe it to God the temptation will
          be too strong for you, you will be sure to take it for yourself; and
          if you do this the most fatal consequences will follow, for they that
          walk in pride God will assuredly abase. No matter how dear you are to
          him, if pride be harboured in your spirit he will whip it out of you.
          They that go up in their own estimation must come down again by his
          discipline. You cannot be exalted in self without being by-and-by
          brought low before him. God will have it so; it is always the rule,
          |He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and hath exalted them of
          low degree.| He goes forts with the axe, and this is the work he does
          among the thick trees -- he cuts down the high tree and dries up the
          green tree, but he exalts the low tree, and makes the dry tree to
          flourish, that all the glory may be unto himself alone; for, saith he,
          I the Lord have spoken and have done it. Let us take care, however,
          that we ascribe the glory to God, and do not forget to honor him. We
          have received so many mercies, my brethren, that they come to us as
          common things. We receive them, and scarcely know, perhaps, that we
          have received them. According to the old proverb we do not know the
          value of our mercies till we miss them; but it ought not to be so.
          Must we be defeated in order to let us know that God gives us victory?
          Is it needful that you and I should suffer some great disaster in
          order to make us grateful for past success? Will you never prize
          health as one of the choicest boons of heaven till some grievous
          malady has sapped your strength, and made all the enjoyments of life
          tasteless or even nauseous? Well, if it be needful, it is a necessity
          of our own producing. The more the pity that we should challenge the
          ills we complain of, and incur the reverses we so bitterly deplore. O
          that we may never slight the good things we have, or trifle with the
          benefits we receive from the hand of the Lord! Especially, my dear
          brethren, let us bless God for every spiritual success achieved, and
          take care to make a record of it on the tablet of our grateful heart.
          If we should one day have to flee before the enemy, if our work for
          God should one day seem to be without success, we may look back with
          much smiting of heart upon those ungrateful times when God dealt so
          generously with us, and yet we did not take the trouble to sing him a
          psalm or offer up a vow, or do any act of homage to express our
          gratitude to him. Hang up Goliath's sword; do not put it by to rust.
          Hang up the shields and the spears of the Philistines. If by God's
          help you have taken them, set store by them, and make the world see
          what the Lord has done on your behalf, whereof you are glad. Hake the
          church to join your grateful song. There is too much of the cold
          silence of ingratitude amongst us. Too seldom do we chant forth our Te
          Deum laudamus with solemn, lively air. Stir the hearts of others
          because your own heart heaves with deep emotions of thankfulness to
          the Most High. I am persuaded, my brethren, that it is only in this
          way that we can secure for ourselves future success. David's life was
          a series of dilemmas and deliverances. With what sort of face, think
          you, could he have invoked rescue from fresh perils, had he failed to
          recognize God's help in past preservation? If, when flushed with
          victory, he had usurped the honor to himself, what assistance would he
          have received the next time he was curried with impending disaster?
          Or, had he not taught the Israelites in the hour of triumph to sing,
          |Non nobis, Domine| -- |Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy
          name give glory;| how could he have engaged their hearts in the hour
          of trial to wail forth the litany of supplication -- |The Lord hear
          thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee,
          send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion.|
          Without consistency we cannot exert any moral influence with men, or
          obtain any spiritual prevalence with God. May not many of our barren
          seasons be ascribed to the fact that we did not thank God for fruitful
          ones? If the preacher has been honored in his ministry to win souls to
          Christ, but has not duly blessed his God for the enabling of the Holy
          Ghost granted to himself, and for the witness of the Holy Ghost given
          to the people; or, worse still if he has complimented himself on his
          own talents, and the use he makes of them; need he wonder if, when
          next he goes forth, as Samson of old, and shakes himself as aforetime,
          he finds his strength has departed from him? |Give unto the Lord, O ye
          mighty, give unto the Lord glory and strength. Give unto the Lord the
          glory due unto his name;| else when most you need him, you may find
          his strength is taken from you and your honors will have departed too.
          Hang up the shield, hang up the spear, let Jehovah's name be exalted.
          Bring forth the forgotten memorials of lovingkindness, expose them to
          public view, put them before your own mind's eye to-night, gratefully
          remember them, lovingly praise him and magnify his name. I am sure we,
          as a church whom God has blessed so long, ought not to be slow to hang
          up the trophies of his loving kindness in our midst. If God has done
          anything for you, tell it. If he has delivered you out of trouble,
          tell it. If he has fed your soul in the wilderness, tell it. If you
          have lately been converted, tell it. If you have found Christ precious
          to you, though just now you were a poor lost soul, tell it. Hang up
          the shields and spears. Let each individual do it, let the whole
          church do it; and often by our enlarged endeavors for the dear
          Savior's sake, by our consecrated self-denials, let us show that we do
          feel how much we owe to the infinite power of the God of victory, who
          maketh us strong in the day of battle. That is the first point. If we
          have any victories, let all the trophies be dedicated to the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second is this: THESE TROPHIES MAY COME IN USEFUL AT SUCH
          TIMES AS WE CANNOT FORESEE, AND UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AS WE WOT NOT
          OF.
        </p>
        <p>
          Little could David have thought when he gave Abiathar the sword of
          Goliath, that he would ever go to the priests of Gad and ask them to
          lend him a sword, and that they should say, We have no sword here,
          save the sword of Goliath, the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the
          Valley of Elah, behold it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. He
          gave it to God, but he did not think that he would ever have it back
          again with a priestly blessing on it, so that he should be able to
          say, |There is none like that: give it me.| And when, in after years,
          he hung up the swords and shields which he had taken away from
          Philistine heroes, he did not surmise that one of his descendants, or
          the seed royal, would find the need to employ his own, his
          grandsire's, or, further back, from himself -- his forefather's
          trophies -- in order to establish himself on the throne. We never
          know, my brethren, when we praise God for mercies, but what the very
          praises might come back into our bosoms, and the offerings we make to
          God in the way of thankfulness may be our own enrichment in the days
          to come. The memorials we put up to record God's goodness, may be to
          us in after years among the most useful things in all our treasury. To
          ourselves and others the memorials of the victories we have won may be
          signally profitable, strangely opportune, seemingly indispensable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me try to show this. Years ago you and I were fighting battles
          with unbelief. We were struggling after a Savior. Our sins rose up
          against us thick and furious. The fiery darts of the enemy rained upon
          us like hail. That conflict we never shall forget; we bear the scars
          of it to this very day. Glory be to God! by his grace we won the
          victory and overcame through the blood of the Lamb. We looked at Jesus
          Christ upon the cross, and in that moment our sins fled away. The
          whole host of them was defeated. A dying Savior was the symbol of
          victory. What then? Let us use the mementoes we laid up before the
          Lord of that day -- the trophies that we took in that battle -- for
          ourselves and for others.
        </p>
        <p>
          For ourselves. If ever we have another struggle against sin -- perhaps
          we shall have many -- I mean such alarming assaults as involve severe
          struggles -- let us recollect how Jesus met with us the first time,
          and |if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death
          of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his
          life.| He saved us with a great salvation when we first came home as
          prodigals covered with rags, will he not help us now, when he come to
          him as his own children, clothed in his own righteousness, and say,
          |Abba, Father,| being already accepted in the Beloved?
        </p>
        <p>
          I do think it often proves a great blessing to a man that he had a
          terrible conflict, a desperate encounter, a hard-fought engagement in
          passing from the empire of Satan into the kingdom of God's dear Son.
          Sooner or later each saved man will have his hand-to-hand fight with
          the prince of darkness; and as a general rule, it is a great mercy to
          have it over on the outset of one's career, and be able afterwards to
          feel, |Whatever comes upon me, I never can suffer as I suffered when I
          was seeking Christ. Whatever staggering doubt, or hideous blasphemy,
          or ghastly insinuations, even of suicide itself, may assail my feeble
          heart, they cannot outdo the horror of great darkness through which my
          spirit passed when I was struggling after a Savior.| Now I do not say
          that it is desirable that we should have this painful ordeal, much
          less that we should seek it as an evidence of regeneration, but when
          we have passed through it victoriously, we may so use it that it may
          be a perpetual armoury to us. If we can now defy all doubts and fears
          that come, because they cannot be so potent as those which already in
          the name of Jesus Christ our Savior we have overthrown, shall we not
          use that for ourselves? and can we not equally well use it for others?
          Full often have I found it good, when I have talked with a young
          convert in deep distress about his sin, to tell him something more of
          his anxious plight than he knew how to express and he wondered where I
          had found it, though he would not have wondered if he knew where I had
          been, and how much deeper in the mire than he; when he has talked
          about some horrible thought that he has had, with regard to the
          impossibility of his own salvation, and I have said, |Why, I have
          thought that a thousand times, and yet have overcome it through the
          help of God's Spirit.| I know that a man's own experience is one of
          the very best weapons he can use in fighting with evil in other men's
          hearts. Often their misery and despondency, aggravated, as it commonly
          is by a feeling of solitariness, will be greatly relieved before it is
          effectually driven out when they find that a brother has suffered the
          same, and yet has been able to overcome. Do I show him how precious
          the Savior is to my soul he glorifies God in me. Right soon will he
          look into the same dear face and be lightened; and then he will
          magnify the Lord with me, and we shall exalt his name together. Thus
          good it is, you see, to take the old shields and spears away from the
          enemies and to use them again against new foes of the house of David.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since that time, dear brethren, when we had the first struggle, we
          have had to fight with many evil passions and propensities. Perhaps we
          have had one besetting sin. We were a long time before we came up to
          beard that. We avoided it, and refrained from rising up against it,
          until at length we perceived that it must be killed or it would kill
          us. It was very like pulling out our eyes, but we saw it must be done;
          we stood foot to foot with it. A sharp time it was, for the sin
          threatened to prevail against us; if we threw it down it seemed to
          rise again, like the giant of old, strengthened by its fall. Did you
          ever have a personal, mental, moral conflict with some great dragon of
          besetting sin? If so be you have been enabled to smite it valiantly,
          and slay it utterly, I know you have gained trophies to hang in the
          house of God. To do so will be of no small advantage to ourselves,
          because you can take them down and use them in future; and you will
          find they are footholds of your strength to fight with the next sin
          that comes upon you. The strength which God has educated and fostered
          in the last struggle will greatly assist you in the next. The man who
          gives way to one sin will very readily give way to another, but a man
          who through God's grace has won a very high vantage ground by
          mastering one sin, will be very likely to win another. The spoils
          taken from the last Philistine will help us to go forth and win more,
          and in the name of God we shall get the victory. Many a man has had a
          hard struggle at first. He has been drawn to Christ, proved the grace
          of acceptance, and taken the vows of allegiance, and henceforth it
          behoves him to depart from iniquity, and not turn again to folly.
          Perhaps he has been addicted to swearing, and he has to get rid of
          that wicked habit at any cost. Perhaps he has been accustomed to
          frequent the public house, to sit in the seat of the scornful, and
          enliven his companions with jest and song, he has forthwith to
          relinquish that place, and take leave of that company for ever. Then
          perhaps there has been some other vice which he has cherished in
          secret, and clung to with the more tenacity because it so tenacious!,
          clung to him; of that evil he has purged himself, and from that
          bondage he has escaped. Is it not possible that there yet remains one
          transgression which lurks in the breast of such a one? Very likely at
          this time he has a passionate temper. Down with it, my brother. You
          slew the lion, and you slew the bear, and this uncircumcised
          Philistine shall be as one of them. Do not be afraid to grapple with
          it. Do not say, |I have a quick temper, and I cannot help it.| There
          is no need for it. God's grace can drive it out even as the rest.
          Beard it in the name of the Most High, and use the trophies that you
          stole from past success -- nay, fairly won them from the foes you have
          vanquished -- use those with which to combat sins that now assail you.
        </p>
        <p>
          To change the figure, it is the lot of some of us to be called to
          withstand great errors. We have been sorely harassed at times with
          doubts and misgivings about some established truth. I suppose no one
          is a firm believer who has not once been a doubter. He knows no faith
          who never had a fear; for candid enquiry must go before absolute
          credence. How can any one know the proofs and vouchers of his faith
          unless he has taken pains to dig into the volume of evidence that lies
          at its base? Now it is a fine, a noble thing, when you have had a
          conflict in your own soul with some plausible heresy, some seductive
          perversion of the truth, and have put it to flight with the sword of
          the Spirit, which is the word of God; it is a noble feat, I say, to
          capture the arms of your assailant and to use the very weapons of the
          adversary against him. You have detected his sophistry, you have found
          out his devices, and now for the future you will not be so readily
          carried away with every wind of doctrine. This time you are too old to
          be taken with his chaff. You were deceived once, but by God's grace
          you are not willing any longer to lend a ready ear to the fair speech
          which casts a mist over plain facts, but you henceforth resolve to
          prove the spirits whether they be of God. So from the spoils of past
          conflicts you are made strong to win present victories. Texts of
          Scripture are sometimes used by the adversaries of the gospel, and
          turned against us. I know some ministers who, when they meet with a
          passage that they cannot immediately reconcile with the orthodox
          faith, alter the reading, or put a fresh sense on the words, or twist
          it and turn it to suit their purpose. It is a bad plan, my brethren;
          the texts of Scripture are to be taken as they stand, and you may rest
          assured they will always defend, never overturn, the faith once
          delivered to the saints. When I have seen a text sometimes in the hand
          of the enemy made use of against the deity of Christ, or against the
          doctrine of election, or against some other important and vital
          doctrine, I have not felt at all inclined to give up the text or think
          lightly of it. I rather admire those Americans in the South, who when
          they had lost some guns, were asked by the commanding officer whether
          they had not spiked the guns before they gave them up to the foe?
          |Spiked them! no,| said they, |we did not like to spoil such beautiful
          guns; we will take them again tomorrow.| And so they did. I would not
          have a text touched. Grand old text! we honor thee even while we
          cannot keep the field, or ward thee from the aggression of the
          invader. But shall we spoil it, or give it up as lost? Never, we will
          take it out of the hand of the enemy, use it for the defense of the
          gospel, and show that it does not mean what they think, or answer the
          ends to which they would apply it. Are we baffled in attack, or do we
          lose ground in an argument, it is for us by more diligent study, and
          closer research, to take the guns, the good old guns, and use those
          which the enemy used against ourselves -- to turn them round and use
          them against him. Depend upon it the great temple of truth is not like
          a house divided against itself. Nothing equivocal or prevaricating
          hath come forth at any time from the mouth of the Lord. As for our
          understanding, it is always weak, and as for our tactics in upholding
          the right, they are often at fault. But the word of God is steadfast;
          it does not change with the times or yield to suit any man's purpose.
          The weapons of our warfare are good, it is the hands that wield them
          that are so unskillful. Thus I might continue to show that in all the
          battles we fight, the trophies which we win should be stored; for they
          may come in for future use at some time or other. There is no
          experience of a Christian that will not have some ultimate service to
          render him. He may say to himself, |What can be the good of this
          feeling, what can be the practical advantage of that agony of mind
          through which I passed?| My brother, you know not what may be the
          history of your life, it is unfinished yet; if you did know you would
          see that in this present trial there is a preparation for some future
          emergency, which will enable you to come out of it in triumph. The
          shields and spears of David are hung up for future action.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. In the third place, our text may mean that David hung up the
          spears and shields which he was accustomed to use himself; and if so,
          we shall remark that ANCIENT WEAPONS ARE GOOD FOR PRESENT USE.
        </p>
        <p>
          I should like to show you this by taking you on to a battle-field. I
          did take you there just now, but you did not recognize it, perhaps, as
          a battle-ground. We will go to it. It is not Sadowa or Sedan, it is a
          grander arena far -- the old seventy-seventh. Turn to the
          seventy-seventh Psalm, and you have a battle-field there. Should you
          ever have to fight the same battle, by looking through this Psalm, you
          will see David's shields and spears, and you will soon learn how to
          screen yourself with the one, and how to do exploits with the other.
          Here is David fighting with despondency -- an old enemy of mine. I
          daresay some of you are afflicted with it. But observe how he fought
          with it. The first weapon he drew out of the scabbard was the weapon
          of all-prayer. And how grandly he used it! |I cried unto God with my
          voice, even unto God with my voice.| Satan trembles when he hears the
          sound of prayer. They are the conquering legions that know how to
          pray. Despondency soon flies when a man knows how to ply this
          all-conquering and ever-useful weapon of petition to the Most High.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then note how he used this weapon continually. |My hand was stretched
          out all night,| saith he, according to the marginal reading of the
          second verse. If the first prayer did not help him, he prayed again;
          if an hour's prayer did not bring him peace, he would pray two hours;
          and all night long he kept at it. You will get a like result too, my
          brother, if you exercise a like perseverance, you must get a like
          result if you know how to linger at the mercy-seat.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he had used the weapon of prayer, what did he do next? He took
          out another spear. It was that of remembering God. He had long enough
          pored in thought over himself and his present sinfulness and weakness,
          and now he remembered God's mercy, God's faithfulness, God's
          lovingkindness, God's power, God's covenant, God in the person of
          Christ. Oh! this is indeed to prepare a salvo against the enemy, and
          to fortify one's own position with fresh succours. He can win the
          battle that knows how to use this artillery of remembering God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going on with the strategy of war, what next? Why, in the fifth verse
          we read how he maintained his courage and his constancy -- |I
          considered the days of old.| He enquired of hoary fathers, and looked
          back upon the inspired traditions, if I may be allowed the expression,
          of the early church. He tamed to see whether God ever did forsake any
          of his people, rightly judging that if he never did he never would,
          and firmly resolving that till he could find a clear case of God's
          unfaithfulness he would not yield an inch of soil, nor give up a stone
          of any fortress, but would hold on and fight the battle out. That
          inward musing helped him much. The enemy began to weary, while he
          recruited his strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now he used another weapon. He looked to his own experience -- see
          the sixth verse. |I called to remembrance my song in the night.| Past
          experience acknowledged gratefully, and taken as the index of what the
          future will be -- this is another of David's shields and spears. And
          then he seemed to put a whole path of spears before the enemy, and
          hold up an entire wall of shields when he came to close quarters with
          him, and said, |Will the Lord cast off for ever? Will he be favorable
          no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever? Doth his promise fail for
          evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger shut up
          his tender mercies?| Oh! this is how to win the battle. The next time,
          dear friend, you find yourself downcast in trouble, do not run away
          because Giant Despair is so strong. Though pressed by danger and beset
          by foes, feed not this frenzy of the soul with gloomy black
          forebodings. Armed with David's shield and spears, attack him; show a
          bold front, and so shall yet resist the devil and find that he flees
          from you, and you shall come back from the conflict with louder notes
          of victory than you had dreamed before.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some persons here, however, who are not yet far enough
          advanced to understand this battle of the seventy-seventh. I will take
          them to another battle, the battle of the fifty-first. That is the
          sinner's battle; we shall see David's shields and spears there. A
          tremendous battle it was with sin, with a guilty conscience, with
          despairing thoughts. Some of you, perhaps, are fighting such a battle
          to-night. I rather hope you are. I was preaching the other day, I
          think it was last Tuesday evening, at Acton. I went my way after
          service hopeful, prayerful that some fruits might be reaped from my
          labors. Not long after I received a letter from the minister to this
          effect: |My dear friend, I could not help writing to tell you that
          last Tuesday night when I was in bed and asleep, there was a knock at
          my door, and I came down and found a railway porter wanting to see me.
          |O sir,| said he, |I cannot sleep; I was obliged to come and knock you
          up though it is late. I heard the sermon at your chapel to-night, and
          I want to know what I must do to be saved? It is time for me to seek
          the Lord, and I shall never get rest till I find him.| Oh! it is good
          for us to be knocked up at night to answer any one that comes on such
          an errand as that. Would God it were every night in the year, if it
          were to hear a sinner saying, |What must I do to be saved?|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if one here present be in such a condition as that, just let him
          follow me to this battle-field, and see how David fought. His shields
          and spears in such case consisted first in an appeal to God's mercy.
          Do not appeal to justice, sinner. That is against you; appeal to
          mercy. |Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness!|
          Prayer he brings before God, but it is prayer tipped with a hope in
          the mercy in God. Go, sinner, and plead with God and fight your sins
          with hope in his mercy. When he had done that he then turns to
          confession: |I acknowledge my transgression, and my sin is ever before
          me.| No weapon to drive away guilty fears like making a clean breast
          of your sins. Tell your Father you have offended; do not plead any
          extenuations or mitigations. Confess that you deserve his wrath. Put
          yourself before the throne of God's clemency. Confess that if it were
          turned to a throne of vengeance you deserve it well. Prayers, tears,
          pleas for mercy, and full confession -- these are weapons to conquer
          with.
        </p>
        <p>
          But note the master weapon! See where the battle began to turn into
          victory. It is here when he cries in the seventh verse, |Purge me with
          hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than
          snow.| You know that hyssop was a little bunch, a brush used to dip
          into the blood -- a basin full of blood, and then with this brush of
          hyssop the priest sprinkled the guilty man, the unclean man, and he
          was counted clean. So the master argument in this verse is blood. Oh!
          how this destroys our sins, how this scatters all our doubts and fears
          -- the almighty weapon of the cross, the divine weapon of the
          atonement. Let sins come on, and let them be more than the hairs of my
          head, loftier than mountains and deeper than the unfathomed ocean, let
          them come on -- God's flaming wrath behind them, hell itself coming to
          devour me; yet if I can but take the cross and hold it up before me,
          if I can plead the precious blood I shall be safe, for I shall be
          saved and prove a conqueror, notwithstanding all. Beloved, then, see
          that in all your fights you use the old, old weapons of David himself
          -- his shields and spears -- by these same weapons shall you also win
          the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And now, lastly, let me suggest to you a fourth version of the
          text. DID NOT DAVID HEREIN PREFIGURE HIM THAT WAS TO COME -- DAVID'S
          SON AND DAVID'S LORD?
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus Christ, our King, has hung up many shields and spears in the
          house of the Lord. I shall not occupy many minutes, but I invite every
          believer's heart to look at the great temple that Christ has builded,
          and see how he has hung it round with trophies of his victory. Sin --
          Christ has borne it in himself, endured its penalty and overcome it;
          he has hung up the handwriting of ordinances that was against us as a
          trophy in the house of the Lord. He has nailed it to the cross. Satan
          -- our great foe -- he met him foot to foot in the wilderness and
          discomfited him -- met him in the garden -- overcame him on the cross.
          Now hell, too, is vanquished -- Christ is Lord. The prince of the
          power of the air is but his serf. The King of kings hath led captivity
          captive, and all the crowns of this prince of the power of the air are
          hung up as trophies. Broken are their spears: their shields all
          battered and vilely cast away, hang up as memorials of what Christ has
          done. Death, too, the last enemy, Christ hath taken spoils from him
          when he rose again himself from his prison house, and ascended on
          high, leading captivity captive. And the enmity of the human heart, my
          brethren. Oh I how many of these enmities has Christ hung up in the
          hall, for he has conquered that enmity and made the hater into a
          lover. My heart, your heart, I hope that all our hearts, too, are
          trophies of what Christ's love can do. There are some great sinners at
          this day who are wonderful tokens of the power of love. When we look
          round the temple and see the shields and spears hung up, we say, |Who
          did those shields and spears belong to?| One says, |Why, that is the
          shield and spear of John Newton, the old blasphemer!| Glory be to God,
          Christ conquered him. Whose shield and spears are those? Why, that is
          the shield and spear of John Bunyan, the blasphemer on the village
          green. God's mercy conquered him. Yes, there will be a pillar for many
          of us, and I do not know which will bring Christ most honor, for he
          had much ado to bring us down. I wonder whether there will be a place
          for you, you old sailor? These many year you have been living without
          God and without Christ. You have been a frequenter of every place of
          sin, every filthy haunt in London. I do trust God's grace will meet
          with you. The poor harlot, Mary, the woman that was a sinner -- there
          hangs her shield and spear. She was a hard fighter, a very Amazon, but
          Christ conquered her, hung up her shield and spear, and there it shall
          hang for ever, to the praise of the glory of his grace, who vanquished
          even her, and made her his willing servant, nay, his beloved friend.
          What will heaven be when all of us shall be trophies of his power to
          save, and when our bodies shall be there as well as our souls! |O
          death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?| -- when not
          only souls, but bodies shall be in heaven too, all trophies of what
          Christ has done when he plucked his people from the jaws of the grave
          and delivered them from the grasp of the sepulcher.
        </p>
        <p>
          I came just now, before I entered here, from a sight which did my very
          soul good. One of our dear and well-beloved sisters, lies very sick, I
          think sue is dying -- in all human probability a few hours will see
          her in another world. I looked at her as one of the trophies of
          Christ's power to save. I would not have missed the visit for I know
          not what. She was not only calm, but joyous; nay, triumphant,
          expecting the time of her departure and longing for it, speaking of
          everlasting faithfulness, of sure promises, and of the presence of
          Christ as a reality, which she enjoyed even now, before the veil of
          flesh is rent that hides his blessed face from ours. I said to her,
          |How long is it since the cloud has broken away from you?| She said,
          |I have had a good deal of peace of mind, but never such joy as I have
          now. Now that I am going hence I shall soon see his face without a
          veil between.| The victories of dying spirits substantiate the gospel.
          When Christian people have no motive to overrate their assurance, and
          certainly no inducement to play the hypocrite, when they have nothing
          in their present sensations to inspire courage, raise enthusiasm, or
          buoy them up with suspicious comfort -- for heart and flesh fail --
          there is much to admire in their constancy, much to animate us in
          their faith:
        </p>
        <p>|Our dying friends are pioneers to smoothe</p>
        <p>Our rugged path to death, to break those bars</p>
        <p>Of terror and abhorrence Nature throws</p>
        <p>Cross our obstructed way, and thus to make</p>
        <p>Welcome, as safe, our port from every storm.|</p>
        <p>
          When you can see the eye, soon to be closed, sparkling with ecstacy,
          and hear the voice feeble because the throat is choking, as brave, and
          braver still than ever it has been before, and when you mark the look
          of deep composure, nay, of heavenly expectancy, upon the pale, pale
          face -- oh! this makes our soul, my brethren, to feel that we have a
          faith that is worth prizing, a Christ that is worth trusting. These
          are trophies; and these death-bed trophies are hung up in that part of
          the temple where we can see them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us take care that we have good confidence, always walking by
          faith, be the path of our pilgrimage rough or smooth, arid ever
          maintaining the fight of faith, however fierce our temptations or
          fiery our trials. So when we come to die we may hang up our trophies
          too, saying to death and hell that we bid them defiance, for Christ is
          with us to the last, making our darkest moments to be bright with the
          light of his presence. God grant that all of us may be trophies of
          Christ, and hung up thus as memorials for ever. Amen.
