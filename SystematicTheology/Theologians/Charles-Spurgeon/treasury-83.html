 </p>
</font></b><font face="Verdana">
<p>Title. To the Chief Musician upon Shoshannim Eduth. </p>
<p>For the fourth time we have a song upon Shoshannim, or the lilies; the 
    former ones being Psalms 45, 60, and 69. Why this title is given it would be 
    difficult to say in every case, but the delightfully poetical form of the 
    present Psalm may well justify the charming title. Eduth signifies 
    testimony. The Psalm is a testimony of the church as a "lily among thorns." 
    Some interpreters understand the present title to refer to an instrument of 
    six strings, and Schleusner translates the two words, "the hexachord of 
    testimony." It may be that further research will open up to us these "dark 
    sayings upon a harp." We shall be content to accept them as evidence that 
    sacred song was not lightly esteemed in the days of old. A Psalm of Asaph. A 
    latter Asaph we should suppose, who had the unhappiness to live, like the 
    "last minstrel," in evil times. If by the Asaph of David's day, this Psalm 
    was written in the spirit of prophecy, for it sings of times unknown to 
    David.</p>
<p align="justify">Division. </p>
<p align="justify">The Psalm divides itself naturally at the refrain which 
    occurs three times: "Turn us again, O God," etc. 1-3 is an opening address 
    to the Lord God of Israel; </p>
<p align="justify">from 4-7 is a lamentation over the national woe, </p>
<p align="justify">and from 8-19 the same complaint is repeated, the nation 
    being represented in a beautiful allegory as a vine. It is a mournful Psalm, 
    and its lilies are lilies of the valley. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. "Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel." </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Hear you the bleatings of your suffering flock. The name 
    is full of tenderness, and hence is selected by the troubled psalmist: 
    broken hearts delight in names of grace. Good old Jacob delighted to think 
    of God as the Shepherd of Israel, and this verse may refer to his dying 
    expression: "From thence is the Shepherd, the stone of Israel." We may be 
    quite sure that he who deigns to be a shepherd to his people will not turn a 
    deaf ear to their complaints. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"You who lead Joseph like a flock."</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The people are called here by the name of that renowned 
    son who became a second father to the tribes, and kept them alive in Egypt; 
    possibly they were known to the Egyptians under the name of "the family of 
    Joseph," and if so, it seems most natural to call them by that name in this 
    place. </p>
<p align="justify">The term may, however, refer to the ten tribes of which 
    Manasseh was the acknowledged head. The Lord had of old in the wilderness 
    led, guided, shepherded all the tribes; and, therefore, the appeal is made 
    to him. The Lord's doings in the past are strong grounds for appeal and 
    expectation as to the present and the future. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"You that dwell between the cherubim, shine forth." </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The Lord's especial presence was revealed upon the 
    mercy-seat between the cherubim, and in all our pleadings we should come to 
    the Lord by this way: only upon the mercy-seat will God reveal his grace, 
    and only there can we hope to commune with him. </p>
<p align="justify">Let us ever plead the name of Jesus, who is our true 
    mercy-seat, to whom we may come boldly, and through whom we may look for a 
    display of the glory of the Lord on our behalf. Our greatest dread is the 
    withdrawal of the Lord's presence, and our brightest hope is the prospect of 
    his return. In the darkest times of Israel, the light of her Shepherd's 
    countenance is all she needs.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. "Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir 
    up your strength, and come and save us."</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It is wise to mention the names of the Lord's people in 
    prayer, for they are precious to him.<i> Jesus bears the names of his people 
    on his breastplate. </i>Just as the mention of the names of his children has 
    power with a father, so it is with the Lord. </p>
<p align="justify">The three names were near of kin; Ephraim and Manasseh 
    represent Joseph, and it was fit that Benjamin, the other son of the beloved 
    Rachel, should be mentioned in the same breath. These three tribes were 
    accustomed to march together in the wilderness, following immediately behind 
    the ark. The prayer is that the God of Israel would be mighty on behalf of 
    his people, chasing away their foes, and saving his people. </p>
<p align="justify">O that in these days the Lord may be pleased to remember 
    every part of his church, and make all her tribes to see his salvation. <i>
    We would not mention our own denomination only—but lift up prayer for all 
    the sections of the one church.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. "Turn us again, O God."</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It is not so much said, "turn our captivity," but "turn 
    us." All will come right if we are right.<i> The best turn is not that of 
    circumstances, but of character. </i>When the Lord turns his people he will 
    soon turn their condition. It needs the Lord himself to do this, for 
    conversion is as divine a work as creation; and those who have been once 
    turned unto God, if they at any time backslide, as much need the Lord to 
    turn them again as to turn them at the first. The word may be read, "restore 
    us;" truly, it is a choice mercy that "he restores my soul." </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"And cause your face to shine." </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Be favorable to us, smile upon us. This was the high 
    priest's blessing upon Israel: what the Lord has already given us by our 
    High Priest and Mediator we may right confidently ask of him. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"And we shall be saved." </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">All that is wanted for salvation is the Lord's favor. One 
    glance of his gracious eye would transform Tophet into Paradise. No matter 
    how fierce the foe, or dire the captivity, the shining face of God ensures 
    both victory and liberty. This verse is a very useful prayer. Since we too 
    often turn aside, let us often with our lips and heart cry, "Turn us again, 
    O God, and cause your face to shine, and we shall be saved."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. "O Lord God Almighty, how long will you be angry 
    against the prayer of your people?" </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">How long shall the smoke of your wrath drown the smoking 
    incense of our prayers? Prayer would gladly enter your holy place—but your 
    wrath battles with it, and prevents its entrance. <i>That God should be 
    angry with us when sinning seems natural enough—but that he should be angry 
    even with our prayers is a bitter grief. </i>With many a pang may the 
    pleader ask, "How long?" Commander of all the hosts of your creatures, able 
    to save your saints in their extremity, shall they forever cry to you in 
    vain?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. "You feed them with the bread of tears." </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">Their food is seasoned with brine distilled from weeping 
    eyes.</p></i> Their meals, which were once such pleasant seasons of social 
    merriment, are now like funeral feasts to which each man contributes his 
    bitter morsel. Your people ate bread of wheat before—but now they receive 
    from your own hand no better diet than bread of tears. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"And give them tears to drink in great measure." </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">Tears are both their food and their drink, and that 
    without stint</p></i>. They swallow tierces of tears, and swim in gulfs of 
    grief, and all this by God's own appointment; not because their enemies have 
    them in their power by force of arms—but because their God refuses to 
    interpose. <i>Tear bread is even more the fruit of the curse than to eat 
    bread in the sweat of one's face</i>—but it shall by divine love be turned 
    into a greater blessing by ministering to our spiritual health.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. "You make us a strife unto our neighbors."</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Always jealous and malicious, Edom and Moab exulted over 
    Israel's troubles, and then fell to disputing about their share of the 
    spoil. A neighbor's jeer is ever most cutting, especially if a man has been 
    superior to them, and claimed to possess more grace. None are unneighborly 
    as envious neighbors. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"And our enemies laugh among themselves."</p></b> 
<i>
<p align="justify">They find mirth in our misery, comedy in our tragedy, 
    salt for their wit in the brine of our tears, amusement in our amazement.</p></i> 
    It is devilish to sport with another's griefs; but it is the constant habit 
    of the world which lies in the wicked one, to make merry with the saints' 
    tribulations; the seed of the serpent follow their progenitor and rejoice in 
    evil.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. "Turn us again, O God Almighty."</p></b> 
<p align="justify">The prayer rises in the form of its address to God. He is 
    here the God Almighty. The more we approach the Lord in prayer and 
    contemplation the higher will our ideas of him become.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. "You have brought a vine out of Egypt." </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">There it was in unfriendly soil: the waters of the Nile 
    watered it not—but were as death to its shoots, while the inhabitants of the 
    land despised it and trampled it down. Glorious was the right hand of the 
    Lord when with power and great wonders he removed his pleasant plant in the 
    teeth of those who sought its destruction. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"You have cast out the heathen, and planted it." </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Seven nations were dug out to make space for the vine of 
    the Lord; the old trees, which long had engrossed the soil, were torn up 
    root and branch; oaks of Bashan, and palm trees of Jericho were displaced 
    for the chosen vine. It was securely placed in its appointed position with 
    divine prudence and wisdom. <i>Small in appearance, very dependent, 
    exceeding weak, and apt to trail on the ground—yet the vine of Israel was 
    chosen of the Lord, because he knew that by incessant care, and abounding 
    skill, he could make of it a goodly fruit bearing plant.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. "You prepare room before it."</p></b> 
<p align="justify">The weeds, brambles, and huge stones were cleared; the 
    Amorites, and their brethren in iniquity, were made to quit the scene, their 
    forces were routed, their kings slain, their cities captures, and Canaan 
    became like a plot of land, made ready for a vineyard. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"And caused it to take deep root, and it filled the 
    land."</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Israel became settled and established as a vine well 
    rooted, and then it began to flourish and to spread to every side.</p>
<p align="justify">This analogy might be applied to the experience of every 
    believer in Jesus. The Lord has planted us, we are growing downward, 
    "rooting roots," and by his grace we are also advancing in manifest 
    enlargement. The same is true of the church in a yet closer degree, for at 
    this moment through the goodwill of the dresser of the vineyard her branches 
    spread far and wide.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. "The hills were covered with the shadow of it."
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Israel dwelt up the mountains' summits, cultivating every 
    foot of soil. The nation multiplied and became so great that other lands 
    felt its influence, or were shadowed by it. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"And the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars."</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The nation itself was so great that even its tribes were 
    powerful and worthy to take rank among the mighty. A more correct rendering 
    describes the cedars as covered with the vine, and we know that in many 
    lands vines climb the trees, and cover them. What a vine must that be which 
    ascends the cedars of God, and even overtops them! It is a noble picture of 
    the prosperity of the Israelitish people in their best days. In Solomon's 
    time the little land of Israel occupied a high place among the nations. 
    There have been times when the church of God also has been eminently 
    conspicuous, and her power has been felt far and near.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. "She sent out her boughs unto the sea." </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Along the Mediterranean and, perhaps, across its waters, 
    Israel's power was felt. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"And her branches unto the river." </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">On her Eastern side she pushed her commerce even to the 
    Euphrates. Those were brave days for Israel, and would have continued, had 
    not sin cut them short. </p>
<p align="justify">When the church pleases the Lord, her influence becomes 
    immense, far beyond the proportion which her numbers or her power would lead 
    us to expect; but, alas! when the Lord leaves her she becomes as worthless, 
    useless, and despised as an untended vine, which is of all plants the most 
    valueless.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. "Why have you then broken down her hedges?" </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">You have withdrawn protection from her after caring for 
    her with all this care; why is this, O Lord? A vine unprotected is exposed 
    to every form of injury; none regard it, all prey upon it: such was Israel 
    when given over to her enemies; such has the church full often been. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"So that all they which pass by the way do pluck her."
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Her cruel neighbors have a pluck at her, and marauding 
    bands, like roaming beasts, must needs pick at her. <i>With God no enemy can 
    harm us, without him none are so weak as to be unable to do us damage.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. The boar out of the woods does waste it. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Such creatures are famous for rending and devouring 
    vines. Babylon, like a beast from the marshes of the Euphrates, came up and 
    wasted Judah and Israel. Fierce peoples, comparable to wild swine of the 
    forest, warred with the Jewish nation, until it was gored and torn like a 
    vine destroyed by greedy hogs. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And the wild beast of the field does devour it. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">First one foe and then another wreaked vengeance on the 
    nation, neither did God interpose to chase them away. Ruin followed ruin; 
    the fox devoured the young shoots which had been saved from the damage 
    wrought by the boar. Alas, poor land. How low were you brought! An oak or 
    cedar might have been crushed by such ravages—but how can you endure it, O 
    weak and tender vine? <i>See what evils follow in the train of sin, and how 
    terrible a thing it is for a people to be forsaken of their God</i>.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14. Return, we beseech you, O God Almighty.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Turn yourself to us as well as us to you. You have gone 
    from us because of our sins, come back to us, for we sigh and cry after you. 
    Or, if it be too much to ask you to come then do at least give us some 
    consideration and cast an eye upon our griefs. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Look down from Heaven, and behold, and visit this vine.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Do not close your eyes; it is your vine, do not utterly 
    turn away from it as though it were quite gone from your mind. Great 
    Gardener, at least note the mischief which the beasts have done, for then it 
    may be your heart will pity, and your hand will be outstretched to deliver.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 15. And the vineyard which your right hand has 
    planted. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Shall all your care be lost? You has done so much, will 
    you lose your labor? With your power and wisdom you did great things for 
    your people, will you now utterly give them up, and allow your enemies to 
    exult in the evil which they delight in? </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And the branch that you made strong for yourself. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">A prayer for the leader whom the Lord had raised up, or 
    for the Messiah whom they expected. Though the vine had been left—yet one 
    branch had been regarded of the Lord, as if to furnish a scion for another 
    vine; therefore, is the prayer made in this form. Let us pray the Lord, if 
    he will not in the first place look upon his church, to look upon the Lord 
    Jesus, and then behold her in mercy for his sake. This is the true are of 
    prayer, to put Christ forward and cry, "Him and then the sinner see, Look 
    through Jesus' wounds on me."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 16. It is burned with fire.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">In broken utterances the sorrowful singer utters his 
    distress. The vineyard was like a forest which has been set on fire; the 
    choice vines were charred and dead. It is cut down. The cruel axe had hacked 
    after its murderous fashion, the branches were lopped, the trunk was 
    wounded, desolation reigned supreme.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">They perish at the rebuke of your countenance. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">God's rebuke was to Israel what fire and axe would be to 
    a vine.<i> His favor is life, and his wrath is as messengers of death. </i>
    One angry glance from Jehovah's eye is sufficient to lay all the vineyards 
    of Ephraim desolate. O Lord, look not thus upon our churches. Rebuke us—but 
    not in anger.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 17. Let your hand be upon the man of your right 
    hand. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Let your power rest on your true Benjamin, son of your 
    right hand; give a commission to some chosen man by whom you will deliver. 
    Honor him, save us, and glorify yourself. There is no doubt here an outlook 
    to the Messiah, for whom believing Jews had learned to look as the Savior in 
    time of trouble. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Upon the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Send forth your power with him whom you shall strengthen 
    to accomplish your purposes of grace. It pleases God to work for the sons of 
    men by sons of men. "By man came death, by man came also the resurrection 
    from the dead." </p>
<p align="justify">Nations rise or fall largely through the instrumentality 
    of individuals: by a Napoleon the kingdoms are scourged, and by a Wellington 
    nations are saved from the tyrant. It is by the man Christ Jesus that fallen 
    Israel is yet to rise, and indeed through him, who deigns to call himself 
    the Son of Man, the world is to be delivered from the dominion of Satan and 
    the curse of sin. O Lord, fulfill your promise to the man of your right 
    hand, who participates in your glory, and give him to see the pleasure of 
    the Lord prospering in his hand.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 18. So will not we go back from you.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Under the leadership of one whom God had chosen the 
    nation would be kept faithful, grace would work gratitude, and so cement 
    them to their allegiance. It is in Christ that we abide faithful; because he 
    lives, we live also. There is no hope of our perseverance apart from him.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Quicken us, and we will call upon your name. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">If the Lord gives life out of death, his praise is sure 
    to follow. The Lord Jesus is such a leader, that in him is life, and the 
    life is the light of men. He is our life. When he visits our souls anew we 
    shall be revived, and our praise shall ascend unto the name of the Triune 
    God.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 19. Turn us again, O Lord God Almighty. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Here we have another advance in the title and the 
    incommunicable name of Jehovah, the I AM is introduced. Faith's day grows 
    brighter as the hours roll on; and her prayers grow more full and mighty.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Cause your face to shine; and we shall be saved. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Even we who were so destroyed. No extremity is too great 
    for the power of God. He is able to save at the last point, and that too by 
    simply turning his smiling face upon his afflicted. <i>Men can do little 
    with their arm—but God can do all things with a glance. </i>Oh, to live 
    forever in the light of Jehovah's countenance.</p>
