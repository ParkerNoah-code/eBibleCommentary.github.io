          There is a great deal more room given in Scripture to the
          <i>call</i> of men to God's work than there is to their <i>end</i>.
          For instance, we don't know where Isaiah died, or how he died, but we
          know a great deal about the call God gave him, when he saw God on high
          and lifted up on His throne. I suppose that it is true to-day that
          hundreds of young men and women who are listening for a call and
          really want to know what their life's mission is, perhaps find it the
          greatest problem they ever had. Some don't know just what profession
          or work to take up, and so I should like to take the call of Moses,
          and see if we cannot draw some lessons from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You remember when God met Moses at the burning bush and called him to
          do as great a work as any man has ever been called to in this world,
          that
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>HE THOUGHT THE LORD HAD MADE A MISTAKE,</p>
        <p>
          that he was not the man. He said, "Who am I?" He was very small in his
          own estimation. Forty years before he had started out as a good many
          others have started. He thought he was pretty well equipped for
          service. He had been in the schools of the Egyptians, he had been in
          the palaces of Egypt, he had moved in the <i>bon ton</i> society. He
          had had all the advantages any man could have when he started out,
          undoubtedly, without calling on the God of Abraham for wisdom and
          guidance, yet he broke down.
        </p>
        <p>
          How many men have started out in some profession and made a failure of
          it! They haven't heard the voice of God, they haven't waited upon God
          for instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          I suppose Moses thought that the children of Israel would be greatly
          honored to know that a prince of the realm was going to take up their
          cause, but you remember how he lost his temper and killed the
          Egyptian, and next day, when he interfered in a quarrel between two
          Hebrews, they wanted to know who had made him judge and ruler over
          them, and he had to flee into the desert, and was there for forty
          years hidden away. He killed the Egyptian and lost his influence
          thereby. Murder for liberty; wrong for right; it was a poor way to
          reform abuses, and Moses needed training.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a long time for God to keep him in His school, a long time for
          a man to wait in the prime of his life, from forty to eighty. Moses
          had been brought us with all the luxuries that Egypt could give him,
          and now he was a shepherd, and in the sight of the Egyptians a
          shepherd was an abomination. I have an idea that Moses started out
          with a great deal bigger head than heart. I believe that is the reason
          so many fail; they have
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>BIG HEADS AND LITTLE HEARTS.</p>
        <p>
          If a man has a shriveled-up heart and a big head he is a monster.
          Perhaps Moses looked down on the Hebrews. There are many people who
          start out with the idea that they are great and other people are
          small, and they are going to bring them up on the high level with
          themselves. God never yet used a man of that stamp. Perhaps Moses was
          a slow scholar in God's school, and so He had to keep him there for
          forty years.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now he is ready; he is just the man God wants, and God calls him.
          Moses said, "Who am I?" He was very small in his own eyes -- just
          small enough so that God could use him. If you had asked the Egyptians
          who he was, they would have said he was
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>THE BIGGEST FOOL IN THE WORLD.</p>
        <p>
          "Why," they would say, "look at the opportunity that man had! He might
          have been commander of the Egyptian army, he might have been on the
          throne, swaying the sceptre over the whole world, if he hadn't
          identified himself with those poor, miserable Hebrews! Think what an
          opportunity he has lost, and what a privilege he has thrown away!"
        </p>
        <p>
          He had dropped out of the public mind for forty years, and they didn't
          know what had become of him, but God had His eye upon him. He was the
          very man of all others that God wanted, and when he met God with that
          question, "Who am I?" it didn't matter who he was but who his God was.
          When men learn the lesson that they are nothing and God is everything,
          then there is not a position in which God cannot use them. It was not
          Moses who accomplished that great work of redemption, for he was only
          the instrument in God's hand. God could have spoken to Pharaoh without
          Moses. He could have spoken in a voice of thunder, and broken the
          heart of Pharaoh with one speech, if He had wanted to, but He
          condescended to take up a human agent, and to use him. He could have
          sent Gabriel down, but he knew that Moses was the man wanted above all
          others, so He called him. God uses men to speak to men: He works
          through mediators. He could have accomplished the exodus of the
          children of Israel in a flash, but instead He chose to send a lonely
          and despised shepherd to work out His purpose through pain and
          disappointment. That was God's way in the Old Testament, and also in
          the New. He sent His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be the
          mediator between God and man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moses went on making excuses and said, "When I go down there, who
          shall I say has sent me?" I suppose he remembered how he went before
          he was sent that other time, and he was afraid of a failure again. A
          man who has made a failure once is always afraid he will make another.
          He loses confidence in himself. It is a good thing to lose confidence
          in ourselves so as to gain confidence in God.
        </p>
        <p>The Lord said, "Say unto them, 'I AM hath sent me.'"</p>
        <p>Some one has said that God gave him</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>A BLANK CHECK,</p>
        <p>
          and all he had to do was to fill it out from that time on. When he
          wanted to bring water out of the rock, all he had to do was to fill
          out the check; when he wanted bread, all he had to do was to fill out
          the check and the bread came; he had a rich banker. God had taken him
          into partnership with Himself. God had made him His heir, and all he
          had to do was to look up to Him, and he got all he wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet he seemed to draw back, and began to make another excuse, and
          said:
        </p>
        <p>"They will not believe me."</p>
        <p>
          He was afraid of the Israelites as well as of Pharaoh: he knew how
          hard it is to get even your friends to believe in you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if God has sent you and me with a message it is not for us to say
          whether others will believe it or not. <i>We</i> cannot make men
          believe. If I have been sent by God to make men believe, He will give
          me power to make them believe. Jesus Christ didn't have that power; it
          is the work of the Holy Ghost; we cannot persuade men and overcome
          skepticism and infidelity unless we are baptised with the Holy Ghost
          and with power.
        </p>
        <p>
          God told Moses that they <i>would</i> believe him, that he would
          succeed, and bring the children of Israel out of bondage. But Moses
          seemed to distrust even the God who had spoken to him.
        </p>
        <p>Then the Lord said, "What is that in thy hand?"</p>
        <p>
          He had a rod or staff, a sort of shepherd's crook, which he had cut
          haphazard when he had wanted something that would serve him in the
          desert.
        </p>
        <p>"It is only a rod."</p>
        <p>
          "With that you shall deliver the children of Israel; with that rod you
          shall make Israel believe that I am with you."
        </p>
        <p>
          When God Almighty linked Himself to that rod, it was worth more than
          all the armies the world had ever seen. Look and see how that rod did
          its work. It brought up the plagues of flies, and the thunder storm,
          and turned the water into blood. It was not Moses, however, nor Moses'
          rod that did the work, but it was the God of the rod, the God of
          Moses. As long as God was with him, he could not fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes it looks as if God's servants fail. When Herod beheaded John
          the Baptist, it looked as if John's mission was a failure. But was it?
          The voice that rang through the valley of the Jordan rings through the
          whole world to-day. You can hear its echo upon the mountains and the
          valleys yet, "I must decrease, but He must increase." He held up Jesus
          Christ and introduced Him to the world, and Herod had not power to
          behead him until his life work had been accomplished. Stephen never
          preached but one sermon that we know of, and that was before the
          Sanhedrim; but how that sermon has been preached again and again all
          over the world! Out of his death probably came Paul, the greatest
          preacher the world has seen since Christ left this earth. If a man is
          sent by Jehovah, there is no such thing as failure. Was Christ's life
          a failure? See how His parables are going through the earth to-day. It
          looked as if the apostles had made a failure, but see how much has
          been accomplished. If you read the book of Acts, you will see that
          every seeming failure in Acts was turned into a great victory. Moses
          wasn't going to fail, although Pharaoh said with contempt, "Who is God
          that I should obey Him?" He found out who God was. He found out that
          there was a God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Moses made another excuse, and said, "I am slow of speech, slow of
          tongue." He said he was
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>NOT AN ORATOR.</p>
        <p>
          My friends, we have too many orators. I am tired and sick of your
          "silver-tongued orators." I used to mourn because I couldn't be an
          orator. I thought, Oh, if I could only have the gift of speech like
          some men! I have heard men with a smooth flow of language take the
          audience captive, but they came and they went, their voice was like
          the air, there wasn't any <i>power</i> back of it; they trusted in
          their eloquence and their fine speeches. That is what Paul was
          thinking of when he wrote to the Corinthians: -- "My speech and my
          preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in
          demonstration of the Spirit and of power: that your faith should not
          stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a witness in court and let him try his oratorical powers in the
          witness-box, and see now quickly the judge will rule him out. It is
          the man who tells the plain, simple truth that has the most influence
          with the jury.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose that Moses had prepared a speech for Pharaoh, and had got his
          hair all smoothly brushed, and had stood before the looking -glass or
          had gone to an elocutionist to be taught how to make an oratorical
          speech and how to make gestures. Suppose that he had buttoned his
          coat, put one hand in his chest, had struck an attitude and begun:
        </p>
        <p>
          "The God of our fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has
          commanded me to come into the presence of the noble King of Egypt."
        </p>
        <p>
          I think they would have taken his head right off! They had Egyptians
          who could be as eloquent as Moses. It was not eloquence they wanted.
          When you see a man in the pulpit trying to show off his eloquence he
          is making a fool of himself and trying to make a fool of the people.
          Moses was slow of speech, but he had a message, and what God wanted
          was to have him deliver the message. But he insisted upon having an
          excuse. He didn't want to go; instead of being eager to act as
          heaven's messenger, to be God's errand boy, he wanted to excuse
          himself. The Lord humored him and gave him an interpreter, gave him
          Aaron.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if there is a stupid thing in the world, it is to talk through an
          interpreter. I tried it once in Paris. I got up into a little box of a
          pulpit with the interpreter -- there was hardly room enough for one. I
          said a sentence while he leaned away over to one side, and then I
          leaned over while he repeated it in French. Can you conceive of a more
          stupid thing than Moses going before Pharaoh and speaking through
          Aaron!
        </p>
        <p>
          But this slow-of-speech man became eloquent. Talk about Gladstone's
          power to speak! Here is a man one hundred and twenty years old, and he
          waxed eloquent, as we see in Deuteronomy xxxii:1-4:
        </p>
        <p>
          Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak;<br />And hear, O earth, the
          words of my mouth.<br />My doctrine shall drop as the rain,<br />My
          speech shall distil as the dew,<br />As the small rain upon the tender
          herb,<br />And as the showers upon the grass:<br />Because I will
          publish the name of the Lord:<br />Ascribe ye greatness unto our
          God.<br />He is the Rock, His work is perfect:<br />For all His ways
          are judgment:<br />A God of truth and without iniquity,<br />Just and
          right is He.
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned out to be one of the most eloquent men the world has ever
          seen. If God sends men and they deliver His message He will be with
          their mouth. If God has given you a message, go and give it to the
          people as God has given it to you. It is a stupid thing for a man to
          try to be eloquent. Make
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>YOUR MESSAGE, AND NOT YOURSELF,</p>
        <p>
          the most prominent thing. Don't be self-conscious Set your heart on
          what God has given you to do, and don't be so foolish as to let your
          own difficulties or your own abilities stand in the way. It is said
          that people would go to hear Cicero and would come away and say, "Did
          you ever hear anything like it? wasn't it sublime? wasn't it grand?"
          But they would go and hear Demosthenes, and he would fire them so with
          the subject that they would want to go and fight at once. They forgot
          all about Demosthenes, but were stirred by his message; that was the
          difference between the two men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next Moses said: "O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him
          whom thou wilt send."
        </p>
        <p>
          Did you ever stop to think what Moses would have lost if God had taken
          him at his word, and said:
        </p>
        <p>
          "Very well, Moses; you may stay here in the desert, and I will send
          Aaron, or Joshua, or Caleb!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't seek to be excused if God calls you to some service. What would
          the twelve disciples have lost if they had declined the call of Jesus!
          I have always pitied those other disciples of whom we read that they
          went back, and walked no more with Jesus. Think what Orpah missed and
          what Ruth gained by cleaving to Naomi's God! Her story has been
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>TOLD THESE THREE THOUSAND YEARS.</p>
        <p>
          Father, mother, sisters, brothers, the grave of her husband -- she
          turned her back on them all. Ruth, come back, and tell us if you
          regret your choice! No: her name shines one of the brightest among all
          the women that have ever lived. The Messiah was one of her
          descendants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moses, you come back and tell us if you were afterwards sorry that God
          had called you? I think that when he stood in glorified body on the
          Mount of Transfiguration with Jesus and Elijah, he did not regret it.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dear friends, God is not confined to any one messenger. We are told
          that He can raise up children out of stones. Some one has said that
          there are three classes of people, the "wills," the "won'ts," and the
          "can'ts"; the first accomplish everything, the second oppose
          everything, and the third fail in everything. If God calls you,
          consider it a great honor. Consider it a great privilege to have
          partnership with Him in anything. Do it cheerfully, gladly. Do it with
          all your heart, and He will bless you. Don't let false modesty or
          insincerity, self-interest, or any personal consideration turn you
          aside from the path of duty and sacrifice. If we listen for God's
          voice, we shall hear the call; and if He calls and sends us, there
          will be no such thing as failure, but success all along the line.
          Moses had glorious success because he went forward and did what God
          called him to do.
