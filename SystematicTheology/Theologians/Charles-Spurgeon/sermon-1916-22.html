        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.3514)</p>

        <p>Delivered by</p>

          "For the Lord shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places
          and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the
          garden of the Lord; joy and gladness shall be found therein,
          thanksgiving, and the voice of melody." -- Isaiah 51:3.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE pedigree of God's chosen nation Israel may be traced back to one
          man and one woman -- to Abraham and Sarah. Both of them were well
          stricken in years when the Lord called them, yet, in the fulfilment of
          his promise, he built up of their seed a great nation, which, for
          number, was comparable to the stars of heaven. Take heart, brethren;
          these things are written for our example and for our encouragement.
          His Church can never sink to so low an ebb that he cannot soon build
          her up again, nor in our own hearts can the work of grace ever decline
          so grievously that the same mighty power which once quickened cannot
          revive and restore us. Think of Abraham and Sarah, childless till they
          were old, then rejoicing in one son, who became their heir. Hence
          sprang the great multitude that peopled Palestine. With such a
          panorama unfolding before you, there is no excuse for despair; but you
          may find ten thousand reasons for confidence in God.
        </p>
        <p>
          With such preface the Lord proceeds to unfold to his people a series
          of delightful promises. As we have no time to spare, and no words to
          waste, we will plunge at once into the heart of the text, and observe,
          first, that you have before you: --
        </p>
        <p>I. HEAVENLY COMFORT PROMISED.</p>
        <p>
          This is a promise to God's Church. There are some who would have us
          always restrain Isaiah's prophecies to the Jews, as though this was
          their exclusive application. I have no objection to your so
          understanding them in their original and literal sense, nor have I any
          objection to our friends labouring for the Jews especially, as a
          class; far rather would I commend them. Only, I would have them
          recollect that no Scripture is of private interpretation that, in
          God's sight, neither Jews nor Gentiles are recognised under this
          dispensation of the gospel, for he has made both one in Christ Jesus.
          I, therefore, as a Christian minister, when I preach the gospel, know
          neither Jew nor Gentile, male nor female, bond nor free, but I simply
          know men as men, and go out into the world to "preach the gospel to
          every creature." It seems to me that this is the order in which God
          would have his Church carry out every evangelical enterprise,
          forgetting and ignoring all fleshly distinctions, understanding that
          now men are either sinners or saints. As to circumcision or
          uncircumcision, vast as its importance in the kingdom of Israel, it is
          of no account in the kingdom of God. The text, we believe, whatever
          may be its relation to the Jews as a people, belongs to the Church of
          God and the disciples of Christ; for "all things are yours." Zion was
          the stronghold of Jerusalem. Originally a fortress of the Jebusites,
          it was taken by a feat of arms by David and his valiant men. It became
          afterwards the residence of David, and there, too, was the residence
          of the Great King; for in it was built the temple which became the
          glory of all lands. Hence the Church of God -- which has been captured
          by Christ from the world, which is the palace where he dwells, which
          is the temple where he is worshipped -- is frequently called "Zion,"
          and the Zion of this passage, I believe, we are warranted in
          interpreting as the Church of the living God.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are told here, then, that the Lord will comfort his Church. Let the
          object of this comfort, therefore, engage your attention. "The Lord
          will comfort Zion." Well he may, for she is his chosen. "The Lord hath
          chosen Zion." He would have those upon whom his choice is fixed be
          glad and happy. The elect of a great king have cause for thankfulness,
          but the chosen of the King of Kings should rejoice continually in the
          God that chose them. He would have his Church rejoice because he has
          not only chosen her, but he has cleansed her. Jesus has put away the
          sin of his people by his blood, and by his Spirit he is daily renewing
          the nature of his children. Sin is the cause of sorrow, and when sin
          is put away sorrow shall be put away too. The sanctified should be
          happy. The Lord will, therefore, comfort them, because he cleansed
          them. The Church of God is placed where God dwells: --
        </p>
        <p>"Where God doth dwell sure heaven is there;</p>
        <p>And singing there should be."</p>
        <p>
          What can ye conceive of weeping and lamenting in the house where
          Jehovah dwelleth? It was a rule with one of the old monarchs that no
          one should come into his presence sad. In all our afflictions we may
          draw near to the Lord, but his presence should dispel our sorrow and
          sighing; for the children of Zion should be joyful in their King. If
          the Lord dwelleth in the midst of his people, there ought to be
          shootings of joy. The presence of the King of Heaven is the heaven of
          their delight. Moreover, Zion enjoys her Monarchs love, and therefore,
          he would have her comforted. We know not how dear to the heart of
          Christ his Church is, but we do know this: that for his Church he left
          his Father's house and came down to earth, and was poor, that she,
          through his poverty, might be made rich. A man leaveth father and
          mother, and cleaveth to his wife, and they become one flesh; but what
          shall I say of the great mystery of this glorious Lover, who left his
          Father's house, and did cleave unto his Church, and became one flesh
          with her that he might lift her up and set her upon his own throne,
          that she might reign with him as the Bride, the Lamb's Wife? Well may,
          therefore, the Lord desire his Church to be happy. Eternal love has
          fixed itself upon her. Eternal purposes cluster around her. Eternal
          power is sworn to protect her. Eternal faithfulness has guaranteed
          eternal life to all her citizens. Why should she not be comforted? I
          do not wonder that the text says the Lord will comfort the people whom
          he has thus favoured.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the Lord himself is the Comforter. "The Lord will comfort Zion."
          Beloved, we make but sorry comforters for God's people unless Jehovah
          puts his own hand to the work. I have sometime tried to cheer up my
          brethren when they have been desponding, and I hope not without
          success; yet I have always felt that to relieve and refresh a
          desponding saint, I must fetch the remedies from my Master's pharmacy.
          So, doubtless, those of you who have ever sought to obey the command,
          "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people," must have found that it was not
          your word that could comfort Zion, nor your sympathy, but God's truth
          applied by God' Spirit, for this alone can comfort Zion. Oh! blessed
          promise! "The Lord will comfort Zion; he will comfort her waste
          places." He that made the heavens will become the Comforter of his
          people. The Holy Ghost, who brooded over chaos, and brought order out
          of confusion; the mighty Spirit who came down at Pentecost in tongues
          of fire, with a sound like a mighty rushing wind -- that same blessed
          Spirit will come to the hearts of the members of his Church and
          comfort them. There are sorrows for which there is no solace within
          the reach of the creature; there is a ruin which it would baffle any
          mortal to retrieve. Happy for us that the Omnipotent comes to our aid.
          It is "he who telleth the number of the stars; calleth them all by
          their names"; who also "healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up
          their wounds!" Where he is, rolling the stars along, filling heaven
          with wonder as he creates majestic orbs, and keeps them in their
          pathways, making the comet fling its gorgeous light across space and
          startle nations, holding the burning furnace of the sun in the hollow
          of his hand; yet he stoops down to minister to a desponding spirit,
          and to pour the oil and wine of heavenly comfort into a poor
          distracted heart! Yes, it is Zion that is to be comforted, but it is
          Jehovah himself who has promised to be her Comforter!
        </p>
        <p>
          And how does the Lord propose to comfort Zion? If you read the verse
          through, you will find it is by making her fertile. He will turn her
          barren deserts into fruitful gardens, and her unproductive wilderness
          into a blooming Eden. The true way to comfort the Church is to build
          her synagogues, restore the desolation of former times, to sow her
          fields, plant her vineyards, make her soil fruitful, call out the
          industry of her sons and daughters, and fill them with lively, ardent
          zeal. There is an everlasting consolation for the Church in those
          grand doctrines of grace revealed to us in covenant, such as election,
          particular redemption, effectual calling, final perseverance, and the
          faithfulness of God. Resting in his love, God forbid that we should
          ever keep back these grand truths; they are the wells of salvation
          from which we rejoice to draw the water of life. But there are other
          truths besides these and we could not make full proof of our ministry
          if we overlooked the rain, even the former and the latter rain, which
          God gives in due season, or withholds in his chastening anger. I have
          often remarked that those persons who are always crying after the
          comfort that is to be derived from the stability of God's purpose are
          strangely lacking in that present joy and jubilant song which revels
          in the goodness of the Lord, who clothes the pastures with flocks, and
          covers the valleys over with corn. I have also remarked that the best
          way to make a Christian man happy is to make him useful, ploughing the
          fields which God has watered, and gathering the fruits which he has
          ripened. A Christian Church never enjoys so much concord, love, and
          happiness as when every member is kept hard at work for God, every
          soul upon the stretch of anxiety to do good and communicate, every
          disciple a good soldier of the Cross, fighting the common enemy. Thus
          the Lord will comfort Zion, and he comforts her by turning her desert
          into a garden, and her wilderness into Eden.
        </p>
        <p>
          And oh! my brethren, how happy is the Church when all the members are
          active, all the trees bearing fruit; when sinners are converted, and
          daily added to the fellowship of the saved; when, instead of the
          thorn, there comes up the myrtle, and instead of the briar, there
          comes up the fir-tree; when God is turning hard hearts, that were,
          like rocks, into good soil, where the corn of the Kingdom may grow.
          There is no joy like it! If you can be happy in seeking your own good,
          without caring for the welfare of others, I pity you. If a minister
          can be content to go on preaching without converts or baptisms, the
          Lord have mercy upon his miserable soul! Can he be a minister of
          Christ who does not win souls? A man might as well be a huntsman and
          never take any prey; a fisherman, and always come home with empty
          nets; a husbandman, and never reap a harvest! I wonder at some
          people's complacency. When God never blesses them, they never fail to
          bless themselves. "Divine sovereignty withholds the increase," they
          say. But it really is their idleness that tends to poverty. The
          promise of God is to the diligent, not the indolent. Let Paul plant,
          and let Apollos water, God will give the increase. It may not come
          to-day, nor to-morrow, nor the next day, but come it must. The Word
          cannot return unto God void. It must prosper in the thing whereto he
          has sent it. Had God sent us on a listless, bootless errand, we might
          well complain, but he doth not so. Only let us preach Jesus Christ
          with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, and we shall, doubtless,
          come again rejoicing, bringing our sheaves with us. Although when we
          went forth, we wept because of our inability and our want of
          confidence, yet this is the way in which God comforts us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The promise, you will observe, is given in words that contain an
          absolute pledge. He shall and he will are terms that admit of no
          equivocation. What an emphasis that man of God, the late Joseph Irons,
          used to lay on the words when he got hold of a "shall" and a "will"
          from, the mouth of the Lord! Though some people say we must not make
          too much of little words, I will venture to make as much as ever I can
          of these two potent monosyllables. "The Lord shall comfort Zion; the
          Lord will comfort all her waste places." How much better and brighter
          this reads than an "if," or a "but," or a "perhaps," or a
          "peradventure"! He shall comfort Zion. Oh! how those dear saints, the
          Covenanters, when they were hunted about, and fled into dens and
          caves, said, "Ah! but King Jesus will have his own; he shall comfort
          Zion!" And our Puritan forefathers, when priests threatened to harry
          them out of the land, could see with prophetic eye the time when the
          harlot church would yet be driven out, and the true, legitimate
          children of God would take her place; they could say, "The Lord shall
          comfort Zion," and they looked forward to happier halcyon days. No
          less did those glorious Albigenses and Waldenses, when they stained
          the snows of the Alps with their blood, feel confident that the Church
          of Rome would not gain the day, that God would yet return and avenge
          the blood of his martyred saints, and give the victory to his true
          people. And surely you and I may take comfort too. "The Lord shall
          comfort Zion; he will comfort her waste places." Brethren, there are
          brighter days to come. The day breaketh, and the shadows flee away!
          Our hope is in God. Never doubt the true progress of the Church.
          Believe that, notwithstanding every discouragement that checks our
          progress, the cause of God goes on; it must go on, and it shall go on,
          till King Jesus is universally acknowledged King of Kings and Lord of
          Lords. We have not to serve a master who cannot take care of his own.
          To your tents, ye Philistines, when the God of Israel comes to the
          battle! Where will ye be? Your ranks are broken; ye flee like thin
          clouds before a Biscay gale! When God comes forth he has but by his
          Spirit to blow upon his enemies, and they fly before him, like the
          chaff before the wind. The Lord shall and the Lord will; who, then,
          shall disannul it? Though foes may hoot and fiends may howl, he will
          keep his word; it shall come to pass, and he will get to himself
          renown in fulfilling his own good pleasure. Having thus enlarged upon
          the heavenly comfort promised, we proceed to notice the: --
        </p>
        <p>II. MOURNFUL CASES FAVOURED.</p>
        <p>
          "He will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden
          of the Lord. "Now are there not to be found in the visible Church
          persons whose character is here vividly depicted? I think there are
          three sorts of people in such a case, to all of whom I trust the
          blessing will come. There are those who once were fruitful, but are
          now comparable to wastes. If God should visit his Church, he will be
          pleased to comfort the waste places. Do I not address some who must
          needs recognise their own portrait? You used to be church members, and
          then you did seem to run well; what did hinder you? You were,
          apparently, brave soldiers once, but you deserted and went over to the
          enemy. Still, if you are the Lord's people, one of the signs of God's
          grace to his Church will be the recovery of backsliders. I remember
          one Monday afternoon, when we had been waiting upon the Lord in prayer
          ever since seven o'clock in the morning, that there came a most
          remarkable wave of prayer over the assembly. And then two backsliders
          got up and prayed, one after the other. According to their own
          account, they had been very bad fellows indeed, and had sorely
          transgressed against God; but there they were, broken-hearted and
          fairly broken down. It was a sight to make angels rejoice as their
          tears flowed. Certainly their sobs and cries touched the hearts of all
          of us who were assembled. I thought to myself, "Then God is blessing
          us, for when backsliders come back it is a proof that God has visited
          his people." You recollect when it was that Naomi returned to Israel
          with Ruth, her daughter-in-law. They never came back during the time
          of famine; they stopped in Moab then, but they came back when they
          heard that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread. Even
          then Naomi said, "Call me not Naomi." She seemed to come back from her
          exile groaning and full of bitterness, and yet she came back because
          God was with his people. Backsliders, come back, come now, for God is
          with his Church, and he has promised to comfort her waste places. Oh!
          you who have forgotten your Lord, remember your first Husband! It was
          better with you then than now. Though you have gone astray, yet the
          Lord saith, "Return, thou backsliding Israel, for I am married unto
          you, saith the Lord." You may break the marriage bond with God, but he
          will not break it with you. He claims that he is married to you, and
          he bids you return to him. I hope that some backslider will be
          encouraged by this promise to return, with full purpose of heart, to
          the God of his salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then a second department of the promise is, "He will make her
          wilderness like Eden." I take the wilderness here to be a place of
          scanty vegetation. The Oriental wildernesses are not altogether barren
          sand, but there is a feeble herbage which struggles for existence. We
          are told, you recollect, that "Moses kept his father's sheep in the
          wilderness." Oh! how many there are in the Church of God who are just
          like that! They are Christians, but sorry Christians they are. They do
          love the Lord Jesus Christ, but it is with a moonlight love, cold,
          very cold, and chill. They have light, but it is dim and hazy. If they
          do anything for Christ, their service is scanty; their contribution
          mean; their charity grudging. They bring him no sweet cane with money.
          They do not fill him with the fat of their sacrifices, but they make
          him to serve with their sins, and they weary him with their
          iniquities. Ah! dear friend, if thou art indeed a child of God, then
          there is this comfort for thee. We will make her wilderness like Eden.
          Even you who have borne so little for God shall yet be visited, and
          made fruitful when the Lord comforts his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          A third character is implied in the desert -- the deserted places
          where no man dwells, where the traveller does not care to linger :How
          many professors of religion, how many who attend our chapels, answer
          to this description of the soil! They are like deserts. You not only
          never did bring forth fruit, but you never concerned yourself to do
          so. No man seems to care for you, and you appear to yourselves as
          though you were like the sand, which it would be a hopeless task to
          plough, for the gleaner would never fill his hand from the produce,
          much less the reaper his bosom with the sheaves. Ah! well, but God has
          a word for these desert souls. He will make her desert like the garden
          of the Lord. I pray -- nay, I know -- that during the gracious season
          which God has given us we shall see many a desert heart made to
          blossom like the rose. These be they whom the Lord will specially<br />transform
          -- backsliders, scanty Christians, and those who have often heard, but
          never yet proved the power of the gospel at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ask ye now, what does the Lord say he will do for them? He says (hear
          it and marvel!) that he will make the wilderness like Eden. You know
          what Eden was. It was the garden of the earth in the days of primeval
          purity. Fruit and flower, lofty tree, and lively vegetation abounded
          there in profuse luxuriance. I know not how its groves and shrubberies
          were tenanted by graceful creatures and lovely birds, but I can well
          imagine that every sense of man was regaled by its unfailing charms.
          No thorns or thistles cursed the soil, no sweating brow with arduous
          toll forced the crops from barren sods. The land laughed with plenty.
          The river, branching into many heads, watered the garden. God himself
          was pleased to water it with the mists, and to make the fruits grow,
          to swell in rich abundance, and early come to mature perfection. So
          the Lord says that when he visits his Church he will make these poor
          backsliders, these immature Christians, these nominal professors, like
          Eden. Oh! that the Lord would do it! Oh! that he would make them
          healthy, fruitful, prolific in fruitfulness, and spontaneously
          fruit-bearing, so that we should almost have need to say, "Hold,
          Lord!" just as Moses and Aaron did when the people brought in the
          offerings for the Tabernacle, until there were more than enough. Oh!
          that the Church of Christ may be enriched with all spiritual gifts,
          with all heavenly graces, with all that can minister to the welfare of
          the saints, to the advantage of the world, and to the glory of him who
          created and redeemed us! God grant it may be so!
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, as if to strengthen the volume of his grace and our hope, he
          says that he will make her desert like the garden of the Lord. He
          shall come to you and delight your heart and soul with his converse.
          If ever you should be an Eden, you shall be like to Paradise for a yet
          higher reason, because your fellowship shall be with the Father and
          with his Son, Jesus Christ. There shall be upon you the smell of a
          field that the Lord hath blessed. The Lord shall water his Church,
          shall water it every moment. He shall make fat our bones, and cause us
          to be as a watered garden, as a well of water whose waters fail not.
          Oh! some of you may well envy those happy days you once enjoyed! Would
          you like them back again? Then plead with God the promise of the text.
          You were once blessed with nearness to, and communion with, Christ.
          You once prayed with fervour, and your souls prospered. Go to God with
          this promise and say, "Lord, I am a desert; I am a wilderness; I am a
          waste place; but comfort thy Church, and let me partake of the
          consolation by making me fruitful in every good word, and work to thy
          glory!" The Lord will do it, for the promises of God shall certainly
          be fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who but Jehovah himself can do this? I have already noted this. "He
          will make her wilderness like Eden." It is he only that can perform
          it. The minister cannot. The Church cannot, with all her efforts. Talk
          of getting up a revival! It were insufferable arrogance to make the
          attempt. It belongeth not to us to do this. Unto the Lord our God
          alone doth this belong. "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit,
          saith the Lord." If he will but visit his Church, then we shall see
          the wilderness rejoice, but if not, we may plough, as is our duty, and
          we may work upon it, as is our calling, but there shall be no joy and
          no rejoicing. We conclude with the view of: --

        <p>III. CERTAIN DESIRABLE RESULTS WHICH ARE PREDICTED.</p>
        <p>
          "Joy and gladness shall be found therein; thanksgiving and the voice
          of melody." You notice the doubles. The parallelism of Hebrew poetry,
          perhaps, necessitated them. Still. I am prone to remember how John
          Bunyan says that "all the flowers in God's garden bloom double." We
          are told of "manifold mercies," that is, mercies which are folded up
          one in another, so that you may unwrap them and find a fresh mercy
          enclosed in every fold. Here we have "joy and gladness, thanksgiving
          and the voice of melody." Just so; the Psalmist tells us of our soul
          being satisfied with "marrow and fatness" -- two things. Elsewhere he
          speaks of "loving-kindness and tender mercy" -- two things again. The
          Lord multiplies his grace. He is always slow to anger, but he is
          always lavish of his grace. See here, then, God will give his people
          an overflowing joy, an inexpressible joy, a sort of double joy, as
          though he would give them more joy than they could hold -- joy and
          then gladness -- ,thanksgiving and the voice of melody.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! what a delightful thing must a, visitation from God be to his
          Church! Without God, all she can do is to groan. Nay, she will not
          always do that. She sometimes indulges a foolish conceit, and says, "I
          am rich and increased in goods, and have need of nothing." After that
          will Soon be heard the hooting of dragons and the cry of owls. Let God
          visit his Church, and there is sure to be thanksgiving and the voice
          of melody. It has been remarked that all revivals of true religion in
          ancient as well as modern times have been attended by revival of
          psalmody and song. The joy that makes the heart grateful, enlivens the
          spirits, and diffuses happiness, will seek and must find some tuneful
          strains. Not to speak of the Hebrew Psalter or of the Greek Hymnals,
          in Luther's day his translation of the Psalms and his chorales did
          more, perhaps, to make the Reformation popular than even his
          preaching, for the ploughman at his field-labour, and the housewife at
          the cradle, would sing one of Luther's Psalms; so, too, in our own
          country, in Wycliffe's day, fresh psalms and hymns were scattered all
          over the land. And you know how, in the last century, Wesley and
          Whitefield gave a new impetus to congregational singing. The hymns
          were printed on little fly-sheets after each sermon, and at length
          these units swelled into a volume. Collections and selections of hymns
          were published. So fond, indeed, were the Methodists of singing, that
          it became a taunt and a by-word to speak of them as canting
          Psalm-singers. But this is the mark of a revived church everywhere.
          New impetus is given to the service of song. When the Bridegroom is
          gone we may well mourn and fast, and hang our harps on the willows; it
          is when the Bridegroom cometh that joy and feasting seek the aid of
          vocal music, and the people of God break forth into thanksgiving with
          the voice of melody. I do fervently hope, beloved, that we shall have
          this thanksgiving, and this voice of melody in our midst for many a
          day to come! Would God that all the churches enjoyed it! Need I say
          that from all parts of the country there are, tokens of it now? We do
          not desire at any time a monopoly of blessing. May every Christian
          denomination and every Christian community be favoured with the dew of
          heaven, and have their roots watered by that river which is full of
          water. Oh! that all the Churches of Christ were fruitful! Instead of
          wishing any of them to be weak, I would say, with Moses, "Would God
          that all the Lord's people were prophets," and that the Lord would put
          his Spirit upon them! Oh! that Jesus might be extolled from the
          uttermost parts of the earth to the highest heavens! Brethren, let us
          ask God to fulfil this promise to the Church at large. Let us say to
          him, "Lord, comfort thy Zion! She has many waste places -- comfort
          her! Thou knowest she has many barren spots -- turn them into gardens
          of the Lord! Oh! let the heavenly rain descend, and the divine dew
          come from thee, that the wilderness and the solitary place may yet be
          glad!"
        </p>
        <p>
          But what shall I say to those of you who are not saved? If you want to
          become as these gardens of the Lord, it is only the grace of God which
          bringeth salvation that can work in you this mighty change. Look to
          the Lord. He it is who must do it. He hears prayer. A negro was once
          sent by his master on an errand that did not suit him; he did not want
          to go. So when he came to a river he turned back, and said, "Master, I
          came to a river; and I could not swim across it." "Well, but was there
          not a ferryboat?" "Yes, there was a ferry-boat, but the man was on the
          other side." "Well," said the master, "did you call to the ferry-man
          to come and take you across?" No; he did not think of doing that, for,
          as he did not wish to go over, he was glad to find an excuse. Now it
          is true, sinner, that you cannot save yourself, but there is One who
          can. There is a ferry-boat and there is a Ferry-man. Cry to him! Cry
          to him, "Master, across this river be pleased to take me; I cannot
          swim it, but thou canst bear me over it. Oh! do for me what I cannot
          do for myself. Make me to be accepted in the Beloved!" If you seek the
          Lord, he will be found of you. He never did set a soul a-seeking but
          what he meant to bless it. But if you will not seek, what should be
          said of you but that on your head should lie your own blood? I know
          many of you to be greatly impressed this week. I hope the impression
          will not be blown away, like smoke out of a chimney. May God make a
          deep work in your souls! Oh! some of you were easily impressed, but
          you quite as easily forgot the impression. You are like Ephraim's cake
          that was baked on one side; you do not get thoroughly cooked. You do
          not feel the power of the gospel permeating your whole nature in every
          part. You are like a cake not turned, and God accepts you not because
          of this. Oh! that there might be a thorough work of the Spirit in your
          souls, a work of grace that should bring you to Jesus to be rooted and
          built up in him and established in the faith, abounding therein with
          thanksgiving. Amen.<br />
