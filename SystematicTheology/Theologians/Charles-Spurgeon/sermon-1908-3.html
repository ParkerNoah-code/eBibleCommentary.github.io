        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.3116)</p>
        <p>Published on Thursday, October 29th, 1908.</p>

        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>On Lord's-day Evening, October 8th, 1865.</p>
        <p>
          |And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold,
          there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them
          both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.| -- 2
          Kings 2:11.
        </p>
        <p>
          IT seems to me that the departure of Elijah from the world, though of
          course he did not |die| at all, may furnish us with a very good type
          of the decease of those saints who, although taken away on a sudden,
          are not without some previous intimation that in such a manner they
          will be removed. There may be some such here. They may know that they
          have about them a disease which, in all probability, will terminate
          fatally and suddenly. Others of us may have no idea at present, that
          there is prepared for us a sudden death and sudden glory. We would not
          shrink from such a death if it were the Lord's will that it should be
          ours. Nay, some of us would gladly reach out our hands, and grasp so
          happy a mode of departure. It has always seemed to us to be the
          preferable way of leaving this world, not to be long sick and
          disabled, a weariness to those who nurse us, and a torment to
          ourselves, but on a sudden to shut our eyes on earth, and open them on
          the splendors of heaven. So to die would be, we think, a blessed mode
          of resting from our labors and entering into the presence of our Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Taking Elijah's case as a guide, we propose to-night to say a few
          words -- and may God make them to edification! -- about PREPARING FOR
          OUR DEPARTURE, which really is so near that it is time we began to
          talk about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is much nearer to us than we think. To those of you who have passed
          fifty, sixty, or seventy years of age, it must, of necessity, be very
          near. To others of us who are in the prime of life, it is not far off,
          for I suppose we are all conscious that time flies more swiftly with
          us now than ever it did. The years of our youth seem to have been
          twice as long as the years are now that we are men. It was but
          yesterday that the buds began to swell and burst, and now the leaves
          are beginning to fall, and soon we shall be expecting to see old
          winter taking up his accustomed place. The years whirl along so fast
          that we cannot see the months which, as it were, make the spokes of
          the wheel. The whole thing travels so swiftly that the axle thereof
          grows hot with speed. We are flying, as on some mighty eagle's wing,
          swiftly on towards eternity. Ltt us, then, talk about preparing to
          die. It is the greatest thing we have to do, and we have soon to do it
          so let us talk and think something about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what should we do when we are preparing to die? Well, we may spend
          some little time in leave-taking. We have some friends who have been
          very dear to us, and we may almost begin to bid them |good-bye.| When
          we feel that death is really coming, we may spare a little season to
          say to a friend, |I beseech thee now to leave me.| There will be some
          who, like Elisha with Elijah, have been with us during life, and who
          will not leave us tin the very last moment of death. Yet, in the
          prospect of our departure, we must learn to hold all things with a
          loose hand. Why should I grip so fast that which death must and will
          tear from me? Why should I set my affections so ardently upon a dying
          thing that will melt before my eyes? I cannot carry it with me when I
          am called to go. There are, it is true, dear ones who will not leave
          us, but who will live in our hearts and permit us to live in their
          hearts till the last hour shall come, and longer still. But we must
          begin even now to prepare for our departure by reminding them, and
          reminding ourselves likewise, that these friendships must be broken,
          that these unions must be snapped, at least for a season, hopeful
          though we may be that we shall enjoy them again on the other side the
          Jordan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next thing we ought to do, and as it seems to me even more
          important, is to go and see about our work. If we have a feeling at
          all that we are going home, let us set our house in order. What did
          Elijah do? He went to the two colleges he had founded at Bethel and at
          Jericho, and of which he was their principal instructor, and he
          addressed the young men once more before he was taken from them. I
          should like to have been a student there to have listened to the
          Professor's last lecture. I warrant you that it was not an ordinary
          one. There was nothing in it dry, dusty, dead, and dreary. O friends,
          I think I hear the prophet charging them as before God, and before his
          holy angels, to rebuke the sin of the age in which they lived. |I went
          to the top of Carmel,| said he, |and the priests of Baal were gathered
          about me, and I laughed them to scorn; I poured sarcasms upon their
          heads; I said to them concerning Baal, 'Cry aloud, for he is a God;
          and while they cut themselves with knives and with lancets I mockingly
          said to them, 'Peradventure he hunteth, or he stepeth, and needeth to
          be awaked by louder cries;' I laughed to scorn their reapings upon the
          altar; and then, when I bowed my knees, and cried for fire to come
          from heaven, those same skies, which my faith had shut up so that no
          rain fell upon the sinful Israelites' land, now cast forth fire at my
          word; and then I took the prophets of Baal, I let not one of them
          escape; I slew them by the brook Kishon, and made the brook run
          blood-red with their gore, because they had led astray the people of
          God, and had defied the name of the Most High. Now, young, men,| said
          he, |be ye faithful even unto death; go ye and teach the people,
          whether they will hear or whether they will forbear; pull down their
          idols, and exalt Jehovah, and speak ye as men who are sent by him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          You, dear friends, are not called to teach students as I am, so I
          speak with earnest sympathy when I say that, next to dying in the
          pulpit, the thing I would choose would be to die amongst those
          brethren whom I often seek to stir up to fidelity in the Master's
          cause. But you may well desire that, before you depart, all your
          various works should come under review. Sunday-school teachers, call
          your children together; let your addresses to them be those of dying
          men and women. You who can and do conduct our Bible-classes, dear and
          honored brothers and sisters, there are many souls committed
          constantly to your care; clear yourselves of their blood so that you
          may go to your beds to-night, and every night, as though you were
          going to your tomb, and feel that you fell asleep on that bed as you
          would wish to fall asleep when your last sleeping hour must come. Let
          us each see to the various works we have in hand, so that we leave
          nothing out of place. Is there one soul we ought to have spoken to
          that we have not yet pleaded with for the Master? Let us do it now. Is
          there any field of usefulness which we ought to have ploughed, and
          does the ploughshare still lie rusting in the furrow? Let us go and
          begin to plough this very night, or, at least, when to-morrow's sun
          has risen. We have so little time to live, let us live like dying men.
          A certain lady, staying in their parish of that devoted minister, Mr.
          Cecil, was asked by him to undertake some particular work. She
          answered him |My dear sir, I should he very glad to do it but I am not
          certain of being in the parish more than three months| |Ah!| said he,
          |I am not certain of being in the parish three hours, and yet I go on
          with my duty, and I pray you, madam, to go on with you.| Let us look
          at our time, not as having a great deal of it, but as having so
          little. Beza said to his scribe, as he was translating the Gospel of
          John, |Write fast; write fast, for I am dying.| Then when he had got
          to the last verse, he said, |Now shut up the book, and leave me alone
          a minute,| and he fell back, and entered into glory. Work hard; the
          candle is nearly burned out, and you have not finished that garment
          yet! Work hard, for you have not another candle to light when that one
          is gone!
        </p>
        <p>
          When Elijah had taken leave of Elisha, and had addressed the students,
          the next thing was to cross the Jordan. With his mantle he smote the
          waters, and passed through them, and then, as it were, they shut him
          out from all the world except Elisha. I think I would like, if I might
          have notice of the day of my dying, to get away from the world alone.
          What does a dying man want with business? A man who has to die had
          need shut up the ledger, and keep open that blessed book which shall
          be as God's rod and shaft to comfort him in the valley of the shallow
          of death. It is a happy circumstance for some of my friends, whom I
          look upon almost with envy, that they have ended the activities of
          life before death, and have now a little season in which, as it were,
          they have got on the verge of Jordan, and are resting, except that
          they are doing the Lord's work diligently, -- resting from the world,
          and preparing to enter into glory. John Bunyan very graphically
          describes this state, when he tells us of what he calls |the country
          of Beulah, whose air was very sweet, and pleasant, and the way lying
          directly through it, the pilgrims solaced themselves there for a
          season. Yea, here they heard continually the singing of birds, and saw
          every day the flowers appear in the earth, and heard the voice of the
          turtle in the land. In this country the sun shineth night and day;
          wherefore this was beyond the Valley of the Shallow of Death, and also
          out of the reach of Giant Despair, neither could they from, this place
          so much as see Doubting Castle. Here they were within sight of the
          city they were going to, also here met them some of the inhabitants
          thereof; for in this land the Shining Ones commonly walked, because it
          was upon the borders of heaven.| They heard the melody of the upper
          spheres while they were still here below. This is a blessed terminus
          of our earthly life. Did not the prophet indicate it, when he said,
          |At evening time, it shall be light.| When you have got home from
          business lately, how you have enjoyed those splendid evenings that we
          have been having, so fair, so calm, so bright! You know that the day
          must die, and that the dew would weep its fall; but, oh! its dying
          hours were so pleasant! There was no sun-heat to broil you, no dust
          nor whirl of care to vex you, but the evening seemed a beautiful
          preparation for your going to your beds. Well, if one might choose,
          one would like to have just such a season as that; and though there
          are but few grey hairs on the heads of some of us, I am not quite sure
          that we might not begin this happy time sooner than most people do. I
          do not mean by laying aside work, but by laying aside unbelief; not by
          giving up toil, but by giving up carking care. Why should I fret and
          worry myself when I am young any more than when I am old? My father's
          God is my God, and he who will make the land as Beulah to me when I
          come to die, can make it so even now if I have but that childlike
          confidence which can sing, --
        </p>
        <p>All my times are in thy hand,</p>
        <p>All events at thy command.|</p>
        <p>
          Imitate Luther's little bird, that used to sit on the tree, and sing
          so him. Nobody else could interpret its notes, or tell what it said,
          but to Luther it sang, --
        </p>
        <p>|Mortal, cease from care and sorrow,</p>
        <p>God provideth for the morrow.|</p>
        <p>
          Elijah teaches us another thing by which we may prepare for our
          departure. He said to his friend Elisha, |Ask what I shall do for
          thee.| Quick, then, brother, quick; if you have anything you can do
          for your friends, do it now. |Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it
          with thy might.| If you do not ask your friends what you shall do,
          think what you can do for them. Mother, you would like to pray with
          that dear child of yours; then do it soon, for the hour of your
          departure is at hand. Friend, you would like to do a kind action to
          that struggling brother, then do is soon for you my be gone tomorrow.
          You have thought of something that you would like to do for Christ's
          cause. Perhaps there is a destitute village where you would like to
          have the gospel preached, and you want to make some provision for it;
          then do it soon, do it soon, or the resolve may never be able to ripen
          into action. How many infants that might have grown up to be spiritual
          giants, have been strangled by our procrastination! You nurse the
          little child of resolve, but seldom does it grow into the man of
          practical action. Get about it, get about, it now! You cannot help
          your friend when you have once gone up in your chariots of fire, so
          help him now, and let him tell you what you shall do for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then notice that Elijah and Elisha were talking as they went on, and
          holding communion with each other. Old Bishop Hall says they must have
          been talking of some very solemn and heavenly subjects, or else one
          would have thought that they would have been on their knees praying
          instead of talking; but he very properly adds, that |sometimes
          mediation is best and sometimes conversation.| So was it in their
          case. Elijah had a great deal to say to Elisha; he was about to leave
          the State and the Church in very perilous times, so he talked fast to
          the man who was to bear the burden and heat of the day, and poured the
          whole case into his ear; and no doubt Elisha asked him many questions,
          and was informed by him upon many knotty points, and so |they still
          went on, and talked.| Let our talk always be like their talk, and then
          it will be well to die talking. |They that feared the Lord spake often
          one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard.| Brethren, I say,
          and I am afraid I may well say it with tears, that much of our
          conversation would not do for God to hear, and though he does hear it,
          yet it would not do for him to write a book of remembrance concerning
          it, for it would be better far that it should be blotted out. Oh! when
          the last solemn hour shall come, may we be found --
        </p>
        <p>|Wrapt in meditation high,</p>
        <p>Hymning our great Creator's praise;| --</p>
        <p>
          or else conversing with our brethren here below, so that we may go
          from the communion of the Church militant to that of the Church
          triumphant, and take away our lip from the human ear to begin to speak
          to ears immortal before the starry throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are the different methods by which we may prepare to die. Some
          people, when they fancy they are going to die, think the only thing
          they can do to prepare for death is to send for the parson, |take the
          sacrament,| as they call it, get upstairs, not see anybody, and draw
          the curtain. The best way for a Christian to die is in harness. If I
          were a soldier, methinks I would sooner die in battle in the hour of
          victory than I would die in the trenches doing nothing, rotting in
          idleness for want of work to do. Let us just push on, and may it be
          said of us when we are gone, he did --
        </p>
        <p>His body with his charge lay down,</p>
        <p>And ceased at once to work and live.|</p>
        <p>So was it with Elijah; so may it be with us!</p>
        <p>
          II. THIS DEPARTURE OF ELIJAH appears to melee in some measure SYMBOLIC
          OF THE DEATHS OF BELIEVERS.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was sudden, though expected. They were talking, and just in the
          middle of a sentence, perhaps, they were parted. There was no noises,
          for the wheels of that chariot moved not on earth, but its brightness
          shone around them. They looked back, and they saw strange steeds,
          whose eyeballs flashed with flame, and whose necks were clothed with
          thunder; and behind them was a chariot brighter than the golden car in
          which the Caesars rode, for it was a car of fire, and Elijall knew it
          was one of the chariots of God, which are twenty thousand, that he had
          sent to take his favourite servant up to the ivory palaces, where the
          King himself dwells. It was sudden; the parting came in a moment; and
          I suppose that death is usually sudden. Even though persons may be, as
          we say, long dying, yet the actual moment of departure comes suddenly.
          The bowl is broken with a crash, and the silver cord is loosed; the
          chain is snapped, and the eagle mounts to dwell in the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          How terrible! -- a chariot of fire, and horses of fire. Even to a
          Christian, death is not a soft, dainty being. To die is no child's
          play. We speak of it, as a sleep; but it is no such sleep as yon
          youngster's, when he lies down upon the sunny bank to wake again.
          There are solemnities about it. There are, horses and there are
          chariots, and so far there is comfort; but they are all of fire, and
          he that sees them need have Elijah's eyes, or perhaps his own will
          blink. Elijah had seen fire before; he had called it from heaven upon
          his enemies; he had brought it down from heaven upon his sacrifice; he
          had seen fire flashing on him at Horeb, then the whole sky was blight,
          with sheets of forked flame, but the Lord was not in that fire as he
          was in this. He who had looked at that former fire, and feared not,
          could bear to look upon the horses and chariots of fire which God had
          sent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though terrible, how triumphant! Oh, what splendor, to ride to heaven
          in a chariot! No foot-passenger wading through Jordan's stream, and
          going up dripping on the other bank to be met by the shining ones.
          That is bright and glorious. The good dreamer of Bedford Gaol dreamed
          well when he dreamed that; but this is more triumphant still, -- to
          mount the car, and stand erect, and ride up to the throne of God,
          drawn thither by horses of fire! It is given to but few to have this
          experience; and yet, what am I saying? Have we not all the like
          experience? Shall we not all have it when, in the image of Christ
          Jesus, we shall mount with him to our eternal rest? Yes, he will come
          again, and all his people with him; and if Jesus shall ride on the
          white horse of victory, his saints shall ride on white horses too, and
          shall enter through the gates into the city amidst resounding
          acclamations. Yes, to die is triumph to the Christian. It seems to me
          that it was an act of faith, on the part of Elijah, to mount that
          fiery chariot; and we may say of him as it was said of Enoch, |By
          faith he was translated that he should not see death; and he was not,
          for God took him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, horses of fire and chariots of fire are no bad image of the
          departure of the blessed when they are called to enter into the joy of
          their Lord. As for us, we have not got to heaven yet; our turn has not
          come, though we are ready to say, --
        </p>
        <p>|Oh that we now might grasp our Guide!|</p>
        <p>Oh that the worst were given!</p>
        <p>Come, Lord of hosts, the waves divide,</p>
        <p>And land us all in heaven!|</p>
        <p>
          III. But while we remain behind, let us ask, WHAT OUGHT WE TO DO WHO
          HAVE SEEN ANY DIE LIKE THIS?
        </p>
        <p>
          If we have lost wife, or husband, or child, or friend, in this sudden
          way, what ought we to do? You see what Elisha did. First of all, he
          rent his clothes, which was the Eastern mode of showing his grief.
          Well, you may weep, for |Jesus wept.| Do not think there is any sin in
          sorrowing over departed friends, for the Lord never denies to us those
          human feelings which are rather kindly than vicious. Had there been
          death before the Fall, I could imagine even perfect, Adam weeping at
          the loss of Eve; nay, he would have been no perfect man if he could
          have lost his spouse, and not have wept. |Jesus wept;| we regard him
          all the more as Jesus because he wept; and you could not be like Jesus
          unless you wept too. The gospel does not make us Stoics; it makes us
          Christians. Still, you must remember that there is a moderation in
          grief. The Quaker was right who, when he saw a lady fretting on the
          sofa some year or so after her husband was dead, still harboring grief
          without a token of resignation, said to her, |Madam, I see you have
          not forgiven God yet.| Sometimes grief is not a sacred feeling, but
          only a murmur of rebellion against the Most High.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, you may rend your garments; and if you like, you may do a little
          more. Elisha not only rent his garments, but be cried |My father, my
          father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof,| and in doing
          this he eulogized his departed friend. He seemed to say, |He has been
          a father to me; I have lost one who was very tender to me, one who
          trained me, and watched over me, and fostered me as a father.| Oh,
          speak well of the departed! You need not 'bate your kind words about
          your dead friends. We speak little enough that is good of one another
          while we are living; I wish we sometimes said a little more, not by
          way of flattery, but by way of commendation, which might cheer
          depressed and burdened spirits; but you need not be afraid of speaking
          flatteringly, so as to hurt the dead who have gone to glory, for they
          will not be injured by what you say. If those who have departed were
          of value to the Church of God, you may say of them, |The chariot of
          Israel, and the horsemen thereof!| You may wonder who will lead the
          Church now; you may question how things will go on; who will be the
          horses to drag the car, or where will now be the Chariot in which
          weary spirits may be made to ride.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, you may both grieve and eulogize. Weep well and speak well, but
          then, what next? Do not stand there, and waste your time; do not stop
          there, and let your eyes see nothing. See, there is something falling.
          What is it that is dropping from the sky. It is no meteor. Elisiha's
          eyes are fixed on it; he finds that it is the old mantle that the
          prophet used to throw about his shoulders, and he picks it up
          joyfully; and our friends, who have gone from us, have left their
          mantles too. What are these mantles? Sometimes good men leave their
          books and sermons behind them, but all Christian people leave their
          good examples. Now, do not stand and weep then you forget the goodness
          of the departed, but go and take their mantles up. Were they earnest?
          Be you earnest. Were they humble? Be you humble. Were they prayerful?
          Be you prayerful; and so, in each case, shall you wear their mantle.
          They have left their example for you to follow; they are not gone that
          you may superstitiously reverence them, but they have departed that
          you may earnestly imitate them. As far as they followed Christ, do you
          follow them, and so wear their mantle.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when you have got their mantle, do not waste precious time in
          lamentations about them any more; get to your business. There is a
          river in your way; what then? Well, go to the Jordan as the prophet
          Elisha did, and try to pass it. Say not, |Where is Elijah?| but |Where
          is the Lord God of Elijah?| Elijah is gone, but his God is not; Elijah
          has gone away, but Jehovah is present, still. Now then, Christians,
          you have to take up the work of the departed; take it up in the
          strength of the same God who made them mighty, and strive to do the
          same works that they did. If they divided Jordan, do you divide
          Jordan. You have their example to show you how to do it, and their God
          is |the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Ask ye now, |Where did Elisha go after he had divided Jordan?| Did he
          go to seek out Elijah --
        </p>
        <p>|In some vast wilderness,</p>
        <p>Some boundless contiguity of shade;</p>
        <p>Where rumor of -- |</p>
        <p>
          bereavements and of death might never reach him more? Not he! He went
          straight away to the place where Elijah used to be the head of the
          college, and there took up Elijah's work. Were I a soldier, with
          courage for the armor of any mind, and valor for the enterprise of my
          life, a soldier of that class which Baxter describes as carrying their
          lives in their hands, and the grace of God in their hearts, then
          surely, when I saw a man just in front of me fall, I should step
          forward, and take his place. That is what you should do. If there is a
          good man dead, fill up the gap. If there is a saint departed, be you,
          as it were, |baptized for the dead.| Seek to have the blessing of God
          upon you, so that you may have a double portion of his spirit, and may
          be able to take the place in the ranks, or the council, which he who
          is gone has vacated. Your business is not in the closet of mourning,
          but in the field of service. There is work to be done yet; there is
          work to so done yet; up, and do it! That was a brave thing in Richard
          Cobden's life, at the time when his whole soul was taken up with the
          subject of free trade, and the breaking of the chains of commerce, the
          young wife of his friend, John Blight, died, and God went to him, and
          said, |Now, Bright, you have lost your wife, and we will heal your
          sorrow by fighting the nation's battle;| and the thing was indeed well
          and bravely done. So, if you have lost a dear friend, heal your sorrow
          by giving yourself more earnestly than ever to God's cause, and to the
          propagation of |the truth as it is in Jesus.| There is nothing like
          activity, nothing like having the hands full, to keep the heart
          bright, and to keep the soul happy. You are dullards, you who have
          nothing to do: you fret and fume, and rebel, instead of fighting for
          you Lord; but if you would only go up |to the help of the Lord against
          the mighty,| and would bear his burdens, he would help you to bear
          yours, and the sorrow that now seems as a knife in your bones would be
          as a spur to your activity. |I vowed,| said one, |that I would be
          avenged on death for all the damage that he had done to me, and so I
          smote him right and left with the fiery sword of the Spirit, which is
          the Word of God; I preached the immortality that there is in Christ
          Jesus, and so I was avenged of death, and felt that I had conquered
          him.| So do you; go and serve your Master still, and though Elija may
          depart, yet you shall fill up his place, and God's horsemen and
          chariots shall not be wanting.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, dear friends, in parting for the night, it is meet for us to
          say, |Farewell for this night, then we meet again in the morning.|
          But, sometimes, this parting may be very significant, and therefore
          let us say, |Farewell,| with the thought that some of us may never
          look each other in the face again. I hope we can truly say,
          |Farewell!| and then we shall meet in the morning, when the night is
          over, and the death-dews drop no more, when the chill frost of
          midnight shall all have been melted away by the rising sun of
          immortality. Yes, we will meet; we shall meet to part no more. We will
          make an appointment now, to meet each other then, where our hearts, in
          faith, have often met before, at the throne of him who has washed us
          in his blood, and made us white, and so, -- FAREWELL TILL THE MORNING!
        </p>
        <p>
          But what of some of you? You can make no such appointment to meet us
          there, for your way is not thitherward -- not with horses of fire to
          heaven, but with chariots of flame down to hell, -- down, down, down
          for ever into the depths of grief! We dare not say that we will meet
          you there. If you will go there, you must go alone; if you will
          perish, you must perish by yourself. If you will live and die without
          a Savior, you cannot expect your friends to accompany you to that
          dreary world of woe. But why goest thou, why goest thou, O solitary
          traveler, where thou wouldst not have thy fellow go? Thou wouldst not
          see thy child damned, -- let me say the word with solemn awe -- thou
          wouldst not see thy child damned, wouldst thou? Then why shouldst thou
          so damned thyself? |But must it so!| say you. No, sinner, there is no
          |must| for that. There hangs my Master, the crucified redeemer, and if
          thou lookest to him, there will be another |must| for thee, namely,
          that thou must be saved. The road to heaven is by the cross of
          Calvary. Christ Jesus marks the way to glory by the crimson
          blood-drops which flowed from his pierced hands and feet. Trust Jesus;
          trust him wholly; trust him now; trust him for ever; and then we will
          meet, we will meet, again in the morning, and so, -- GOOD NIGHT!
        </p>
        <p>Psalm 62</p>
        <p>
          In this Psalm the royal singer casts himself entirely on God. Here we
          see the foundation of his expectation laid bare. He has no confidence
          anywhere but in God. The Psalm begins in the original with the word
          |Only.| I always call it |The 'only' Psalm| because it harps upon that
          word. David had no mixed reliance; he had not built upon a foundation
          partly of iron and partly of clay; it was all in harmony throughout;
          his trust was in the Lord alone.
        </p>
        <p>Verse 1. Truly --</p>
        <p>Or, as it is in the margin, |Only| --</p>
        <p>1. My soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.</p>
        <p>
          It is a blessed thing to wait truly and only upon God. You have proved
          everything else to be a failure, and now you hang upon the bare arm of
          God alone. There is certainly enough for you to depend upon there.
          Most people want something to see, something tangible to the senses,
          to be the object of their confidence; but David says, |Only my soul
          waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.| It is already on the
          road; it is coming now; it is a salvation from present trouble and
          from present temptation. A complete salvation is on the road for all
          those whose souls are waiting only upon God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. He only is my rock and my salvation;2 he is my defense; I shall not
          be greatly moved.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Though I have no other shelter, yet,| says he, |God, but God alone,
          is my rook fortress. Though I have no other deliverer he is my
          salvation, and though thousands seek to do me hurt, and none will
          stand up for me, yet he is my shield and my defense.| Then he adds,
          |'I shall not be greatly moved.' I shall be like a well-anchored ship;
          I may suffer some tossing, but I cannot drift far away, my grace holds
          me fast.|
        </p>
        <p>
          How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all
          of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.
        </p>
        <p>
          See how he laughs at his enemies. He tells them they are like a wall
          that came over, bulges out, and shakes and totters, with a push, it
          will go over. |You think that you will destroy me,| says he, |but you
          will yourselves be destroyed.|
        </p>
        <p>
          4. They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they
          delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly.
          Selah.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a sure proof that they delight in lies because they are guilty
          of telling them. They can speak soft oily words all the while that
          they are harboring curses in their hearts. God save us from having a
          tongue that talks in a different way from that in which our heart
          feels! But those that delight in lies are never better pleased than
          when they can find a man of God upon whom they can spit their venom;
          and of all cruel things slander is the worst, and it deserves the
          worst punishment. Well did the psalmist ask, |What shall be given unto
          thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue? Sharp arrows
          of the mighty, with coals of juniper.| Such punishment as that a
          slanderer's tongue well deserves to feel.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. My soul, wait thou only upon God;3 for my expectation is from him.
          First he said that his salvation came from the Lord, and now he says
          that his exultation comes from him. All that he needs, and all that he
          wishes for, he gets from his God. |Let my foes slander me,| he seems
          to say, |but, O my soul, do thou wait upon God! Let their tongues keep
          on inventing their diabolical falsehoods; but, O my soul, take thou no
          notice of them! Sit thou down at Jehovah's feet, and patiently wait
          then he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy
          judgment as the noonday.'|
        </p>
        <p>
          6. He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defense; I shall not
          be moved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice how David's faith grows. In verse 2, he says, |I shall not be
          greatly moved;| but now he says, |I shall not be moved at all.| What
          strength faith gives to a man, and what strength prayer gives to a
          man! We may begin our supplication tremblingly, but as we draw near to
          God we become confident in him, and filled with holy boldness.
        </p>
        <p>
          7, 8. In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,
          and my refuge, is in God. Trust in him at all times; --
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot tell what |times| you may be passing through just now, yet I
          can repeat David's exhortation, |Trust in him at all times.| In your
          darkest hours, in the most terrible times that you ever have, when all
          seems lost, when the dearest object of your heart's love is taken from
          you, or when you yourself are coming to the swellings of Jordan, still
          trust in the Lord: |Trust in him at all times;| --
        </p>
        <p>8. Ye people, pour out your heart before him: --</p>
        <p>
          That is the way to get rid of all your troubles; take your heart, and
          turn it upside down, and pour out all that is in it. Do not save a
          drop or a drag: try not to hide one secret sorrow from your God, nor
          one slight grief that nestles in a corner of your spirit. |Pour out
          your heart before him.| It will not be wise for you to pour it out
          before your fellows, for they will misunderstand you and misrepresent
          you; but |pour out your heart before him:| --
        </p>
        <p>
          8, 9. God is a refuge for us. Selah. Surely men of low degree are
          vanity,
        </p>
        <p>
          There is nothing in them; they are only the very essence of vanity.
        </p>
        <p>9. And men of high degree --</p>
        <p>
          must surely be better. No, they are even worse: |Men of high degree|
          --
        </p>
        <p>9. Are a lie:</p>
        <p>
          Their presence of being better because they are of high degree is mere
          presence. Well but, if we mix them up, and get some poor men and some
          rich ones, some peasants and some peers, can we not make something
          solid out of this mixture? Oh, no!
        </p>
        <p>
          9. To be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The men of low degree alone were vanity, but when the men of high
          degree were put with them, they became lighter than vanity; so that
          there seems to be a propensity in the men of high degree to make those
          that are of low degree even lighter than they are by nature; and
          whether men are high or low, if we trust in them, we shall be
          deceived. He who tries to base his happiness upon the good opinion of
          his neighbors, he whose happiness depends upon human esteem, builds
          not on sand, but on mere breath, which is no more solid than the
          bubble that our children blow.
        </p>
        <p>10. Trust not in oppression, --</p>
        <p>
          An ungodly man says, |Well, if I cannot trust in others, I will trust
          in myself; my own stout arm shall win me the victory, and I will tread
          others down beneath my feet.| |I will get money,| says another;
          |somehow or other, I will get money.| To both of these, David says,
          |Trust not in oppression,| --
        </p>
        <p>
          10. And become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your
          heart upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do, they will either fly away from your heart, or else they
          will fly away with your heart, which would be the greater evil of the
          two, for, when riches carry a man's heart away from God, his greatest
          gains are his heaviest losses. He is poor indeed who prizes his gold
          more than his God.
        </p>
        <p>
          11. God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power
          belongeth unto God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where ought we to put our confidence? Why, where true power is. If
          there were any power elsewhere, we might put a measure of confidence
          elsewhere; but when twice the heavenly message declares that power
          belongs to God, our wisdom will be shown in putting an our trust in
          God.
        </p>
        <p>12. Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: --</p>
        <p>
          Almighty power would be terrible if it were separated from infinite
          mercy; but it is not so.
        </p>
        <p>12. For thou renderest to every man according to his work.</p>
        <p>
          Thou givest him enough strength with which to do his work. Thou dost
          not send him to do a work beyond his power, and leave him to fail; but
          unto all thy children thy mercy brings thy power to help in every time
          of need. Thy faithful promise is, |As thy days, so shall thy strength
          be. Come, my brothers and sisters in Christ, let us be of the same
          mind as David was when he wrote the first verse of this Psalm, and let
          each one of us say, |Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh
          my salvation.|
        </p>

          When this discourse was delivered, in October, 1865, the preacher
          could scarcely have imagined that he would leave behind him so many
          books and sermons as he did leave when he was |called home| in
          January, 1892; and it would never have seemed possible to him that,
          nearly seventeen years after his own translation to heaven, the weekly
          issues of the Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit would still be continued,
          with the prospect of a further continuance for many years more.
