        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.110)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, December 28th, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the Mount Sion, and with him
          an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written
          in their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of
          many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the
          voice of harpers harping with their harps; And they sung as it were a
          new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the
          elders; and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and
          four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth." -- Revelation
          14:1-3.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE SCENE of this marvellous and magnificent vision is laid upon Mount
          Sion; by which we are to understand, not Mount Sion upon earth, but
          Mount Sion which is above, "Jerusalem, the mother of us all." To the
          Hebrew mind Mount Sion was a type of heaven, and very justly so. Among
          all the mountains of the earth none was to be found so famous as Sion.
          It was there that patriarch Abraham drew his knife to slay his son; it
          was there, too, in commemoration of that great triumph of faith,
          Solomon built a majestic temple, "beautiful for situation and the joy
          of the whole earth." That Mount Sion was the centre of all the
          devotions of the Jews.
        </p>
        <p>"Up to her courts, with joys unknown,</p>
        <p>The sacred tribes repaired."</p>
        <p>
          Between the wings of the cherubim Jehovah dwelt; on the one altar
          there all the sacrifices were offered to high heaven. They loved Mount
          Sion, and often did they sing, when they drew nigh to her, in their
          annual pilgrimages, "How amiable are thy tabernacles O Lord God of
          hosts, my King and my God!" Sion is now desolate; she hath been
          ravished by the enemy; she hath been utterly destroyed; her vail hath
          been rent asunder, and the virgin daughter of Sion is now sitting in
          sackcloth and ashes; but, nevertheless, to the Jewish mind it must
          ever, in its ancient state, remain the best and sweetest type of
          heaven. John, therefore, when he saw this sight might have said, "I
          looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood in heaven, and with him an hundred and
          forty and four thousand having his Father's name written in their
          foreheads: And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many
          waters, and as the voice of a great thunder; and I heard the voice of
          harpers harping with their harps: And they sung as it were a new song
          before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no
          man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand,
          which were redeemed from the earth."
        </p>
        <p>
          This morning I shall endeavour to show you, first of all, the object
          of heavenly worship -- the Lamb in the midst of the throne; in the
          next place we shall look at the worshippers themselves, and note their
          manner and their character; in the third place we shall listen to hear
          their song, for we may almost hear it; it is like "the noise of many
          waters and like great thunder;" and then we shall close by noting,
          that it is a new song which they sing, and by endeavouring to mention
          one or two reasons why it must necessarily be so.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In the first place, then, we wish to take a view of THE OBJECT OF
          HEAVENLY WORSHIP. The divine John was privileged to look within the
          gates of pearl; and on turning round to tell us what he saw -- observe
          how he begins -- he saith not, "I saw streets of gold or walls of
          Jasper;" he saith not, "I saw crowns, marked their lustre, and saw the
          wearers." That he shall notice afterwards. But he begins by saying, "I
          looked, and, lo, a Lamb!" To teach us that the very first and chief
          object of attraction in the heavenly state is "the Lamb of God which
          taketh away the sins of the world." Nothing else attracted the
          Apostle's attention so much as the person of that Divine Being, who is
          the Lord God, our most blessed Redeemer: "I looked, and, lo a Lamb!"
          Beloved, if we were allowed to look within the vail which parts us
          from the world of spirits, we should see, first of all, the person of
          our Lord Jesus. If now we could go where the immortal spirits "day
          without night circle the throne rejoicing," we should see each of them
          with their faces turned in one direction; and if we should step up to
          one of the blessed spirits, and say, "O bright immortal, why are thine
          eyes fixed? What is it that absorbs thee quite, and wraps thee up in
          vision?" He, without deigning to give an answer, would simply point to
          the centre of the sacred circle, and lo, we should see a Lamb in the
          midst of the throne. They have not yet ceased to admire his beauty,
          and marvel at his wonders and adore his person.
        </p>
        <p>"Amidst a thousand harps and songs,</p>
        <p>Jesus, our God, exalted reigns."</p>
        <p>
          He is the theme of song and the subject of observation of all the
          glorified spirits and of all the angels in paradise. "I looked, and,
          lo, a Lamb!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian, here is joy for thee; thou hast looked, and thou hast seen
          the Lamb. Through thy tearful eyes thou hast seen the Lamb taking away
          thy sins. Rejoice, then! In a little while, when thine eyes shall have
          been wiped from tears, thou wilt see the same Lamb exalted on his
          throne. It is the joy of the heart to hold daily fellowship and
          communion with Jesus; thou shalt have the same joy in heaven; "there
          shalt thou see him as he is, and thou shalt be like him." Thou shalt
          enjoy the constant vision of his presence, and thou shalt dwell with
          him for aye. "I looked, and, lo, a Lamb!" Why, that Lamb is heaven
          itself; for as good Rutherford says, "Heaven and Christ are the same
          things; to be with Christ is to be in heaven, and to be in heaven is
          to be with Christ." And he very sweetly says in one of his letters,
          wrapped up in love to Christ. "Oh! my Lord Christ, if I could be in
          heaven without thee, it would be a hell; and if I could be in hell,
          and have thee still, it would be a heaven to me, for thou art all the
          heaven I want." It is true, is it not Christian? Does not thy soul say
          so?
        </p>
        <p>"Not all the harps above</p>
        <p>Could make a heavenly place,</p>
        <p>Should Christ his residence remove,</p>
        <p>Or but conceal his face."</p>
        <p>
          All thou needest to make thee blessed, supremely blessed, is "to be
          with Christ, which is far better."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now observe the figure under which Christ is represented in
          heaven. "I looked, and, lo, a Lamb." Now, you know Jesus, in
          Scripture, is often represented as a lion: he is so to his enemies,
          for he devoureth them, and teareth them to pieces. "Beware, ye that
          forget God, lest he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver."
          But in heaven he is in the midst of his friends, and therefore he
        </p>
        <p>Looks like a lamb that has been slain,</p>
        <p>And wears his priesthood still."</p>
        <p>
          Why should Christ in heaven choose to appear under the figure of a
          lamb, and not in some other of his glorious characters? We reply,
          because it was as a lamb that Jesus fought and conquered, and,
          therefore as a lamb he appears in heaven. I have read of certain
          military commanders, when they were conquerors, that on the
          anniversary of their victory they would never wear anything but the
          garment in which they fought. On that memorable day they say, "Nay,
          take away the robes; I will wear the garment which has been
          embroidered with the sabre-cut, and garnished with the shot that hath
          riddled it; I will wear no other garb but that in which I fought and
          conquered." It seems as if the same feeling possessed the breast of
          Christ. "As a Lamb," saith he, "I died, and worsted hell; as a Lamb I
          have redeemed my people, and therefore as a Lamb I will appear in
          paradise."
        </p>
        <p>
          But, perhaps, there is another reason; it is to encourage us to come
          to him in prayer. Ah, believer, we need not be afraid to come to
          Christ, for he is a Lamb. To a lion-Christ we need fear to come; but
          the Lamb-Christ! -- oh, little children, were ye ever afraid of lambs?
          Oh, children of the living God, should ye ever fail to tell your
          griefs and sorrows into the breast of one who is a Lamb? Ah, let us
          come boldly to the throne of the heavenly grace, seeing a Lamb sits
          upon it. One of the things which tend very much to spoil
          prayer-meetings is the fact that our brethren do not pray boldly. They
          would practice reverence, as truly they ought, but they should
          remember that the highest reverence is consistent with true
          familiarity. No man more reverent than Luther; no man more fully
          carried out for the passage, "He talked with his Maker as a man
          talketh with his friend." We may be as reverent as the angels, and yet
          we may be as familiar as children in Christ Jesus. Now, our friends,
          when they pray, very frequently say the same thing every time. They
          are Dissenters; they cannot bear the Prayer Book; they think that
          forms of prayer are bad, but they always use their own form of prayer
          notwithstanding; as much as if they were to say that the bishop's form
          would not do, but their own they must always use. But a form of prayer
          being wrong, is as much wrong when I make it as when the bishop makes
          it; I am as much out of order in using what I compose myself
          continually and constantly, as I am when I am using one that has been
          composed for me; perhaps far more so, as it is not likely to be
          one-half so good. If our friends, however, would lay aside the form
          into which they grow, and break up the stereotyped plates with which
          they print their prayers so often, they might come boldly to the
          throne of God, and need never fear to do so; for he whom they address
          is represented in heaven under the figure of a Lamb, to teach us to
          come close to him, and tell him all our wants, believing that he will
          not disdain to hear them.
        </p>
        <p>
          And you will further notice that this Lamb is said to stand. Standing
          is the posture of triumph. The Father said to Christ, "Sit thou on my
          throne, till I make thine enemies thy footstool." It is done; they are
          his footstool, and here he is said to stand erect, like a victor over
          all his enemies. Many a time the Saviour knelt in prayer; once he hung
          upon the cross; but when the great scene of our text shall be fully
          wrought out, he shall stand erect, as more than conqueror, through his
          own majestic might. "I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the Mount
          Sion." Oh, if we could rend the veil -- if now we were privileged to
          see within it -- there is no sight would so enthrall us as the simple
          sight of the Lamb in the midst of the throne. My dear brethren and
          sisters in Christ Jesus, would it not be all the sight you would ever
          wish to see, if you could once behold him whom your soul loveth? Would
          it not be a heaven to you, if it were carried out in your experience
          -- "Mine eye shall see him, and not another's?" Would you want
          anything else to make you happy but continually to see him? Can you
          not say with the poet --
        </p>
        <p>"Millions of years my wondering eyes</p>
        <p>Shall o'er my Saviour's beauty rove,</p>
        <p>And endless ages I'll adore</p>
        <p>The wonders of his love?"</p>
        <p>
          And if a single glimpse of him on earth affords you profound delight;
          it must be, indeed, a very sea of bliss, and an abyss of paradise,
          without a bottom or a shore, to see him as he is; to be lost in his
          splendours, as the stars are lost in the sunlight, and to hold
          fellowship with him, as did John the beloved, when he leaned his head
          upon his bosom. And this shall be thy lot, to see the Lamb in the
          midst of the throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second point is, THE WORSHIPPERS, WHO ARE THEY? Turn to the
          text, and you will not, first of all, their numbers -- "I looked, and,
          lo, a Lamb stood on the Mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and
          four thousand." This is a certain number put for an uncertain -- I
          mean uncertain to us, though not uncertain to God. It is a vast
          number, put for that "multitude which no man can number," who shall
          stand before the throne of God. Now, here is something not very
          pleasant to my friend Bigot yonder. Note the number of those who are
          to be saved; they are said to be a great number, even a "hundred forty
          and four thousand," which is but a unit put for the vast innumerable
          multitude who are to be gathered home. Why, my friend, there are so
          many as that belonging to your church. You believe that none will be
          saved but those who hear your minister, and believe your creed; I do
          not think you could find one hundred and forty-four thousand anywhere.
          You will have to enlarge your heart I think; you must take in a few
          more, and not be so inclined to shut out the Lord's people, because
          you cannot agree with them. I do abhor from my heart that continual
          whining of some men about their own little church as the "remnant" --
          the "few that are to be saved." They are always dwelling upon strait
          gates and narrow ways, and upon what they conceive to be a truth, that
          but few shall enter heaven. Why, my friends, I believe there will be
          more in heaven than in hell. If you ask me why I think so, I answer,
          because Christ, in everything, is to "have the pre-eminence," and I
          cannot conceive how he could have the pre-eminence if there are to be
          more in the dominions of Satan than in paradise. Moreover, it is said
          there is to be a multitude that no man can number in heaven; I have
          never read that there is to be a multitude that no man can number in
          hell. But I rejoice to know that the souls of all infants, as soon as
          they die, speed their way to paradise. Think what a multitude there is
          of them! And then there are the just, and the redeemed of all nations
          and kindreds up till now; and there are better times coming, when the
          religion of Christ shall be universal; when he shall reign from pole
          to pole with illimitable sway; when kingdoms shall bow before him, and
          nations be born in a day; and in the thousand years of the great
          millennial state there will be enough saved to make up all the
          deficiencies of the thousands of years that have gone before. Christ
          shall have the pre-eminence at last; his train shall be far larger
          than that which shall attend the chariots of the grim monarch of hell.
          Christ shall be master everywhere, and his praise sounded in every
          land. One hundred and forty-four thousand were observed, the types and
          representatives of a far larger number who are ultimately to be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          But notice, whilst the number is very large, how very certain it is.
          By turning over the leaves of your Bible to a previous chapter of this
          book, you will see that at the 4th verse it is written, that one
          hundred and forty-four thousand were sealed; and now we find there are
          one hundred and forty-four thousand saved; not 143,999, and 144,001,
          but exactly the number that are sealed. Now, my friends may not like
          what I am going to say; but if they do not like it, their quarrel is
          with God's Bible, not with me. There will be just as many in heaven as
          are sealed by God -- just as many as Christ did purchase with his
          blood; all of them, and no more and no less. There will be just as
          many there as were quickened to life by the Holy Spirit, and were,
          "born again, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the
          will of man, but of God." "Ah," some say, "there is that abominable
          doctrine of election." Exactly so, if it be abominable; but you will
          never be able to cut it out of the Bible. You may hate it, and gnash
          and grind your teeth against it; but, remember, we can trace the
          pedigree of this doctrine, even apart from Scripture, to the time of
          the apostles. Church of England ministers and members, you have no
          right to differ from me on the doctrine of election, if you are what
          you profess by your own Articles. You who love the old Puritans, you
          have no right to quarrel with me; for where will you find a Puritan
          who was not a strong Calvinist? You who love the fathers, you cannot
          differ from me. What say you of Augustine? Was he not, in his day,
          called a great and mighty teacher of grace? And I even turn to Roman
          Catholics, and, with all the errors of their system, I remind them
          that even in their body have been found those who have held that
          doctrine, and, though long persecuted for it, have never been expelled
          the church. I refer to the Jansenists. But, above all, I challenge
          every man who reads his Bible to say that that doctrine is not there.
          What saith the 9th of Romans? "The children being not yet born,
          neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God
          according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that
          calleth: It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger." And
          then it goes on to say to the carping objector -- "Nay, but, O man,
          who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to
          him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter
          power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour,
          and another unto dishonor?" But enough on this subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          One hundred and forty-four thousand, we say, is a certain number made
          to represent the certainty of the salvation of all God's elect,
          believing people. Now, some say that this doctrine has a tendency to
          discourage men from coming to Christ. Well, you say so; but I have
          never seen it, and blessed be God I have never proved it so. I have
          preached this doctrine ever since I began to preach; but I can say
          this, -- ye shall not (and I am now become a fool in glorying) ye
          shall not find among those who have not preached the doctrine, one who
          has been the instrument of turning more harlots, more drunkards, and
          more sinners of every class, from the error of their ways, than I
          have, by the simple preaching of the doctrine of free grace; and,
          while this has been so, I hold that no argument can be brought to
          prove that it has a tendency to discourage sinners, or bolster them up
          in sin. We hold, as the Bible says, that all the elect, and those
          only, shall be saved; all who go to Christ are elect. So that if any
          of you have in your heart a desire after heaven and after Christ; if
          you carry out that desire in sincere and earnest prayer, and are born
          again, you may as certainly conclude your election as you can conclude
          that you are alive. You must have been chosen of God before the
          foundation of the world, or you would never have done any of these
          things, seeing they are the fruits of election.
        </p>

          But why should it keep any one from going to Christ? "Because," says
          one, "if I go to Christ I may not be elect." No, sir, if you go, you
          prove that you are elect. "But," says another, "I am afraid to go, in
          case I should not be elect." Say as an old woman once said, "If there
          were only three persons elected, I would try to be one of them; and
          since he said, He that believeth shall be saved,' I would challenge
          God on his promise, and try if he would break it." No, come to Christ;
          and if you do so, beyond a doubt you are God's elect from the
          foundation of the world; and therefore this grace has been given to
          you. But why should it discourage you? Suppose there are a number of
          sick folk here, and a large hospital has been built. There is put up
          over the door, "All persons who come shall be taken in:" at the same
          time it is known that there is a person inside the hospital, who is so
          wise that he knows all who will come, and has written down the names
          of all who will come in a book, so that, when they come, those who
          open the doors will only say, "How marvellously wise our Master was,
          to know the names of those who would come." Is there anything
          despiriting in that? You would go, and you would have all the more
          confidence in that man's wisdom, because he was able to know before
          that they were going. "Ah, but," you say, "it was ordained that some
          should come." Well, to give you another illustration; suppose there is
          a rule that there always must be a thousand persons, or a very large
          number in the hospital. You say, "When I go perhaps they will take me
          in, and perhaps they will not." "But," says someone, "there is a rule
          that there must be a thousand in: somehow or other they must make up
          that number of beds, and have that number of patients in the
          hospital." You say, Then why should not I be among the thousand; and
          have not I the encouragement that whosoever goes shall not be cast
          out? And have I not again the encouragement, that if they will not go,
          they must be fetched in somehow or other; for the number must be made
          up; so it is determined and so it is decreed." You would therefore
          have a double encouragement, instead of half a one; and you would go
          with confidence, and say, "They must take me in, because they say they
          will take all in that come; and on the other hand, they must take me
          in, because they must have a certain number: that number is not made
          up, and why should not I be one?" Oh, never doubt about election;
          believe in Christ, and then rejoice in election; do not fret about it
          till you have believed in Christ.

          "I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the Mount Sion, and with him an
          hundred forty and four thousand." And who were these people, "having
          his Father's name written in their foreheads?" Not Bs for "Baptists,"
          not Ws for "Wesleyans," not Es for "Established Church:" they had
          their Father's name and nobody else's. What a deal of fuss is made on
          earth about our distinctions! We think such a deal about belonging to
          this denomination, and the other. Why, if you were to go to heaven's
          gates, and ask if they had any Baptists there, the angel would only
          look at you, and not answer you; if you were to ask if they had any
          Wesleyans, or members of the Established Church, he would say,
          "Nothing of the sort;" but if you were to ask him whether they had any
          Christians there, "Ay," he would say, "an abundance of them: they are
          all one now -- all called by one name; the old brand has been
          obliterated, and now they have not the name of this man or the other;
          they have the name of God, even their Father, stamped on their brow."
          Learn then dear friends, whatever the connection to which you belong,
          to be charitable to your brethren, and kind to them, seeing that,
          after all, the name you now hold here will be forgotten in heaven, and
          only your Father's name will be there known.
        </p>
        <p>
          One more remark here, and we will turn from the worshippers to listen
          to their song. It is said of all these worshippers that they learned
          the song before they went there. At the end of the third verse it is
          said, "No man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four
          thousand, which were redeemed from the earth." Brethren, we must begin
          heaven's song here below, or else we shall never sing it above. The
          choristers of heaven have all had rehearsals upon earth, before they
          sing in that orchestra. You think that, die when you may, you will go
          to heaven, without being prepared. Nay, sir; heaven is a prepared
          place for a prepared people, and unless you are "made meet to be
          partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light," you can never
          stand there among them. If you were in heaven without a new heart and
          a right spirit, you would be glad enough to get out of it; for heaven,
          unless a man is heavenly himself, would be worse than hell. A man who
          is unrenewed and unregenerate going to heaven would be miserable
          there. There would be a song -- he could not join in it; there would
          be a constant hallelujah, but he would not know a note: and besides,
          he would be in the presence of the Almighty, even in the presence of
          the God he hates, and how could he be happy there? No, sirs; ye must
          learn the song of paradise here, or else ye can never sing it. Ye must
          learn to sing --
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus, I love thy charming name,</p>
        <p>'Tis music to my ears."</p>
        <p>
          You must learn to feel that "sweeter sounds than music knows mingle in
          your Saviour's name," or else you can never chaunt the hallelujahs of
          the blest before the throne of the great "I AM." Take that thought,
          whatever else you forget; treasure it up in your memory, and ask grace
          of God that you may here be taught to sing the heavenly song, that
          afterwards in the land of the hereafter, in the home of the
          beautified, you may continually chaunt the high praises of him that
          loved you.

          III. And now we come to the third and most interesting point, namely,
          THE LISTENING TO THEIR SONG. "I heard a voice form heaven, as the
          voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard
          the voice of harpers harping with their harps;" singing -- how loud
          and yet how sweet!
        </p>
        <p>
          First, then, singing how loud! It is said to be "like the voice of
          many waters." Have you never heard the sea roar, and the fulness
          thereof? Have you never walked by the sea-side, when the waves were
          singing, and when every little pebble-stone did turn chorister, to
          make up music to the Lord God of hosts? And have you never in time of
          storm beheld the sea, with its hundred hands, clapping them in
          gladsome adoration of the Most High? Have you never heard the sea roar
          out his praise, when the winds were holding carnival -- perhaps
          singing the dirge of mariners, wrecked far out on the stormy deep, but
          far more likely exalting God with their hoarse voice, and praising him
          who makes a thousand fleets sweep over them in safety, and writes his
          furrows on their own youthful brow? Have you never heard the rumbling
          and booming of ocean on the shore, when it has been lashed into fury
          and has been driven upon the cliffs? If you have, you have a faint
          idea of the melody of heaven. It was "as the voice of many waters."
          But do not suppose that it is the whole of the idea. It is not the
          voice of one ocean, but the voice of many, that is needed to give you
          an idea of the melodies of heaven. You are to suppose ocean piled upon
          ocean, sea upon sea, -- the Pacific piled upon the Atlantic, the
          Arctic upon that, the Antarctic higher still, and so ocean upon ocean,
          all lashed to fury, and all sounding with a mighty voice the praise of
          God. Such is the singing of heaven. Or if the illustration, fails to
          strike, take another. We have mentioned here two or three times the
          mighty falls of Niagara. They can be heard at a tremendous distance,
          so awful is their sound. Now, suppose waterfalls dashing upon
          waterfalls, cataracts upon cataracts, Niagaras upon Niagaras, each of
          them sounding forth their mighty voices, and you have got some idea of
          the singing of paradise. "I heard a voice like the voice of many
          waters." Can you not hear it? Ah! if our ears were opened we might
          almost cast the song. I have thought sometimes that the voice of the
          Aeolian harp, when it has swollen out grandly, was almost like an echo
          of the songs of those who sing before the throne; and on the summer
          eve, when the wind has come in gentle zephyrs through the forest, you
          might almost think it was the floating of some stray notes that had
          lost their way among the harps of heaven, and come down to us, to give
          us some faint foretaste of that song which hymns out in mighty peals
          before the throne of the Most High. But why so loud? The answer is,
          because there are so many there to sing. Nothing is more grand than
          the singing of multitudes. Many have been the persons who have told me
          that they could but weep when they heard you sing in this assembly, so
          mighty seemed the sound when all the people sang --
        </p>
        <p>"Praise God from whom all blessings flow."</p>
        <p>
          And, indeed, there is something very grand in the singing of
          multitudes. I remember hearing 12,000 sing on one occasion in the open
          air. Some of our friends were then present, when we concluded our
          service with that glorious hallelujah. Have you ever forgotten it? It
          was indeed a mighty sound; it seemed to make heaven itself ring again.
          Think, then, what must be the voice of those who stand on the
          boundless plains of heaven, and with all their might shout, "Glory and
          honour and power and dominion unto him that sitteth on the throne, and
          to the Lamb for ever and ever."
        </p>
        <p>
          On reason, however, why the song is so loud is a very simple one,
          namely, because all those who are there think themselves bound to sing
          the loudest of all. You know our favourite hymn --
        </p>
        <p>"Then loudest of the crowd I'll sing,</p>
        <p>While heav'n's resounding mansions ring</p>
        <p>With shouts of sov'reign grace."</p>
        <p>
          And every saint will join that sonnet, and each one lift up his heart
          to God, then how mighty must be the strain of praise that will rise up
          to the throne of the glorious God our Father!
        </p>
        <p>
          But note next, while it was a loud voice, how sweet it was. Noise is
          not music. There may be "a voice like many waters." and yet no music.
          It was sweet as well as loud; for John says, "I heard the voice of
          harpers harping with their harps." Perhaps the sweetest of all
          instruments is the harp. There are others which give forth sounds more
          grand and noble, but the harp is the sweetest of all instruments. I
          have sometimes sat to hear a skilful harper, till I could say, "I
          could sit and hear myself away," whilst with skilful fingers he
          touched the chords gently, and brought forth strains of melody which
          flowed like liquid silver, or like sounding honey into one's soul.
          Sweet, sweet beyond sweetness; words can scarcely tell how sweet the
          melody. Such is the music of heaven. No jarring notes there, no
          discord, but all one glorious harmonious song. You will not be there,
          formalist, to spoil the tune; nor you, hypocrite, to mar the melody;
          there will be all those there whose hearts are right with God, and
          therefore the strain will be one great harmonious whole, without a
          discord. Truly do we sing --
        </p>
        <p>"No groans to mingle with the songs</p>
        <p>That warble from immortal tongues."</p>
        <p>
          And there will be no discord of any other sort to spoil the melody of
          those before the throne. Oh! my beloved brethren, that we might be
          there! Lift us up, ye cherubs! Stretch your wings, and bear us up
          where the sonnets fill the air. But if ye must not, let us wait our
          time.
        </p>
        <p>"A few more rolling suns at most,</p>
        <p>Will land us on fair Canaan's coast;"</p>
        <p>
          and then we shall help to make the song, which now we can scarcely
          conceive, but which yet we desire to join.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. We now close with a remark upon the last point: WHY IS THE SONG
          SAID TO BE A NEW SONG? But one remark here. It will be a new song,
          because the saints were never in such a position before as they will
          be when they sing this new song. They are in heaven now; but the scene
          of our text is something more than heaven. It refers to the time when
          all the chosen race shall meet around the throne, when the last battle
          shall have been fought, and the last warrior shall have gained his
          crown. It is not now that they are thus singing, but it is in the
          glorious time to come, when all the hundred and forty and four
          thousand -- or rather, the number typified by that number -- will be
          all safely housed and all secure. I can conceive the period. Time was
          -- eternity now reigns. The voice of God exclaims, "Are my beloved all
          safe?" The angel flies through paradise and returns with this message,
          "Yea, they are." "Is Fearful safe? Is Feeble-mind safe? Is
          Ready-to-Halt safe? Is Despondency safe?" "Yes, O king, they are,"
          says he. "Shut-to the gates," says the Almighty, "they have been open
          night and day; shut them to now." Then, when all of them shall be
          there, then will be the time when the shout shall be louder than many
          waters, and the song shall begin which will never end. There is a
          story told in the history of brave Oliver Cromwell, which I use here
          to illustrate this new song. Cromwell and his Ironsides before they
          went to battle bowed the knee in prayer, and asked for God's help.
          Then, with their Bibles in their breasts, and their swords in their
          hands -- a strange and unjustifiable mixture, but which their
          ignorance must excuse -- they cried, "The Lord of hosts is with us,
          the God of Jacob is our refuge;" and rushing to battle they sang --
        </p>
        <p>"O Lord our God, arise and let</p>
        <p>Thine enemies scattered be,</p>
        <p>And let all those that do thee hate</p>
        <p>Before thy presence flee.</p>
        <p>
          They had to fight up hill for a long time, but at last the enemy fled.
          The Ironsides were about to pursue them and win the booty, when the
          stern harsh voice of Cromwell was heard -- "Halt! halt! now the
          victory is won, before you rush to the spoil return thanks to God;"
          and they sang some such song as this -- "Sing unto the Lord, for he
          has gotten us the victory! Sing unto the Lord." It was said to have
          been one of the most majestic sights in that strange, yet good man's
          history. (I say that word without blushing, for good he was.) For a
          time the hills seemed to leap, whilst the vast multitude, turning from
          the slain, still stained with blood, lifted up their hearts to God. We
          say, again, it was a strange sight, yet a glad one. But how great
          shall be that sight, when Christ shall be seen as a conqueror, and
          when all his warriors, fighting side by side with him, shall see the
          dragon beaten in pieces beneath their feet. Lo, their enemies are
          fled; they were driven like thin clouds before a Biscay gale. They are
          all gone, death is vanquished, Satan is cast into the lake of fire,
          and here stands the King himself, crowned with many crowns, the victor
          of the victors. And in the moment of exaltation the Redeemer will say,
          "Come let us sing unto the Lord;" and then, louder than the shout of
          many waters, they shall sing, "Hallelujah! the Lord God Omnipotent
          reigneth." Ah! that will be the full carrying out of the great scene!
          My feeble words cannot depict it. I send you away with this simple
          question, "Shall you be there to see the conqueror crowned?" Have you
          "a good hope through grace" that you shall? If so, be glad; if not, go
          to your houses, fall on your knees, and pray to God to save you from
          that terrible place which must certainly be your portion, instead of
          that great heaven of which I preach, unless you turn to God with full
          purpose of heart.
