        <p>|He was moved with compassion.| -- Matthew 9:36.</p>
        <p>
          THIS is said of Christ Jesus several times in the New Testament. The
          original word is a very remarkable one. It is not found in classic
          Greek. It is not found in the Septuagint. The fact is, it was a word
          coined by the evangelists themselves. They did not find one in the
          whole Greek language that suited their purpose, and therefore they had
          to make one. It is expressive of the deepest emotion; a striving of
          the bowels -- a yearning of the innermost nature with pity. As the
          dictionaries tell us -- Ex intimis visceribus misericordia commoveor.
          I suppose that when our Saviour looked upon certain sights, those who
          watched him closely perceived that his internal agitation was very
          great, his emotions were very deep, and then his face betrayed it, his
          eyes gushed like founts with tears, and you saw that his big heart was
          ready to burst with pity for the sorrow upon which his eyes were
          gazing. He was moved with compassion. His whole nature was agitated
          with commiseration for the sufferers before him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, although this word is not used many times even by the
          evangelists, yet it may be taken as a clue to the Saviour's whole
          life, and I intend thus to apply it to him. If you would sum up the
          whole character of Christ in reference to ourselves, it might be
          gathered into this one sentence, |He was moved with compassion.| Upon
          this one point we shall try to insist now, and may God grant that good
          practical result may come of it. First, I shall lead your meditations
          to the great transactions of our Saviour's life; secondly, to the
          special instances in which this expression is used by the evangelists;
          thirdly, to the forethought which he took on our behalf; and fourthly
          to the personal testimony which one's own recollections can furnish.
          Let us take a rapid survey of: --
        </p>
        <p>
          I. THE GREAT LIFE OF CHRIST, just touching, as with a swallow's wing,
          the evidence it bears from the beginning. Before ever the earth was
          framed; before the foundations of the everlasting hills were laid,
          when as yet the stars had not begun their shining, it was known to God
          that his creature man would sin; that the whole race would fall from
          its pure original state in the first Adam, the covenant head as well
          as the common parent of the entire human family; and that in
          consequence of that one man's disobedience every soul born of his
          lineage would become a sinner too. Then, as the Creator knew that his
          creatures would rebel against him, he saw that it would become
          necessary, eventually, to avenge his injured law. Therefore, it was
          purposed, in the eternal plan, ere the stream of time had commenced
          its course, or ages had began to accumulate their voluminous records,
          that there should be an interposer -- one ordained to come and re-head
          the race, to be a second Adam, a federal Chief; to restore the breach,
          and repair the mischief of the first Adam; to be a Surety to answer
          for the sons of men on whom God's love did light; that their sins
          should be laid upon him, and that he should save them with an
          everlasting salvation. No angel could venture to intrude into those
          divine counsels and decrees, or to offer himself as the surety and
          sponsor for that new covenant. Yet there was one -- and he none other
          than Jehovah's self -- of whom he said, Let all the angels of God
          worship him, the Son, the well beloved of the Father, of whom it is
          written in the Word, |When he prepared the heavens I was there, when
          he set a compass upon the face of the depth, when he established the
          clouds above, when he strengthened the fountain of the deep|; then, |I
          was by him as one brought up with him, and I was daily his delight,
          rejoicing always before him; rejoicing in the habitable parts of the
          earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.| He it is of whom
          the Apostle John speaks as the Word who was God, and was in the
          beginning with God. Was he not moved with compassion when he entered
          into a covenant with his father on our behalf, even on the behalf of
          all his chosen -- a covenant in which he was to be the sufferer, and
          they the gainers -- in which he was to bear the shame that he might
          bring them into his own glory? Yes, verily, he was even then moved
          with compassion, for his delights even then were with the sons of men.
          Nor did his compassion peer forth in the prospect of an emergency
          presently to diminish and disappear as the rebellion took a more
          active form, and the ruin assumed more palpable proportions. It was no
          transient feeling. He continued still to pity men. He saw the fall of
          man; he marked the subtle serpent's mortal sting; he watched the trail
          as the slime of the serpent passed over the fair glades of Eden; he
          observed man in his evil progress, adding sin to sin through
          generation after generation, fouling every page of history until God's
          patience had been tried to the uttermost; and then, according as it
          was written in the volume of the Book that he must appear, Jesus
          Christ came himself into this stricken world. Came how? O, be
          astonished, ye angels, that ye were witnesses of it, and ye men that
          ye beheld it. The Infinite came down to earth in the form of an
          infant; he who spans the heavens and holds the ocean in the hollow of
          his hand, condescended to hang upon a woman's breast -- the King
          eternal became a little child. Let Bethlehem tell that he had
          compassion. There was no way of saving us but by stooping to us. To
          bring earth up to heaven, he must bring heaven down to earth.
          Therefore, in the incarnation, he must bring heaven down to earth.
          Therefore, in the incarnation, he had compassion, for he took upon
          himself our infirmities, and was made like unto ourselves. Matchless
          pity, indeed, was this!
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, while he tarried in the world, a man among men, and we beheld
          his glory, the glory as of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of
          grace and truth, he was constantly moved with compassion; for he felt
          all the griefs of mankind in himself. He took our sicknesses and
          carried our sorrows: he proved himself a true brother, with quick,
          human sensibilities. A tear brought a tear into his eye; a cry made
          him pause to ask what help he could render. So generous was his soul,
          that he gave all he had for the help of those that had not. The fox
          had its hole, and the bird its nest, but he had no dwelling-place.
          Stripped even of his garments, he hung upon the cross to die. Never
          one so indigent in death as he, without a friend, without even a tomb,
          except such as a loan could find him. He gave up all the comforts of
          life -- he gave his life itself; he gave his very self to prove that
          he was moved with compassion. Most of all do we see how he was moved
          with compassion in his terrible death. Oft and oft again have I told
          this story, yet these lips shall be dumb ere they cease to reiterate
          the old, old tidings. God must punish sin, or else he would relinquish
          the government of the universe. He could not let iniquity go
          unchastened without compromising the purity of his administration.
          Therefore, the law must be honoured, justice must be vindicated,
          righteousness must be upheld, crime must be expiated by suffering.
          Who, then, shall endure the penance or make the reparation? Shall the
          dread sentence fall upon all mankind? How far shall vengeance proceed
          before equity is satisfied? After what manner shall the sword do
          homage to the sceptre? Must the elect of God be condemned for their
          sins? No; Jesus is moved with compassion. He steps in, he takes upon
          himself the uplifted lash, and his shoulders run with gore; he bares
          his bosom to the furbished sword, and it smites the Shepherd that the
          sheep may escape. |He looked, and there was no man, and wondered that
          there was no intercessor; therefore, his arm brought salvation.| He
          trod the wine- press alone, and |bore, that we might never bear, his
          Father's righteous ire.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Are ye asked what means the crucifixion of a perfect man upon a
          felon's cross, ye may reply, |He was moved with compassion.| |He saved
          others; himself he could not save.| He was so moved with compassion,
          that compassion, as it were, did eat him up. He could save nothing
          from the general conflagration: he was utterly consumed with love, and
          died in the flame of ardent love towards the sons of men. And after he
          had died and slept a little while in the grave, he rose again. He has
          gone into his glory; he is living at the right hand of the Father; but
          this is just as true of him, |He is moved with compassion.| Is proof
          wanted? Let faith pass within the veil, and let your spirits for a
          moment stand upon that sea of glass mingled with fire where stand the
          harpers tuning their never-ceasing melodies. What see you there
          conspicuous in the very midst of heaven but One who looks like a lamb
          that has been slain, and wears his priesthood still? What is his
          occupation there in heaven? He has no bloody sacrifice to offer, for
          he has perfected for ever those that were set apart. That work is
          done, but what is he doing now? He is pleading for his people; he is
          their perpetual Advocate, their continual Intercessor; he never rests
          until they come to their rest; he never holds his peace for them, but
          pleads the merit of his blood, and will do so till all whom the Father
          gave him shall be with him where he is. Well indeed does our hymn
          express it: --
        </p>
        <p>|Now, though he reigns exalted high,</p>
        <p>His love is still as great;</p>
        <p>Well he remembers Calvary,</p>
        <p>Nor will his saints forget.|</p>
        <p>
          His tender heart pities all the griefs of his dear people. There is
          not a pang they have but the head feels it, feels it for all the
          members. Still doth he look upon their imperfections and their
          infirmities, yet not with anger, not with loss of patience, but with
          gentleness and sympathy, |He is moved with compassion.| Having thus
          briefly sketched the life of Christ, I want you to turn to: --
        </p>
        <p>
          II. THOSE PASSAGES OF THE EVANGELISTS IN WHICH THEY TESTIFY THAT HE
          WAS MOVED WITH COMPASSION.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will find one case in Matthew 20:31: |Two blind men sat by the
          wayside begging, and when they heard that Jesus passed by, they said,
          'O Lord, thou Son of David, have mercy on us.'| Jesus stood still,
          called them, questioned them, and they seem to have had full
          conviction that he both could and would restore their sight, so Jesus
          had compassion on them, touched their eyes, and immediately they
          received sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, and what a lesson this is for any here present who have a like
          conviction. Do you believe that Christ can heal you? Do you believe
          that he is willing to heal you? Then let me assure you that a channel
          of communication is opened between him and you, for he is moved with
          compassion towards you, and already I hear him command you to come to
          him. He is ready to heal you now. The sad condition of a blind man
          should always move pity in the breast of the humane, but a glance at
          these two poor men -- I do not know that there was anything strange or
          uncommon about their appearance -- touched the Saviour's sensibility.
          And when he heard them say that they did believe he could heal them,
          he seemed to perceive that they had inward sight, and to account it a
          pity that they should not have outward sight too. So at once he put
          his fingers upon their eyes, and they received the power of seeing. O
          soul, if thou believest Christ can save thee, and if you wilt now
          trust in him to save thee, be of good cheer, thou art saved; that
          faith of thine hath saved thee. The very fact that thou believest that
          Jesus is the Christ, and doth rely upon him, may stand as evidence to
          thee that thou art forgiven, that thou art saved. There is no let or
          bar to thy full redemption. Go thy way and rejoice in thy Lord. He
          hath compassion on thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next case I shall cite is that of the leper, Mark 1:41. This poor
          man was covered with a sad and foul disease, when he said to Jesus,
          |Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.| He had full faith in
          Christ's ability, but he had some doubts as to Christ's willingness.
          Our Saviour looked at him, and though he might very well have rebuked
          him that he should doubt his willingness, he merely said, |I will, be
          thou clean,| and straightway he was made whole of that loathsome
          plague. If there is in this assembly one grievously defiled or openly
          disgraced by sin, seest thou the leprosy upon thyself, and dost thou
          say, |I believe he could save me if he would|? Hast thou some
          lingering doubt about the Saviour's willingness? Yet I beseech you
          breathe this prayer, |Lord, I believe, I believe thy power. Help thou
          mine unbelief which lingers round thy willingness.| Then little as thy
          faith is, it shall save thee. Jesus, full of compassion, will pity
          even thine unbelief, and accept what is faith, and forgive what is
          unbelief. There is a second instance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third I will give you is from Mark 5:19. It was the demoniac.
          There met Christ a man so possessed with a devil as to be mad, and
          instead of belief in Christ or asking for healing, this spirit within
          the man compelled him to say, |Wilt thou torment us before the time?|
          -- and rather to stand against Christ healing him than to ask for it;
          but Christ was moved with compassion, and he bade the evil spirit come
          out of the evil man. Oh! I am so glad of this instance of his being
          moved with compassion. I do not so much wonder that he has pity on
          those that believe in him, neither do I so much marvel that he has
          pity even on weak faith; but here was a case in which there was no
          faith, no desire, nor anything that could commend him to our Lord's
          sympathy. Is there no such case among the crowds gathered together
          here? You do not know why you have come into this assembly. You
          scarcely feel at home in this place. Though you have led a very sad
          life, you do not want to be converted -- not you. You almost shun the
          thought. Yet it is written, |He will have compassion on whom he will
          have compassion.| Well we have known it in this house, and I hope we
          shall know it again and again that the Lord has laid violent hands of
          love upon unprepared souls. They have been smitten down with
          repentance, renewed in heart, and saved from their sins. Saul of
          Tarsus had no thought that he should ever be an apostle of Christ, but
          the Lord stopped the persecutor, and changed him into a preacher; so
          that ever afterwards he propagated the faith which once he destroyed.
          May the Lord have compassion on you tonight. Well may we offer that
          prayer; for what will be your fate if you die as you are? What will be
          your doom eternally if you pass out of this world, as soon you must,
          without being sprinkled with the blood of Christ, and forgiven your
          iniquities? Jesus knows the terrors of the world to come. He describes
          the torments of hell. He sees your danger; he warns you; he pities
          you; he sends his messengers to counsel you; he bids me say to the
          very chief of sinners, |Come unto me, and I will give you rest.| |Only
          return unto me and confess thine iniquity, and I will have mercy upon
          thee,| saith the Lord. May God grant that the compassion of Christ may
          be seen in thy case.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I turned over the Greek Concordance to find out where this word is
          repeated again and again, I found one instance in Luke 7:13. It refers
          to the widow at the gates of Nain. Her son was being carried out --
          her only son. He was dead, and she was desolate. The widow's only son
          was to her her sole stay; the succour as well as the solace of her old
          age. He was dead and laid upon the bier, and when Jesus saw the
          disconsolate mother, he was moved with compassion, and he restored her
          son. Oh! is there not refreshment here for you mothers that are
          weeping for your boys; you that have ungodly sons, unconverted
          daughters, the Lord Jesus sees your tears. You weep alone sometimes,
          and when you are sitting and enjoying the Word, you think, |Oh! that
          my Absalom were renewed; oh! that Ishmael might live before thee.|
          Jesus knows about it. He was always tender to his own mother, and he
          will be so to you. And you that are mourning over those that have been
          lately taken from you, Jesus pities you. Jesus wept, he sympathises
          with your tears. He will dry them and give you consolation. |He was
          moved with compassion.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Still the occasions on which we find this expression most frequently
          used in the Evangelists are when crowds of people were assembled. At
          the sight of the great congregations that gathered to hear him, our
          Lord was often moved with compassion. Sometimes it was because that
          they were hungry and faint, and in the fulness of his sympathy he
          multiplied the loaves and fishes to feed them. At the same time he
          showed his disciples that it is a good work to feed the poor. He would
          not have them so spiritually-minded as to forget that the poor have
          flesh and blood that require sustenance, and they need to eat and to
          drink, to be housed and clothed: the Christian's charity must not lie
          in words only, but in deeds. Our Lord was moved with compassion, it is
          said, when he saw the number of sick people in the throng, for they
          made a hospital of his preaching place. Wherever he paused or even
          passed by, they laid the sick in the streets; he could not stand or
          walk without the spectacle of their pallets to harrow his feelings.
          And he healed their impotent folk, as if to show that the Christian
          does well to minister to the sick -- that the patient watcher by the
          bedside may be serving the Lord, and following his example, as well as
          the most diligent teacher or the most earnest preacher of the glorious
          gospel. All means that can be used to mitigate human suffering are
          Christlike, and they ought to be carried out in his name, and carried
          to the utmost perfection possible. Christ is the patron of the
          hospital: he is the president of all places where men's bodies are
          cared for. But we are also told that the multitude excited his
          compassion because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he
          taught them as a guide that showed the path by leading the way; and he
          looked after their welfare as a Shepherd who regarded the health of
          their bodies as well as the good estate of their souls. Surely,
          brethren and sisters, if you love him, and wish to be like him, you
          cannot look on this congregation without pity. You cannot go out into
          the streets of London and stand in the high roads among the surging
          masses for half an hour without saying, |Whither away these souls?
          Which road are they travelling? Will they all meet in heaven?| What!
          live ye in London, move ye about in this great metropolis, and do ye
          never have the heartache, never feel your soul ready to burst with
          pity? Then shame upon you! Ask yourself whether ye have the spirit of
          Christ at all. In this congregation, were we all moved with pity as we
          should be, I should not have to complain, as I sometimes must, that
          persons come in and out here in want of someone to speak with them, to
          condole, to console, or to commune with them in their loneliness, and
          they find no helper. Time was when such a thing never occurred, but,
          in conversing with enquirers lately, I have met with several cases in
          which persons in a distressed state of mind have said that they would
          have given anything for half an hour's conversation with any Christian
          to whom they might have opened their hearts. They came from the
          country, attended the Tabernacle, and no one spoke to them. I am sorry
          it should be so. You used to watch for souls, most of you. Very
          careful were you to speak to those whom you saw again and again. I do
          pray you mend that matter. If you have any bowels of mercy, you should
          be looking out for opportunities to do good. Oh! never let a poor
          wounded soul faint for want of the balm. You know the balm. It has
          healed yourselves. Use it wherever the arrows of God have smitten a
          soul. Enough; I must leave this point; I have given you, I think,
          every case in which it is said that Jesus was moved with compassion.
          Very briefly let me notice: --
        </p>
        <p>III. SOME OF THE FORESIGHTS OF HIS COMPASSION.</p>
        <p>
          The Lord has gone from us, but as he knew what would happen while he
          was away, he has, with blessed forethought, provided for our wants.
          Well he knew that we should never be able to preserve the truth pure
          by tradition. That is a stream that always muddies and defiles
          everything. So in tender forethought he has given us the consolidated
          testimony, the unchangeable truth in his own Book; for he was moved
          with compassion. He knew the priests would not preach the gospel; he
          knew that no order of men could be trusted to hold fast sound doctrine
          from generation to generation; he knew there would be hirelings that
          dare not be faithful to their conscience lest they should lose their
          pay; while there would be others who love to tickle men's ears and
          flatter their vanity rather than to tell out plainly and distinctly
          the whole counsel of God. Therefore, he has put it here, so that if
          you live where there is no preacher of the gospel, you have the old
          Book to go to. He is moved with compassion for you. For where a man
          cannot go, the Book can go, and where in silence no voice is heard,
          the still clear voice of this blessed Book can reach the heart.
          Because he knew the people would require this sacred teaching, and
          could not have it otherwise, he was moved with compassion towards us
          all, and gave us the blessed Book of inspired God-breathed Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then, since he knew that some would not read the Bible, and others
          might read and not understand it, he has sent his ministers forth to
          do the work of evangelists. He raises up men, saved themselves from
          great sin, trophies of redeeming grace, who feel a sympathy with their
          fellow-men who are revelling in sin, reckless of their danger. These
          servants of his the Lord enables to preach his truth, some with more,
          some with less ability than others; still, there are, thank God,
          throughout this happy realm, and in other favoured lands, men
          everywhere, who, because sinners will not come to Christ of
          themselves, go after them and persuade them, plead with them, and
          intreat them to believe and turn to the Lord. This cometh of Christ's
          tender gentleness. He was moved with compassion, and therefore he sent
          his servants to call sinners to repentance.
        </p>
        <p>
          But since the minister, though he may call as he may, will not bring
          souls to Christ of himself, the Lord Jesus, moved with compassion, has
          sent his Spirit. The Holy Ghost is here. We have not to say: --
        </p>
        <p>|Come Holy Spirit, heavenly dove.|</p>
        <p>
          He is here. He dwells in his Church, and he moves over the
          congregation, and he touches men's hearts, and he subtly inclines them
          to believe in Christ. Oh! this is great mercy when a Prince spreads a
          feast and gives an invitation. That is all you can expect him to do.
          But if he keeps a host of footmen and says, |Go and fetch them one by
          one till they do come,| that is more gracious still. But if he goes
          himself and with sacred violence compels them to come in -- oh! this
          is more than we could have thought he would have done; but he is moved
          with compassion, and he does that. Furthermore, brethren, the Lord
          Jesus knew that after we were saved from the damning power of sin, we
          should always be full of wants, and therefore he was moved with
          compassion, and he sets up the throne of grace, the mercy-seat, to
          which we may always come, and from which we may always obtain grace to
          help in time of need. Helped by his Spirit, we can bring what
          petitions we will, and they shall be heard. And then, since he knew we
          could not pray as we ought, he was moved with compassion when he sent
          the Holy Spirit to help our infirmities, to teach us how to pray. Now
          I do not know a single infirmity that I have or that you have, my
          Christian brother, but what Christ Jesus has been moved with
          compassion about it, and has provided for it. He has not left one
          single weak point of which we have to say, |There I shall fail,
          because he will not help there|; but he has looked us over and over
          from head to foot, and said, |You will have an infirmity there: I will
          provide for it. You will have a weakness there: I will provide for
          it.| And oh! how his promises meet every case! Did you ever get into a
          corner where there was not a promise in the corner too? Had you ever
          to pass through a river but there was a promise about his being in the
          river with you? Were you ever on the sick bed without a promise like
          this, |I will make thy bed in thy sickness?| In the midst of
          pestilence have not you found a promise that |he shall cover thee with
          his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust?| The Lord's great
          compassion has met the wants of all his servants to the end. If our
          children should ever need much patience to be exercised towards them
          as Christ needs to exercise towards us, I am sure there would be none
          of us able to bear the house. They have their infirmities, and they
          full often vex and grieve us, it may be, but oh! we ought to have much
          compassion for the infirmities of our children -- ay, and of our
          brethren and sisters, and neighbours -- for what compassion has the
          Lord had with us? I do believe none but God could bear with such
          untoward children as we ourselves are. He sees our faults, you know,
          when we do not see them, and he knows what those faults are more
          thoroughly than we do. Yet still he never smites in anger. He cuts us
          not off, but he still continues to show us abounding mercies. Oh! what
          a guardian Saviour is the Lord Jesus Christ to us, and how we ought to
          bless his name at all times, and how his praise should be continually
          in our mouth. One thought strikes me that I must put in here: he knew
          that we should be very forgetful; and he was moved with compassion
          with our forgetfulness when he instituted the blessed Supper, and we
          can sit around the table and break bread, and pour forth the wine in
          remembrance of him. Surely this is another instance of how he is moved
          with compassion, and not with indignation, towards our weaknesses. And
          now let me close with: --
        </p>
        <p>IV. PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS OF THE COMPASSION OF CHRIST.</p>
        <p>
          I shall only recall my own experience in order to stir up your pure
          minds by way of remembrance, my brethren and sisters. I do well
          remember when I was under conviction of sin, and smarted bitterly
          under the rod of God, that when I was most heavy and depressed there
          would sometimes come something like hope across my spirit. I knew what
          it was to say, |My soul chooseth strangling rather than life,| yet
          when I was at the lowest ebb and most ready to despair, though I could
          not quite lay hold of Christ, I used to get a touch of the promise now
          and then, till I half hoped that, after all, I might prove to be God's
          prisoner, and he might yet set me free. I do remember well, when my
          sins compassed me about like bees, and I thought it was all over with
          me, and I must be destroyed by them, it was at that moment when Jesus
          revealed himself to me. Had he waited a little longer, I had died of
          despair, but that was no desire of his. On swift wings of love he came
          and manifested his dear wounded self to my heart. I looked to him and
          was lightened, and my peace flowed like a river. I rejoiced in him.
          Yes, he was moved with compassion. He would not let the pangs of
          conviction be too severe; neither would he suffer them to be
          protracted too long for the spirit of man to fail before him. It is
          not his wont to break a leaf that is driven by the tempest. |He will
          not quench the smoking flax.| Yea, and I do remember since I first saw
          him and began to love him many sharp and severe troubles, dark and
          heavy trials, yet have I noted this, that they have never reached that
          pitch of severity which I was unable to bear. When all gates seemed
          closed, there has still been with the trial a way of escape, and I
          have noted again that in deeper depressions of spirits through which I
          have passed, and horrible despondencies that have crushed me down, I
          have had some gleams of love, and hope, and faith at the last moment;
          for he was moved with compassion. If he withdrew his face, it was only
          till my heart broke for him, and then he showed me the light of his
          countenance again. If he laid the rod upon me, yet when my soul cried
          under his chastening he could not bear it, but he put back the rod,
          and he said, |My child, I will comfort thee.| Oh! the comforts that he
          gives on a sick bed! Oh! the consolations of Christ! when you are very
          low. If there is anything dainty to the taste in the Word of God, you
          get it then; if there be any bowels of mercy, you hear them sounding
          for you then. When you are in the saddest plight, Christ comes to your
          aid with the sweetest manifestations; for he is moved with compassion.
          How frequently have I noticed, and I tell it to his praise, for though
          it shows my weakness, it proves his compassion, that sometimes, after
          preaching the gospel, I have been so filled with self-reproach, that I
          could hardly sleep through the night because I had not preached as I
          desired. I have sat me down and cried over some sermons, as though I
          knew that I had missed the mark and lost the opportunity. Not once nor
          twice, but many a time has it happened, that within a few days someone
          has come to tell me that he found the Lord through that very sermon,
          the shortcoming of which I had deplored. Glory be to Jesus; it was his
          gentleness that did it. He did not want his servant to be too much
          bowed down with a sense of infirmity, and so he had compassion on him
          and comforted him. Have not you noticed, some of you, that after doing
          your best to serve the Lord, when somebody has sneered at you, or you
          have met with such a rebuff as made you half- inclined to give up the
          work, an unexpected success has been given you, so that you have not
          played the Jonah and ran away to Tarshish, but kept to your work? Ah!
          how many times in your life, if you could read it all, you would have
          to stop and write between the lines, |He was moved with compassion.|
          Many and many a time, when no other compassion could help, when all
          the sympathy of friends would be unavailing, he has been moved with
          compassion towards us, has said to us, |Be of good cheer,| banished
          our fears with the magic of his voice, and filled our souls to
          overflowing with gratitude. When we have been misrepresented,
          traduced, and slandered, we have found in the sympathy of Christ our
          richest support, till we could sing with rapture the verse -- I cannot
          help quoting it now, though I have often quoted it before: --
        </p>
        <p>|If on my face for thy dear name</p>
        <p>Shame and reproach shall be,</p>
        <p>I'll hail reproach and welcome shame,</p>
        <p>Since thou rememberest me.|</p>
        <p>
          The compassion of the Master making up for all the abuses of his
          enemies. And, believe me, there is nothing sweeter to a forlorn and
          broken spirit than the fact that Jesus has compassion. Are any of you
          sad and lonely? Have any of you been cruelly wronged? Have you lost
          the goodwill of some you esteemed? Do you seem as if you had the cold
          shoulder even from good people? Do not say, in the anguish of your
          spirit, |I am lost,| and give up. He hath compassion on you. Nay, poor
          fallen woman, seek not the dark river and the cold stream -- he has
          compassion. He who looks down with the bright eyes of yonder stars and
          watches thee is thy friend. He yet can help thee. Though thou hast
          gone so far from the path of virtue, throw not thyself away in blank
          despair, for he hath compassion. And thou, broken down in health and
          broken down in fortune, scarcely with shoe to thy feet, thou art
          welcome in the house of God, welcome as the most honoured guest in the
          assembly of the saints. Let not the weighty grief that overhangs thy
          soul tempt thee to think that hopeless darkness has settled thy fate
          and foreclosed thy doom. Though thy sin may have beggared thee, Christ
          can enrich thee with better riches. He hath compassion. |Ah!| say you,
          |they will pass me on the stairs; they will give me a broad pathway,
          and if they see me in the street they will not speak to me -- even his
          disciples will not.| Be it so; but better than his disciples, tenderer
          by far, is Jesus. Is there a man here, whom to associate with were a
          scandal from which the pure and pious would shrink?; the holy,
          harmless, undefiled one will not disdain even him -- for this man
          receiveth sinners -- he is a friend of publicans and sinners. He is
          never happier than when he is relieving and retrieving the forlorn,
          the abject, and the outcast. He despises not any that confess their
          sins and seek his mercy. No pride nestles in his dear heart, no
          sarcastic word rolls off his gracious tongue, no bitter expression
          falls from his blessed lips. He still receives the guilty. Pray to him
          now. Now let the silent prayer go up, |My Saviour, have pity upon me;
          be moved with compassion towards me, for if misery be any
          qualification for mercy, I am a fit object for thy compassion. Oh!
          save me for thy mercy's sake!| Amen.<br />
