          My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD;<br />Neither be weary
          of his reproof:<br />For whom the LORD loveth he reproveth;<br />Even
          as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Happy is the man that findeth wisdom,<br />And the man that getteth
          understanding.<br />For the merchandise of it is better than the
          merchandise of silver, And the gain thereof than fine gold.<br />She
          is more precious than rubies:<br />And none of the things thou canst
          desire are to be compared unto her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Length of days is in her right hand;<br />In her left hand are riches
          and honour.<br />Her ways are ways of pleasantness,<br />And all her
          paths are peace.<br />She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon
          her: And happy is every one that retaineth her.
        </p>
        <p>
          The LORD by wisdom founded the earth;<br />By understanding he
          established the heavens.<br />By his knowledge the depths were broken
          up,<br />And the skies drop down the dew.
