        <p>Held at the</p>
        <p>CRYSTAL PALACE, SYDENHAM,</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, October 7th, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>
          Being the Day appointed by Proclamation for a Solemn Fast,
          Humiliation, and Prayer before Almighty God: in order to obtain Pardon
          of our Sins, and for imploring His Blessing and Assistance on our Arms
          for the Restoration of Tranquillity in India.
        </p>
        <p>BRIEF INVOCATION.</p>
        <p>
          O GOD, the God of heaven and of earth, we do this day pay Thee
          reverence, and meekly bow our heads in adoration before Thine awful
          throne. We are the creatures of Thine hand; Thou hast made us, and not
          we ourselves. It is but just and right that we should pay unto Thee
          our adoration. O God I we are met together in a vast congregation for
          a purpose which demands all the power of piety, and all the strength
          of prayer. Send down Thy Spirit upon Thy servant, that he, whilst
          trembling in weakness, may be made strong to preach Thy Word, to lead
          forth this people in holy prayer, and to help them in that humiliation
          for which this day is set apart. Come, O God, we beseech Thee; bow our
          hearts before Thee; instead of sackcloth and ashes give us true
          repentance, and hearts meekly reverent; instead of the outward guise,
          to which some pay their only homage, give us the inward spirit; and
          may we really pray, really humiliate ourselves, and really tremble
          before the Most High God. Sanctify this service; make it useful unto
          us and honorable to Thyself. And O Thou dread Supreme, unto Thee shall
          be the glory and the honor, world without end. Amen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now praise God by singing the first Hymn. I shall read it
          through; and then, perhaps, you will be kind enough to sing it
          through.
        </p>
        <p>BEFORE Jehovah's awful throng,</p>
        <p>Ye nations bow with sacred joy;</p>
        <p>Know that the Lord is God alone;</p>
        <p>He can create and he destroy.</p>
        <p>His sovereign power, without our aid,</p>
        <p>made us of clay and form'd us men!</p>
        <p>And when like wand'ring sheep, we stray'd,</p>
        <p>He brought us to his fold again.</p>
        <p>We are his people, we his care,</p>
        <p>Our souls and all our mortal frame;</p>
        <p>What lasting honors shall we rear,</p>
        <p>Almighty Maker to thy name?</p>
        <p>We'll crowd thy gates with thankful songs,</p>
        <p>High as the heavens our voices raise;</p>
        <p>And earth with her ten thousand tongues,</p>
        <p>Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise.</p>
        <p>Wide as the world is thy command;</p>
        <p>Vast as eternity thy love;</p>
        <p>Firm as a rock thy truth must stand,</p>
        <p>When rolling years shall cease to move.</p>
        <p>EXPOSITION.</p>
        <p>DANIEL 9:1-19.</p>
        <p>
          |In the first year of Darius the Son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the
          Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;
        </p>
        <p>
          |In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the
          number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the
          prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of
          Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          |And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and
          supplications, withfasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:
        </p>
        <p>
          |And I prayed unto the Lord my God, and made my confession, and said,
          O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to
          them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;
        </p>
        <p>
          |We have sinned, and have committed, iniquity, and have done wickedly,
          and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy
          judgments:
        </p>
        <p>
          |Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake
          thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the
          people of the land.
        </p>
        <p>
          |O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of
          faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of
          Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off,
          through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of
          their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          |O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our
          princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          |To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have
          rebelled against him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          There is the first bright star which shines in the midst of the
          darkness of our sins. God is merciful. He is just -- as just as if he
          were not merciful. He is merciful -- as merciful as if he were not
          just, and in very deed more merciful than if he were too lenient;
          instead of blending a wise severity of justice with a gracious
          clemency of long-suffering. My brethren, we should rejoice that we
          have not this day to address the gods of the heathens. You have not
          to-day to bow down before the thundering Jove; you need not come
          before implacable deities, who delight in the blood of their
          creatures, or rather, of the creatures whom it is pretended that they
          have made. Our God delights in mercy, and in the deliverance of
          Britain from its ills. God will be as much pleased as Britain; yea,
          when Britain shall have forgotten it, and only the page of history
          shall record his mercies, God will still remember what he did for us
          in this day of our straits and our difficulties. As to the hope that
          he will help us it is a certainty. There is no fear that when we unite
          in prayer God will refuse to hear. It is as sure as that there is a
          God, that God will hear us; and if we ask him aright, the day shall
          come when the world shall see what Britain's God has done, and how he
          has heard her cry, and answered the voice of her supplications.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his
          laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that
          they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us,
          and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God,
          because we have sinned against him.
        </p>
        <p>
          |And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and
          against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil:
          for under this whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon
          Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          |As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us:
          yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God, that we might turn
          front our iniquities, and understand thy truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Therefore hath the Lord watched upon the evil, and brought it upon
          us: for the Lord our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth:
          for we obeyed not his voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          |And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of
          the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renoun, as
          at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The prophet in his prayer pleads what God has done for them, as the
          reason why he should make bare his arm; he tells how God delivered
          Israel out of Egypt; and he therefore prays that God would deliver
          them from their present trouble. And, my brethren, not Israel itself
          could boast a nobler history than we, measuring it by God's bounties.
          We have not yet forgotten an armada scattered before the breath of
          heaven, scattered upon the angry deep as a trophy of what God can do
          to protect his favored Isle. We have not yet forgotten a fifth of
          November, wherein God discovered divers plots that were formed against
          our religion and our commonwealth. We have not yet lost the old men,
          whose tales of even the victories in war are still a frequent story.
          We remember how God swept before our armies the man who thought to
          make the world his dominion, who designed to cast his shoe over
          Britain, and make it a dependency of his kingdom. God wrought for us;
          he wrought with us; and he will continue to do so. He hath not left
          his people, and he will not leave us, but he will be with us even to
          the end. Cradle of liberty! Refuge of distress! Storms may rage around
          thee, but not upon thee, nor shall all the wrath and fury of men
          destroy thee, for God hath pitched his tabernacle in thy midst, and
          his saints are the salt in the midst of thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          |O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine
          anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy
          mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers,
          Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about
          us.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Now, therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his
          supplications, and cause thy face to thine upon thy sanctuary that is
          desolate, for the Lord's sake.
        </p>
        <p>
          |O my God, incline thins ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold
          our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do
          not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but
          for thy great mercies.
        </p>
        <p>
          |O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O lord, hearken and do; defer not, for
          thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by
          thy name.|
        </p>
        <p>And now for a few moments let us endeavor to pray: --</p>
        <p>PRAYER</p>
        <p>
          OUR Father, which art in heaven,| we will be brief, but we will be
          earnest if Thou wilt help us. We have a case to spread before Thee
          this day. We will tell out our story, and we will pray that Thou
          wouldst forgive the weakness of the words in which it shall be
          delivered, and hear us, for Jesus' sake. O Father, Thou hast smitten
          this our land, not in itself, but in one of its dependencies. Thou
          hast allowed a mutinous spirit to break out in our armies, and Thou
          hast suffered men who know not Thee, who fear neither God nor man, to
          do deeds for which earth may well blush, and for which we, as men,
          desire to cover our faces before Thee. O Lord God, Thou couldst not
          bear the sin of Sodom; we are sure Thou canst not endure the sin which
          has been committed in India. Thou didst rain hell out of heaven upon
          the cities of the plain. The cities of Inde are not less vile than
          they, for they have committed lust and cruelty, and have much sinned
          against the Lord. Remember this, O God of Heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, O Lord our God, we are not here to be the accusers of our
          fellow-mall; we are here to pray that Thou wouldst remove the scourge
          which this great wickedness has brought upon us. Look down from
          heaven, O God, and behold this day the slaughtered thousands of our
          countrymen. Behold the wives, the daughters of Britain, violated,
          defiled! Behold her sons, cut in pieces and tormented in a manner
          which earth hath not beheld before. O God, free us, we beseech Thee,
          from this awful scourge! Give strength to our soldiers to execute upon
          the criminals the sentence which justice dictates; and then, by Thy
          strong arm, and by Thy terrible might, do Thou prevent a repetition of
          so fearful an outrage.
        </p>
        <p>
          We pray Thee, remember this day the widow and the fatherless children;
          think Thou of those who are this day distressed even to the uttermost.
          Guide the hearts of this great multitude, that they may liberally give
          and this day bestow of their substance to their poor destitute
          brethren. Remember especially our soldiers, now fighting in that land.
          God shield them! Be Thou a covert from the heat! Wilt Thou be pleased
          to mitigate all the rig ours of the climate for them! Lead them on to
          battle; cheer their hearts; bid them remember that they are not
          warriors merely, but executioners; and may they go with steady tramp
          to the battle, believing that God wills it that they should utterly
          destroy the enemy, who have not only defied Britain, but thus defiled
          themselves amongst men.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, O Lord, it is ours this day to humble ourselves before Thee. We
          are a sinful nation; we confess the sins of our governors and our own
          particular iniquities. For all our rebellions and transgressions, O
          God have mercy upon us! We plead the blood of Jesus. Help every one of
          us to repent of sin, to fly to Christ for refuge and grant that each
          one of us may thus hide ourselves in the rock, till the calamity be
          overpass, knowing that God will not desert them that put their trust
          in Jesus. Thy servant is overwhelmed this day; his heart is melted
          like wax in the midst of him; he knoweth not how to pray. Yet Lord if
          Thou canst hear a groaning heart which cannot utter itself in words,
          thou hearest his strong impassioned cry, in which the people join.
          Lord save us! Lord arise and bless us; and let the might of Thine arm
          and the majesty of Thy strength be now revealed in the midst of this
          land, and throughout those countries which are in our dominion God
          save the Queen! A thousand blessings on her much-loved head! God
          preserve our country! May every movement that promotes liberty and
          progress be accelerated, and may everything be done in our midst,
          which can shield us from the discontent of the masses, and can protect
          the masses from the oppression of the few. Bless England, O our God.
          |Shine, mighty God, on Britain shine;| and make her still glorious
          Britain, |beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth.| Lord
          accept our confessions; hear our prayers, and answer us by Thy Holy
          Spirit! Help Thy servant to preach to us; and all the glory shall be
          unto Thee, O Father, to Thee, O Son, and Thee, O Holy Spirit; world
          without end. Amen and Amen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now sing the second hymn. It is made up of verses selected from
          different psalms, which I thought to be appropriate to the occasion
        </p>
        <p>OUR God, our help in ages past,</p>
        <p>Our hope for years to come,</p>
        <p>Our shelter from the stormy blast,</p>
        <p>And our eternal home.</p>
        <p>Under the shadow of thy throne,</p>
        <p>Thy saints have dwelt secure</p>
        <p>Sufficient is thine arm alone,</p>
        <p>And our defense is sure.</p>
        <p>Our foes insult us, but our hope</p>
        <p>In thy compassion lies</p>
        <p>This thought shall bear our spirits up,</p>
        <p>That God will not despise.</p>
        <p>In vain the sons of Satan boast</p>
        <p>Of armies in array;</p>
        <p>When God has first despised their host,</p>
        <p>They fall an easy prey.</p>
        <p>Our God, our help in ages past,</p>
        <p>Our hope for years to come</p>
        <p>Be thou our guard while troubles last,</p>
        <p>And our eternal home.</p>
        <p>
          Hoping to receive help from God's Holy Spirit, I shall now proceed to
          address you from a part of the 9th verse of the 6th chapter of Micah:
          --
        </p>
        <p>SERMON.</p>
        <p>|Hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.| -- Micah 6:9.</p>
        <p>
          THIS world is not the place of punishment for sin; not the place; it
          may sometimes be a place, but not usually. It is very customary among
          religious people, to talk of every accident which happens to men in
          the indulgence of sin, as if it were a judgment. The upsetting of a
          boat upon a river on a Sunday is assuredly understood to be a judgment
          for the sin of Sabbath-breaking. In the accidental fall of a house, in
          which persons were engaged in any unlawful occupation, the inference
          is at once drawn that the house fell because they were wicked. Now,
          however some religionists may hope to impress the people by such
          childish stories as those, I, for one, forswear them all. I believe
          what my Master says is true, when he declared, concerning the men upon
          whom the tower of Siloam fell, that they were not sinners above all
          the sinners that were upon the face of the earth. They were sinners;
          there is no doubt about it; but the falling of the wall was not
          occasioned by their sin, nor was their premature death the consequence
          of their excessive wickedness. Let me, however, guard this
          declaration, for there are many who carry this doctrine to an extreme.
          Because God does not usually visit each particular offense in this
          life upon the transgressor, men are apt to deny altogether the
          doctrine of judgments. But here they are mistaken. I feel persuaded
          that there are such things as national judgments, national
          chastisements for national sins -- great blows from the rod of God,
          which every wise man must acknowledge to be, either a punishment of
          sin committed, or a monition to warn us to a sense of the consequences
          of sins, leading us by God's grace to humiliate ourselves, and repent
          of our sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          O, my friends, what a rod is that which has just fallen upon our
          country! My poor words will fall infinitely short of the fearful tale
          of misery and woe which must be told before you can know how smartly
          God hath smitten, and how sternly he hath chidden us. We have to-day
          to mourn over revolted subjects, for to-day a part of our
          fellow-countrymen are in open arms against our government. That, of
          itself, were a heavy blow. Happily the government of this land is so
          constituted that we know little of revolutions except by name; but the
          horrors of anarchy, the terrors of a government shaken to its
          foundations, are so great, that should I preach alone upon that
          subject, you might hear the rod, and cry aloud beneath its strokes.
          But this is as but the letting forth of water. A flood succeedeth. The
          men that have revolted were our subjects, and I challenge all the
          world to deny what I am going to say: they were our subjects rightly.
          Whatever the inhabitants of India might be (and undoubtedly that
          people have grave faults to find with us), the Sepoys had voluntarily
          given themselves up to our dominion, they had themselves taken oaths
          of fealty to Her Majesty and their officers, and they have no cause to
          murmur if they are made to endure the sentence uttered by a government
          of which they were the sworn and willing supporters. They were always
          petted, always dandled upon the knee of favoritism. Their revolt is
          not the revolt of a nation. If India had revolted, history might
          perhaps have taught us that she had patriots in her midst, who were
          delivering her from a tyrannical nation; but in the present cave it is
          only men who are impelled by a lust and ambition for empire, who have
          risen against us. And, ah I my friends, what crimes have they
          committed! Not to-day shall I detail their acts of debauchery,
          bloodshed, and worse than bestiality -- this tongue will not venture
          to utter what they have dared to do. Ye would rise from your seats and
          hiss me from the pulpit which I now occupy, if I should but dare to
          hint at the crimes which have been done of them, not in secret, but in
          the very streets of their cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, again, equally as painful, we have now rebels to be executed. I
          look upon every gallows as a fearful chastisement. I regard every
          gibbet as being a dreadful visitation upon our land; and I think that
          whenever the arm of the ruler is outstretched for the punishment of
          death, it must always be looked upon by the country as a serious
          affliction to it. Just as the father thinks it a high affliction to
          chastise his child, so should a country ever esteem it to be a
          visitation when they have to punish, especially with the punishment of
          death. Now, these men must be punished; both heaven and earth demand
          it. I am no soldier, I love not war; I do not believe that this is a
          war at all, in the proper sense of the term. We are not fighting with
          enemies; our troops are going forth against revolted subjects --
          against men who, by their crimes, by their murder, and by other
          unmentionable sins, have incurred the punishment of death; and as the
          arrest of a murderer by authority of the law is not war, so the arrest
          of Indian Sepoys, and their utter destruction is not war -- it is what
          earth demands, and what I believe God sanctions. But it is a horrible
          necessity. It is a dreadful thing to think of taking away the lives of
          our fellow-subjects; we must look upon it as being an affliction: and,
          to-day, amongst the other evils that we bemoan, we must bemoan this --
          that the sword must be taken out of its sheath, to cut off our
          fellow-subjects by their thousands. The rod, the rod, THE ROD hath
          indeed fallen heavily; no mortal tongue can tell the anguish it hath
          caused, nor perhaps can we yet dream where its ill effects shall end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, however, the words of my text. It is a rod; but it is an
          appointed rod. Every deed that has been done against us has been
          appointed by God. God is most fully to be cleared from the sin of it,
          but it is undoubtedly true that he has overruled and permitted it. The
          rod was ordained of God. I myself see God everywhere. I believe that
          |the foreknown station of a rush by the river is as fixed as the
          station of a king, and the chaff from the hand of the winnower as
          steered as the stars in their courses.| And I see God in this war. The
          wheels of providence may revolve in a mysterious manner, but I am
          certain that wisdom is the axle upon which they revolve, so that at
          last it shall be seen that God, who ordained the rod, only permitted
          it that greater good might follow, and that his name might be exalted
          through the earth. The sin is man's own deed, but the affliction that
          we suffer through it, God hath ordained. Let us bow before it, and let
          us now hearken to the exhortation of the text -- |Hear ye the rod, and
          him that hath appointed it.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall have your attention whilst as briefly as I can I endeavor to
          bid you hear this rod of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, let me remark, it would have been as well if we had heard this
          rod BEFORE IT FELL upon us. God's rod by the wise man may be heard
          before it smiteth. He that understandeth God's moral government, knows
          that sin carries punishment in its bowels. A wise man believing
          revelation, could have prophesied that God would visit us. The sins of
          the government of India have been black and deep. He who has heard the
          shrieks of tormented natives, who has heard the well-provoked cursing
          of dethroned princes, might have prophesied that it would not be long
          before God would unsheath his sword to avenge the oppressed. With
          regard to India itself, I am no apologist for our dominion there; with
          regard to the Sepoys, they are our voluntary subjects, they deserve
          the utmost rigour of the law. From their own oath they were our
          subjects; and if they have revolted let them suffer the punishment of
          their treason. But had it been the Indian nation that had revolted, I
          would have prayed God that they might have been brought under British
          rule again, for the sake of civilization, but I would not have
          preached a crusade against them, lest haply we should have been
          smiting patriots who were but delivering an oppressed country. My
          brethren, I say it would have been as well if the rod had been heard
          before it fell. If in the midst of sin the Indian government had
          paused, and endeavored to undo the evil, it would have been well for
          them -- if instead of following the policy of creed they had followed
          the policy of right, they might have looked for divine support. They
          never ought to have tolerated the religion of the Hindoos at all. I
          believe myself (for it in no way infringes the law of right) entitled
          to my religion; but if my religion consisted in bestiality,
          infanticide, and murder, I should have no right to my religion, unless
          I were prepared to be hanged for it. Now, the religion of the Hindoos
          is neither more nor less than a mass of the rankest filth that ever
          imagination could have conceived. The gods they worship are not
          entitled to the least atom of respect. Had they given a decent
          character to their demons, we might have tolerated their idolatry; but
          when their worship necessitates everything that is evil, not religion,
          but morality must put it down. I do not believe that in this land
          there ever ought to have been any toleration for the Agapemone, a
          place of lust and abomination, where sin is committed before which
          God's sun might blush, never ought to be tolerated. Any religion that
          does not infringe upon morality is beyond the force of legislature.
          But when once religious teachers teach immorality, and when once a
          religion compels men to sin, down with it; no toleration to it. It is
          impossible that there should be any quarter strewn to vice, even
          though embellished with the name of religion. If it be any man's
          religion to blow my brains out, I shall not tolerate it. If it be any
          man's religion to meet me as the Thugs do, and garotte me, and murder
          me, I shall not tolerate his Thugism. If it be a man's religion to
          commit bestial acts in public, I for one would touch his conscience,
          but believing that he has none, I would touch him somewhere else. Such
          a religion as the religion of the Hindoo, the Indian Government were
          bound, as in the sight of God, to put down with all the strength of
          their hand. But they have allowed it, in some cases they have even
          aided and abetted their filthy deeds; and now God visits them; and, I
          repeat, it would have been well if they had heard the rod before it
          fell; they might have perhaps avoided all this evil, and certainly
          they would have avoided the remorse which some of them must feel in
          having thus brought it upon themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it has fallen. The rod has smitten; the scourge has ploughed deep
          furrows upon India's back. What then? |Hear ye the rod| that has
          fallen. Now, it is an opinion published by authority -- and who am I,
          that I should dispute the great authorities of England? -- that one
          part of the reason for this dreadful visitation, is the sin of the
          people of England themselves. We are exhorted this day to humble
          ourselves for sin. Granting me that as being a truth -- and mark, I am
          not the originator of it; it is in the Proclamation -- who am I, that
          I should dispute such a high authority as that? -- it is our sin that
          has brought it us, so they say -- what, then, are our sins? Now, I
          will be honest with you -- as honest as I can, and I will try and tell
          you. What are the most glaring sins for which, if it be true that God
          is now punishing us, are the most likely to have brought this
          visitation upon us?
        </p>
        <p>
          First, there are sins in the community that never ought to have been
          allowed. O Britain, weep for deeds which thy governors have not yet
          strength of mind to stop. We have long been allowing the infamous
          nuisances of Holywell-street; bless God they are pretty well done for!
          But now what do I see every night? If I return from preaching in the
          country, in the Haymarket and in Regent-street, what stares me before
          my eyes? If there be a crime for which God will visit England, it is
          the sin of allowing infamy to walk before our eyes thus publicly. I do
          not know whose fault it is -- some say it is the fault of the police:
          it is somebody's fault, that I do know, and against that somebody I do
          now most solemnly protest. It is a most fearful thing that those who
          are honest and moral cannot walk the streets, without being insulted
          by sin in the robes of the harlot. My voice perhaps this day may reach
          some who have power to repeat this protest powerfully and
          successfully. I see before me gentlemen who are the representatives of
          the press. I believe they will do their duty in that matter; and if
          they will sting as some of them can sting, right sharply, they perhaps
          may be able to sting a little virtue into some of our governors, and
          that will be a good thing. But I do protest that this has been one of
          the causes why God has visited us, if indeed our sins have brought
          this evil upon us, as I verily believe. Look ye too, men and brethren,
          at some of those amusements of yours, in which ye are wont to indulge.
          God forbid I should deny you those of your amusements which are
          innocent, but I must maintain that they should be always moral; when
          we know that lords and ladies of the land, have sat in playhouses, and
          listened to plays that were a long way from decent, it is time that
          some voice should be lifted up against them. These are glaring sins. I
          am not raking now for private faults; we have had these things before
          our eyes, and there have been some that have dared to protest against
          them long ago. I say, these sins of the community in part have brought
          the rod upon us.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, my friends, I am inclined to think that our class sins are the
          most grievous. Behold this day the sins of the rich. How are the poor
          oppressed! How are the needy down-trodden! In many a place the average
          wage of men is far below their value to their masters. In this age
          there is many a great man who looks upon his fellows as only
          stepping-stones to wealth. He builds a factory as he would make a
          cauldron. He is about to make a brew for his own wealth. |Pitch him
          in.| He is only a poor clerk, he can live on a hundred a year. Put him
          in! There is a poor time-keeper: he has a large family; it does not
          matter; a man can be had for less: in with him! Here are the tens, the
          hundreds, and the thousands that must do the work. Put them in; heap
          the fire; boil the cauldron; stir them up; never mind their cries. The
          hire of the laborers kept back may go up to heaven: it does not
          matter, the millions of gold are safe. The law of demand and supply is
          with us, who is he that would interfere? Who shall dare to prevent the
          grinding of the faces of the poor? Cotton-lords and great masters
          ought to have power to do what they like with the people: ought they
          not? |Ah! but ye great men of the earth, there is a God, and that God
          has said he executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are
          oppressed. And yet the sempstress in her garret, and yet the tailor in
          his den, and yet the artizan in his crowded factory, and yet the
          servants who earn your wealth, who have to groan under your
          oppression, shall get the ear of God, and he will visit you. |Hear ye
          the rod.| It is for this the rod falleth on you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark, again, the sins of merchants. Was there ever an age when the
          merchants of England had more fallen from their integrity? The mass of
          them, I believe, are honest to the core; but I do not know who among
          them are so. We can trust none in these times. Ye heap up your
          companies, and ye delude your myriads; ye gather the money of fools;
          ye scatter it to the winds of heaven, and when the poor call upon you
          ye tell them it is gone: but where? O! England, thou wast once true,
          upright, honest; men could not rightly call thee, then, |Perfidious
          Albion;| but now, O Britain, alas! for thee! Unless thou dost recover
          thyself, who can trust thee? God will visit the nation for this, and
          it shall be seen that this alone is one of the things which God would
          have us hear, when we hear the rod.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many of you that are poor. I saw you smile when I spoke to
          the rich. I will have at you also. If we are to humble ourselves this
          day as a nation, ye have cause also to humble. Ah, my God, what
          multitudes there are of men who deserve but little of their employers,
          for they are eye-servers, men-pleasers, and do not with singleness of
          heart serve the Lord. Were men better workmen, their masters would be
          better. There are hundreds of you that are here to-day who are the
          best hands in all the world to prop up walls, when you ought to be
          busy at your own work -- who, when your time is bought and paid for,
          steal it for something else. And how many there are in what are called
          the lower ranks -- and God forgive the man that invented that word,
          for we are none of us lower than the other before the Judge of all the
          earth -- how many are there that do not know what it is to look up to
          God, and say, |Though he has made me a servant, I will discharge my
          duty, and I will serve my master and serve my God with all my might.|
          Many are the sins of the poor. Humble yourselves with the rich; bow
          your heads and weep for your iniquities; for these things God doth
          visit us, and ye should hear the rod.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is impossible for me to-day to enter into all the sins of
          illiberality, of deceit, of bigotry, of lasciviousness, of carnality,
          of pride, of covetousness, and of laziness which infest this land. I
          have tried to indicate some of the chief, and I pray God humble us all
          for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, |Hear ye the rod.| O church of God, the rod has fallen, and
          the church ought to hear it. I am afraid that it is the church that
          has been the greatest sinner. Do I mean by |the church| that
          established by law? No, I mean the Christian church as a body. We, I
          believe, have been remiss in our duty; for many and many a year
          pulpits never condescended to men of low estate. Our ministers were
          great and haughty; they understood the polish of rhetoric, they had
          all the grandeur of logic; to the people they were blind guides and
          dumb dogs, for the people knew not what they said, neither did they
          regard them. The churches themselves slumbered; they wrapped
          themselves in a shroud of orthodoxy, and they slept right on; and,
          whilst Satan was devouring the world, and taking his prey, the church
          sat still, and said, |Who is my neighbor?| and did not arouse herself
          to serve her God. I do hope that we have already seen the beginning of
          a revival. The last year has seen more preaching than any year since
          the days of the apostles. We are stirring in ragged schools, and in
          various efforts for doing good; but still the church is only half
          awake; I fear she still slumbers. O church of God! awake I awake I
          awake! for verily the rod has fallen for thy sake. |Hear thou the rod,
          and him that hath appointed it.|
        </p>
        <p>
          We have had many rods, friends; we have had many great afflictions,
          and we did bear them for a time; and now I close my sermon by saying,
          |Hear ye the rod, when the rod SHALL AGAIN BE STILL.| We trust that in
          a little while our soldiers will carve us out peace and victory with
          their triumphant swords; we trust that, perhaps this very day a great
          fight is being fought, and a great victory being won. I seem to hear
          to-day the shout of the triumphant warrior; I think I hear the trump
          of victory even now. The hour of prayer is often the hour of
          deliverance. At any rate, we hope that ere long this black cloud will
          be overblown, and then I fear you will all forget it. You will pray
          to-day: will you pray when victory comes? You will buy some fireworks,
          will you not? That is how you will thank God! You had a victory over a
          potent enemy, and peace was established: your votive offerings
          consisted of rockets and illuminations -- grand offerings to the Dread
          Supreme! If a heathen were here he would say, |Their God is the God of
          humiliation, not the God of victory: their God is a God of trouble,
          certainly not the God of blessings, for they forget him when they
          receive deliverance.| I remember, when last time the cholera swept
          through your streets, ye hurried to your churches, and ye prayed;
          terror sat upon your countenances, and many of you cried aloud for
          deliverance. It came. What did you do? Alas! for your piety! It was as
          the morning cloud, and as the early dew it passed away. It will be so
          again. It is but as the lashing of the water; it is smitten, but it
          soon recovers itself, and all marks are effaced. It is so with this
          land; I fear it is so with each of us to a degree. How often have you
          and I been laid upon our beds with cholera, or with fever, or with
          some other disease which threatened to take us away! We prayed; we
          sent for the minister; we devoted ourselves to God; we vowed, if he
          would spare us, we would live better. Here thou art, my hearer, just
          what thou wast before thy sickness. Thou hast forgotten thy vow; but
          God hath not forgotten it. Thy resolutions were filed in heaven, and
          in the day of judgment God shall take them forth, and say, |Here is
          one solemn covenant broken; here is another vow forgotten, another
          resolution made in sickness broken after recovery!| I do think that
          to-day will be a most solemn mockery if our humiliation ends to-day.
          With some of you it will not even begin to-day, and, therefore, it
          will not end, for it is not begun. But the mass who will pray to-day,
          will they pray in a week? Not they; they will go their way, to heap
          again the faggots of their sins upon the pile of vengeance, and still
          stand by and weep, because the fire is burning, the fire which they
          themselves have kindled. Oh! my hearers, permit me to charge home to
          your hearts; and would God that he would make the charge of my
          language against your consciences as heavy as the charge of British
          soldiery against the enemy! How many of you have been awakened,
          convinced of sin, of righteousness, and of judgement! How many times
          have you vowed you would repent! How many times have you declared that
          you did hear the rod, and that you would turn to God! And yet you have
          been liars to the Almighty; you have defrauded the Most High; and
          whilst the bill is due it still stands dishonored. Tremble! God may
          smite you yet; and if to-day you are despisers of Christ, remember,
          you have no guarantee that you will be in this world another hour. You
          may before this sun is set stand before your Maker's bar. What then?
          what then? what then? To perish for ever is no light matter; to be
          cast into the flames of hell is no little consideration. |Turn ye,
          turn ye, turn ye; why will ye die, O house of Israel!| Repent! |The
          times of your ignorance God winked at, but now commandeth all men
          everywhere to repent.| And remember that when he gives repentance and
          faith he has appended the blessing to them. |Jesus Christ of the seed
          of David| was nailed to a cross; he died that we might not die, and to
          every believer heaven's gate is open, to every penitent the path to
          paradise is free. Sinner I dost thou believe? If so, Christ hath
          blotted out thy sin. Be happy! Soul! dost thou repent? Thou art safe.
          God has helped thee to repent, and inasmach as he hath done that, he
          hath proved that he loves thee.
        </p>

          Oh! if I might but have some souls won to Christ to-day, what would I
          give? What is all this great gathering to me? It is an extra labor,
          that is all. For this I do not labor. God is my witness, I sought you
          not; never once have I said a thing to court a smile from any man.
          When God first sent me to the ministry he bade me fear no man, and I
          have not yet met the man to whom I have feared to tell of God's truth.
          Nor you have I sought to please, nor you have I sought to gather here.
          I would preach the gospel; may God give me some souls as my reward!
          And if but one poor sinner shall look to Jesus, clap your wings, ye
          angels! enough is done, for God is honored.

          I have done my sermon, but I want to make an appeal to you to give
          liberally.

          Lives there a man in England who will this day refuse his help to
          those of his countrymen who have suffered? No; there does not live
          such a man -- not such a Briton. Is there a miserable miscreant
          without a heart, who will, when God has given him enough, shut up his
          bowels of compassion against those whose sons and daughters have been
          murdered, and who themselves have escaped as by the skin of their
          teeth? No, I will not slander you by such a supposition. I cannot
          think that I have such a monster here. When the box shall pass round,
          give -- give as you can afford; if it be a penny, let the working man
          give. You that are rich must not give pence, however. Many a man has
          said, |There is my mite.| He was worth a hundred thousand pounds, and
          it was not a mite at all; if he had given a thousand it would only
          have been a mite to him. Give as ye can afford it; may God be pleased
          to grant a liberal spirit.

        <p>The following Chorus was then sung --</p>
        <p>GLORY, honor, praise, and power,</p>
        <p>Be unto the Lamb for ever;</p>
        <p>Jesus Christ is our Redeemer,</p>
        <p>Hallelujah, Amen.</p>
        <p>
          After which, the benediction having been pronounced, the service
          terminated.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were upwards of 24,000 persons present at this service; and the
          amount collected towards the Indian Relief Fund amounted to nearly
          £500, of which £25 was given by Miss Nightingale. The Crystal Palace
          Company contributed £200 in addition -- making a total of nearly £700.
