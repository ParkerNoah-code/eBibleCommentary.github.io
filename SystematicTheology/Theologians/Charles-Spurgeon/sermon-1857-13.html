        <p>A Sermon</p>

          "By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not,
          when she had received the spies with peace." -- Hebrews 11:31.
        </p>
        <p>
          IN ALMOST every capital of Europe there are varieties of triumphal
          arches or columns, upon which are recorded the valiant deeds of the
          country's generals, its emperors, or its monarchs. You will find, in
          one case, the thousand battles of a Napoleon recorded, and in another,
          you find the victories of a Nelson pictured. It seems, therefore, but
          right, that faith, which is the mightiest of the mighty, should have a
          pillar raised to its honor, upon which its valiant deeds should be
          recorded. The apostle Paul undertook to raise the structure, and he
          erected a most magnificent pillar in the chapter before us. It recites
          the victories of faith. It begins with one triumph of faith, and then
          proceeds to others. We have, in one place, faith triumphing over
          death; Enoch entered not the gates of hades, but reached heaven by
          another road from that which is usual to men. We have faith, in
          another place, wresting with time; Noah, warned of God concerning
          things not seen as yet, wrestled with time, which placed his deluge a
          hundred and twenty years away; and yet, in the confidence of faith, he
          believed against all rational expectation, against all probability,
          and his faith was more than a match for probability and time too. We
          have faith triumphing over infirmity -- Abraham begetteth a son in his
          old age. And then we have faith triumphing over natural affection, as
          we see Abraham climbing to the top of the hill and raising the knife
          to slay his only and beloved son at the command of God. We see faith,
          again, entering the lists with the infirmities of old age and the
          pains of the last struggle, as we read, "By faith Jacob, when he was
          dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the
          top of his staff." Then we have faith combating the allurements of a
          wealthy court. "By faith Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ greater
          riches than the treasures in Egypt." We see faith dauntless in courage
          when Moses forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king, and
          equally patient in suffering when he endured as seeing him who is
          invisible. We have faith dividing seas, and casting down strong walls.
          And then, as though the greatest victory should be recorded last, we
          have faith entering the lists with sin, holding a tournament with
          iniquity, and coming off more than a conqueror. "Rahab perished not
          with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with
          peace." That this woman was no mere hostess, but a real harlot, I have
          abundantly proved to every candid hearer while reading the chapter. I
          am persuaded that nothing but a spirit of distaste for free grace
          would ever have led any commentator to deny her sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do think this triumph of faith over sin is not the least here
          recorded, but that if there be any superiority ascribable to any one
          of faith's exploits, this is, in some sense, the greatest of all.
          What! faith, didst thou fight with hideous lust? What! wouldst thou
          struggle with the fiery passion which sendeth forth flame from human
          breasts? What! wouldst thou touch with thy hallowed fingers foul and
          bestial debauchery? "Yea," says faith, "I did encounter this
          abomination of iniquity; I delivered this woman from the loathsome
          chambers of vice, the wily snares of enchantment, and the fearful
          penalty of transgression; yea, I brought her off saved and rescued,
          gave her purity of heart, and renewed in her the beauty of holiness;
          and now her name shall be recorded in the roll of my triumphs as a
          woman full of sin, yet saved by faith."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall have some things to say this morning concerning this notable
          victory of faith over sin, such as I think will lead you to see that
          this was indeed a supereminent triumph of faith. I will make my
          divisions alliterative, that you may recollect them. This woman's
          faith was saving faith, singular faith, stable faith, self-denying
          faith, sympathising faith, and sanctifying faith. Let no one run away,
          when I shall have expounded the first point, and miss the rest, for
          you can not apprehend the whole power of her faith unless you remember
          each of those particulars I am about to mention.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In the first place, this woman's faith was SAVING FAITH. All the
          other persons mentioned here were doubtless saved by faith; but I do
          not find it specially remarked concerning any of them that they
          perished not through their faith; while it is particularly said of
          this woman, that she was delivered amid the general destruction of
          Jericho purely and only through her faith. And, without doubt, her
          salvation was not merely of a temporal nature, not merely a
          deliverance of her body from the sword, but redemption of her soul
          from hell. O! what a mighty thing faith is, when it saves the soul
          from going down to the pit! So mighty is the ever-rushing torrent of
          sin, that no arm but that which is as strong as Deity can ever stop
          the sinner from being hurried down to the gulf of black despair, and,
          when nearing that gulf, so impetuous is the torrent of divine wrath,
          that nothing can snatch the soul from perdition but an atonement which
          is as divine as God himself. Yet faith is the instrument of
          accomplishing the whole work. It delivers the sinner from the stream
          of sin, and so, laying hold upon the omnipotence of the Spirit, it
          rescues him from that great whirlpool of destruction into which his
          soul was being hurried. What a great thing it is to save a soul! You
          can never know how great it is unless you have stood in the capacity
          of a saviour to other men. You heroic man who, yesterday, when the
          house was burning, climbed the creaking stair-case, and, almost
          suffocated by the smoke, entered an upper chamber, snatched a babe
          from its bed and a woman from the window, bore them both down in his
          arms, and saved them at the peril of his own life, he can tell you
          what a great thing it is to save a fellow-creature. Yon noble-hearted
          youth who, yesterday, sprang into the river, at the hazard of himself,
          and snatched a drowning man from death, he felt, when he stood upon
          the shore, what a great thing it was to save life. Ah! but you can not
          tell what a great thing it is to save a soul. It is only our Lord
          Jesus Christ who can tell you that, for he is the only one who has
          ever been the Saviour of sinners. And remember, you can only know how
          great a thing faith is by knowing the infinite value of the salvation
          of a soul. "Now, by faith, the harlot Rahab was delivered." That she
          was really saved in a gospel sense as well as temporally, seems to me
          to be proved from her reception of the spies which was an emblem of
          the entrance of the word into her heart, and her hanging out of the
          scarlet thread was an evidence of faith, not unaptly picturing faith
          in the blood of Jesus the Redeemer. But who can measure the length and
          breadth of that word -- salvation. Ah! it was a mighty deed which
          faith accomplished when he bore her off in safety. Poor sinner! take
          comfort. The same faith which saved Rahab can save thee. Art thou
          literally one of Rahab's sisters in guilt? She was saved, and so
          mayest thou be, if God shall grant thee repentance. Woman! art thou
          loathsome to thyself? Dost thou stand at this moment in this assembly,
          and say, "I am ashamed to be here; I know I have no right to stand
          among people who are chaste and honest?" I bid thee still remain; yea,
          come again and make this thy Sabbath house of prayer. Thou art no
          intruder! Thou art welcome! For thou hast a sacred right to the courts
          of mercy. Thou hast a sacred right; for here sinners are invited, and
          thou art such. Believe in Christ, and thou, like Rahab, shalt not
          perish with the disobedient, but even thou shalt be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now there is some gentleman in the audience who says, "There's a
          gospel for you; it is a kind of sanctuary for wicked men, unto which
          the worst of people may run and be saved." Yes, that is the stale
          objection which Celsus used against Oigen in his discussion. "But,"
          said Origen, "it is true, Celsus, that Christ's gospel is a sanctuary
          for thieves, robbers, murderers, and harlots. But know this, it is not
          a sanctuary merely, it is an hospital too; for it heals their sins,
          delivers them from their diseases, and they are not afterwards what
          they were before they received the gospel." I ask no man to-day to
          come to Christ, and then continue his sins. If so, I should ask him to
          do an absurdity. As well might I talk of delivering a Prometheus,
          while his chains are allowed to remain upon him and bind him to his
          rock. It can not be. Christ taketh away the vulture from the
          conscience, but he taketh away the chains too, and maketh the man
          wholly free when he doeth it all. Yet, we repeat it again, the chief
          of sinners are as welcome to Christ as the best of saints. The
          fountain filled with blood was opened for black ones; the robe of
          Christ was woven for naked ones; the balm of Calvary was compounded
          for sick ones; life came into the world to raise the dead. And O! ye
          perishing and guilty souls, may God give you Rahab's faith, and you
          shall have this salvation, and shall with her stand yonder, where the
          white-robed spotless hosts sing unending hallelujah to God and the
          Lamb.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But mark, Rahab's faith was a SINGULAR FAITH. The city of Jericho
          was about to be attacked; within its walls there were hosts of people
          of all classes and characters, and they knew right well that if their
          city should be sacked and stormed they would all be put to death; but
          yet, strange to say, there was not one of them who repented of sin, or
          who even asked for mercy, except this woman who had been a harlot.
          She, and she alone was delivered, a solitary one among a multitude.
          Now, have you ever felt that it is a very hard thing to have a
          singular faith? It is the easiest thing in the world to believe as
          every body else believes, but the difficulty is to believe a thing
          alone, when no one else thinks as you think; to be the solitary
          champion of a righteous cause when the enemy mustereth his thousands
          to the battle. Now, this was the faith of Rahab. She had not one who
          felt as she did, who could enter into her feelings and realize the
          value of her faith. She stood alone. O! it is a noble thing to be the
          lonely follower of despised truth. There be some who could tell you a
          tale of standing up alone. There have been days when the world poured
          continually a river of infamy and calumny upset them, but they stemmed
          the torrent, and, by continued grace, made strong in weakness, they
          held their own until the current turned, and they, in their success,
          were praised and applauded by the very men who sneered before. Then
          did the world accord them the name of "great." But where lay their
          greatness? Why, in this, that they stood as firm in the storm as they
          stood in the calm -- that they were as content to serve God alone as
          they were to run by fifties. To be good we must be singular.
          Christians must swim against the stream. Dead fish always float down
          the stream, but the living fish forces its way against the current.
          Now, worldly religious men will go just as every body else goes. That
          is nothing. The thing is to stand alone. Like Elijah, when be said, "I
          only am left and they seek my life;" to feel in one's self that we
          believe as firmly as if a thousand witnesses stood up by our side. O!
          there is no great right in a man, no strong-minded right, unless he
          dares to be singular. Why, the most of you are as afraid as you ever
          can be to go out of the fashions, and you spend more money than you
          ought because you think you must be respectable. You dare not move in
          opposition to your brethren and sisters in the circle in which you
          move; and therefore you involve yourselves in difficulties. You are
          blindfolded by the rich fabric of fashion, and therefore many a wrong
          thing is tolerated because it is customary. But a strong-minded man is
          one who does not try to be singular, but who dares to be singular,
          when he knows that to be singular is to be right. Now, Rahab's faith,
          sinner as she was, had this glory, this crown about its head, that she
          stood alone, faithful among the faithless found."
        </p>
        <p>
          And why should not God vouchsafe the same faith to thee, my poor,
          sinning, but contrite hearer? You live in a back street, in a house
          which contains none but Sabbath breakers, and irreligious men and
          women. But if you have grace in your heart you will dare to do right.
          You belong to an infidel club; if you should make them a speech after
          your own conscience, they would hiss you; and if you forsook their
          company, they would persecute you. Go and try them. Dare them. See,
          whether you can do it; for if you are afraid of men, you are taken in
          a snare which may prove your grief and is now your sin. Mark you, the
          chief of sinners can make the most daring of saints; the worst men in
          the devil's army, when they are converted, make the truest soldiers
          for Jesus. The forlorn hope of Christendom has generally been led by
          men who have proved the high efficacy of grace to an eminent degree by
          having been saved from the deepest sins. Go on, and the Lord give you
          that high and singular faith!
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Furthermore, this woman's faith was A STABLE FAITH, which stood
          firm in the midst of trouble, I have heard of a church clergyman who
          was once waited upon by his church warden, after a long time of
          drought, and was requested to put up the prayer for rain. "Well," said
          he, "my good man, I will offer it, but it's not a bit of use while the
          wind is in the east, I'm sure." There are many who have that kind of
          faith: they believe just so far as probabilities go with them, but
          when the promise and the probability part, then they follow the
          probability and part with the promise. They say, "The thing is likely,
          therefore I believe it." But that is no faith, it is sight. True faith
          exclaims, "The thing is unlikely, yet I believe it." This is real
          faith. Faith is to say, that "mountains, when in darkness hidden, are
          as real as in day." Faith is to look through that cloud, not with the
          eye of sight, which seeth naught, but with the eye of faith, which
          seeth every thing, and to say, "I trust him when I can not trace him;
          I tread the sea as firmly as I would the rock; I walk as securely in
          the tempest as in the sunshine, and lay myself to rest upon the
          surging billows of the ocean as contentedly as upon my bed." The faith
          of Rahab was the right sort of faith, for it was firm and enduring.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will just have a little talk with Rahab this morning, as I suppose
          old Unbelief did commune with her. Now, my good woman, don't you see
          the absurdity of this thing? Why, the people of Israel are on the
          other side of Jordan, and there is no bridge: how are they to get
          over? Of course they must go up higher toward the fords; and then
          Jericho will be for a long time secure. They will take other cities
          before coming to Jericho; and, besides, the Canaanites are mighty, and
          the Israelites are only a parcel of slaves; they will soon be cut in
          pieces, and there will be an end of them; therefore, do not harbor
          these spies. Why put your life in jeapordy for such an improbability?
          "Ah," says she, "I do not care about the Jordan; my faith can believe
          across the Jordan, or else it were only a dry-land faith." By-and-by,
          they march through the Jordan dry shod, and then Faith gets firmer
          confidence. "Ah!" says she, secretly within herself, what she would
          willingly have said to her neighbors, "will you not now believe? will
          you not now sue for mercy?" "No," they say; "the walls of Jericho are
          strong; can the feeble host resist us? And lo on the morrow the troops
          are out, and what do they do? They simply blow a number of rams'
          horns; her neighbors say, "Why, Rahab, you do not mean to say you
          believe now? They are mad." The people just go round the city, and all
          hold their tongues, except the few priests blowing rams' horns. "Why,
          it is ridiculous. It were quite a new thing in warfare to hear of men
          taking a city by blowing rams' horns." That was the first day;
          probably the next day Rahab thought they would come with
          scaling-ladders and mount the walls; but no, rams' horns again, up to
          the seventh day; and this woman kept the scarlet thread in the window
          all the time, kept her father and mother, and brothers and sisters in
          the house, and would not let them go out; and on the seventh day, when
          the people made a great shout, the wall of the city fell flat to the
          ground; but her faith overcame her womanly timidity, and she remained
          within, although the wall was tumbling to the ground. Rahab's house
          stood alone upon the wall, a solitary fragment amid a universal wreck,
          and she and her household were all saved. Now would you have thought
          that such a rich plant would grow in such poor soil -- that strong
          faith could grow in such a sinful heart as that of Rahab? Ah! but here
          it is that God exercises his great husbandry. "My Father is the
          husbandman," said Christ. Any husbandman can get a good crop out of
          good soil; but God is the husbandman who can grow cedars on rocks, who
          can not only put the hyssop upon the wall, but put the oak there too,
          and make the greatest faith spring up in the most unlikely position.
          All glory to his grace! the great sinner may become great in faith.
          "Be of good cheer, then, sinner! If Christ should make thee repent,
          thou hast no need to think that thou shalt be the least in the family.
          O! no; thy name may yet be written among the mightiest of the mighty,
          and thou mayest stand as a memorable and triumphant instance of the
          power of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. This woman's faith was A SELF-DENYING FAITH. She dared to risk her
          life for the sake of the spies. She knew that if they were found in
          her house she would be put to death; but though she was so weak as to
          do a sinful deed to preserve them, yet she was so strong that she
          would run the risk of being put to death to save these two men. It is
          some thing to be able to deny ourselves. An American once said, "I
          have got a good religion; it's the right sort of religion; I do not
          know that it costs me a cent a year; and yet I believe I am as truly a
          religious man as anybody." "Ah!" said one who heard it, "the Lord have
          mercy on your miserable stingy soul, for if you had been saved you
          would not have been con tent with a cent a year" -- a halfpenny per
          annum! I hazard this assertion, that there is nothing in the faith of
          that man who does not exercise self-denial. If we never give any thing
          to Christ's cause, work for Christ, deny ourselves for Christ, the
          root of the matter is not in us. I might call some of you hypocrites:
          you sing,
        </p>
        <p>"And if I might make some reserve,</p>
        <p>And duty did not call,</p>
        <p>I love my God with zeal so great,</p>
        <p>That I could give him all."</p>

          Yes, but you would not, though; you know better than that, for you do
          not, as it is, give all, no, nor yet half, nor yet the thousandth
          part. I suppose you think you are poor yourselves, though you have got
          some thousand pounds odd a year, and so you keep it yourself, under
          the notion that "he that giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord." I
          don't know how else it is you make your religion square with itself,
          and be at all consistent. This woman said, "If I must die for these
          men, I will; I am prepared, bad name as I have, to have a worse name
          still; as a traitor to my country I am prepared to be handed down to
          infamy, if it be necessary, for having betrayed my country in taking
          in these spies, for I know it is God's will it should be done, and do
          it I will at every hazard. "O men and brethren, trust not your faith,
          unless it has self-denial with it. Faith and self-denial, like the
          Siamese twins, are born together, and must live together, and the food
          that nourisheth one must nourish both. But this woman, poor sinner as
          she was, would deny herself. She brought her life, even as that other
          woman, who was a sinner, brought the alabaster box of precious
          ointment, and broke it on the head of Christ.
        </p>

          V. Not to detain you too long, another point very briefly. This
          woman's faith was A SYMPATHISING FAITH. She did not believe for
          herself only; she desired mercy for her relations, Said she, "I want
          to be saved, but that very desire makes me want to have my father
          saved, and my mother saved, and my brother saved, and my sister
          saved." I know a man who walks seven miles every Sabbath to hear the
          gospel preached in a certain place -- a place where they preach the
          gospel. You know that very particular, superfine sort -- the gospel, a
          gospel, the spirit of which consists in bad temper, carnal security,
          arrogance, and a seared conscience. But this man was one day met by a
          friend, who said to him, "Where is your wife?" "Wife?" said he to him.
          "What! does she not come with you?" "O! no", said the man; "she never
          goes anywhere." "Well, but," said he, "don't you try to get her to go,
          and the children?" "No; the fact of it is, I think, if I look to
          myself that is quite enough." "Well," said the other, "and you believe
          that you are God's elect, do you?" "Yes." "Well, then," said the
          other, "I don't think you are, because you are worse than a heathen
          man and a publican, for you don't care for your own household;
          therefore I don't think you give much evidence of being God's elect,
          for they love their fellow-creatures." So sure as our faith is real,
          it will want to bring others in. You will say, "You want to make
          proselytes." Yes; and you will reply, that Christ said to the
          Pharisees, "Ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte." Yes, and
          Christ did not find fault with them for doing so; what he found fault
          with them for was this -- "When ye have found him ye make him tenfold
          more the child of hell than yourselves."
        </p>
        <p>
          The spirit of proselyting is the spirit of Christianity, and we ought
          to be desirous of possessing it. If any man will say, "I believe such
          and such a thing is true, but I do not wish any one else to believe
          it, I will tell you, it is a lie; he does not believe it, for it is
          impossible, heartily and really to believe a thing, without desiring
          to make others believe the same. And I am sure of this, moreover, it
          is impossible to know the value of salvation without desiring to see
          others brought in. Said that renowned preacher, Whitefield, "As soon
          as I was converted, I wanted to be the means of the conversion of all
          that I had ever known. There were a number of young men that I had
          played cards with, that I had sinned with, and transgressed with: the
          first thing I did was, to go to their houses to see what I could do
          for their salvation, nor could I rest until I had the pleasure of
          seeing many of them brought to the Saviour." This is a first-fruit of
          the Spirit. It is a kind of instinct in a young Christian. He must
          have other people feel what he feels. Says one young man, in writing
          to me this week, "I have been praying for my fellow-clerk in the
          office; I have desired that he might be brought to the Saviour, but at
          present there is no answer to my prayers." Do not give a penny for
          that man's piety which will not spread itself. Unless we desire others
          to taste the benefits we have enjoyed, we are either inhuman monsters
          or outrageous hypocrites; I think the last is most likely. But this
          woman was so strong in faith that all her family were saved from
          destruction. Young woman! you have a father, and he hates the Saviour.
          O! pray for him. Mother! you have a son: he scoffs at Christ. Cry out
          to God for him. Ay, my friends -- young people like myself -- we
          little know what we owe to the prayers of our parents. I feel that I
          shall never be able sufficiently to bless God for a praying mother. I
          thought it was a great nuisance to be had in at such a time to pray,
          and more especially to be made to cry, as my mother used to make me
          cry. I would have laughed at the idea of any body else talking to me
          about these things; but when she prayed, and said, "Lord, save my son
          Charles," and then was overcome, and could not get any further for
          crying, you could not help crying too; you could not help feeling; it
          was of no use trying to stand against it. Ah! and there you are young
          man! Your mother is dying, and one thing which makes her death-bed
          bitter is, that you scoff God and hate Christ. O! it is the last stage
          of impiety, when a man can think lightly of a mother's feelings. I
          would hope there are none such here, but that those of you who have
          been so blessed, as to have been begotten and brought forth by pious
          men and women may take this into consideration -- that to perish with
          a mother's prayers is to perish fearfully; for if a mother's prayers
          do not bring us to Christ, they are like drops of oil dropped into the
          flames of hell that will make them burn more fiercely upon the soul
          for ever and ever. Take heed of rushing to perdition over your
          mother's prayers!
        </p>
        <p>
          There is an old woman weeping -- do you know why? I believe she has
          sons too, and she loves them. I met with a little incident in company,
          the other day, after preaching. There was a little boy at the corner
          of the table, and his father asked him, "Why does your father love
          you, John?" Said the dear little lad, very prettily, "Because I'm a
          good boy." "Yes." said the father, "he would not love you if you were
          not a good boy." I turned to the good father and remarked that I was
          not quite sure about the truth of the last remark, for I believed he
          would love him if he were ever so bad. "Well," he said, "I think I
          should." And said a minister at the table, "I had an instance of that
          yesterday. I stepped into the house of a woman who had a son
          transported for life, and she was as full of her son Richard as if be
          had been prime minister, or had been her most faithful and dutiful
          son." Well, young man, will you kick against love like that -- love
          that will bear your kicks, and will not turn round against you, but
          love you straight on still? But perhaps that woman -- I saw her weep
          just now -- had a mother, who has gone long ago, and she was married
          to a brutal husband, and at last left a poor widow; she calls to mind
          the days of her childhood, when the big Bible was brought out and read
          around the hearth, and "Our Father which art in heaven" was their
          nightly prayer. Now, perhaps, God is beginning some good thing in her
          heart. O! that he would bring her now, though seventy years of age, to
          love the Saviour! Then would she have the beginning of life over again
          in her last days, which will be made her best days.

          VI. One more head, and then we have done. Rahab's faith was a
          SANCTIFYING FAITH. Did Rahab continue a harlot after she had faith?
          No, no, she did not. I do not believe she was a harlot at the time the
          men went to her house, though the name still stuck to her, as such ill
          names will; but I am sure she was not afterward, for Salmon the prince
          of Judah married her, and her name is put down among the ancestors of
          our Lord Jesus Christ. She became after that a woman eminent for piety
          walking in the fear of God. Now, you may have a dead faith which will
          ruin your soul. The faith that will save you is a faith which
          sanctifies. "Ah!" says the drunkard, "I like the gospel, sir; I
          believe in Christ;" then he will go over to the Blue Lion to-night,
          and get drunk. Sir, that is not the believing in Christ that is of any
          use. "Yes," says another, "I believe in Christ;" and when he gets
          outside he will begin to talk lightly, frothy words, perhaps
          lascivious ones, and sin as before. Sir, you speak falsely; you do not
          believe in Christ. That faith which saves the soul is a real faith,
          and a real faith sanctifies men. It makes them say, "Lord, thou hast
          forgiven me my sins; I will sin no more. Thou bast been so merciful to
          me, I will renounce my guilt; so kindly hast thou treated me, so
          lovingly hast thou embraced me, Lord, I will serve thee till I die;
          and if thou wilt give me grace, and help me so to be, I will be as
          holy as thou art." You can not have faith, and yet live in sin. To
          believe is to be holy. The two things must go together. That faith is
          a dead faith, a corrupt faith, which lives in sin that grace may
          abound. Rahab was a sanctified woman. O that God might sanctify some
          that are here! The world has been trying all manner of processes to
          reform men: there is but one thing that ever will reform them, and
          that is, faith in the preached gospel. But in this age preaching is
          much despised. You read the newspaper you read the book; you hear the
          lecturer; you sit and listen to the pretty essayist; but where is the
          preacher? Preaching is not taking out a manuscript sermon, asking God
          to direct your heart, and then reading pages prepared beforehand. That
          is reading -- not preaching. There is a good tale told of an old man
          whose minister used to read. The minister called to see him, and said,
          "What are you doing John?" "Why, I'm prophesying, sir." "Prophesying;
          how is that? You mean you are reading the prophecies?" "No, I don't;
          I'm prophesying; for you read preaching, and call it preaching, and I
          read prophecies, and, on the same rule, that is prophesying." And the
          man was not far from right. We want to have more outspoken, downright
          utterances of truth and appeals to the conscience, and until we get
          these, we shall never see any very great and lasting reforms. But by
          the preaching of God's word, foolishness though it seem to some,
          harlots are reformed, thieves are made honest, and the worst of men
          brought to the Saviour. Again let me affectionately give the
          invitation to the vilest of men, if so they feel themselves to be,
        </p>
        <p>"Come, ye needy, come and welcome,</p>
        <p>God's fine bounty glorify:</p>
        <p>True belief and true repentance --</p>
        <p>Every grace that brings us nigh --</p>
        <p>Without money,</p>
        <p>Come to Jesus Christ and buy."</p>
        <p>
          Your sins will be forgiven, your transgressions cast away, and you
          shall henceforth go and sin no more, God having renewed you, and he
          will keep you even to the end. May God give his blessing, for Jesus
          sake! Amen.<br />
