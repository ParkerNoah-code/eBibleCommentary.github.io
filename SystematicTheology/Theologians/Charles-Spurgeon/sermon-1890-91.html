          V. This is He who took a bodily form in the Virgin, and was hanged
          upon the tree, and was buried within the earth, and suffered not
          dissolution; He who rose from the place of the dead, and raised up men
          from the earth -- from the grave below to the height of heaven. This
          is the Lamb that was slain; this is the Lamb that opened not His
          mouth. This is He who was born of Mary, fair sheep of the fold. This
          is He that was taken from the flock, and was led to the slaughter, and
          was slain in the evening, and was buried at night; He who had no bone
          of Him broken on the tree; He who suffered not dissolution within the
          earth; He who rose from the place of the dead, and raised up the race
          of Adam from the grave below, This is He who was put to death. And
          where was He put to death? In the midst of Jerusalem. By whom? By
          Israel: because He cured their lame, and cleansed their lepers, and
          gave light to their blind, and raised their dead! This was the cause
          of His death. Thou, O Israel, wast giving commands, and He was being
          crucified; thou wast rejoicing, and He was being buried; thou wast
          reclining on a soft couch, and He was watching in the grave and the
          shroud. O Israel, transgressor of the law, why hast thou committed
          this new iniquity, subjecting the Lord to new sufferings -- thine own
          Lord, Him who fashioned thee, Him who made thee, Him who honoured
          thee, who called thee Israel? But thou hast not been found to be
          Israel: for thou hast not seen God, nor understood the Lord. Thou hast
          not known, O Israel, that this was the first-born of God, who was
          begotten before the sun, who made the light to shine forth, who
          lighted up the day, who separated the darkness, who fixed the first
          foundations, who poised the earth, who collected the ocean, who
          stretched out the firmament, who adorned the world. Bitter were thy
          nails, and sharp; bitter thy tongue, which thou didst whet; bitter was
          Judas, to whom thou gavest hire; bitter thy false witnesses, whom thou
          stirredst up; bitter thy gall, which thou preparedst; bitter thy
          vinegar, which thou madest; bitter thy hands, filled with blood. Thou
          slewest thy Lord, and He was lifted up upon the tree; and an
          inscription was fixed above, to show who He was that was slain. And
          who was this? (that which we shall not say is too shocking to hear,
          and that which we shall say is very dreadful: nevertheless hearken,
          and tremble.) It was He because of whom the earth quaked. He that hung
          up the earth in space was Himself hanged up; He that fixed the heavens
          was fixed with nails; He that bore up the earth was borne up on a
          tree; the Lord of all was subjected to ignominy in a naked body -- God
          put to death! the King of Israel slain with Israel's right hand! Alas
          for the new wickedness of the new murder! The Lord was exposed with
          naked body: He was not deemed worthy even of covering; and, in order
          that He might not be seen, the luminaries turned away, and the day
          became darkened because they slew God, who hung naked on the tree. It
          was not the body of our Lord that the luminaries covered with darkness
          when they set, but the eyes of men. For, because the people quaked
          not, the earth quaked; because they were not affrighted, the earth was
          affrighted. Thou smotest thy Lord: thou also hast been smitten upon
          the earth. And thou indeed liest dead; but He is risen from the place
          of the dead, and ascended to the height of heaven, having suffered for
          the sake of those who suffer, and having been bound for the sake of
          Adam's race which was imprisoned, and having been judged for the sake
          of him who was condemned, and having been buried for the sake of him
          who was buried. This is He who took a bodily form in the Virgin, and
          was hanged upon the tree, and was buried within the earth, and
          suffered not dissolution; He who rose from the place of the dead, and
          raised up men from the earth -- from the grave below to the height of
          heaven. This is the Lamb that was slain; this is the Lamb that opened
          not His mouth. This is He who was born of Mary, fair sheep of the
          fold. This is He that was taken from the flock, and was led to the
          slaughter, and was slain in the evening, and was buried at night; He
          who had no bone of Him broken on the tree; He who suffered not
          dissolution within the earth; He who rose from the place of the dead,
          and raised up the race of Adam from the grave below, This is He who
          was put to death. And where was He put to death? In the midst of
          Jerusalem. By whom? By Israel: because He cured their lame, and
          cleansed their lepers, and gave light to their blind, and raised their
          dead! This was the cause of His death. Thou, O Israel, wast giving
          commands, and He was being crucified; thou wast rejoicing, and He was
          being buried; thou wast reclining on a soft couch, and He was watching
          in the grave and the shroud. O Israel, transgressor of the law, why
          hast thou committed this new iniquity, subjecting the Lord to new
          sufferings -- thine own Lord, Him who fashioned thee, Him who made
          thee, Him who honoured thee, who called thee Israel? But thou hast not
          been found to be Israel: for thou hast not seen God, nor understood
          the Lord. Thou hast not known, O Israel, that this was the first-born
          of God, who was begotten before the sun, who made the light to shine
          forth, who lighted up the day, who separated the darkness, who fixed
          the first foundations, who poised the earth, who collected the ocean,
          who stretched out the firmament, who adorned the world. Bitter were
          thy nails, and sharp; bitter thy tongue, which thou didst whet; bitter
          was Judas, to whom thou gavest hire; bitter thy false witnesses, whom
          thou stirredst up; bitter thy gall, which thou preparedst; bitter thy
          vinegar, which thou madest; bitter thy hands, filled with blood. Thou
          slewest thy Lord, and He was lifted up upon the tree; and an
          inscription was fixed above, to show who He was that was slain. And
          who was this? (that which we shall not say is too shocking to hear,

          put to death! the King of Israel slain with Israel's right hand! Alas

          And further on: -- This is He who made the heaven and the earth, and
          in the beginning, together with the Father, fashioned man; who was
          announced by means of the law and the prophets; who put on a bodily
          form in the Virgin; who was hanged upon the tree; who was buried in
          the earth; who rose from the place of the dead, and ascended to the
          height of heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the Father.
