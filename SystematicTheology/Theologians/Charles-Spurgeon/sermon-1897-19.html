          ALEXANDRIA became the home of Christian Philosophy, but Athens was its
          birthplace. Pantaenus and Ammonius-Saccus were chief founders of the
          Alexandrine School. They were both Christian. They both drew their
          teaching from the Word of God, " the Fountain of Wisdom," and from the
          writings of Hierotheus, and Dionysius the Areopagite -- Bishops of
          Athens. For several centuries there had been a Greek preparation for
          the Alexandrine School. As the Old Testament was a Schoolmaster,
          leading to Christ, so the Septuagint, Pythagoras, Plato, Aristobulus,
          Philo, and Apollos were heralds who prepared the minds of men for that
          fulness of light and truth in Jesus Christ, which, in Alexandria,
          clothed itself in the bright robes of Divine Philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pantaenus was born in Athens, a.d.120, and died in Alexandria,
          a.d.213. He was Greek by nationality, and Presbyter of the Church in,
          Alexandria by vocation. First, Stoic, then Pythagorean, he became
          Christian some time before a.d.186, at which date he was appointed
          chief instructor in the Didaskeleion, by Demetrius, Bishop of
          Alexandria. Pantaenus recognised the preparation for the Christian
          Faith in the Greek Philosophy. Anastasius-Sinaita describes him as
          "one of the early expositors who agreed with each other in treating
          the first six days of Creation as prophetic of Christ and the whole
          Church."
        </p>
        <p>
          Eusebius says, that "Pantaenus expounded the treasures of the Divine
          dogmas preserved direct, as from father to son, from St. Paul and
          other Apostles. Phptius records that Pantaenus was pupil of those who
          had seen the Apostles, but that he certainly had not listened to any
          of them themselves. Now, if Pantaenus was pupil of those who had seen
          the Apostles, and yet had, not listened to their oral teaching, it is
          natural to infer that he was pupil through their writings. I am a
          pupil of Dr. Pusey, but I never listened to his oral teaching; I am
          pupil through his writings. Now, there exist, to this day, the
          writings of two Presbyters who had seen the Apostles -- both, converts
          to the faith through St. Paul, -- -whose writings contain the
          treasures of the Divine dogmas, received from St. Paul and the other
          Apostles. Those two Presbyters are Hierotheus and Dionysius the
          Areopagite, both ordained Bishop of Athens by St. Paul. Dionysius the
          Areopagite expressly calls, St. Paul his "chief initiator," and as
          such, gives his teaching on the holy Angels, in the sixth chapter of
          the Heavenly Hierarchy; and frequently describes St. Paul as his
          "chief instructor."
        </p>
        <p>
          If, then, we can prove that the writings of Dionysius existed before
          and were known in Alexandria, when Pantaenus delivered his lectures in
          that city, we may fairly infer that Pantaenus would know, and knowing,
          would use, the writings penned by the Chief of his own Areopagus, and
          Bishop of his own Athens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Historical criticism does not permit us to reject probabilities,
          merely because they confirm the Christian Faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dexter, in his Chronicle, collected from the Archives of Toledo and
          other churches in Spain, gives this testimony: --
        </p>
        <p>
          "U.C.851 (a.d.98). Dionysius Areopagita dicat Eugenio Marcello, dicto,
          propter ingenii excellentiam, Timotheo, libros de Divinis Nominibus."
        </p>
        <p>
          Dionysius of Alexandria, writing to Tope Sixtus II., c.250, respecting
          the writings of Dionysius the Areopagite, affirms "that no one can
          intelligently dispute their paternity -- that no one penetrated more
          profoundly than Dionysius into the mysterious depths of Holy Scripture
          -- that Dionysius was disciple of St. Paul, and piously governed the
          Church of Athens." If, then, the Bishops of Alexandria and Rome
          exchanged letters only a few years after the death of Pantaenus, and
          only seven years after the death of Ammonius, and in those letters
          affirmed the writings to be undoubtedly written by Dionysius the
          Areopagite, it would be the height of absurdity to affirm that such
          writings were unknown to Pantaenus and Ammonius.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we do not need to base our proof on mere supposition. Routh gives
          two fragments of Pantaenus. The second is a distinct echo of
          Dionysius. In Divine Names (c.7), Dionysius discusses how Almighty God
          knows existing things, and explains the text; "He, knowing all things
          before their birth" as proving that "not as learning existing things
          from existing things, but from Himself, and in Himself, as Cause, the
          Divine Being pre-holds and pre-comprehends the notions and essence of
          all things, not approaching each several thing according to its kind,
          but knowing and containing all things within one grasp of the cause.
          Thus Almighty God knows existing things, not by a knowledge of
          existing things, but by that of Himself." Dionysius, c. V. s.8,
          speaking of creation, declares that the Divine and good volitions of
          Almighty God define and produce existing things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pantaenus teaches the same: "Neither does He know things sensible
          sensibly (aisthetos), nor things intelligible intellectually. For it
          is not possible that He, Who is above all things, should comprehend
          things being, after things being (kata ta onta), but we affirm that He
          knows things being" as His own volitions . . . yea, as His own
          volitions, Almighty God knows things being, since by willing (thelon),
          He made all things being."
        </p>
        <p>
          In Mystic Theology, c. V., Dionysius says, "Almighty God does not know
          existing things, qua existing." The teaching of Ammonius-Saccus is the
          same; Ammonius uses the word boulema, Dionysius and Pantaenus,
          thelemata, of God, as Source of Creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, though the known fragments of Pantaenus are few, we possess
          abundant writings of two pupils, Clement of Alexandria and Origen,
          from which we may gather the teaching of their master. Clement speaks
          of Pantaenus as his "great instructor and collaborator." Such is the
          similarity between the writings of Clement and Dionysius, that some
          have hazarded the conjecture that Clement the Philosopher, mentioned
          by Dionysius, was Clement of Alexandria! I give only one familiar
          illustration. Clement writes: "As then, those riding at anchor at sea,
          drag the anchor, but do not drag it to themselves, but themselves to
          the anchor, thus those who are drawn to God in the gnostic life, find
          themselves unconsciously led to God." Dionysius, D. N., c. III. s.1,
          says, "or, as if after we have embarked on ship, and are holding on to
          the cable, attached to some rock, we do not draw the rock to us, but
          ourselves, and the ship, to the rock. Wherefore, before everything,
          and especially theology, we must begin with prayer; not as though we
          ourselves were drawing the power, which is everywhere, and nowhere
          present, but as, by our godly reminiscences and invocations,
          conducting ourselves to, and making ourselves one with It."
        </p>
        <p>
          Origen confessed that Pantaenus was his superior in the philosophy of
          the schools, and that he moulded his teaching upon the model of
          Pantaenus. Do the writings of Origen bear the stamp of Dionysius and
          Hierotheus? Origen, on the resurrection of the body, says, "For how
          does it not seem absurd that this body which has endured scars for
          Christ, and, equally with the soul, has borne the savage torments of
          persecutions, and has also endured the suffering of chains, and rods,
          and has been tortured with fire, beaten with the sword, and has
          further suffered the cruel teeth of wild beasts, the gallows of the
          cross, and divers kinds of punishments, -- that this should be
          deprived of the prizes of such contests. If forsooth, the soul alone,
          which not alone contended, should receive the crown, and its companion
          the body, which served it with much labour, should attain no
          recompense, for its agony and victory, -- how does it not seem
          contrary to all reason, that the flesh, resisting for Christ its
          natural vices, and its innate lust, and guarding its virginity with
          immense labour, -- that one, when the time for rewards has come,
          should be rejected as unworthy and the other should receive its crown?
          Such a fact would undoubtedly argue on the part of God, either a lack
          of justice or a lack of power." Dionysius (E. H., c. VII.) says, "Now
          the pure bodies of the holy souls, enrolled together as yoke-fellows,
          and fellow travellers, which together strove during the divine
          contests, throughout the Divine Life, in the unmoved steadfastness of
          the souls, will together receive their own resurrection. For, having
          been made one with the holy souls, to which they were united during
          this present life, by having become members of Christ, they will
          receive in return the godlike and incorruptible immortality and
          blessed inheritance." Dionysius (D. N., c. VI. s.2) says, "what is
          still more divine, It promises to "transfer our whole selves (I mean
          souls and bodies, their yoke-fellows), to a perfect life and
          immortality. Others again do this injustice to bodies, that, after
          having toiled with the holy souls, they unjustly deprive them of the
          holy retributions, when they have come to the goal of their most
          divine course." "For if the man have passed a life dear to God in soul
          and body, the body which has contended throughout the Divine struggles
          will be honoured together with the devout soul."
        </p>
        <p>
          To shew that Origen knew the works of Hierotheus, we give an extract
          from his letter to Gregory: "Would that you might both participate in
          and continually augment this part, so that you may not only say, we
          are partakers of Christ,' but also partakers of God." Papias , Bishop
          of Hierapolis (fragment V.) says, "the Presbyters, the disciples of
          the Apostles, say that this is the gradation and method of those who
          are saved, and that they advance through steps of this nature, and
          that, moreover, they ascend through the Spirit to the Son, and through
          the Son to the Father; and that, in due time, the Son will yield up
          His work to the Father." Who the Presbyters, the disciples of the
          Apostles were, we may gather from the three last chapters of the "Book
          of Hierotheus ," in which the very same doctrine is taught. Is it not,
          then, a legitimate inference, that when Photius says " that Pantaenus
          was a pupil of the Presbyters who had seen the Apostles," he
          designated Hierotheus and Dionysius the Areopagite, generally known
          under that title?
        </p>
        <p>
          Ammonius Saccus was born of Christian parents in Alexandria, and died
          in that city, a.d.242.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anastasius Sinaita calls him "the Wise," and Hierocles, "the taught of
          God." Besides being famous for his expositions of Holy Scripture, he
          wrote the "Diatesseron," or "Harmony of the Gospels," contained in the
          Bib. Patrum. In a.d.236, he wrote the agreement between Moses and
          Jesus. He was the great conciliator, who sought the good in every
          system, and to make all one in Christ. Pressensé beautifully describes
          him as a man who wished to believe and to know -- to adore and to
          comprehend -- to conciliate the Greek Philosophy with the Mysteries of
          the East. He wrote a commentary on the golden verses of Pythagoras,
          which Hierocles published, as well as reproduced his other works. The
          titles of his books, mentioned by Photius, such as "Providence" and
          "Free Will," recall those of the lost books of Dionysius, of which we
          have only a summary in his known works. (Cod.251-214.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Ammonius was surnamed Saccus from having been a corn carrier. Virgil,
          Shakespere, Milton, were great geniuses in themselves, but when we
          know the sources from which they drew, we can better understand their
          achievements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dionysius was indebted to Hierotheus -- Ammonius drew from Dionysius.
          This we shall shew, not as we might, by his works as described by
          Photius, but from Plotinus, his disciple, in order that we may have
          the prevailing proof, to some minds, of testimony not necessarily
          Christian.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plotinus was born in Lycopolis, a.d.205, and died in Campagna,
          a.d.270. At the age of 29, he began to search for truth, in the
          schools of Alexandria. He wandered from teacher to teacher, but could
          find no rest until he was persuaded to go and hear Ammonius-Saccus.
          After listening to him, he exclaimed, "This is what I sought."
        </p>
        <p>
          Plotinus remained under him eleven years, until the death of Ammonius,
          a.d.242. In a.d.244, Plotinus began to teach in Rome. Plotinus was not
          a refined scholar. Porphyry, therefore, committed his teaching to
          writing. Porphyry was regarded as the greatest enemy to the Christian
          Faith in the early centuries. Persecutors burned the bodies of
          Christians, but Porphyry sought to undermine their faith in the Holy
          Scriptures, by quibbles of unbelief, which have been revived to-day as
          "New Criticism." Porphyry wrote against the Holy Scriptures with a
          bitterness engendered by a conviction of their truth. Now, it is a
          startling fact, that though the teaching of Plotinus comes to us
          through Porphyry, there is not a word in the Enneades, in which the
          teaching of Plotinus is given, against the Christian Faith. It is true
          that Eutochius published another version of the teaching of Plotinus,
          on the ground that his teaching was coloured by Porphyry, but we
          prefer to rest our proof on Porphyry, as not being prejudiced in
          favour of the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us then first see what Plotinus teaches respecting the Holy
          Trinity. He says, "We need not go beyond the three Hypostaseis"
          (Persons). It is true that Plotinus presents that Trinity as "One,"
          "Mind," and "Soul," whereas Dionysius gives the formula "Father, Son,
          and Spirit." Occasionally Plotinus uses "Logos" instead of "Mind." But
          even this substitution of "One" for "Father" may be traced to
          Dionysius, who speaks of the Triad, enarchike and even enarchikon
          hupostaseon, "One springing." The "One" represents the Father.
          Plotinus says, "We may represent the first principle, One,' as source,
          which has no other origin than Itself, and which pours Itself in a
          multitude of streams without being diminished by what it gives."
          Dionysius speaks of the "Father" as sole source of Godhead, and says
          that "the Godhead is undiminished by the gifts imparted." In Chap.
          XII. of Divine Names, Dionysius treats of "One" and "Perfect" as
          applied to Almighty God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let Us now hear Plotinus on the "Beautiful" Enneades (I.6-7). Plotinus
          says, "The soul advances in its ascent towards God, until being raised
          above everything alien, it sees face to face, in His simplicity, and
          in all His purity, Him upon Whom all hangs, to Whom all aspire; from
          Whom all hold existence, life and thought. What transport of love must
          not he feel who sees Him! with what ardour ought he not to desire to
          be united to Him! He, who has not seen Him, desires Him as the Good;
          he who has seen Him, admires Him as the sovereign Beauty; and struck
          at once with astonishment and pleasure, disdains the things which
          heretofore he called by the name of Beauty. This is what happens to
          those to whom have appeared the forms of gods and demons; -- they no
          longer care For the beauty of other bodies. What think you, then,
          should he experience who has seen the Beautiful Himself, -- the
          Beautiful surpassing earth and heaven! The miserable is not he, Who
          has neither fresh colour nor comely form, nor power, nor royalty; it
          is alone he, Who sees himself excluded from the possession of Beauty
          -- a possession in comparison with which he ought to disdain royalty,
          rule of the whole earth, of the sea, and heaven itself, if he should
          be able, by abandoning, by despising all these, to rise to the
          contemplation of the Beautiful, face to face." Plotinus also
          recognised, "that the eye soiled with impurity could never bear the
          sight, or attain to the vision of that Beauty. We must render the
          organs of vision analogous and like to the object that they would
          contemplate. Every man ought to begin by rendering himself beautiful
          and divine to obtain a Vision of the Beautiful and the Deity." Well
          might St. Augustine say, that "with the change of a few words,
          Plotinus became concordant with Christ's religion." No wonder that
          Gregory and Basil quoted so largely from Plotinus. Let us now hear
          what Dionysius says of the "Good and Beautiful": -- "Goodness turns
          all things to Itself; all things aspire to It, as source and bond and
          end. From this Beautiful comes being to all existing things. All
          things aspire to the Beautiful and Good, -- and there is no existing
          thing which does not participate in the Beautiful and Good." Read the
          Fourth Chapter of the Divine Names.
        </p>
        <p>
          Porphyry records that Plotinus attained to that vision of the
          Beautiful three times during his life. How that vision of the
          Beautiful is to be attained, Dionysius describes in the "Mystic
          Theology:" -- "But thou, O dear Timothy, by thy persistent commerce
          with the mystic visions, leave behind both sensible perceptions and
          intellectual efforts, and all objects of sense and intelligence, and
          all things not being and being, and be raised aloft agnostically to
          the union, as attainable, with Him Who is above every essence and
          knowledge. For by unchecked and absolute extasy, in all purity, from
          thyself, and all, thou wilt be carried on high to the superessential
          Ray of the Divine Darkness, when thou hast cast away all and become
          free from all." Ammonius had such extasy during his lectures, in which
          he seemed to have Divine visions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plotinus differs from Dionysius in regarding creation as an act of
          necessity, whereas Dionysius regards it as an act of love. Plotinus
          treats evil as "an elongation from God." Dionysius speaks of Almighty
          God as immanent in matter the most elongated from spirit. Plotinus
          traces evil to matter; Dionysius to the fallacious choice of a free
          agent. May it not be that the pagan colouring of Porphyry in these
          respects led Eutochius to give a more faithful and consistent account
          of the teaching of Plotinus.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the crowning proof that Dionysius was the source from which the
          Alexandrine School drew much of its wisdom, is Proclus (450-485).
          Suidas affirmed long ago that Proclus cribbed whole passages from
          Dionysius. Professor Stiglmayr fills seven pages with parallel
          passages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vachérot describes certain chapters of the "Divine Names" as extracts
          from Proclus, word for word, and says the whole doctrine of Dionysius
          seems to be a commentary upon the Theology of Alexandria. Barthélémy
          St. Hilaire says that Dionysius and Scotus Erigena, almost entirely
          implanted, in the middle age, the doctrine of Neo-Platonism. Matter is
          more profound; Professor Langen finds in Dionysius the
          "characteristics of Neo-Platonic speculation." The similarity of
          doctrine is denied by none. Which writings appeared first? that is the
          question.

          Polycarp quotes Dionysius verbatim as "a certain one." Jerome quotes
          him as "quidam Graecorum." Dionysius of Alexandria (a.d.250), writing
          to Sixtus II., declares that no one can intelligently doubt that the
          writings are those of Dionysius, the convert of St. Paul, Bishop of
          Athens. Tertullian, expresses the Agnosia "nihil scire omnia scire,"
          Origen quotes him by name. Theodore (a.d.420) answers objections, --
          whom Photius approved. Gregory calls Dionysius "an ancient and
          venerable Father." The Second Council of Nicea quotes the very words,
          contained in the "Ecclesiastical Hierarchy," c. I. s.4, as those of
          the great Dionysius. Bishop Pearson proves that the best judges in the
          sixth, fifth, fourth and third centuries regarded the writings as
          written: by Dionysius the Areopagite. German scholars to-day admit
          that the external testimony is in favour of their genuineness.

          Yet eccentric critics, on account of the precise theology, cannot
          believe that the works were written; by a learned Greek, -- Chief of
          the Areopagus -- who forsook all to follow Christ, -- the convert and
          disciple of St.. Paul, -- the familiar friend of St. John and other
          Apostles, to whom our Saviour revealed the mysteries of the Father;
          but those critics can believe that an unknown man, whose century no
          one can fix, and possibly a Syrian, may have gleaned from writers of
          the first four centuries these theological pearls expressed in Greek
          in a style unique and always like itself. They can, believe that the
          Author of these Divine writings, would incorporate, fictitious
          allusions to persons and events of the apostolic, age, to add lustre
          to incomparable works, and to impute them to another. They can believe
          that writings, so composed, were foisted upon a credulous Christendom,
          so that Dionysius of Alexandria, Maximus, St. John Damascene, and the
          Council of Nicea, accepted them as the genuine works of Dipnysius. I
          do not belong to that school. Only unbelief could believe anything so
          incredible. Rational men will not hazard the surmise that works known
          in the first century were gleaned from writings composed four hundred
          years afterwards.

          The tone of the Alexandrine School may be further illustrated from
          Amelius and Dionysius the Sublime. Amelius attended Plotinus
          twenty-four years as companion and pupil. Eusebius gives an extract
          from his writings, in which Amelius says, "This plainly was the Word,
          by Whom, being Eternal, things becoming became, as Heraclitus would
          say." It was probably he who said, "the Prologue of St. John's Gospel
          ought to be written in gold, and placed in the most conspicuous place
          in every church." De Civ. Dei, LX. c.29. Dionysius, the famous
          secretary of Zenobia, attended the lectures of Ammonius-Saccus. He was
          the "arbiter" of all literary questions. He expresses his admiration,
          De sub. L.9, of the diction of Moses in the description of the six
          days' creation, and numbers St. Paul amongst the most brilliant Greek
          orators, as a man who propounded a "dogma beyond demonstration."

          We claim that the testimony of these illustrious men, and the extracts
          from Pantaenus, Ammonius, and their disciples, justify the conclusion
          that the Alexandrine School was Biblical, Christian, and
          Philosophical, that its Philosophy was a Divine Philosophy of the
          Faith, not a pagan philosophy against the Faith, and that the main
          sources of its Divine Philosophy were the writings of Hierotheus and
          Dionysius, Bishops of Athens.
