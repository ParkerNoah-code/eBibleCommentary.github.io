        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.3254)</p>
        <p>Published on Thursday, June 15th, 1911.</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>More than a half century ago.</p>
        <p>
          NOTE: This is taken from an early published edition of the original
          sermon. The version that appears in The Metropolitan Tabernacle
          Pulpit, vol.57, was edited and slightly abbreviated. For edition we
          have restored the fuller text of the earlier published edition, while
          retaining a few of the editorial refinements of the Met Tab edition.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse
          for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a
          tree." -- Galatians 3:13
        </p>
        <p>
          THE law of God is a divine law, holy, heavenly, perfect. Those who
          find fault with the law, or in the least degree depreciate it, do not
          understand its design, and have no right idea of the law itself. Paul
          says, "the law is holy, but I am carnal; sold under sin." In all we
          ever say concerning justification by faith, we never intend to lower
          the opinion which our hearers have of the law, for the law is one of
          the most sublime of God's works. There is not a commandment too many;
          there is not one too few; but it is so incomparable, that its
          perfection is a proof of its divinity. No human lawgiver could have
          given forth such a law as that which we find in the decalogue. It is a
          perfect law; for all human laws that are right are to be found in that
          brief compendium and epitome of all that is good and excellent toward
          God, or between man and man.
        </p>
        <p>
          But while the law is glorious, it is never more misapplied than when
          it is used as a means of salvation. God never intended men to be saved
          by the law. When he proclaimed it on Sinai, it was with thunder, fire,
          and smoke; as if he would say, "O man, hear my law; but thou shalt
          tremble while thou hearest it." Hear it! It is a law which hath the
          blast of a terrible trumpet, even like the day of destruction, of
          which it is but the herald, if thou offendest it, and findest none to
          bear the doom for thee. It was written on stone; as if to teach us
          that it was a hard, cold, stony law -- one which would have no mercy
          upon us, but which, if we break it, would fall upon us, and dash us
          into a thousand pieces. O ye who trust in the law for your salvation!
          ye have erred from the faith; ye do not understand God's designs; ye
          are ignorant of every one of God's truths. The law was given by Moses
          to make men feel themselves condemned, but never to save them; its
          very intention was to "conclude us all in unbelief, and to condemn us
          all, that he might have mercy upon all." It was intended by its
          thunders to crush every hope of self-righteousness, by its lightnings
          to scathe and demolish every tower of our own works, that we might be
          brought humbly and simply to accept a finished salvation through the
          one mighty Mediator who has "finished the law, and made it honorable,
          and brought in an everlasting righteousness," whereby we stand, stand
          complete before our Maker at last, if we be in Christ. All that the
          law doth, you will observe, is to curse; it can not bless. In all the
          pages of revelation you will find no blessings that the law ever gave
          to one that offended it. There were blessings, and those were
          comparatively small, which might be gained by those who kept it
          thoroughly; but no blessing is ever written for one offender.
          Blessings we find in the gospel; curses we find in the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          This afternoon we shall briefly consider, first, the curse of the law;
          secondly, the curse removed; thirdly, the great Substitute who removed
          it -- "He was made a curse for us." And then we shall come, in the
          last place, solemnly to ask each other, whether we are included in the
          mighty number for whom Christ did bear iniquities, and for whom "He
          was made a curse."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, THE CURSE OF THE LAW. All who sin against the law are
          cursed by the law; all who rebel against its commands are cursed --
          cursed instantly, cursed terribly.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. We shall regard that curse, first as being a universal curse,
          resting upon every one of the seed of Adam. Perhaps some here will be
          inclined to say, "Of course the law of God will curse all those who
          are loose in their lives, or profane in their conversation. We can all
          of us imagine that the swearer is a cursed man, cursed by God. We can
          suppose that the wrath of God rests upon the head of the man who is
          filthy in his life, and whose conversation is not upright, or who is a
          degraded man, under the ban of society." But ah! my friend, it is not
          quite so easy to get at the real truth, which is this, that the curse
          of God rests upon every one of us, as by nature we stand before him.
          Thou mayest be the most moral in the world, but yet the curse of God
          is upon thee; thou mayest be lovely in thy life, modest in thy
          carriage, upright in thy behavior, almost Christlike in thy conduct,
          yet, if thou hast not been born again, and regenerated by sovereign
          grace, the curse of God still rests upon thine head. If thou hast but
          committed one sin in thy life, God's justice is so inexorable, that it
          condemns a man for one solitary offense; and though thy life should
          henceforth be one continued career of holiness, if thou hast sinned
          but once, unless thou hast an interest in the blood of Christ, the
          thunders of Sinai are launched at thee, and the lightnings of terrible
          vengeance flash all around thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah! my hearers, how humbling is this doctrine to our pride, that the
          curse of God is on every man of the seed of Adam; that every child
          born in this world is born under the curse, since it is born under the
          law; and that the moment I sin, though I transgress but once, I am
          from that moment condemned already; for "cursed is every one that
          continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law
          to do them." -- cursed without a single hope of mercy, unless he find
          that mercy in the Substitute "who was made a curse for us." It is an
          awful thought, that the trail of the serpent is on the whole earth;
          that the poison is in the fountain of every heart; that the stream of
          the blood in all our veins is corrupt; that we are all condemned; that
          each one of us, without a single exception, whether he be
          philanthropist, senator, philosopher, divine, prince, or monarch, is
          under the curse unless he has been redeemed from it by Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The curse, too, we must remark, while universal, is also just. This
          is the great difficulty. There are many persons who think that the
          curse of God upon those who are undeniably wicked is, of course,
          right; but that the curse of God upon those who for the most part
          appear to be excellent, and who may have sinned but once, as an act of
          injustice. We answer, "Nay, when God pronounces the curse, he doth it
          justly; he is a God of justice; 'just and right is he.'" And mark
          thee, man, if thou art condemned, it shall be by the strictest
          justice; and if thou hast sinned but once, the curse is righteous when
          it lights upon thy head. Dost thou ask me how this is? I answer, Thou
          sayest thy sin is little; then, if the sin be little, how little
          trouble it might have taken thee to have avoided it! If thy
          transgression be but small, at how small an expense thou mightest have
          refrained from it! Some have said, "Surely the sin of Adam was but
          little; he did but take an apple." Ay, but in its littleness was its
          greatness. If it was a little thing to take the fruit, with how little
          trouble might it have been avoided! And because it was so small an
          act, there was couched within it the greater malignity of guilt. So,
          too, thou mayest never have blasphemed thy God, thou mayest never have
          desecrated his Sabbath; yet, insomuch as thou hast committed a little
          sin, thou art justly condemned, for a little sin hath in it the
          essence of all sin; and I know not but that what we call little sins
          may be greater in God's sight than those which the world universally
          condemns, and against which the hiss of the execration of humanity
          continually rises. I say, God is just, although from his lips should
          rush thunders to blast the entire universe; God is just, although he
          curses all. Tremble, man, and "kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye
          perish by the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are
          all they that put their trust in him."
        </p>
        <p>So the curse is universal, and it is just.</p>
        <p>
          3. But let us notice, next, the curse is also fearful. Some there be
          who think it little to be cursed of God; but O! it they knew the
          fearful consequences of that curse; they would think it terrible
          indeed. It were enough to make our knees knock together, to chill our
          blood, and start each individual hair of our head upon its end, if we
          did but know what it is to be under the curse of God. What does that
          curse include? It involves death, the death of this body; that is by
          no means an insignificant portion of its sentence. It includes
          spiritual death, a death of that inner life which Adam had -- the life
          of the spirit, which hath now fled, and can only be restored by that
          holy Spirit who "quickeneth whom he will." And it includes, last of
          all, and worst of all, that death eternal, a dwelling forever in the
          place
        </p>
        <p>"Where solemn groans, and hollow moans,</p>
        <p>And shrieks of tortured ghosts,"</p>
        <p>
          make up the only music. Death eternal includes all that can be
          gathered in that terrible, that awful -- we had almost said
          unutterable -- word "hell." This is a curse which rests on every man
          by nature. We make no exception of rank or degree; for God has made
          none. We offer no hope of exception of character or reputation; for
          God has made none. The whole of us are shut up to this, that (so far
          as the law is concerned) we must die -- die here and die in the next
          world, and die a death which never dies; feel a worm which shall gnaw
          forever, and a fire which never can be extinguished, even by a fold of
          tears of future penitence. There we must be forever, O! forever lost.
          Could we estimate that curse, I say again, the torments that tyrants
          could inflict we might well afford to ridicule, the injuries that this
          body can sustain we might well afford to despise, compared with that
          awful avalanch of threatening which rushes down with fearful force
          form the mountain of God's truth. Condemnation -- that curse of God --
          abideth on us all.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. We hasten from this point, beloved, for it is fearful work to speak
          upon it; but yet we must not depart from it entirely, till we have
          hinted at one thought more; and that is, that the curse of God which
          comes upon sinful men is a present curse. O! my dear hearers, could I
          lay hold of your hands, it ye be not converted, I would labor with
          tears and groans to get you to grasp this thought. It is not so much a
          condemnation in the future that you have to dread as a damnation now.
          Yes, sitting where thou art, my hearer, if thou art out of Christ,
          thou art condemned now; thy condemnation is sealed; thy death-warrant
          has been stamped by the great seal of the Majesty of heaven; the
          angel's sword of vengeance is already unsheathed, and over thy head
          this afternoon. Whosoever thou mayest be, it thou art out of Christ,
          there hangeth a sword over thee, a sword suspended by a hair, which
          death shall cut; and then that sword shall descend, dividing thy soul
          from thy body, and sending both of them to pains eternal. O! ye might
          start up from your seats with fear, if ye did but know this, some of
          you. Ye are reputable, ye are respectable, ye are honorable, perhaps
          right honorable, and yet condemned men, condemned women. On the walls
          of heaven ye are proscribed, written up there as deicides, who have
          slain the Saviour -- as rebels against God's government, who have
          committed high treason against him; and perhaps even now the
          dark-winged angel of death is spreading his pinions upon the blast,
          hastening to hurry you down to destruction. Say not, O sinner, that I
          would affright thee; say, rather, that I would bring thee to the
          Saviour; for whether thou hearest this or not, or believest it or not,
          thou canst not alter the truth thereof -- that thou art now, if thou
          hast not given thyself to Christ, "condemned already;" and wherever
          thou sittest, thou art but still in thy condemned cell; for this whole
          earth is but one huge prison-house, wherein the condemned one doth
          drag along a chain of condemnation, till death takes him to the
          scaffold, where the fearful execution of terrific woe must take place
          upon him. Now condemned and forever condemned; hear that word. "The
          curse of the law!"
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But now I must speak, in the second place, of THE REMOVAL OF THAT
          CURSE. This is a sweet and pleasant duty. Some of you, my dear
          friends, will be able to follow me in your experience, while I just
          remind you how it was, that in your salvation Christ removed the
          curse.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, you will agree with me when I say that the removal of the
          curse from us is done in a moment. It is an instantaneous thing. I may
          stand here one moment under the curse; and if the Spirit look upon me,
          and I breathe a prayer to heaven -- if by faith I cast myself on Jesus
          -- in one solitary second, ere the clock hath ticked, my sins may be
          all forgiven. Hart sung truly, when he said --
        </p>
        <p>"The moment a sinner believes,</p>
        <p>And trusts in his crucified God,</p>
        <p>His pardon at once he receives,</p>
        <p>Salvation if full, through his blood."</p>
        <p>
          You will remember in Christ's life, that most of the curses he wrought
          -- yea, I believe all -- were instantaneous cures. See! there lies a
          man stretched on his couch, from which he hath not risen for years.
          "Take up thy bed, and walk," said Christ in majesty. The man takes up
          that bed, and without the intervention of weeks of convalescence at
          once carries it, leaping like a hart. There is another. From his
          closed lips a sound hath scarcely ever escaped; he is dumb; Christ
          toucheth his lips; "Ephphatha, be opened;" and he sings at once. He
          does not barely speak, but he speaks plain; the tongue of the dumb
          sings. Ay, and even in the cases where Christ healed death itself, he
          did it instantaneously. When that beautiful creature lay asleep in
          death upon the bed, Jesus went to her; and though her dark ringlets
          covered up her eyes, which were now glazed in death, Jesus did but
          take her clay-cold hand in his, and say, "Talitha cumi! damsel, I say
          unto thee, Arise;" and no sooner had he said it, than she sat up, and
          opened her eyes; and to show that she was not merely half alive, or
          half restored, she rose up, and ministered to him. We do not say that
          the great work of conversion is instantaneous; that may take some
          time; for Christ commences in the heart a work, which is to be carried
          on through life in sanctification; but the justification, the taking
          away the curse, is done in a single moment. "Unwrite the curse," says
          God. It is done. The acquittal is signed and sealed; it taketh not
          long.
        </p>
        <p>"Fully discharged by Christ I am,</p>
        <p>From sin's tremendous curse and blame."</p>
        <p>
          I may stand here at this moment, and I may have believed in Christ but
          five minutes ago; still, if I have believed in Christ but that short
          space of time, I am as justified, in God's sight, as I would be should
          I live until these hairs are whitened by the sunlight of heaven, or as
          I shall be when I walk among the golden lamps of the city of palaces.
          God justifieth his people at once; the curse is removed in a single
          moment. Sinner, hear that! Thou mayest now be under condemnation; but
          ere thou canst say "now" again, thou mayest be able to say -- "There
          is, therefore, now no condemnation to me, for I am in Christ Jesus."
          We may be fully absolved in a moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Mark, beloved, in the next place, that this removal of the curse
          from us, when it does take place, is an entire removal. It is not a
          part of the curse which is taken away. Christ doth not stand at the
          foot of Sinai, and say, "Thunders! diminish your force;" he doth not
          catch here and there a lightning, and bind its wings; nay, but when he
          cometh he bloweth away all the smoke, he putteth aside all the
          thunder, he quencheth all the lightning; he removeth it all. When
          Christ pardoneth, he pardoneth all sin; the sins of twice ten thousand
          years he pardons in an hour. Thou mayest be old and gray-headed, and
          hitherto unpardoned; but though thy sins exceed in number the stars
          spread in the sky, one moment takes them all away. Mark that "all!"
          That sin of midnight; that black sin which, like a ghost, has haunted
          thee all thy life; that hideous crime; that unknown act of blackness
          which hath darkened thy character; that awful stain upon thy
          conscience -- they shall be all taken away. And though thou hast a
          stain upon that hand -- a stain which thou hast often sought to wash
          out by all the mixtures that Moses can give thee -- thou shalt find,
          when thou art bathed in Jesus' blood, that thou shalt be able to say,
          "All clean, my Lord, all clean; not a spot now; all is gone; I am
          completely washed from head to foot; the stains are all removed." It
          is the glory of this removal of the curse that it is all taken away;
          there is not a single atom left. Hushed now is the law's loud thunder;
          the sentence is entirely reversed, and there is no fear left.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. We must say again upon this point, that when Christ removes the
          curse, it is an irreversible removal. Once let me be acquitted, who is
          he that condemns me? There be some in these modern times who teach
          that God justifieth, and yet, after that, condemns the same person
          whom he has justified. We have heard it asserted pretty boldly, that a
          man may be a child of God to-day -- hear it, ye heavens, and be
          astonished -- and be a child of the devil to-morrow; we have heard it
          said, but we know it is untrue, for we find nothing in Scripture to
          warrant it. We have often asked ourselves, Can men really believe
          that, after having been "begotten again to a lively hope," that birth
          in God, through Christ, and by his Spirit, can yet fail? We have asked
          ourselves, Can men imagine that, after God hath once broken our
          chains, and set us free, he will call us back, and bind us once again,
          like Prometheus, to the great rocks of despair? Will he once blot out
          the handwriting that is against us, and then record the charge again?
          Once pardoned, then condemned? We trow, that had Paul been in the way
          of such men, he would have said, "Who is he that condemneth? It is
          Christ that died; yea, rather, that is risen again. Who shall lay
          anything to the charge of God's elect?" There is no condemnation to
          us, being in Christ Jesus; we "walk not after the flesh, but after the
          Spirit." It is a sweet thought, that Satan himself can never rob me of
          my pardon. I may lose my copy of it, and lose my comfort; but the
          original pardon is filed in heaven. It may be that gloomy doubts may
          arise, and I may fear to think myself forgiven: but
        </p>
        <p>"Did Jesus upon me shine?</p>
        <p>Then Jesus is for ever mine."</p>
        <p>"O! my distrustful heart!</p>
        <p>How small thy faith appears.</p>
        <p>Far greater, Lord, thou art,</p>
        <p>Than all my doubts and fears.</p>
        <p>'Midst all my sin, and fear, and woe,</p>
        <p>Thy Spirit will not let me go."</p>
        <p>
          I love, at times, to go back to the hour when I hope I was forgiven
          through a Saviour's blood. There is much comfort in it to remember
          that blessed hour when first we knew the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>"Dost mind the place, the spot of ground,</p>
        <p>Where Jesus did thee meet?"</p>
        <p>
          Perhaps thou dost; perhaps thou canst look back to the very place
          where Jesus whispered thou wast his. Canst thou do so? O! how much
          comfort it will give thee! for, remember, once acquitted, acquitted
          forever. So saith God's word. Once pardoned, thou art clear; once set
          at liberty, thou shalt never be a slave again; once hath Sinai been
          appeased, it shall never roar twice. Blessed be God's name! we are
          brought to Calvary, and we shall be brought to Zion too. At last shall
          we stand before God; and even there we shall be able to say --
        </p>
        <p>"Great God! I am clean;</p>
        <p>Through Jesus' blood I'm clean."</p>
        <p>
          III. And now we are brought, in the third place, to observe THE GREAT
          SUBSTITUTE by whom the curse is removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The curse of God is not easily taken away; in fact, there was but one
          method whereby it could be removed. The lightnings were in God's hand;
          they must be launched; he said they must. The sword was unsheathed; it
          must be satisfied; God vowed it must. How, then, was the sinner to be
          saved? The only answer was this. The Son of God appears; and he says,
          "Father! launch thy thunderbolts at me; here is my breast -- plunge
          that sword in here; here are my shoulders -- let the lash of vengeance
          fall on them;" and Christ, the Substitute, came forth and stood for
          us, "the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God." It is
          our delight to preach the doctrine of substitution, because we are
          fully persuaded that no gospel is preached where substitution is
          omitted. Unless men are told positively and plainly that Christ did
          stand in their room and stead, to bear their guilt and carry their
          sorrows, they never can see how God is to be "just, and yet the
          justifier of the ungodly."
        </p>
        <p>
          We have heard some preach a gospel, something after this order -- that
          though God is angry with men, yet out of his great mercy, for the sake
          of something that Christ has done, he does not punish them, but remits
          the penalty. Now, we hold, that this is not of God's gospel; for it is
          neither just to God, nor safe to man. We believe that God never
          remitted the penalty, that he did not forgive the sin without
          punishing it, but that there was blood for blood, and stroke for
          stroke, and death for death, and punishment for punishment, without
          the abatement of a solitary jot or tittle; that Jesus Christ, the
          Saviour, did drink the veritable cup of our redemption to its very
          dregs; that he did suffer beneath the awful crushing wheels of divine
          vengeance, the self-same pains and sufferings which we ought to have
          endured. O! the glorious doctrine of substitution! When it is preached
          fully and rightly, what a charm and what power it hath. O! how sweet
          to tell sinners, that though God hath said, "Thou must die," their
          Maker stoops his head to die for them and Christ incarnate breathes
          his last upon a tree, that God might execute his vengeance, and yet
          might pardon all believers in Jesus because he has met all the claims
          of divine justice on their account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should there be one here who does not understand substitution, let me
          repeat what I have said. Sinner, the only way thou canst be saved is
          this. God must punish sin; if he did not, he would undeify himself;
          but if he has punished sin in the person of Christ for thee, thou art
          fully absolved, thou art quite clear; Christ hath suffered what thou
          oughtest to have suffered, and thou mayest rejoice in that. "Well,"
          sayest thou, "I ought to have died." Christ hath died! "I ought to
          have been sent to hell." Christ did not go there to endure that
          torment forever; but he suffered an equivalent for it, something which
          satisfied God. The whole of hell was distilled into his cup of
          sorrows; he drank it. The cup which his father gave him, he drank to
          its dregs.
        </p>
        <p>"At one tremendous draught of love,</p>
        <p>He drank destruction dry."</p>
        <p>
          for all who believe in him. All the punishment, all the curse, on him
          was laid. Vengeance now was satisfied; all was gone, and gone for
          ever; but not gone without having been taken away by the Saviour. The
          thunders have not been reserved, they have been launched at him, and
          vengeance is satisfied, because Christ has endured the full penalty of
          all his people's guilt.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Now we come to answer that last question: HOW MANY AMONG US CAN
          SAY, THAT "CHRIST HATH REDEEMED US FROM THE CURSE OF THE LAW, HAVING
          BEEN MADE A CURSE FOR US?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The first part of our discourse has been entirely doctrinal; some of
          you have not cared for it, because you did not feel you were
          interested in it. It was natural it should be so. At the reading of a
          will, doth the servant stay to listen? Nay, there is nothing for her;
          but if a man be a son, how doth he open his ear to catch the sound, to
          know if there be an estate for him; and however ill the lawyer may
          read that will, how anxious he is to catch every word, and know if
          there is a portion for him among the children! Now, beloved, let us
          read the will again, to see if you belong to those for whom Christ
          made a satisfaction. The usual way with most of our congregation is
          this -- they write themselves down for Christ's long before God has
          done it. You make a profession of religion, you wear a Christian's
          cloak, you behave like a Christian, you take a seat in a Christian
          church or chapel, and you think you are christianized at once; whereas
          one half of our congregations who fancy themselves to be Christians
          have made a great mistake; never were they more apart from any
          character than from being true Christians. Let me beg you not to
          suppose yourselves to be believers, because your parents were so, or
          because you belong to an orthodox church. Religion is a thing which we
          must have for ourselves; and it is a question which we all ought to
          ask, whether we are all interested in the atonement of Christ, and
          have a portion in the merits of his agonies?
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, then, I will put a question to thee. First, let me ask thee
          this, my friend -- Wast thou ever condemned by the law in thine own
          conscience? "Nay, sayest thou, "I know not what thou meanest." Of
          course thou dost not; and thou hast no hope, then, that thou art safe.
          But I will ask thee yet again: Hast thou been condemned by the law in
          thy conscience? Hast thou ever heard the word of God saying in thy own
          soul, "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are
          written in the book of the law to do them?" And hast thou felt that
          thou wast cursed? Didst thou ever stand before God's bar, like a poor
          condemned criminal before the judge, ready for execution? Hast thou,
          as John Bunyan would have had it, ever had the rope upon thy neck?
          Hast thou ever seen the black cap put upon the face of thy Judge? Hast
          thou ever thought thyself about to be turned off from the gallows?
          Hast thou ever walked the earth, as if at every step the earth would
          open beneath thee, and swallow thee up? Hast thou ever felt thyself to
          be a worthless, ruined, sin-condemned, law-condemned,
          conscience-condemned sinner? Hast thou ever fallen down before God,
          and said: "Lord, thou art just; though thou slay me, I will say, Thou
          art just; for I am sinful, and I deserve thy wrath?" As the Lord
          liveth, if thou hast never felt that, thou art a stranger to his
          grace; for the man who acquits himself God condemneth; and if the law
          condemn thee, God will acquit thee. So long as thou hast felt thyself
          condemned, thou mayest know that Christ died for condemned ones, and
          shed his blood for sinners; but and if thou foldest thine arms in
          self-security, if thou sayest: "I am good, I am righteous, I am
          honorable," be thou warned of this -- thine armor is the weaving of a
          spider; it shall be broken in pieces; the garments of the
          righteousness are light as the web of the gossamer, and shall be blown
          away by the breath of the Eternal, in that day when he will unspin all
          that nature hath ever woven. Ay, I bid thee now take heed; if thou
          hast never been condemned by the law, thou hast never been acquitted
          by grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now another question I will ask thee: Hast thou ever felt thyself
          to be acquitted by Christ? "No," saith one, "I never expected to feel
          that; I thought that we might know it perhaps when we came to die --
          that a few eminent Christians might then possibly know themselves to
          be forgiven; but I think, sir, you are very enthusiastic to ask me
          whether I have ever felt myself to be forgiven." My dear friend, you
          mistake. Do you think, if a man had been a galley-slave, chained to an
          oar for many a year, if he were once set free he would not know
          whether he were free or not? Do you think that a slave who had been
          toiling for years, when once he trod upon the land of freedom, if you
          should say to him: "Do you know that you are emancipated?" Do you
          think he would not know it? Or a man that has been dead in his grave,
          if he were awakened to life, do you think he would not know it? There
          may be times when he hath forgotten the season; but he will know
          himself to be alive; he will feel and know himself to be free. Tell me
          it is enthusiastic to ask you whether you have ever felt your chains
          broken? Sirs, if you have never felt your chains fall off from you,
          then be it know that your chains are on you; for when God breaketh our
          chains from off us, we know ourselves to be free. The most of us, when
          God did set us free from our prison-house, did leap for very joy; and
          we remember the mountains and the hills did burst forth before us into
          singing, and the trees of the field did clap their hands. We shall
          never forget that gladsome moment; it is impressed upon our memory; we
          shall remember it till life's latest hour. I ask thee, again, Didst
          thou ever feel thyself forgiven? And if thou sayest "No," then thou
          hast no right to think thou art. If Jesus hath never whispered in
          thine ear, "I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions,"
          thou hast no right to think thyself pardoned. O! I beseech thee,
          examine thyself, and know whether thou hast been condemned by the law,
          and whether thou hast been acquitted by Christ!
        </p>
        <p>
          And, lastly, my friends, I may have, and doubtless have, many present
          here who have simply come to spend an hour, but who have no care, no
          interest, no concern about their own souls -- who are, perhaps,
          utterly and entirely careless as to whether they are condemned or not.
          O! if I could speak to you as I would wish, I would speak --
        </p>
        <p>"As though I ne'er might speak again,</p>
        <p>A dying man to dying men."</p>
        <p>
          When I remember that I shall likely enough never see the faces of many
          of you again, I feel that there is a deep and an awful responsibility
          lying on me to speak to such of you as are careless. There are some of
          you who are putting off the evil day; and you are saying, "If I be
          condemned, I care not for it." Ah! my friend, if I saw thee carelessly
          asleep on thy bed, when the flames were raging in thy chamber, I would
          shout in thine ear, or I would drag thee from thy couch of slumber. If
          I knew that while thou hadst a bad disease within thee, thou wouldst
          not take the medicine, and that if thou didst not take it thou wouldst
          die, I would implore thee on my knees to take that medicine that would
          save thee. But, alas! here you are; you are in danger of destruction,
          many of you, and you have a disease within you that must soon destroy
          your lives; and yet what careless, hardened, thoughtless creatures you
          are, just caring for the body, and not seeking for Christ! As the
          angel put his hand upon Lot, and said, "Look not behind thee, neither
          stay thou in all the plain, but flee to the mountain," so would I do
          to you. I would come to each of you, and say, "My brother,
          carelessness may avail thee now; but carelessness will not stop the
          voice of death when he speaks. Indifference may silence my voice in
          your conscience; but when that gloomy skeleton tyrant comes to address
          thee, indifference will not do then. Now thou mayest laugh; now thou
          mayest dance; now thou mayest be merry; now thy cup may be full to the
          brim; but what wilt thou do in that day, when the heavens are clothed
          with glory, when the books are opened, when the great white throne is
          set, and when thou comest to be condemned or acquitted before thy
          Maker? Do, I beseech thee, do forestall the day. I beg of thee, for
          Christ's sake, bethink thyself even now before thy Judge; conceive him
          there in yonder heavens upon his throne; imagine that now thou art
          looking upon him. Oh! my hearer, what wilt thou do? Thou art before
          the judgment-throne, without Christ; thou art there naked. 'Rocks!
          hide me! hide me! hide me! I am naked!' But thou art dragged out,
          sinner! What wilt thou do now? Thou art dragged naked before thy
          Judge. I see thee bend thy knee; I hear thee cry, 'O Jesus, clothe me
          now!' 'Nay,' saith Jesus, 'the robe now is hung up forever, not to be
          worn by thee.' 'Saviour! spread thy wings over me!' 'Nay,' saith he,
          'I called, and ye refused; I stretched out my hand, and no man
          regarded. I also will laugh at your calamity, and mock when your fear
          cometh.'" Do I talk realities, or mere fictions? Why, realities; and
          yet if I were reading a novel to you, you would be lost in tears; but
          when I tell you God's truth, that soon his chariot shall descend to
          earth, and he shall judge us all, you sit unmoved and careless of that
          event. But oh! be it known to every careless sinner, death and
          judgment are not the things they fancy; everlasting wrath and eternal
          severance from God are not such light things to endure as they have
          conceived. "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living
          God." "Who among us shall dwell with devouring fire? Who among us
          shall abide with everlasting torments?"
        </p>
        <p>
          But to close: have I one here who is saying, "What must I do to be
          saved, for I feel myself condemned?" Hear thou Christ's own words --
          "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that
          believeth not shall be damned." Dost thou ask me what it is to
          believe? Hear, then, the answer. To believe is to look to Jesus. that
          little word "look" expresses beautifully what a sinner is to do. There
          is little in its appearance, but there is much in its meaning.
          Believing is letting the hands lie still, and turning the eyes to
          Christ. We can not be saved by our hands; but we are saved through our
          eyes, when they look to Jesus. Sinner! it is no use for thee to try
          and save thyself; but to believe in Christ is the only way of
          salvation; and that is, throwing self behind your back, and putting
          Christ right before thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never can find a better figure than the negro's one: to believe is
          to fall fla down upon the promise, and there to lie. To believe is as
          a man would do in a stream. It is said, that if we were to fold our
          arms, and lie motionless, we could not sink. To believe is to float
          upon the stream of grace. I grant you, you shall do afterward; but you
          must live before you can do. The gospel is the reverse of the law. The
          law says, "Do and live;" the gospel says, "Live first, then do." The
          way to do, poor sinner, is to say, "Here, Jesus, here I am; I give
          myself to thee." I never had a better idea of believing than I once
          had from a poor countryman. I may have mentioned this before; but it
          struck me very forcibly at the time, and I can not help repeating it.
          Speaking about faith he said, "The old enemy has been troubling me
          very much lately; but I told him that he must not say any thing to me
          about my sins, he must go to my Master, for I had transferred the
          whole concern to him, bad debts and all." That is believing. Believing
          is giving up all we have to Christ, and taking all Christ has to
          ourselves. It is changing houses with Christ, changing clothes with
          Christ, changing our unrighteousness for his righteousness, changing
          our sins for his merits. Execute the transfer, sinner; rather, may
          God's grace execute it, and give thee faith in it; and then the law
          will be no longer thy condemnation, but it shall acquit thee. May
          Christ add his blessing! May the Holy Spirit rest upon us! And may we
          meet at last in heaven! Then will we "sing to the praise of the glory
          of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved.<br />
