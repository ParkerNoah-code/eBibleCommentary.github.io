          Moreover, marriages among blood-relations are forbidden, since all
          laws, both sacred and secular, forbid such. Wherefore the divine laws
          not only expel, but even anathematize, those who do so, and those who
          spring from them. Secular laws, again, call such persons infamous, and
          interdict them from inheriting. And we too, following our fathers, and
          keeping close by their footsteps, brand such with infamy, and hold
          them to be infamous, because they are sprinkled with the stains of
          infamy. Neither ought we to admit those men or their accusations, that
          secular laws reject. (For who doubts that human laws, when they are
          not inconsistent with reason and honour, are to be embraced,
          especially when they either further the public good or defend the
          authority of the ecclesiastical office, and uphold it as a help?) And
          we call those blood-relations whom divine laws, and those of the
          emperors, both Roman and Greek, name blood-relations, and whom they
          admit to the right of inheriting, and cannot exclude from that.
          Marriages, then, between such are neither lawful nor capable of
          holding good, but are to be rejected. (And if any such are attempted
          in rash daring, they come to be rescinded by apostolic authority.)<br />
