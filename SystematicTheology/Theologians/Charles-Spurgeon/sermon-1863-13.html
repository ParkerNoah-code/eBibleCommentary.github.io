        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.531)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, September 20th, 1863, by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of
          his Son Jesus Christ.| -- 1 John 3:23.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE old law shines in terrible glory with its ten commandments. There
          are some who love that law so much, that they cannot pass over a
          Sabbath without its being read in their hearing, accompanied by the
          mournful petition, |Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts
          to keep this law.| Nay, some are so foolish as to enter into a
          covenant for their children, that |they shall keep all God's holy
          commandments, and walk in the same all the days of their life.| Thus
          they early wear a yoke which neither they nor their fathers can bear,
          and daily groaning under its awful weight, they labour after
          righteousness where it never can be found. Over the tables of the law
          in every Church, I would have conspicuously printed these gospel
          words, |By the deeds of the law shall no flesh living be justified.|
          The true believer has learned to look away from the killing ordinances
          of the old law. He understands that |as many as are of the works of
          the law are under the curse, for it is written: Cursed is everyone
          that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the
          law to do them.| He therefore turns with loathing from all trust in
          his own obedience to the ten commands, and lays hold with joy upon the
          hope set before him in the one commandment contained in my text, |This
          is his commandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son
          Jesus Christ.|
        </p>
        <p>We sing, and sing rightly too --</p>
        <p>|My soul, no more attempt to draw</p>
        <p>Thy life and comfort from the law,|</p>
        <p>
          for from the law death cometh and not life, misery and not comfort.
          |To convince and to condemn is all the law can do.| O, when will all
          professors, and especially all professed ministers of Christ, learn
          the difference between the law and the gospel? Most of them make a
          mingle-mangle, and serve out deadly potions to the people, often
          containing but one ounce of gospel to a pound of law, whereas, but
          even a grain of law is enough to spoil the whole thing. It must be
          gospel, and gospel only. |If it be of grace, it is not of works,
          otherwise grace is no more grace; and if it be of works, then it is
          not of grace, otherwise work is no more work.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The Christian then, turning his attention to the one command of the
          gospel, is very anxious to know first, what is the matter of the
          believing here intended; and secondly, what is the sinner's warrant
          for so believing in Christ; nor will he fail to consider the mandate
          of the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First then, THE MATTER OF BELIEVING, or what is it that a man is to
          believe in order to eternal life. Is it the Athanasian creed? Is it
          true, that if a man does not hold that confession whole and entire, he
          shall without doubt perish everlastingly? We leave those to decide who
          are learned in matters of bigotry. Is it any particular form of
          doctrine ? Is it the Calvinistic or the Arminian scheme? For our own
          part we are quite content with our text -- believing on |his Son Jesus
          Christ.| That faith which saves the soul is believing on a person,
          depending upon Jesus for eternal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          To speak more at large of the things which are to be believed in order
          to justification by faith. they all relate to the person and the work
          of our Lord Jesus Christ. We must believe him to be God's Son -- so
          the text puts it -- |His Son.| We must grasp with strong confidence
          the great fact that he is God: for nothing short of a divine Saviour
          can ever deliver us from the infinite wrath of God. He who rejects the
          true and proper Godhead of Jesus of Nazareth, is not saved, and cannot
          be, for he believes not on Jesus as God's Son. Furthermore, we must
          accept this Son of God as |Jesus,| the Saviour. We must believe that
          Jesus Christ the Son of God, became man out of infinite love to man,
          that he might save his people from their sins, according to that
          worthy saying, |Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,|
          even the chief. We must look upon Jesus as |Christ,| the anointed of
          the Father, sent into this world on salvation's errand, not that
          sinners might save themselves, but that he, being mighty to save,
          might bring many sons unto glory. We must believe that Jesus Christ,
          Coming into the world to save sinners, did really effect his mission;
          that the precious blood which is shed upon Calvary is almighty to
          atone for sin, and therefore, all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be
          forgiven unto men, since the blood of Jesus Christ, God's dear Son,
          cleanseth us from all sin. We must heartily accept the great doctrine
          of the atonement -- regarding Jesus as standing in the room, place,
          and stead of sinful men, bearing for them the terror of the law's
          curse until justice was satisfied and could demand no more. Moreover,
          we should rejoice that as Jesus Christ, by his dying, put away for
          ever the sin of his people, so by his living he gave unto those who
          trust in him a perfect righteousness, in which, despite their own
          sins, they are |accepted in the beloved.| We are also taught, that if
          we heartily trust our soul with Christ, our sins, through his blood,
          are forgiven, and his righteousness is imputed to us. The mere
          knowledge of these facts will not, however, save us, unless we really
          and truly trust our souls in the Redeemer's hands. Faith must act in
          this wise: |I believe that Jesus came to save sinners, and therefore,
          sinner though I be, I rest myself on him; I know that his
          righteousness justifies the ungodly; I, therefore, though ungodly,
          trust in him to be my righteousness; I know that his precious blood in
          heaven prevails with God on the behalf of them that come unto him; and
          since I come unto him, I know by faith that I have an interest in his
          perpetual intercession.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I have enlarged the one thought of believing on God's Son Jesus
          Christ. Brethren, I would not darken counsel by words without
          knowledge. |Believing| is most clearly explained by that simple word
          |trust.| Believing is partly the intellectual operation of receiving
          divine truths, but the essence of it lies in relying upon those
          truths. I believe that, although I cannot swim, yonder friendly plank
          will support me in the flood -- I grasp it, and am saved: the grasp is
          faith. I am promised by a generous friend that if I draw upon his
          banker, he will supply all my needs -- I joyously confide in him, and
          as often as I am in want I go to the bank, and am enriched: my going
          to the bank is faith. Thus faith is accepting God's great promise,
          contained in the person of his Son. It is taking God at his word, and
          trusting in Jesus Christ as being my salvation, although I am utterly
          unworthy of his regard. Sinner, if thou takest Christ to be thy
          Saviour this day, thou art justified; though thou be the biggest
          blasphemer and persecutor out of hell, if thou darest to trust Christ
          with thy salvation, that faith of thine saves thee; though thy whole
          life may have been as black, and foul, and devilish as thou couldst
          have made it, yet if thou wilt honour God by believing Christ is able
          to forgive such a wretch as thou art, and wilt now trust in Jesus'
          precious blood, thou art saved from divine wrath.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The WARRANT OF BELIEVING is the point upon which I shall spend my
          time and strength this morning. According to my text, the warrant for
          a man to believe is the commandment of God. This is the commandment,
          that ye |believe on his Son Jesus Christ.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-righteousness will always find a lodging somewhere or other.
          Drive it, my brethren, out of the ground of our confidence; let the
          sinner see that he cannot rest on his good works, then, as foxes will
          have holes, this self-righteousness will find a refuge for itself in
          the warrant of our faith in Christ. It reasons thus: |You are not
          saved by what you do but by what Christ did; but then, you have no
          right to trust in Christ unless there is something good in you which
          shall entitle you to trust in him.| Now, this legal reasoning I
          oppose. I believe such teaching to contain in it the essence of Popish
          self-righteousness. The warrant for a sinner to believe in Christ is
          not in himself in any sense or in any manner, but in the fact that he
          is commanded there and then to believe on Jesus Christ. Some preachers
          in the Puritanic times, whose shoe latchets I am not worthy to
          unloose, erred much in this matter. I refer not merely to Alleyne and
          Baxter, who are far better preachers of the law than of the gospel,
          but I include men far sounder in the faith than they, such as Rogers
          of Dedham, Shepherd, the author of |The Sound Believer,| and
          especially the American, Thomas Hooker, who has written a book upon
          qualifications for coming to Christ. These excellent men had a fear of
          preaching the gospel to any except those whom they styled |sensible
          sinners,| and consequently kept hundreds of their hearers sitting in
          darkness when they might have rejoiced in the light. They preached
          repentance and hatred of sin as the warrant of a sinner's trusting to
          Christ. According to them, a sinner might reason thus -- |I possess
          such-and-such a degree of sensibility on account of sin, therefore I
          have a right to trust in Christ.| Now, I venture to affirm that such
          reasoning is seasoned with fatal error. Whoever preaches in this
          fashion may preach much of the gospel, but the whole gospel of the
          free grace of God in its fulness he has yet to learn. In our own day
          certain preachers assure us that a man must he regenerated before we
          may bid him believe in Jesus Christ; some degree of a work of grace in
          the heart being, in their judgment, the only warrant to believe. This
          also is false. It takes away a gospel for sinners and offers us a
          gospel for saints. It is anything hut a ministry of free grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others say that the warrant for a sinner to believe in Christ is his
          election. Now, as his election cannot possibly be known by any man
          until he has believed, this is virtually preaching that nobody has any
          known warrant for believing at all. If I cannot possibly know my
          election before I believe -- and yet the minister tells me that I may
          only believe upon the ground of my election -- how am I ever to
          believe at all? Election brings me faith, and faith is the evidence of
          my election; but to say that my faith is to depend upon my knowledge
          of my election, which I cannot get without faith. is to talk egregious
          nonsense.
        </p>
        <p>
          I lay down this morning with great boldness -- because I know and am
          well persuaded that what I speak is the mind of the Spirit -- this
          doctrine that the sole and only warrant for a sinner to believe in
          Jesus is found in the gospel itself and in the command which
          accompanies that gospel, |Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
          shalt be saved.| I shall deal with that matter first of all,
          negatively, and then, positively.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, NEGATIVELY; and here my first observation is that any other
          way of preaching the gospel-warrant is absurd. If I am to preach faith
          in Christ to a man who is regenerated, then the man, being
          regenerated, is saved already, and it is an unnecessary and ridiculous
          thing for me to preach Christ to him, and bid him to believe in order
          to be saved when he is saved already, being regenerate. But you will
          tell me that I ought to preach it only to those who repent of their
          sins. Very well; but since true repentance of sin is the work of the
          Spirit, any man who has repentance is most certainly saved, because
          evangelical repentance never can exist in an unrenewed soul. Where
          there is repentance there is faith already, for they never can be
          separated. So, then, I am only to preach faith to those who have it.
          Absurd, indeed! Is not this waiting till the man is cured and then
          bringing him the medicine ? This is preaching Christ to the righteous
          and not to sinners. |Nay,| saith one, |but we mean that a man must
          have some good desires towards Christ before he has any warrant to
          believe in Jesus.| Friend, do you not know what all good desires have
          some degree of holiness in them ? But if a sinner hath any degree of
          true holiness in him it must be the work of the Spirit, for true
          holiness never exists in the carnal mind, therefore, that man is
          already renewed, and therefore saved. Are we to go running up and down
          the world, proclaiming life to the living, casting bread to those who
          are fed already, and holding up Christ on the pole of the gospel to
          those who are already healed? My brethren, where is our inducement to
          labour where our efforts are so little needed ? If I am to preach
          Christ to those who have no goodness, who have nothing in them that
          qualifies them for mercy, then I feel I have a gospel so divine that I
          would proclaim it with my last breath, crying aloud, that |Jesus came
          into the world to save sinners| -- sinners as sinners, not as penitent
          sinners or as awakened sinners, but sinners as sinners, sinners |of
          whom I am chief.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, to tell the sinner that he is to believe on Christ because
          of some warrant in himself, is legal, I dare to say it -- legal.
          Though this method is generally adopted by the higher school of
          Calvinists, they are herein unsound, uncalvinistic, and legal; it is
          strange that they who are so bold defenders of free grace should make
          common cause with Baxterians and Pelagians. I lay it down to he legal
          for this reason: if I believe in Jesus Christ because I feel a genuine
          repentance of sin, and therefore have a warrant for my faith, do you
          not perceive that the first and true ground of my confidence is the
          fact that I have repented of sin? If I believe in Jesus because I have
          convictions and a spirit of prayer, then evidently the first and the
          most important fact is not Christ, but my possession of repentance,
          conviction, and prayer, so that really my hope hinges upon my having
          repented; and if this be not legal I do not know what is. Put it
          lower. My opponents will say, |The sinner must have an awakened
          conscience before he is warranted to believe on Christ.| Well, then,
          if I trust Christ to save me because I have an awakened conscience, I
          say again, the most important part of the whole transaction is the
          alarm of my conscience, and my real trust hangs there. If I lean on
          Christ because I feel this and that, then I am leaning on my feelings
          and not on Christ alone, and this is legal indeed. Nay, even if
          desires after Christ are to be my warrant for believing, if I am to
          believe in Jesus not because he bids me, but because I feel some
          desires after him, you will again with half an eye perceive that the
          most important source of my comfort must be my own desires. So that we
          shall be always looking within. |Do I really desire? If I do, then
          Christ can save me; if I do not, then he cannot.| And so my desire
          overrides Christ and his grace. Away with such' legality from the
          earth!
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, any other way of preaching than that of bidding the sinner
          believe because God commands him to believe, is a boasting way of
          faith. For if my warrant to trust in Jesus be found in my experience,
          my loathings of sin, or my longings after Christ, then all these good
          things of mine are a legitimate ground of boasting, because though
          Christ may save me, yet these were the wedding-dress which fitted me
          to come to Christ. If these be indispensable pre-requisites and
          conditions, then the man who has them may truly and justly say,
          |Christ did save me, but I had the pre-requisites and conditions
          first, and therefore let these share the praise.| See, my brethren,
          those who have a faith which rests upon their own experience, what are
          they as a rule? Mark them, and you will perceive much censorious
          bitterness in them, prompting them to set up their own experience as
          the standard of saintship, which may assuredly make us suspicious
          whether they ever were humbled in a gospel manner at all, so as to see
          that their own best feelings, and best repentances, and best
          experiences in themselves are nothing more nor less than filthy rags
          in the sight of God. My dear brethren, when we tell a sinner that foul
          and filthy as he is, without any preparation or qualification, he is
          to take Jesus Christ to be his all in all, finding in him all that he
          can ever need, when we dare on the spot to bid the jailor just
          startled out of sleep, |Believe in Jesus,| we leave no room for
          self-glorification, all must be of grace. When we find the lame man
          lying at the temple gates, we do not bid him strengthen his own legs.
          or feel some life in them, but we bid him in the name of Jesus rise up
          and walk; surely here when God the Spirit owns the Word, all boasting
          is excluded. Whether I rely on my experience or my good works makes
          little difference, for either of these reliances will lead to boasting
          since they are both legal. Law and boasting are twin brothers, but
          free grace and gratitude always go together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any other warrant for believing on Jesus than that which is presented
          in the gospel is changeable. See, brethren, if my warrant to believe
          in Christ lies in my meltings of heart and my experiences, then if
          to-day I have a melting heart and I can pour my soul out before the
          Lord, I have a warrant to believe in Christ. But to-morrow (who does
          not know this?) to-morrow my heart may be as hard as a stone, so that
          I can neither feel nor pray. Then, according to the
          qualification-theory, I have no right to trust in Christ, my warrant
          is clean gone from me. According to the doctrine of final
          perseverance, the Christian's faith is continual, if so the warrant of
          his faith must be always the same, or else he has sometimes an
          unwarranted faith which is absurd; it follows from this that the
          abiding warrant of faith must lie in some immutable truth. Since
          everything within changes more frequently than ever does an English
          sky, if my warrant to believe in Christ be based within, it must
          change every hour; consequently I am lost and saved alternately.
          Brethren, can these things be so? For my part I want a sure and
          immutable warrant for my faith; I want a warrant to believe in Jesus
          which will serve me when the devil's blasphemy comes pouring into my
          ears like a flood; I want a warrant to believe which will serve me
          when my lustings and corruptions appear in terrible array, and make me
          cry out, |O wretched man that I am;' I want a warrant to believe in
          Christ which will comfort me when I have no good frames and holy
          feelings, when I am dead as a stone and my spirit lies cleaving to the
          dust. Such an unfailing warrant to belief in Jesus is found in this
          precious truth, that his gracious commandment and not my variable
          experience, is my title to believe on his Son Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, my brethren, any other warrant is utterly incomprehensible.
          Multitudes of my brethren preach an impossible salvation. How often do
          poor sinners hunger and thirst to know the way of salvation, and there
          is no available salvation preached to them. Personally, I do not
          remember to have been told from the pulpit to believe in Jesus as a
          sinner. I heard much of feelings which I thought I could never get,
          and frames after which I longed; but I found no peace until a true,
          free grace message came to me, |Look unto me and be ye saved, all the
          ends of the earth.| See, my brethren, if convictions of soul are
          necessary qualifications for Christ, we ought to know to an ounce how
          much of these qualifications are needed. If you tell a poor sinner
          that there is a certain amount of humblings, and tremblings, and
          convictions, and heart-searchings to be felt, in order that he may be
          warranted to come to Christ, I demand of all legal-gospellers distinct
          information as to the manner and exact degree of preparation required.
          Brethren, you will find when these gentlemen are pushed into a corner,
          they will not agree, but will every one give a different standard,
          according to his own judgment. One will sa the sinner must have months
          of law work; another, that he only needs good desires; and some will
          demand that he possess the graces of the Spirit -- such as humility,
          godly sorrow, and love to holiness. You will get no clear answer from
          them. If the sinner's warrant to come is found in the gospel itself,
          the matter is clear and plain; but what a roundabout plan is that
          compound of law and gospel against which I Contend! And let me ask
          you, my brethren, whether such an incomprehensible gospel would do for
          a dying man? There he lies in the agonies of death. He tells me that
          he has no good thought or feeling, and asks what he must do to be
          saved. There is but a step between him and death -- another five
          minutes and that man's soul may be in hell. What am I to tell him? Am
          I to be an hour explaining to him the preparation required before he
          may come to Christ? Brethren, I dare not. But I tell him, |Believe.
          brother, even though it be the eleventh hour; trust thy soul with
          Jesus, and thou shalt be saved.| There is the same gospel for a living
          man as for a dying man. The thief on the Cross may have had some
          experience, but I do not find him pleading it; he turns his eye to
          Jesus, saying, |Lord, remember me !| How prompt is the reply, |To-day
          shalt thou be with me in paradise.| He may have had onging desires, he
          may have had deep convictions, but I am quite sure he did not say,
          |Lord, I dare not ask thee to remember me, because I do not feel I
          have repented enough. I dare not trust thee, because I have not been
          shaken over hell's mouth.| No, no, no; he looked to Jesus as he was,
          and Jesus responded to his believing prayer. It must be so with you,
          my brethren, for any other plan but that of a sinner's coming to
          Christ as a sinner, and resting on Jesus just as he is, is utterly
          incomprehensible, or, if it is to be explained at all, will require a
          day or two to explain it ill; and that cannot be the gospel which the
          apostles preached to dying men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet again, I believe that the preaching of alarms of conscience and
          repentance as qualifications for Christ, is unacceptable to the
          awakened sinner. I will introduce one, as Saltmarsh does in his
          |Flowings of Christ's Blood Freely to the Chief of Sinners.| Here is a
          poor brother who dares not believe in Jesus. I will suppose him to
          have attended a ministry where the preaching is |If you have felt
          this, if you have felt that, then you may believe.| When you went to
          your minister in trouble, what did he say to you? |He asked me whether
          I felt my need of Christ, I told him I did not think I did, at least I
          did not feel my need enough. He told me that I ought to meditate upon
          the guilt of sin, and consider the dreadful character of the wrath to
          come, and I might in this way feel my need more.| Did you do so? |I
          did; but it seemed to me as if while I meditated upon the terrors of
          judgment, my heart grew harder instead of softer, and I seemed to be
          desperately set, and resolved in a kind of despair to go on in my
          ways; yet, some-times I did have some humblings and some meltings of
          heart.| What did your minister tell you to do to get comfort then? |He
          said I ought to pray much.| Did you pray? |I told him I could not
          pray; that I was such a sinner that it was of no use for me to hope
          for an answer if I could.| What did he say then? |He told me I ought
          to lay hold upon the promises.| Yes, did you do so? |No; I told him I
          could not lay hold upon the promises; that I could not see they were
          meant for me, for I was not the character intended; and that I could
          only find threatenings in the Word of God for such as I was.| What did
          he say then? |He told me to be diligent in the use of the means, and
          to attend his ministry.| What did you say to that? |I told him I was
          diligent, but that what I wanted was not means, I wanted to get my
          sins pardoned and forgiven.| What did he say then? |Why, he said that
          I had better persevere and wait patiently for the Lord; I told him
          that I was in such a horror of great darkness, that my soul chose
          strangling rather than life. Well then, he said, he thought I must
          already be truly penitent, and was therefore safe, and that sooner or
          later I should have hope But I told him, a mere hope was not enough
          for me, I could not he safe while sin lay so heavy upon me. He asked
          me whether I had not desires after Christ. I said I had, but they were
          merely selfish, Carnal desires; that I sometimes thought I had
          desires, but they were only legal. He said if I had a desire to have a
          desire, it was God's work, and I was saved. That did prop me up for a
          time, sir, but I went down again, for that did not do for me, I wanted
          something solid to rest on.| And sinner, how is it now with you? where
          are you now? |Well, sir, I scarce know where I am, but I pray you,
          tell me what I must do?| Brethren, my reply is prompt and plain; hear
          it. Poor soul, I have no questions to ask you; I have no advice to
          give you, except this, God's command to you is, whatever you may be,
          trust to the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved. Will you do it
          or no? If he rejects that, I must heave him; I have no more to say to
          him; I am clear of his blood, and on him the sentence comes, |He that
          believeth not shall be damned.| But you will find in ninety-nine Cases
          out of one hundred, that when you begin to talk to the sinner, not
          about his repentings and his desirings, but about Christ, and tell him
          that he need not fear the law, for Christ has satisfied it; that he
          need not fear an angry God, for God is not angry with believers; tell
          him that all manner of iniquity was Cast into the Red Sea of Jesus'
          blood, and, like the Egyptians, drowned there for ever; tell him that
          no matter however vile and wicked he may have been, |Christ is able to
          save unto the uttermost them that come unto God by him;| and tell him
          that he has a right to come, be he who he may, or what he may, because
          God bids him come; and you will find that the suitability of such a
          gospel to the sinner's case, will prove a sweet inducement in the hand
          of the Holy Spirit, to lead that sinner to lay hold on Jesus Christ. O
          my brethren, I am ashamed of myself when I think of the way in which I
          have sometimes talked to awakened sinners. I am persuaded that the
          only true remedy for a broken heart is Jesus Christ's most precious
          blood. Some surgeons keep a wound open too long; they keep cutting,
          and cutting, and cutting, till they cut away as much sound flesh as
          proud flesh. Better by half heal it, heal it at once, for Jesus Christ
          was not sent to keep open the wounds, but to bind up the broken in
          heart. To you, then, sinners of every sort and hue, black,
          hard-hearted, insensible, impenitent, even to you is the gospel sent,
          for |Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners,| even the
          chief.
        </p>
        <p>
          I might here pause, surely, but I must add yet one other point upon
          this negative mode of reasoning. Any other warrant for the sinner's
          faith than the gospel itself, is false and dangerous.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is false, my brethren, it is as false as God is true, that anything
          in a sinner can be his warrant for believing in Jesus. The whole
          tenour and run of the gospel is clean contrary to it. It must be
          false, because there is nothing in a sinner until he believes which
          can be a warrant for his believing. If you tell me that a sinner has
          any good thing in him before he believes, I reply, impossible --
          |Without faith it is impossible to please God.| All the repentings,
          and humblings, and convictions that a sinner has before faith, must
          be, according to Scripture, displeasing to God. Do not tell me that
          his heart is broken; if it is only broken by carnal means, and trusts
          in its brokenness, it needs to be broken over again. Do not tell me he
          has been led to hate his sin; I tell you he does not hate his sin, he
          only hates hell. There cannot be a true and real hatred of sin where
          there is not faith in Jesus. All the sinner knows and feels before
          faith is only an addition to his other sins, and how can sin which
          deserves wrath be a warrant for an act which is the work of the Holy
          Spirit?
        </p>
        <p>
          How dangerous is the sentiment I am opposing. My hearers, it may be so
          mischievous us to have misled some of you. I solemnly warn you, though
          you have been professors of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ for twenty
          years, if your reason for believing in Christ lies in this, that you
          have felt the terrors of the law; that you have been alarmed, and have
          been convinced; if your own experience be your warrant for believing
          in Christ, it is a false reason, and you are really relying upon your
          experience and not upon Christ: and mark you, if you rely upon your
          frames and feelings, nay, if you rely upon your communion with Christ,
          in any degree whatever, you are as certainly a lost sinner as though
          you relied upon oaths and blasphemies; you shall no more be able to
          enter heaven, even by the works of the Spirit -- and this is using
          strong language -- than by your own works; for Christ, and Christ
          alone, is the foundation, and |other foundation can no man lay than
          that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.| Take care of resting in your own
          experience. All that is of nature's spinning must be unravelled, and
          everything that getteth into Christ's place, however dear to thee, and
          however precious in itself, must be broken in pieces, and like the
          dust of the golden calf, must be strawed upon the water, and thou wilt
          be made sorrowfully to drink of it, because thou madest it thy trust.
          I believe that the tendency of that preaching which puts the warrant
          for faith anywhere but in the gospel command, is to vex the true
          penitent, and to console the hypocrite; the tendency of it is to make
          the poor soul which really repents, feel that he must not believe in
          Christ, because he sees so much of his own hardness of heart. The more
          spiritual a man is, the more unspiritual he sees himself to be; and
          the more penitent a man is, the more impenitent he discovers himself
          to be. Often the most penitent men are those who think themselves the
          most impenitent; and if I am to preach the gospel to the penitent and
          not to every sinner, as a sinner, then those penitent persons, who,
          according to my opponents, have the most right to believe, are the
          very persons who will never dare to touch it, because they are
          conscious of their own impenitence and want of all qualification for
          Christ. Sinners, let me address you with words of life: Jesus wants
          nothing of you, nothing whatsoever, nothing done, nothing felt; he
          gives both work and feeling. Ragged, penniless, just as ye are, lost,
          forsaken, desolate, with no good feelings, and no good hopes, still
          Jesus comes to you, and in these words of pity he addresses you, |Him
          that cometh to me I will in no Wise cast out.| If thou believest in
          him thou shalt never be confounded.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But now, POSITIVELY, and as the negative part has been positive
          enough, we will be brief here. The gospel Command is a sufficient
          warrant for a sinner to believe in Jesus Christ. The words of our text
          imply this -- | This is the commandment.| My brethren, do you want any
          warrant for doing a thing better than God's command to do it? The
          children of Israel borrowed jewels of silver and jewels of gold from
          the Egyptians. Many, as they read the Bible, find fault with this
          transaction; but, to my mind, if God bade them do it, that was enough
          of justification for them. Very well; if God bid thee believe -- if
          this be his commandment that thou believe -- canst thou want a better
          warrant? I say, is there any necessity for any other. Surely the
          Lord's Word is enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, the command to believe in Christ must be the sinner's
          warrant, if you consider the nature of our commission. How runs it?
          |Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.|
          It ought to run, according to the other plan, |preach the gospel to
          every regenerate person, to every convinced sinner, to every sensible
          soul.| But it is not so; it is to |every creature.| But unless the
          warrant be a something in which every creature can take a share, there
          is no such thing as consistently preaching it to every creature. Then
          how is it put? -- |He that believeth and is baptised, shall be saved;
          he that believeth not shall be damned.| Where is there a word about
          the pre-requisites for believing. Surely the man could not be damned
          for not doing what he would not have been warranted in doing. Our
          reaching, on the theory of qualifications, should not be,| Believe in
          the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved;| but |Qualify
          yourselves for faith, be sensible of your sin, be regenerated, get
          marks and evidences, and then believe.| Why, surely, if I am not to
          sow the good seed on the stony places and among the thorns, I had
          better give up being a sower, and take to ploughing, or some other
          work. When the apostles went to Macedonia or Achaia, they ought not to
          have commenced with preaching Christ; they should have preached up
          qualifications, emotions, and sensations, if these are the
          preparations for Jesus; but I find that Paul, whenever he stands up,
          has nothing to preach but |Christ, and him crucified.| Repentance is
          preached as a gift from the exalted Saviour, but it is never as the
          cause or preparation for believing on Jesus. These two graces are born
          together, and live with a common life -- beware of making one a
          foundation for the other. I would like to carry one of those who only
          preach to sensible sinners, and set him down in the capital of the
          kingdom of Dahomey. There are no sensible sinners there! Look at them,
          with their mouths stained with human blood, with their bodies smeared
          all over with the gore of their immolated victims -- how will the
          preacher find any qualification there? I know not what he could say,
          but I know what my message would be. My word would run thus -- |Men
          and brethren, God, who made the heavens and the earth; hath sent his
          Son Jesus Christ into the world to suffer for our sins, and whosoever
          believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.| If
          Christ crucified did not shake the kingdom of Dahomey, it would be its
          first failure. When the Moravian missionaries first went to Greenland,
          you remember that they were months and months teaching the poor
          Greenlander about the Godhead, the doctrine of the Trinity, and the
          doctrine of sin and the law, and no converts were forthcoming. But one
          day, by accident, one of the Greenlanders happening to read that
          passage, |Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us
          that we should be called the children of God,| asked the meaning, and'
          the missionary, hardly thinking him advanced enough to understand the
          gospel, nevertheless ventured to explain it to him, and the man became
          converted, and hundreds of his countrymen received the Word. Naturally
          enough, they said to the missionaries, |Why did not you tell us this
          before? We knew all about there being a God, and that did us no good;
          why did not you come and tell us to believe in Jesus Christ before?| O
          my brethren, this is God's weapon, God's method; this is the great
          battering-ram which will shake the gates of hell; and we must see to
          it, that it be brought into daily use.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have tried, on the positive side, to show that a free-grace warrant
          is consistent with the text -- that it accords with apostolic custom,
          and is, indeed, absolutely necessary, seeing the condition in which
          sinners are placed. But, my brethren, to preach Christ to sinners, as
          sinners, must be right; for all the former acts of God are to sinners,
          as sinners. Whom did God elect? Sinners. He loved us with a great
          love, even when we were dead in trespasses and sins. How did he redeem
          them? Did he redeem them as saints? No; for while we were yet enemies,
          he reconciled us unto God by the death of his Son. Christ never shed
          his blood for the good that is in us, but for the sin that is in us.
          |He laid down his life for our sins,| says the apostle. If, then, in
          election and redemption, we find God dealing with sinners, as sinners,
          it is a marring and nullifying of the whole plan if the gospel is to
          be preached to men as anything else but sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, it is inconsistent with the character of God to suppose that he
          comes forth and proclaims, |If, O my fallen creatures, if you qualify
          yourselves for my mercy, I will save you; if you will feel holy
          emotions -- if you will be conscious of sacred desires after me, then
          the blood of Jesus Christ shall cleanse you.| There would be little
          which is godlike in that. But when he comes out with pardons full and
          free, and saith, |Yea, when ye lay in your blood, I said unto you
          Live| -- when he comes to you, his enemy and rebellious subject, and
          yet cries, |I have blotted out thy sins like a cloud, and like a thick
          cloud thine iniquities.| Why, this is divine. You know what David
          said, |I have sinned.| What did Nathan say? |The Lord has put away thy
          sin, thou shalt not die,| and that is the message of the gospel to a
          sinner as a sinner. |The Lord has put away thy sin; Christ has
          suffered; he has brought in perfect righteousness; take him, trust
          him, and ye shall live.| May that message come home to you this
          morning, my beloved.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have read with some degree of attention a book to which I owe much
          for this present discourse -- a book, by Abraham Booth, called |Glad
          Tidings to Perishing Sinners.| I have never heard any one cast a
          suspicion upon Abraham Booth's soundness; on the contrary, he has been
          generally considered as one of the most orthodox of the divines of the
          last generation. If you want my views in full, read his book. If you
          need something more, let me say, among all the bad things which his
          revilers have laid to his door, I have never heard any one blame
          William Huntingdon for not being high enough in doctrine. Now, William
          Huntingdon prefaced in his lifetime a book by Saltmarsh, with which he
          was greatly pleased; and the marrow of its teaching is just this, in
          his own words, |The only ground for any to believe is, he is faithful
          that hath promised, not anything in themselves, for this is the
          commandment, That ye believe on his Son Jesus Christ.| Now, if William
          Huntingdon himself printed such a book as that, I marvel how the
          followers of either William Huntingdon or Abraham Booth, how men
          calling themselves Calvinistic divines and high Calvinists, can
          advocate what is not free grace, but a legal, graceless system of
          qualifications and preparations. I might here quote Crisp, who is pat
          to the point and a high doctrine man too. I mention neither Booth nor
          Huntingdon as authorities upon the subject, to the law and to the
          testimony we must go; but I do mention them to show that men holding
          strong views on election and predestination yet did see it to be
          consistent to preach the gospel to sinners as sinners -- nay, felt
          that it was inconsistent to preach the gospel in any other way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall only add, that the blessings which flow from preaching Christ
          to sinners as sinners, are of such a character as prove it to be
          right. Do on not see that this levels us all? We have the same warrant
          for believing, and no one can exalt himself above his fellow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, my brethren, how it inspires men with hope and confidence; it
          forbids despair. No man can despair if this be true; or if he do, it
          is a wicked, unreasonable despair, because if he has been never so
          bad, yet God commands him to believe. What room can there be for
          despondency? Surely if anything Could cut off Giant Despair's head,
          Christ preached to sinners is the sharp two-edged sword to do it.

          Again, how it makes a man live close to Christ! If I am to come to
          Christ as a sinner every day, and I must do so, for the Word saith,
          |As ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him;| if
          every day I am to come to Christ as a sinner, why then, how paltry all
          my doings look! what utter contempt it casts upon all my fine virtues,
          m preachings, my prayings, and all that comes of my flesh! and though
          it leads me to seek after purity and holiness, yet it teaches me to
          live on Christ and not on them, and so it keeps me at the fountain
          head.

          My time flies, and I must leave the last head, just to add, sinner,
          whoever thou mayst be, God now commands thee to believe in Jesus
          Christ. This is his commandment: he does not command thee to feel
          anything, or be anything, to prepare thyself for this. Now, art thou
          willing to incur the great guilt of making God a liar? Surely thou
          wilt shrink from that: then dare to believe. Thou canst not say, |I
          have no right:| you have a perfect right to do what God tells you to
          do. You cannot tell me you are not fit; there is no fitness wanted,
          the Command is given and it is yours to obey, not to dispute. You
          cannot say it does not come to you -- it is preached to every Creature
          under heaven; and now soul, it is so pleasant a thing to trust the
          Lord Jesus Christ that I would fain persuade myself thou needest no
          persuading. It is so delightful a thing to accept a perfect salvation,
          to be saved by precious blood. and to be married to so bright a
          Saviour, that I would fain hope the Holy Spirit has led thee to cry,
          |Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.|<br />
