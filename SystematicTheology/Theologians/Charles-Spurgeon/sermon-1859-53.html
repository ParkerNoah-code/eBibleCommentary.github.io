        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.280)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, October 23rd, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth
          away." -- Psalm 1:4.
        </p>
        <p>
          AND WHO are the ungodly? Are they open and wilful sinners -- men who
          take God's name in vain, and curse, and blaspheme -- men who break the
          laws of man, the laws of the state -- men who are scarcely to be
          trusted with liberty? Certainly these are included, but these are not
          mainly intended. While such men come under the category of "sinners"
          and "scorners," there is another class expressly aimed at by the term
          "ungodly." And who are the ungodly? Are they the men who deny God's
          existence, who neglect the outward forms of religion, who scoff at
          everything that is sacred, and make a ribald jest of things at which
          angels tremble? These are included, most certainly, but neither are
          these the men specially aimed at. They are the scornful, the
          pestilent: these are the men whose iniquities have gone beforehand to
          judgment against them, and whose sins are clammering before the throne
          for justice. Another class of men is intended under the term
          "ungodly." And who are they? Surely, my brethren, the answer may well
          strike you with awe. I do trust there are not many in this hall who
          may be called scorners; and, perhaps, not very many who would come
          under the denomination of open profligates and rebels; but how large a
          proportion of all those who attend our places of worship may justly be
          ranked under the character of the ungodly! What does this exactly
          mean? Let me just show its differences once again, and then more
          precisely define it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We sometimes call men irreligious; and, surely, to be irreligious is
          bad enough; but to be religious is not good enough. A man may be
          religious, but yet he may not be godly. There are many who are
          religious; as touching the law outwardly they are blameless; Hebrews
          of the Hebrews, Pharisees of the straitest sect. They neglect no
          rubric, they break no law of their church, they are exceedingly
          precise in their religion; yet, notwithstanding this, they may rank
          under the class of the ungodly; for to be religious is one thing. and
          to be godly is quite another. To be godly, then, -- to come at once to
          the mark -- to be godly is to have a constant eye to God, to recognize
          him in all things' to trust him, to love him, to serve him. And the
          ungodly man is one who does not have an eye to God in his daily
          business, who lives in this world as if there were no God; while he
          attends to all the outward ceremonies of religion, he never goes to
          their core, never enters into their secret heart and their deep
          mysteries. He sees the sacraments, but he sees not God therein; he
          hears the preaching, he comes up to the house of prayer, into the
          midst of the great congregation, he bows his head, but there is no
          present Deity to him, there is no manifest God. There is no hearing of
          his voice, there is no bowing before his throne. Doubtless, there is a
          large number here who must confess that they are not trusting in the
          blood of Christ, they are not influenced by the Holy Ghost, they do
          not love God; they cannot say that the bent and tenour of their fires
          is towards him. Why you have been the last six days about your
          business, occupying all your time, -- and quite right is it to be
          diligent in business -- but how many of you have forgotten God all the
          while? You have been trading for yourselves, not for God. The
          righteous man does everything in the name of God: at least, this is
          his constant desire. Whether he eats or drinks, or whatsoever he does,
          he desires to do all in the name of the Lord Jesus. But you have not
          recognized God in your shop. You have not acknowledged him in your
          dealings with your fellow-men. You have acted towards them as if there
          had been no God whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, perhaps, even this day you must confess that your heart does not
          love the Lord. You have never gone into his company. You do not seek
          retirement. You do not relish private prayer. Now God's children
          cannot be happy without sometimes talking to their Father. The sons of
          God must have frequent interviews with Jehovah. They love to cling to
          him. They feel that he is their life, their love, their all. Their
          daily cry is, "Lord, draw me to thyself; come thou to me, or draw me
          up to thee." They pant to know more of God; they long to reflect more
          of his image, they seek to keep his law; and it is their desire that
          they may be saturated with his Spirit. But such are not your desires.
          You hare no such longings as these. It is true you are not addicted to
          strong drink, you do not swear, you are no thief, you are no harlot.
          In all these things you are blameless; but yet are you ungodly,
          without God in the world. He is not your friend, he is not your
          helper. You do not cleave to him with purpose of heart. You are not
          his child. You have not "the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,
          Father." You could do as well without a God as with one. In fact you
          feel that the thought of God, if you think of it solemnly, strikes you
          with terror, and excites in your breasts, no emotions of delight. You
          are ungodly. Well then, mark, whatever I have to say this morning,
          belongs to you. Don't be looking round you and saying, I wonder how
          this will suit my neighbor. Do not I beseech you be thinking of some
          thriftless loon who has spent his estate in extravagance and
          debauchery, but be thinking of yourself. If you are not born again, if
          you are not a partaker of the Spirit, if you are not reconciled to
          God, if your sins be not forgiven, if you are not this day a living
          member of the living church of Christ, all the curses that are written
          in this book belong to you, and that part of them in particular which
          it will be my solemn business to thunder out this morning. I pray God
          that this part may be applied to your soul, that you may be made to
          tremble before the Most High, and seek him who will certainly be found
          of you, if you seek him with all your hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will readily perceive that my text may be divided into three
          parts. You have, first, a fearful negative -- "The ungodly are not
          so." You have in the next place a terrible comparison -- "they are
          like the chaff. Then you have, thirdly, an awful prophesy -- "They are
          like the chaff which the wind driveth away."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, you have here A FEARFUL NEGATIVE. The vulgate Latin
          version, the Arabic and Septuagint, read this first sentence thus: --
          "Not so the ungodly, not so;" for according to their version there is
          a double negative here -- "Not so the ungodly, not so." Now in order
          to understand what is meant by this negative you must read the third
          verse. The righteous man is said to be "like a tree planted by the
          rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf
          also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper;" -- "Not
          so the ungodly, not so."
        </p>
        <p>
          To explore the negative, we must take each clause of this sentence.
          The ungodly are not like a tree planted. If they may be compared to a
          tree at all, they are as trees "twice dead plucked up by the roots;"
          or if they are to be compared to anything that hath life, then are
          they like the tree in the desert which is planted there by a chance
          hand, which hath nought to nourish it. It is the peculiar
          characteristic of the Christian man, that he is like "a tree planted."
          That is to say, there is a special providence exercised in his
          position and in his culture. You all know the difference between a
          tree that is planted and a tree that is self-sown. The tree that is
          planted in the garden is visited by the husbandman. He digs about it;
          he dungs it; he trims it, prunes it, and looks for its fruit. It is an
          object of property and of special care. The wild tree in the forest,
          the tree which is self-sown upon the plain, no one owns, no one
          watches over it; no heart will sigh if the lightning flash shall
          shiver it; no tear will be wept if the blast should light upon it and
          all its leaves should wither. It is no man's property. It shelters no
          man's roof. No man careth for it. Let it die, why doth it stand there
          to suck nourishment from the soil and yield none again.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ungodly are, it is true, the subjects of a universal providence,
          even as everything is ordered of God; but the righteous have a special
          providence over them. They are trees planted. Everything which takes
          place works together for their good. The Lord their God is their
          guardian. He watches the earth that it should bring forth for them its
          fruit. The precious things of the heavens, the dew, and the deep that
          coucheth beneath, and the precious fruits brought forth by the sun,
          and the precious things put forth by the moon -- these are their
          heritage. He watcheth everything round about them. If pestilence stalk
          through the land, he permitteth not one of its shafts to hit, unless
          he seeth it is for good. If war ariseth, behold he stretches his aegis
          over his children; and if famine comes, they shall be fed, and in the
          days of scarcity they shall be satisfied. Is it not a glorious thing
          for the Christian to know that the very hairs of his head are all
          numbered, that the angels of God keep watch and ward over him; that
          the Lord is his shepherd, and therefore, he shall not want? I know
          this is a doctrine that often comforts me. Let what will happen, if I
          can but fall back upon the thought that there is a providence in
          everything, what do I need? A providence in the great and in the
          little there assuredly is to every child of God. It may be said of
          every tree of the Lord's right hand planting -- "I the Lord do keep
          it, and will water it every moment; lest any hurt it I will watch it
          night and day." Upon the righteous there are not only ten eyes, but
          there are all the eyes of the Omniscient ever fixed both by night and
          day. The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous. They are like the
          planted tree. Not so, ye that are ungodly, not so ye; there is no
          special providence for you. To whom will ye carry your troubles? Where
          is your shelter in the day of wrath? Where is your shield in the hour
          of battle? Who shall be your sun when darkness shall gather about you?
          Who shall comfort you when your troubles shall encompass you round?
          You have no eternal arm to lean upon. You have no compassionate heart
          to beat for you. You have no loving eye to watch you. You are left
          alone! alone! alone! like the heath in the desert, or like the forest
          tree which no man regardeth, until the time comes when the sharpened
          axe shall be lifted up, and the tree must fall. "Not so," then "the
          ungodly, not so." Tis a fearful negative the ungodly man is not the
          object of the special providence of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we must proceed. The righteous man is like a tree planted by the
          rivers of water. Now, a tree that is planted by the rivers of water
          sends out its roots, and they soon draw sufficient nourishment. The
          tree that is planted far away upon the arid desert hath its times of
          drought, it depends upon the casual thunder-cloud that sweeps over it,
          and distils the scanty drops of rain. But this tree planted by rivers
          of water hath a perennial supply. It knows no drought, no time of
          scarcity. Its roots have but to suck up the nourishment which pours
          itself lavishly there. "Not so the ungodly, not so." They have no such
          rivers from which to suck their joy, their comfort, and their life. As
          for the believer, come what may, he can any -- if earth shall fail
          him, then will he look to heaven. If man forsake him, then he looks to
          the divine man Christ Jesus. If the world should shake, his
          inheritance is on high. If everything should pass away, he hath a
          portion that can never be dissolved. He is planted not by brooks that
          may be dried up, far less in a desert, which only hath a scanty share,
          but by the rivers of water. Oh, my beloved brethren, you and I know
          something about what this means. We know what it is to suck up the
          promises, to drink of the rivers of Christ's fullness. We know what it
          is to partake and satisfy ourselves as with marrow and fatness. Well
          may we rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory, for our
          storehouse is inexhaustible, our riches can never be spent. We have
          wealth that cannot be counted a treasury that never can be drained.
          This is our glory, that we have a something to rely upon which can
          never fail us. We are trees planted by the rivers of water. Ah! but
          not so you that are ungodly, not so. Your days of drought shall come.
          You may rejoice now, but what will you do upon the bed of sickness,
          when fever shall make you toss from side-to-side, when head and heart
          shall be racked with anguish, when death shall stare upon you, and
          shall glaze your eyes? What will ye do when ye come into the swellings
          of Jordan? You have joys to-day, but where will be your joys then? You
          have wells now, but what will you do when these are all stopped up,
          when these shall all fail, when your skin-bottles are dried when your
          broken cisterns have emptied themselves of their last drop -- what
          will ye do then, ye ungodly? Surely, this negative is full of awful
          threatenings to you. You may have a little mirth and merriment now,
          you may enjoy a little excitement at present, but what will ye do when
          the hot wind comes upon you -- the wind of tribulation? And above all,
          what will you do when the chilling blast of death shall freeze your
          blood? Ah, where, oh, where will you then look? You will look no
          longer to friends, nor to the comforts of home. You cannot find in the
          hour of death consolation on the bosom of the most loving wife, you
          will be quite unable then to find peace in all your riches or your
          treasures. As for your past life, however good it may seem, if you are
          ungodly, you will find no comfort in the retrospect; and as for the
          future, you will find no comfort in the prospect, for there will be
          for you nothing but "a fearful looking for of judgment and of fiery
          indignation." Oh, my ungodly friends, I beseech you, think upon this
          matter, for if there were nothing worse, the first sentence of my text
          sounds like the trumpets of doom, and hath in it bitterness like the
          vials of the Revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again we must go forward. It is said of the righteous man, that he
          "bringeth forth his fruit in his season." "Not so the ungodly, not
          so," -- they bring forth no fruit; or if there be here and there a
          shrivelled grape upon the vine, it is brought forth in the wrong
          season when the genial heat of the sun cannot ripen it, and therefore
          it is sear and worthless. Many people imagine that if they do not
          commit positive sin they are all right. Now let me give you a little
          sermon in the midst of my sermon. Here is the text: "Curse ye Meroz,
          said the angel of the Lord, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof;
          because they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord
          against the mighty." First, what has Meroz done? Nothing. Secondly, is
          Meroz cursed? Yes; cursed bitterly. What for? -- for doing nothing.
          Yes, for doing nothing. "Curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof,"
          for what they did not do, "because they came not to the help of the
          Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty." Did Meroz fight
          against God? No. Did Meroz put on a buckler and lay bold on shield and
          spear and go forth against the Most High? No. What did Meroz do?
          Nothing. And is it cursed? Yes, cursed bitterly, with the inhabitants
          thereof "because they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of
          the Lord against the mighty." Preach that sermon to yourselves when
          you get home. Draw it out at length, and perhaps while you are sitting
          down you will say, "Meroz! why that is myself. I don't fight against
          God, I am no enemy to Christ, I do not persecute his people, in fact I
          even love his ministers, I love to go up and hear the Word preached. I
          should not be happy if I spent my Sunday anywhere but in God's house.
          But still that must mean me, for I do not go up to the help of the
          Lord against the mighty.' I do nothing. I am an idle do-nothing. I am
          a fruitless tree." Ah, then remember you are cursed, and cursed
          bitterly too. Not for what you do, but for what you don't do. So here
          it is one of the sad curses of the ungodly -- that they bring forth no
          fruit in their season. Why look at many of you. What is the good of
          you in this world? With regard to your families, you are their
          main-stay and prop. God bless you in your work, and may you train up
          your children well. But as to the church, what good are you? You
          occupy a seat, you have had it these years; how do you know but that
          you have been occupying a seat which might have been the place where
          some other sinner would have been converted had he been there? It is
          true you sit and hear the sermon; yes but what of that, if that sermon
          shall add to your condemnation? It is true that you make one among
          many, but what if you should be a black sheep In the midst of the
          flock! What are you doing for Christ? Of what value are you? Have you
          added one stone to his spiritual temple? Have you done as much as the
          poor woman who broke the alabaster box upon his head? You have done
          nothing for him. He has nourished you and brought you up, and you have
          done nothing for him. "The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his
          master's crib," but you do not know, you do not consider. Behold, the
          Lord hath a controversy with you this day, not for what you have done,
          but for what you have not done. He has sent you the ministry; you are
          invited every Sabbath-day. With the tears running down my cheeks have
          l warned you and invited you. You are hearing the Word continually;
          you are enjoying privileges. God is feeding you in his providence,
          clothing you in his compassion, and you are doing nothing for him. You
          are a cumberer of the ground, bringing forth no fruit at all. O my
          dear hearer, I beseech thee lay this to heart, for this is a curse as
          well as a sign to you. It is not only a bad trait in thy character,
          but it is a curse from God. Thou art ungodly, and therefore fruitless.
          Thou lovest him not, therefore thou art useless. Thou trustest not in
          Christ, and therefore thou art not like the tree which "bringeth forth
          his fruit in his season."
        </p>
        <p>
          Pass on to the description. His leaf also shall not wither. Not so the
          ungodly, not so." The ungodly man's leaf shall wither. I see before me
          this day many proofs that God's promise is verified to his people.
          Look round, and behold what a large number of gray-headed men assemble
          every Lord's day to hear the Word. There are many of them who loved
          Christ in their youth. Then they had "a joy unspeakable and full of
          glory" in making a profession of his dear name; and now they have come
          into what men call the sear and yellow leaf of life, but they do not
          find it so, for they still bring forth fruit in old age, they are
          still fat and flourishing to show that the Lord is upright. Their leaf
          has not withered, they are just as active in the cause of Christ as
          ever they were, and perhaps ten times more happy. Instead of bringing
          forth no fruit, they bring forth richer and more luscious clusters
          than ever they did before. Walking in the midst of the younger ones
          they shine as lights in the midst of the world; or to return to the
          simile, they are like trees whose branches hang down by reason of the
          abundance of their fruit, even as their heads bow down by reason of
          the abundance of their years. What a mercy it is, dear brethren, to
          have Christ for your portion in youth, and such a Christ too as will
          last us all our life long. To see good old Rowland Hill preaching when
          he was tottering on the borders of the grave and talking of the
          faithfulness of Christ -- what a glorious sight! There was a proof!
          That leaf did not wither. Was there ever a tree like this that would
          maintain its greenness eighty years and yet not wither? Was there ever
          a religion like this that would make the old men youthful and make
          their tottering feet leap for joy? And yet this is the religion of
          Christ. Our leaf withers not. But oh, "Not so the ungodly, not so."
          Your leaf shall wither; at least when they that look out of the
          windows are darkened, when the grinders fail because they are few,
          when your days of old age shall come upon you, and the grasshopper
          shall be a burden, if not before, shall your leaf wither. But how many
          there are whose leaves do wither! There comes a blight from God and
          the tree which looked once green becomes brown and dead, and at last
          it blackens and has to be removed. We have seen such in our lives. Men
          that seemed to be getting on in this world, rich and happy, and
          respected by almost everybody, but they had no solid background, they
          had no rock to stand on, no God to trust to. I have seen them
          spreading themselves like a green bay tree, and I have often envied
          them as the Psalmist did, but "I looked and lo they were not," I
          passed by and lo there was not so much as a stump of them left, God
          had cursed their habitation; as a dream when one awaketh, their image
          had been despised, as the wax before the fire, they had melted away;
          like the fat of rams had they been consumed; into smoke did they
          consume away. "Not so the ungodly, not so," says the text, and surely
          experience proves it, the ungodly man's leaf must and shall wither.
          And then it is added concerning the righteous man," whatsoever he
          doeth, shall prosper." Godly men, it is true have many tribulations,
          but I am not sure that they have more than the wicked. I do think that
          when a man is converted he will find it to be true that religion's
          "ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace," and he
          has a better hope of even worldly prosperity when he becomes a
          Christian, than the ungodly man has. Christian habits are the best
          business habits, if men would but believe it. When a man mixes his
          religion with his business and allows every act of his life to be
          guided by it, he stands the best chance in this world, it I may be
          allowed such a secular expression, for "Honesty is the best policy "
          after all, and Christianity is the best honesty. The sharp cutting
          competition of the times may be called honesty -- it is only called so
          down here, it is not called so up there, for there is a good deal of
          cheating in it. Honesty in the highest sense -- Christian honesty --
          will be found after all to be the best policy in everything, and there
          will ordinarily be a prosperity, even worldly prosperity, attending a
          good man in the patient industrious pursuit of his calling. But if he
          does not have that success he craves, still there is one thing he
          knows, he would have it if it were best for him. I often know
          Christian men talk in this fashion, "Well, I do but very little
          business," says one, "but I have enough coming in to live upon
          comfortably and happy. I never cared much for push and competition; I
          never felt that I was fit for it, and I sometimes thank God that I
          never thrust myself out into the rough stream, but that I was content
          to keep along shore." And I have marked this one thing, and as a
          matter of fact I know it cannot be disproved, that many such
          humble-minded men are the very best of Christians, they live the
          happiest lives, and whatsoever they do certainly does prosper, for
          they get what they expected though they did not expect much, and they
          get what they want though their wants are not very large. They are not
          going in for anything very great, and therefore they do not come out
          plucked and empty handed, but they just hold on their way, looking to
          Providence constantly, for their supplies, and they have all they
          require; and whatsoever they do, prospers. But they can say too,
          rusts. If he spends it, it does him little service. The man that hath
          no God, hath no prosperity. Is he fat -- he fattens for the slaughter!
          Is he in adversity -- behold the first drops of the fated storm have
          begun to fall on him. To the ungodly man there is nothing good in this
          life. The sweet that he tasteth is the sweetness of poison. That which
          looketh fair is but as paint upon the harlot's face, beneath there is
          loathsomeness and disease. There may be a greenness and a verdure upon
          the mound, but within there lies the rotting carcase, the
          loathsomeness of corruption. Whatsoever the believer doth, it shall
          prosper. "Not so the ungodly, not so." Surely this first part of my
          text is quite bad enough -- to have the gate of blessedness shut
          against you, to have the promises denied you, to be without the
          blessing which is given to the godly -- this punishment of the lost
          surely were enough to make us start in dismay.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now very briefly upon the second point. Listen awhile to THE
          TERRIBLE COMPARISON. "The ungodly are like the chaff." They are not
          like the wild tree, for that hath life, and they are dead in sin. They
          are not compared here even to the dead tree plucked up by the roots,
          for that may be of some service. Floating down the stream, the hand of
          poverty may recall it from the water, and kindle its fire and relieve
          its cold. They are not even like the heath in the desert, for it hath
          some uses, and tends to cheer the arid waste. They are like nothing
          that hath life, nothing that is of any value. They are here said to be
          like chaff which the wind driveth away. Now you will at once see how
          terrible is this figure, if you look at it a moment. They are like
          chaff. Chaff envelopes good corn, but when the wheat is cut down and
          carried into the barn, the corn alone is useful, the grain alone is
          looked at, and that chaff which has grown side by side with the good
          living wheat, is now become utterly useless, and is to be separated
          and driven away. And the wicked are compared to chaff -- think for a
          moment, of two or three reasons. First, because they are sapless and
          fruitless. Chaff hath no sap of life in itself. It is of no use, of no
          service. Men do but desire to get rid of it. They take the fan into
          their hands that they may thoroughly purge their floor. They cast up
          the wheat before the wind with the winnowing shovel, that the breath
          of the air may blow away the chaff, and leave the wheat pure. All that
          they care for the chaff is that they may get rid of it, that it may be
          blown away to waste, for it is sapless and fruitless. Then again you
          notice that it is light and unstable. The wind sweeps through the
          wheat, the wheat remains unmoved, the chaff flies away. When cast up
          in the shovel, the wheat soon finds its place, and returns to the spot
          from which it has been lifted up; but the chaff is light, it has no
          stability. Every eddying wind, every breath moves it and carries it
          away. So are the ungodly. They have nothing stable; they are light,
          they are but as the froth upon the water; they are but as a bubble on
          the breaker, seen to day and gone, here and there, and then carried
          away for ever. Again, the wicked are compared to chaff because it is
          base and worthless. Who will buy it? Who cares for it? In the East at
          least it is of no good, no use whatever can be made of it. They are
          content to burn it up and get rid of it, and the sooner they are rid
          of it, the better pleased are they. So is it with the wicked. They are
          good for nothing, useless in this world, useless in the world to come.
          They are the dross, the offal of all creation. The man who is ungodly,
          however much he may value himself, is as nothing in the estimation of
          God. Put a gold chain round his neck, put a star upon his breast, put
          a crown upon his head, and what is he but a crowned heap of dust,
          useless, perhaps worse than useless. Base in God's sight, he tramples
          them beneath his feet. The potter's vessel hath some service, and even
          the broken potsherd might be used. Some Job might scrape himself with
          it. But what shall be done with the chaff? It is of no use anywhere,
          and no one careth for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          See, then, your value, my hearers, if you fear not God. Cast up your
          accounts and look at yourselves in the right light. You think,
          perhaps, that you are good for much, but God saith you are good for
          nothing. You are "like the chaff which the wind driveth away." I
          linger no more upon this comparison, but choose, rather to dwell upon
          the third head, which was this: --
        </p>
        <p>
          III. THE AWFUL PROPHECY contained in the Verse -- "They are like the
          chaff which the wind driveth away." How near the chaff is to the
          grain! It is, in fact, its envelope; they grow together. My hearers, I
          wish to speak now very pointedly and personally. How nearly related
          are the ungodly to the righteous! One of you, it may be, now present,
          an ungodly man, is the father of a godly child. You have been to that
          child what the chaff is to the wheat; you have nourished the child --
          cherished it in your bosom; you have been wrapt about it like the
          chaff about the grain. Is it not an awful thing for you to think that
          you should have been in such close relationship to a child of God, but
          that in the great day of division you must be separated from it? The
          chaff cannot be taken into heaven with the wheat. I point to another.
          You are the son of a godly mother; you have grown up at her knee. She
          taught you, when you were but a little one, to say your little prayer,
          and to sing the little hymn,
        </p>
        <p>"Gentle Jesus, meek and mild, look upon a little child."</p>
        <p>
          That mother looked upon you as her joy and her comfort. She is gone
          now. But you were once to her what the chaff is to the wheat. You
          grew, as it were, upon the same stock, you were of the same family,
          and her heart was wholly wrapt up in you. You were her joy and her
          comfort here below. Does it not cause you one pang of regret that,
          dying as you are, you must everlastingly be separated from her? Where
          she is you can never come. Mayhap, too, I have here a mother who has
          lost several infants; she has been to those infants what the chaff is
          to the wheat -- wrapt up in her bosom for a little while she fondled
          them; and they, God's good wheat, have been gathered into the garner,
          and there they are now in Jesu's floor. There are their little spirits
          rejoicing before the throne of the Most High. The mother who is left
          thinks not of it, but she is the mother of angels, and, perhaps,
          herself a child of hell. Ah, mother! what think you of this? Is this'
          separation from your child eternal? Will you be content to be found at
          God's great winnowing-day, the chaff, and will you be driven from your
          children? Shall you see them in heaven -- them in heaven, and
          yourselves then cast out for ever? Can you bear the thought? Hath your
          heart become brutish? Is your soul harder than a nether mill-stone?
          Surely, if it be not, the thought of your present intimate connection
          with God's people, and of your sure separation, will make you tremble.
          And oh! my hearers here are some of you sitting side by side with the
          godly. You sing as they sing, you hear as they hear. Perhaps you
          assist the outward wants of the church. You are to the church just
          what the chaff is to the wheat. You are the outward husk, the
          congregation which surrounds the inner living nucleus of the church.
          And must it be -- must you be separated from us? Are you content to go
          from the songs of the saints to the shrieks of the doomed? Will you go
          from the great convocation of the righteous to the last general
          assembly of the destroyed and cursed in hell? The thought checks my
          voice. I must speak slowly on this matter for awhile. Well, dear
          brethren, well I know that this thought used to be dreadful to me. My
          mother said to me once, after she had long prayed for me, and had come
          to the conviction that I was hopeless, "Ah," said she "My son, if at
          the last great day you are condemned, remember your mother will say
          Amen to your condemnation." That stung me to the quick. Must the
          mother that brought me forth and that loved me say "Amen" to my being
          condemned at last? Yet such things must be. Doth not the wheat say
          Amen to the chaff being blown away? Is it not in fact the very prayer
          of the wheat that it may be separated from the chaff? and surely when
          that prayer is heard, and awfully answered, the wheat must say Amen to
          the chaff being blown away into fire unquenchable. Think, my dear
          hearers, think again. And must it be -- must I bid farewell to her I
          love, who served the Lord in spirit. Must I see her body committed to
          the grave, and as I stand there must I bid her a last, a final
          farewell? Must I be for ever separated from her, because I fear not
          God, neither regard him, and therefore cannot have a portion amongst
          the Lord's chosen ones? What, have you lost your relatives for ever?
          Are your pious fathers and mothers buried in a "sure and certain hope"
          to which you are strangers? Will you never sing the song of rejoicing
          with them in heaven? Is there never to be another salutation? Is death
          a gulf that cannot be bridged to you? Oh, I hope it is the joy of some
          of us to know we shall meet many of our kindred above, and as we have
          lost one after another this has been our sweet consolation they are
          gone and we shall soon follow them; they are not lost but gone before;
          they are buried as to their flesh, but their souls are in Paradise,
          and we shall be there also; and, when we have seen our Saviour's face
          and have rejoiced in that glorious vision, then shall we see them
          also, and have deeper and purer fellowship with them than we ever had
          before in all the days of our lives. Well, here is a sad prophecy! The
          wicked are "like the chaff which the wind driveth away."
        </p>
        <p>
          But you will remark that the awful character of my text does not
          appear upon the surface. They "are like the chaff which the wind
          driveth away." Where -- where -- where? Where are they driven? The man
          is in health; the sun shines, the sky is calm, the world is still
          about him. Suddenly there is seen a little cloud the size of a man's
          hand. A little signal overtakes him. The hurricane begins to rise but
          first it is but a faint breath. The wicked man feels the cold air
          blowing on him, but he screens it with the physician, and he thinks
          that surely he shall live. The storm is on. God hath decreed it, and
          man cannot stay it. The breath becomes a gale, the gale a wind, the
          wind a storm, the storm a howling hurricane. His soul is swept away.
          To go to heaven on angels' wings is a glorious thing; but to be swept
          out of this world with the wicked is an awful thing -- to be carried,
          not on wings of cherubs, but on the eagle wings of the wind; to be
          borne, not by yon songsters up to their celestial seats, but to be
          carried away in the midst of a howling tempest by grim fiends. The
          wicked are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. Do you not
          catch the thought? I do not know how to bring out the fullness of its
          poetry -- the great storm sweeping man from the place on which he
          stands. He is driven away. And now cannot your thoughts go further on
          while I again repeat the question, Whither is he driven? Ah! Whither
          is he driven? I see him driven from the solid shore of life. He is
          carried away. But --
        </p>
        <p>"In vain my fancy strives to paint the moment after death."</p>
        <p>
          I cannot tell you into what state that soul at once enters, that is to
          say, I cannot tell you by any guess of my own -- that were frivolous,
          and were to play with a solemn matter; but I can tell you one thing,
          Jesus Christ himself hath said it -- "He shall burn up the chaff with
          unquenchable fire." You die, but you die not. You depart, but you
          depart to fire that never shall be quenched. I will not dwell upon the
          topic. I return again to ask the question -- "Who among us shall dwell
          with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting
          burnings?" Who here is prepared to make his bed in hell? Who shall lie
          down and rest for ever in that lake of fire? You must, my hearers, if
          you are ungodly, except you repent. Are there none of you behind me
          there, who have been living without Christ, and without hope in the
          world? Are there none of you? Surely there are some such. I beseech
          you, think of your destiny -- death, and after death the judgment. The
          wind, and after the wind the whirlwind, and after the whirlwind the
          fire, and after the fire nothing -- for ever for ever, for ever lost,
          cast away, where ray of hope can never come; where eye of mercy can
          never look upon you, and hand of grace can never reach you. I beseech
          you, oh, I beseech you by the living God, before whom you stand this
          day, tremble and repent. "Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye
          perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little." "Tophet
          is ordained of old, yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it
          deep and large; the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of
          the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it." "Turn ye, turn
          ye, why will ye die O house of Israel?" "Let the wicked forsake his
          way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the
          Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will
          abundantly pardon."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, I pray God the Holy Spirit to touch some ungodly hearts now, and
          make you think. And remember my dear hearers, if there be in your
          bosoms this morning one desire towards Christ, cherish it, blow the
          little spark till it comes to a flame. If your heart melts ever so
          little this morning, I beseech you resist not, quench not the heavenly
          influence. Yield up yourselves and remember the sweet text of last
          Sunday morning, "whosoever will, let him come and take the water of
          life freely." I thunder at you, but it is to bring you to Christ. Oh
          that you would but come to him! Oh poor hearts would that ye did but
          feel! Oh, that ye knew how to weep for yourselves as I could weep for
          you now. Oh, that ye knew what a fearful thing it will be to be cast
          away for ever! Why will ye die? Is there anything pleasing in
          destruction? Is sin so luscious to you that you will burn in hell for
          ever for it? What, is Christ so hard a master that you will not love
          him? Is his cross so ugly that ye will not look towards it? Oh, I
          beseech you by him whose heart is love, the crucified Redeemer, who
          now speaks through me this morning, and in me weeps over you, I
          beseech you look to him and be saved, for he came into the world to
          seek and to save that which was lost, and him that cometh to him he
          will in nowise cast out, for "he is able also to save them to the
          uttermost that come unto God by him."
        </p>
        <p>
          To-day, O Spirit bring sinners to thyself. I exhort you, sinners, lay
          hold on Christ. Touch the hem of his garment now. Behold, he hangs
          before you on the cross. As Moses lifted up the serpent in the
          wilderness. even so is Jesus lifted up. Look, I beseech you, look and
          live. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved. As
          though God did beseech you by me, I pray you in Christ's stead be ye
          reconciled to God. And O may the Spirit make my appeal effectual! May
          angels rejoice this day over sinners saved and brought to know the
          Lord.<br />
