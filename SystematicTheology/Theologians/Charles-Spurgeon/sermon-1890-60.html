          In the fifteenth year of the Sovereign Ruler Trajan Cæsar, and in the
          third year of King Abgar the Seventh, which is the year 416 of the
          kingdom of Alexander king of the Greeks, and in the priesthood of
          Sharbil and Barsamya, Trajan Cæsar commanded the governors of the
          countries under his dominion that sacrifices and libations should be
          increased in all the cities of their administration, and that those
          who did not sacrifice should be seized and delivered over to stripes,
          and to the tearing of combs, and to bitter inflictions of all kinds of
          tortures, and should afterwards receive the punishment of the sword.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, when the command arrived at the town of Edessa of the Parthians,
          there was a great festival, on the eighth of Nisan, on the third day
          of the week: the whole city was gathered together by the great altar
          which was in the middle of the town, opposite the Record office, all
          the gods having been brought together, and decorated, and sitting in
          honour, both Nebu and Bel together with their fellows. And all the
          priests were offering incense of spices and libations, and an odour of
          sweetness was diffusing itself around, and sheep and oxen were being
          slaughtered, and the sound of the harp and the drum was heard in the
          whole town. And Sharbil was chief and ruler of all the priests; and he
          was honoured above all his fellows, and was clad in splendid and
          magnificent vestments; and a headband embossed with figures of gold
          was set upon his head; and at the bidding of his word everything that
          he ordered was done. And Abgar the king, son of the gods, was standing
          at the head of the people. And they obeyed Sharbil, because he drew
          nearer to all the gods than any of his fellows, and as being the one
          who according to that which he had heard from the gods returned an
          answer to every man.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, while these things were being done by the command of the king,
          Barsamya, the bishop of the Christians, went up to Sharbil, he and
          Tiridath the elder and Shalula the deacon; and he said to Sharbil, the
          high priest: The King Christ, to whom belong heaven and earth, will
          demand an account at thy hands of all these souls against whom thou
          art sinning, and whom thou art misleading, and turning away from the
          God of verity and of truth to idols that are made and deceitful, which
          are not able to do anything with their hands -- moreover also thou
          hast no pity on thine own soul, which is destitute of the true life of
          God; and thou declarest to this people that the dumb idols talk with
          thee; and, as if thou wert listening to something from them, thou
          puttest thine ear near to one and another of them, and sayest to this
          people: The god Nebu bade me say to you, "On account of your
          sacrifices and oblations I cause peace in this your country;" and: Bel
          saith, "I cause great plenty in your land;" and those who hear this
          from thee do not discern that thou art greatly deceiving them --
          because "they have a mouth and speak not, and they have eyes and see
          not with them;" it is ye who bear up them, and not they who bear up
          you, as ye suppose; and it is ye who set tables before them, and not
          they who feed you. And now be persuaded by me touching that which I
          say to thee and advise thee. If thou be willing to hearken to me,
          abandon idols made, and worship God the Maker of all things, and His
          Son Jesus Christ. Do not, because He put on a body and became man and
          was stretched out on the cross of death, be ashamed of Him and refuse
          to worship Him: for, all these things which He endured -- it was for
          the salvation of men and for their deliverance. For this One who put
          on a body is God, the Son of God, Son of the essence of His Father,
          and Son of the nature of Him who begat Him: for He is the adorable
          brightness of His Godhead, and is the glorious manifestation of His
          majesty, and together with His Father He existed from eternity and
          from everlasting, His arm, and His right hand, and His power, and His
          wisdom, and His strength, and the living Spirit which is from Him, the
          Expiator and Sanctifier of all His worshippers. These are the things
          which Palut taught us, with whom thy venerable self was acquainted;
          and thou knowest that Palut was the disciple of Addæus the apostle.
          Abgar the king also, who was older than this Abgar, who himself
          worshippeth idols as well as thou, he too believed in the King Christ,
          the Son of Him whom thou callest Lord of all the gods. For it is
          forbidden to Christians to worship anything that is made, and is a
          creature, and in its nature is not God: even as ye worship idols made
          by men, who themselves also are made and created. Be persuaded,
          therefore, by these things which I have said to thee, which things are
          the belief of the Church: for I know that all this population are
          looking to thee, and I am well assured that, if thou be persuaded,
          many also will persuaded with thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said to him: Very acceptable to me are these thy words which
          thou hast spoken before me; yea, exceedingly acceptable are they to
          me. But, as for me, I know that I am outcast from all these things,
          and there is no longer any remedy for me. And, now that hope is cut
          off from me, why weariest thou thyself about a man dead and buried,
          for whose death there is no hope of resuscitation? For I am slain by
          paganism, and am become a dead man, the property of the Evil One: in
          sacrifices and libations of imposture have I consumed all the days of
          my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, when Barsamya the bishop heard these things, he fell down before
          his feet, and said to him: There is hope for those who turn, and
          healing for those that are wounded. I myself will be surety to thee
          for the abundant mercies of the Son Christ: that He will pardon thee
          all the sins which thou hast committed against Him, in that thou hast
          worshipped and honoured His creatures instead of Himself. For that
          Gracious One, who extended Himself on the cross of death, will not
          withhold His grace from the souls that comply with His precepts and
          take refuge in His kindness which has been displayed towards us. Like
          as He did towards the robber, so is He able to do to thee, and also to
          those who are like thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said to him: Thou, like a skilful physician, who suffers pain
          from the pain of the afflicted, hast done well in that thou hast been
          concerned about me. But at present, because it is the festival to-day
          of this people, of every one of them, I cannot go down with thee
          to-day to the church. Depart thou, and go down with honour; and
          to-morrow at night I will come down to thee: I too have henceforth
          renounced for myself the gods made with hands, and I will confess the
          Lord Christ, the Maker of all men.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the next day Sharbil arose and went down to Barsamya by night, he
          and Babai his sister; and he was received by the whole church. And he
          said to them: Offer for me prayer and supplication, that Christ may
          forgive me all the sins that I have committed against Him in all this
          long course of years. And, because they were in dread of the
          persecutors, they arose and gave him the seal of salvation, whilst he
          confessed the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, when all the city had heard that he was gone down to the church,
          there began to be a consternation among the multitude; and they arose
          and went down to him, and saw him clad in the fashion of the
          Christians. And he said to them: May the Son Christ forgive me all the
          sins that I have committed against you, and all in which I made you
          think that the gods talked with me, whereas they did not talk; and,
          forasmuch as I have been to you a cause of abomination, may I now be
          to you a cause of good: instead of worshipping, as formerly, idols
          made with hands, may ye henceforth worship God the Maker. And, when
          they had heard these things, there remained with him a great
          congregation of men and of women; and Labu also, and Hafsai, and
          Barcalba, and Avida, chief persons of the city. They all said to
          Sharbil: Henceforth we also renounce that which thou hast renounced,
          and we confess the King Christ, whom thou hast confessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Lysanias, the judge of the country, when he heard that Sharbil had
          done this, sent by night and carried him off from the church. And
          there went up with him many Christians. And he sat down, to hear him
          and to judge him, before the altar which is in the middle of the town,
          where he used to sacrifice to the gods. And he said to him: Wherefore
          hast thou renounced the gods, whom thou didst worship, and to whom
          thou didst sacrifice, and to whom thou wast made chief of the priests,
          and lo! dost today confess Christ, whom thou didst formerly deny? For
          see how those Christians, to whom thou art gone, renounce not that
          which they have held, like as thou hast renounced that in which thou
          wast born. If thou art assured of the gods, how is it that thou hast
          renounced them this day? But, if on the contrary thou art not assured,
          as thou declarest concerning them, how is it that thou didst once
          sacrifice to them and worship them?
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: When I was blinded in my mind, I worshipped that which I
          knew not; but to-day, inasmuch as I have obtained the clear eyes of
          the mind, it is henceforth impossible that I should stumble at carved
          stones, or that I should any longer be the cause of stumbling to
          others. For it is a great disgrace to him whose eyes are open, if he
          goes and falls into the pit of destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Because thou hast been priest of the venerable gods,
          and hast been partaker of the mystery of those whom the mighty
          emperors worship, I will have patience with thee, in order that thou
          mayest be persuaded by me, and not turn away from the service of the
          gods; but, if on the contrary thou shalt not be persuaded by me, by
          those same gods whom thou hast renounced I swear that, even as on a
          man that is a murderer, so will I inflict tortures on thee, and will
          avenge on thee the wrong done to the gods, whom thou hast rebelled
          against and renounced, and also the insult which thou hast poured upon
          them; nor will I leave untried any kind of tortures which I will not
          inflict on thee; and, like as thine honour formerly was great, so will
          I make thine ignominy great this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: I too, on my part, am not content that thou shouldest
          look upon me as formerly, when I worshipped gods made with hands; but
          look thou upon me to-day and question me as a Christian man renouncing
          idols and confessing the King Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: How is it that thou art not afraid of the emperors,
          nor moved to shame by those who are listening to thy trial, that thou
          sayest, "I am a Christian"? But promise that thou wilt sacrifice to
          the gods, according to thy former custom, so that thy honour may be
          great, as formerly -- lest I make to tremble at thee all those who
          have believed like thyself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Of the King of kings I am afraid, but at any king of
          earth I tremble not, nor yet at thy threats towards me, which lo! thou
          utterest against the worshippers of Christ: whom I confessed
          yesterday, and lo! I am brought to trial for His sake to-day, like as
          He Himself was brought to trial for the sake of sinners like me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Although thou have no pity on thyself, still I will
          have pity on thee, and refrain from cutting off those hands of thine
          with which thou hast placed incense before the gods, and from stopping
          with thy blood those ears of thine which have heard their mysteries,
          and thy tongue which has interpreted and explained to us their secret
          things. Of those gods lo! I am afraid, and I have pity on thee. But,
          if thou continue thus, those gods be my witnesses that I will have no
          pity on thee!
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: As a man who art afraid of the emperors and tremblest at
          idols, have thou no pity on me. For, as for me, I know not what thou
          sayest: therefore also is my mind not shaken or terrified by those
          things which thou sayest. For by thy judgments shall all they escape
          from the judgment to come who do not worship that which is not God in
          its own nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Let him be scourged with thongs, because he has dared
          to answer me thus, and has resisted the command of the emperors, and
          has not appreciated the honour which the gods conferred on him:
          inasmuch as, lo! he has renounced them.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he was scourged by ten men, who laid hold on him, according to the
          command of the judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Thou art not aware of the scourging of justice in that
          world which is to come. For thou wilt cease, and thy judgments also
          will pass away; but justice will not pass away, nor will its
          retributions come to an end.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Thou art so intoxicated with this same Christianity,
          that thou dost not even know before whom thou art judged, and by whom
          it is that thou art scourged -- even by those who formerly held thee
          in honour, and paid adoration to thy priesthood in the gods. Why dost
          thou hate honour, and love this ignominy? For, although thou speakest
          contrary to the law, yet I myself cannot turn aside from the laws of
          the emperors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: As thou takest heed not to depart from the laws of the
          emperors, and if moreover thou depart from them thou knowest what
          command they will give concerning thee, so do I also take heed not to
          decline from the law of Him who said, "Thou shalt not worship any
          image, nor any likeness;" and therefore will I not sacrifice to idols
          made with hands: for long enough was the time in which I sacrificed to
          them, when I was in ignorance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Bring not upon thee punishment in addition to the
          punishment which thou hast already brought upon thee. Enough is it for
          thee to have said, "I will not sacrifice:" do not dare to insult the
          gods, by calling them manufactured idols whom even the emperors
          honour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: But, if on behalf of the emperors, who are far away and
          not near at hand and not conscious of those who treat their commands
          with contempt, thou biddest me sacrifice, how is it that on behalf of
          idols, who lo! are present and are seen, but see not, thou biddest me
          sacrifice? Why, hereby thou hast declared before all thy attendants
          that, because they have a mouth and speak not, lo! thou art become a
          pleader for them: dumb idols "to whom their makers shall be like," and
          "every one that trusteth upon them" shall be like thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: It was not for this that thou wast called before me --
          that, instead of paying the honour which is due, thou shouldst despise
          the emperors. But draw near to the gods and sacrifice, and have pity
          on thyself, thou self-despiser!
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Why should it be requisite for thee to ask me many
          questions, after that which I have said to thee: "I will not
          sacrifice"? Thou hast called me a self-despiser? But would that from
          my childhood I had had this mind and had thus despised myself, which
          was perishing!
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Hang him up, and tear him with combs on his sides. --
          And while he was thus torn he cried aloud and said: It is for the sake
          of Christ, who has secretly caused His light to arise upon the
          darkness of my mind. And, when he had thus spoken, the judge commanded
          again that he should be torn with combs on his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: It is better that thou shouldest inflict tortures upon
          me for not sacrificing, than that I should be judged there for having
          sacrificed to the work of men's hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Let his body be bent backwards, and let straps be tied
          to his hands and his feet; and, when he has been bent backwards, let
          him be scourged on his belly.
        </p>
        <p>
          And they scourged him in this manner, according to the command of the
          judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he commanded that he should go up to the prison, and that he
          should be cast into a dark dungeon. And the executioners, and the
          Christians who had come up with him from the church, carried him,
          because he was not able to walk upon his feet in consequence of his
          having been bent backwards. And he was in the gaol many days.
        </p>
        <p>
          But on the second of Ilul, on the third day of the week, the judge
          arose and went down to his judgment-hall by night; and the whole body
          of his attendants was with him; and he commanded the keeper of the
          prison, and they brought him before him. And the judge said to him:
          This long while hast thou been in prison: what has been thy
          determination concerning those things on which thou wast questioned
          before me? Dost thou consent to minister to the gods according to thy
          former custom, agreeably to the command of the emperors?
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: This has been my determination in the prison, that that
          with which I began before thee, I will finish even to the last; nor
          will I play false with my word. For I will not again confess idols,
          which I have renounced; nor will I renounce the King Christ, whom I
          have confessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Hang him up by his right hand, because he has
          withdrawn it from the gods that he may not again offer incense with
          it, until his hand with which he ministered to the gods be dislocated,
          because he persists in this saying of his.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, while he was suspended by his hand, they asked him and said to
          him: Dost thou consent to sacrifice to the gods? But he was not able
          to return them an answer, on account of the dislocation of his arm.
          And the judge commanded, and they loosed him and took him down. But he
          was not able to bring his arm up to his side, until the executioners
          pressed it and brought it up to his side.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Put on incense, and go whithersoever thou wilt, and no
          one shall compel thee to be a priest again. But, if thou wilt not, I
          will show thee tortures bitterer than these.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: As for gods that made not the heavens and the earth, may
          they perish from under these heavens! But thou, menace me not with
          words of threatening; but, instead of words, show upon me the deeds of
          threatening, that I hear thee not again making mention of the
          detestable name of gods!
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Let him be branded with the brand of bitter fire
          between his eyes and upon his cheeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the executioners did so, until the smell of the branding reeked
          forth in the midst of the judgment-hall: but he refused to sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Thou hast heard for thyself from me, when I said to thee
          "Thou art not aware of the smoke of the roasting of the fire which is
          prepared for those who, like thee, confess idols made by hands, and
          deny the living God, after thy fashion."
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Who taught thee all these things, that thou shouldest
          speak before me thus -- a man who was a friend of the gods and an
          enemy of Christ, whereas, lo! thou art become his advocate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Christ whom I have confessed, He it is that hath taught
          me to speak thus. But there needeth not that I should be His advocate,
          for His own mercies are eloquent advocates for guilty ones like me,
          and these will avail to plead on my behalf in the day when the
          sentences shall be eternal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Let him be hanged up, and let him be torn with combs
          upon his former wounds; also let salt and vinegar be rubbed into the
          wounds upon his sides. Then he said to him: Renounce not the gods whom
          thou didst formerly confess.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Have pity on me and spare me again from saying that
          there be gods, and powers, and fates, and nativities. On the contrary,
          I confess one God, who made the heavens, and the earth, and the seas,
          and all that is therein; and the Son who is from Him, the King Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: It is not about this that thou art questioned before
          me -- viz.: what is the belief of the Christians which thou hast
          confessed; but this is what I said to thee, "Renounce not those gods
          to whom thou wast made priest."
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Where is that wisdom of thine and of the emperors of
          whom thou makest thy boast, that ye worship the work of the hands of
          the artificers and confess them, whilst the artificers themselves, who
          made the idols, ye insult by the burdens and imposts which ye lay upon
          them? The artificer standeth up at thy presence, to do honour to thee;
          and thou standest up in the presence of the work of the artificer, and
          dost honour it and worship it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Thou art not the man to call others to account for
          these things; but from thyself a strict account is demanded, as to the
          cause for which thou hast renounced the gods, and refusest to offer
          them incense like thy fellow-priests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Death on account of this is true life: those who confess
          the King Christ, He also will confess before His glorious Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Let lighted candles be brought, and let them be passed
          round about his face and about the sides of his wounds. And they did
          so a long while.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: It is well that thou burnest me with this fire, that so
          I may be delivered from "that fire which is not quenched, and the worm
          that dieth not," which is threatened to those who worship things made
          instead of the Maker: for it is forbidden to the Christians to honour
          or worship anything except the nature of Him who is God Most High. For
          that which is made and is created is designed to be a worshipper of
          its Maker, and is not to be worshipped along with its Creator, as thou
          supposest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The governor said: It is not this for which the emperors have ordered
          me to demand an account at thy hands, whether there be judgment and
          the rendering of an account after the death of men; nor yet about this
          do I care, whether that which is made is to be honoured or not to be
          honoured. What the emperors have commanded me is this: that, whosoever
          will not sacrifice to the gods and offer incense to them, I should
          employ against him stripes, and combs, and sharp swords.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: The kings of this world are conscious of this world
          only; but the King of all kings, He hath revealed and shown to us that
          there is another world, and a judgment in reserve, in which a
          recompense will be made, on the one hand to those who have served God,
          and on the other to those who have not served Him nor confessed Him.
          Therefore do I cry aloud, that I will not again sacrifice to idols,
          nor will I offer oblations to devils, nor will I do honour to demons!
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Let nails of iron be driven in between the eyes of the
          insolent fellow, and let him go to that world which he is looking
          forward to, like a fanatic.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the executioners did so, the sound of the driving in of the nails
          being heard as they were being driven in sharply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Thou hast driven in nails between my eyes, even as nails
          were driven into the hands of the glorious Architect of the creation,
          and by reason of this did all orders of the creation tremble and quake
          at that season. For these tortures which lo! thou art inflicting on me
          are nothing in view of that judgment which is to come. For those
          "whose ways are always firm," because "they have not the judgment of
          God before their eyes," and who on this account do not even confess
          that God exists -- neither will He confess them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Thou sayest in words that there is a judgment; but I
          will show thee in deeds: so that, instead of that judgment which is to
          come, thou mayest tremble and be afraid of this one which is before
          thine eyes, in which lo! thou art involved, and not multiply thy
          speech before me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Whosoever is resolved to set God before his eyes in
          secret, God will also be at his right hand; and I too am not afraid of
          thy threats of tortures, with which thou dost menace me and seek to
          make me afraid.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Let Christ, whom thou hast confessed, deliver thee
          from all the tortures which I have inflicted on thee, and am about
          further to inflict on thee; and let Him show His deliverance towards
          thee openly, and save thee out of my hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: This is the true deliverance of Christ imparted to me --
          this secret power which He has given me to endure all the tortures
          thou art inflicting on me, and whatsoever it is settled in thy mind
          still further to inflict upon me; and, although thou hast plainly seen
          it to be so, thou hast refused to credit my word.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Take him away from before me, and let him be hanged
          upon a beam the contrary way, head downwards; and let him be beaten
          with whips while he is hanging.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the executioners did so to him, at the door of the judgment-hall.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the governor commanded, and they brought him in before him. And
          he said to him: Sacrifice to the gods, and do the will of the
          emperors, thou priest that hatest honour and lovest ignominy instead!
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Why dost thou again repeat thy words, and command me to
          sacrifice, after the many times that thou hast heard from me that I
          will not sacrifice again? For it is not any compulsion on the part of
          the Christians that has kept me back from sacrifices, but the truth
          they hold: this it is that has delivered me from the error of
          paganism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Let him be put into a chest of iron like a murderer,
          and let him be scourged with thongs like a malefactor.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the executioners did so, until there remained not a sound place on
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: As for these tortures, which thou supposest to be
          bitter, out of the midst of their bitterness will spring up for me
          fountains of deliverance and mercy in the day of the eternal
          sentences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The governor said: Let small round pieces of wood be placed between
          the fingers of his hands, and let these be squeezed upon them
          vehemently.
        </p>
        <p>
          And they did so to him, until the blood came out from under the nails
          of his fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: If thine eye be not satisfied with the tortures of the
          body, add still further to its tortures whatsoever thou wilt.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Let the fingers of his hands be loosed, and make him
          sit upon the ground; and bind his hands upon his knees, and thrust a
          piece of wood under his knees, and let it pass over the bands of his
          hands, and hang him up by his feet, thus bent, head downwards; and let
          him be scourged with thongs.
        </p>
        <p>And they did so to him.</p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: They cannot conquer who fight against God, nor may they
          be overcome whose confidence is God; and therefore do I say, that
          "neither fire nor sword, nor death nor life, nor height nor depth, can
          separate my heart from the love of God, which is in our Lord Jesus
          Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Make hot a ball of lead and of brass, and place it
          under his armpits.
        </p>
        <p>And they did so, until his ribs began to be seen.</p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: The tortures thou dost inflict upon me are too little
          for thy rage against me -- unless thy rage were little and thy
          tortures were great.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Thou wilt not hurry me on by these things which thou
          sayest; for I have room in my mind to bear long with thee, and to
          behold every evil and shocking and bitter thing which I shall exhibit
          in the torment of thy body, because thou wilt not consent to sacrifice
          to the gods whom thou didst formerly worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Those things which I have said and repeated before thee,
          thou in thine unbelief knowest not how to hear: now, supposest thou
          that thou knowest those things which are in my mind?
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: The answers which thou givest will not help thee, but
          will multiply upon thee inflictions manifold.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: If the several stories of thy several gods are by thee
          accepted as true, yet is it matter of shame to us to tell of what sort
          they are. For one had intercourse with boys, which is not right; and
          another fell in love with a maiden, who fled for refuge into a tree,
          as your shameful stories tell.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: This fellow, who was formerly a respecter of the gods,
          but has now turned to insult them and has not been afraid, and has
          also despised the command of the emperors and has not trembled -- set
          him to stand upon a gridiron heated with fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the executioners did so, until the under part of his feet was
          burnt off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: If thy rage is excited at my mention of the abominable
          and obscene tales of thy gods, how much more does it become thee to be
          ashamed of their acts! For lo! if a person were to do what one of thy
          gods did, and they were to bring him before thee, thou wouldest pass
          sentence of death upon him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: This day will I bring thee to account for thy
          blasphemy against the gods, and thine audacity in insulting also the
          emperors; nor will I leave thee alone until thou offer incense to
          them, according to thy former custom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Stand by thy threats, then, and speak not falsely; and
          show towards me in deeds the authority of the emperors which they have
          given thee; and do not thyself bring reproach on the emperors with thy
          falsehood, and be thyself also despised in the eyes of thine
          attendants!
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Thy blasphemy against the gods and thine audacity
          towards the emperors have brought upon thee these tortures which thou
          art undergoing; and, if thou add further to thine audacity, there
          shall be further added to thee inflictions bitterer than these.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Thou hast authority, as judge: do whatsoever thou wilt,
          and show no pity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: How can he that hath had no pity on his own body, so
          as to avoid suffering in it these tortures, be afraid or ashamed of
          not obeying the command of the emperors?
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Thou hast well said that I am not ashamed: because near
          at hand is He that justifieth me, and my soul is caught up in rapture
          towards him. For, whereas I once provoked Him to anger by the
          sacrifices of idols, I am this day pacifying Him by the inflictions I
          endure in my person: for my soul is a captive to God who became man.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: It is a captive, then, that I am questioning, and a
          madman without sense; and with a dead man who is burnt, lo! am I
          talking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: If thou art assured that I am mad, question me no
          further: for it is a madman that is being questioned; nay, rather, I
          am a dead man who is burnt, as thou hast said.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: How shall I count thee a dead man, When lo! thou hast
          cried aloud, "I will not sacrifice?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: I myself, too, know not how to return thee an answer,
          since thou hast called me a dead man and yet turnest to question me
          again as if alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Well have I called thee a dead man, because thy feet
          are burnt and thou carest not, and thy face is scorched and thou
          holdest thy peace, and nails are driven in between thine eyes and thou
          takest no account of it, and thy ribs are seen between the furrows of
          the combs and thou insultest the emperors, and thy whole body is
          mangled and maimed with stripes and thou blasphemest against the gods;
          and, because thou hatest thy body, lo! thou sayest whatsoever pleaseth
          thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: If thou callest me audacious because I have endured
          these things, it is fit that thou, who hast inflicted them upon me,
          shouldest be called a murderer in thy acts and a blasphemer in thy
          words.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Lo! thou hast insulted the emperors, and likewise the
          gods; and lo! thou insultest me also, in order that I may pronounce
          sentence of death upon thee quickly. But instead of this, which thou
          lookest for, I am prepared yet further to inflict upon thee bitter and
          severe tortures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Thou knowest what I have said to thee many times:
          instead of denunciations of threatening, proceed to show upon me the
          performance of the threat, that thou mayest be known to do the will of
          the emperors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Let him be torn with combs upon his legs and upon the
          sides of his thighs.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the executioners did so, until his blood flowed and ran down upon
          the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Thou hast well done in treating me thus: because I have
          heard that one of the teachers of the Church hath said, "Scars are on
          my body, that I may come to the resurrection from the place of the
          dead." Me too, who was a dead man out of sight, lo! thine inflictions
          bring to life again.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Let him be torn with combs on his face, since he is
          not ashamed of the nails which are driven in between his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          And they tore him with combs upon his cheeks, and between the nails
          which were driven into them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: I will not obey the emperors, who command that to be
          worshipped and honoured which is not of the nature of God, and is not
          God in its nature, but is the work of him that made it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Like as the emperors worship, so also worship thou;
          and that honour which the judges render, do thou render also.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Even though I insult that which is the work of men and
          has no perception and no feeling of anything, yet do not thou insult
          God, the Maker of all, nor worship along with Him that which is not of
          Him, and is foreign to His nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Does this your doctrine so teach you, that you should
          insult the very luminaries which give light to all the regions of the
          earth?
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Although it is not enjoined upon us to insult them, yet
          it is enjoined upon us not to worship them nor honour them, seeing
          that they are things made: for this were an insufferable wrong, that a
          thing made should be worshipped along with its Maker; and it is an
          insult to the Maker that His creatures should be honoured along with
          Himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: Christ whom thou confessest was hanged on a tree; and
          on a tree will I hang thee, like thy Master.
        </p>
        <p>And they hanged him on a tree a long while.</p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: As for Christ, whom lo! thou mockest -- see how thy many
          gods were unable to stand before Him: for lo! they are despised and
          rejected, and are made a laughing-stock and a jest by those who used
          formerly to worship them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge said: How is it that thou renouncest the gods, and
          confessest Christ, who was hanged on a tree?
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: This cross of Christ is the great boast of the
          Christians, since it is by this that the deliverance of salvation has
          come to all His worshippers, and by this that they have had their eyes
          enlightened, so as not to worship creatures along with the Creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          The governor said: Let thy boasting of the cross be kept within thy
          own mind, and let incense be offered by thy hands to the gods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Those who have been delivered by the cross cannot any
          longer worship and serve the idols of error made with hands: for
          creature cannot worship creature, because it is itself also designed
          to be a worshipper of Him who made it; and that it should be
          worshipped along with its Maker is an insult to its Maker, as I have
          said before.
        </p>
        <p>
          The governor said: Leave alone thy books which have taught thee to
          speak thus, and perform the command of the emperors, that thou idle
          not by the emperors' law.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Sharbil said: Is this, then, the justice of the emperors, in whom
          thou takest such pride, that we should leave alone the law of God and
          keep their laws?
        </p>
        <p>
          The governor said: The citation of the books in which thou believest,
          and from which thou hast quoted -- it is this which has brought upon
          thee these afflictions: for, if thou hadst offered incense to the
          gods, great would have been thine honour, like as it was formerly, as
          priest of the gods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: To thine unbelieving heart these things seem as if they
          were afflictions; but to the true heart "affliction imparts patience,
          and from it comes also experience, and from experience likewise the
          hope" of the confessor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The governor said: Hang him up and tear him with combs upon his former
          wounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, from the fury with which the judge urged on the executioners, his
          very bowels were almost seen. And, lest he should die under the combs
          and escape from still further tortures, he gave orders and they took
          him down.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, when the judge saw that he was become silent and was not able to
          return him any further answer, he refrained from him a little while,
          until he began to revive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharbil said: Why hast thou had pity upon me for even this little
          time, and kept me back from the gain of a confessor's death?
        </p>
        <p>
          The governor said: I have not had pity on thee at all in refraining
          for a little while: thy silence it was that made me pause a little;
          and, if I had power beyond the law of the emperors, I should like to
          lay other tortures upon thee, so as to be more fully avenged on thee
          for thine insult toward the gods: for in despising me thou hast
          despised the gods; and I, on my part, have borne with thee and
          tortured thee thus, as a man who so deserves.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the judge gave orders, and suddenly the curtain fell before him
          for a short time; and he settled and drew up the sentence which he
          should pronounce against him publicly.
        </p>
        <p>
          And suddenly the curtain was drawn back again; and the judge cried
          aloud and said: As regards this Sharbil, who was formerly priest of
          the gods, but has turned this day and renounced the gods, and has
          cried aloud "I am a Christian," and has not trembled at the gods, but
          has insulted them; and, further, has not been afraid of the emperors
          and their command; and, though I have bidden him sacrifice to the gods
          according to his former custom, has not sacrificed, but has treated
          them with the greatest insult: I have looked into the matter, and
          decided, that towards a man who doeth these things, even though he
          were now to sacrifice, it is not fit that any mercy should be shown;
          and that it is not fit that he should any longer behold the sun of his
          lords, because he has scorned their laws. I give sentence that,
          according to the law of the emperors, a strap be thrust into the mouth
          of the insulter, as into the mouth of a murderer, and that he depart
          outside of the city of the emperors with haste, as one who has
          insulted the lords of the city and the gods who hold authority over
          it. I give sentence that he be sawn with a saw of wood, and that, when
          he is near to die, then his head be taken off with the sword of the
          headsmen.
        </p>
        <p>
          And forthwith a strap was thrust into his mouth with all speed, and
          the executioners hurried him off, and made him run quickly upon his
          burnt feet, and took him away outside of the city, a crowd of people
          running after him. For they had been standing looking on at his trial
          all day, and wondering that he did not suffer under his afflictions:
          for his countenance, which was cheerful, testified to the joy of his
          heart. And, when the executioners arrived at the place where he was to
          receive the punishment of death, the people of the city were with
          them, that they might see whether they did according as the judge had
          commanded, and hear what Sharbil might say at that season, so that
          they might inform the judge of the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          And they offered him some wine to drink, according to the custom of
          murderers to drink. But he said to them: I will not drink, because I
          wish to feel the saw with which ye saw me, and the sword which ye pass
          over my neck; but instead of this wine, which will not be of any use
          to me, give me a little time to pray, while ye stand. And he stood up,
          and looked toward the east, and lifted up his voice and said: Forgive
          me, Christ, all the sins I have committed against Thee, and all the
          times in which I have provoked Thee to anger by the polluted
          sacrifices of dead idols; and have pity on me and save me, and deliver
          me from the judgment to come; and be merciful to me, as Thou wast
          merciful to the robber; and receive me like the penitents who have
          been converted and have turned to Thee, as Thou also hast turned to
          them; and, whereas I have entered into Thy vineyard, at the eleventh
          hour, instead of judgment, deliver me from justice: let Thy death,
          which was for the sake of sinners, restore to life again my slain body
          in the day of Thy coming.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, when the Sharirs of the city heard these things, they were very
          angry with the executioners for having given him leave to pray.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, while the nails were remaining which had been driven in between
          his eyes, and his ribs were seen between the wounds of the combs, and
          while from the burning on his sides and the soles of his feet, which
          were scorched and burnt, and from the gashes of the combs on his face,
          and on his sides, and on his thighs, and on his legs, the blood was
          flowing and running down, they brought carpenters' instruments, and
          thrust him into a wooden vice, and tightened it upon him until the
          bones of his joints creaked with the pressure; then they put upon him
          a saw of iron, and began sawing him asunder; and, when he was just
          about to die, because the saw had reached to his mouth, they smote him
          with the sword and took off his head, while he was still squeezed down
          in the vice.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Babai his sister drew near and spread out her skirt and caught his
          blood; and she said to him: May my spirit be united with thy spirit in
          the presence of Christ, whom thou hast known and believed.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the Sharirs of the city ran and came and informed the judge of the
          things which Sharbil had uttered in his prayer, and how his sister had
          caught his blood. And the judge commanded them to return and give
          orders to the executioners that, on the spot where she had caught the
          blood of her brother, she also should receive the punishment of death.
          And the executioners laid hold on her, and each one of them severally
          put her to torture; and, with her brother's blood upon her, her soul
          took its flight from her, and they mingled her blood with his. And,
          when the executioners were entered into the city, the brethren and
          young men ran and stole away their two corpses; and they laid them in
          the burial-place of the father of Abshelama the bishop, on the fifth
          of Ilul, the eve of the Sabbath.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wrote these Acts on paper -- I, Marinus, and Anatolus, the notaries;
          and we placed them in the archives of the city, where the papers of
          the kings are placed.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          This Barsamya, the bishop, made a disciple of Sharbil the priest. And
          he lived in the days of Binus, bishop of Rome; in whose days the whole
          population of Rome assembled together, and cried out to the prætor of
          their city, and said to him: There are too many strangers in this our
          city, and these cause famine and dearness of everything: but we
          beseech thee to command them to depart out of the city. And, when he
          had commanded them to depart out of the city, these strangers
          assembled themselves together, and said to the prætor: We beseech
          thee, my lord, command also that the bones of our dead may depart with
          us. And he commanded them to take the bones of their dead, and to
          depart. And all the strangers assembled themselves together to take
          the bones of Simon Cephas and of Paul, the apostles; but the people of
          Rome said to them: We will not give you the bones of the apostles. And
          the strangers said to them: Learn ye and understand that Simon, who is
          called Cephas, is of Bethsaida of Galilee, and Paul the apostle is of
          Tarsus, a city of Cilicia. And, when the people of Rome knew that this
          matter was so, then they let them alone. And, when they had taken them
          up and were removing them from their places, immediately there was a
          great earthquake; and the buildings of the city were on the point of
          falling down, and the city was near being overthrown. And, when the
          people of Rome saw it, they turned and besought the strangers to
          remain in their city, and that the bones might be laid in their places
          again. And, when the bones of the apostles were returned to their
          places, there was quietness, and the earthquakes ceased, and the winds
          became still, and the air became bright, and the whole city became
          cheerful. And when the Jews and pagans saw it, they also ran and fell
          at the feet of Fabianus, the bishop of their city, the Jews crying
          out: We confess Christ, whom we crucified: He is the Son of the
          living-God, of whom the prophets spoke in their mysteries. And the
          pagans also cried out and said to him: We renounce idols and carved
          images, which are of no use, and we believe in Jesus the King, the Son
          of God, who has come and is to come again. And, what ever other
          doctrines there were in Rome and in all Italy, the followers of these
          also renounced their doctrines, like as the pagans had renounced
          theirs, and confessed the Gospel of the apostles, which was preached
          in the church.
