        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1033)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's Day Morning, January 28th, 1872, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with
          tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.| -- Mark 9:24.
        </p>
        <p>
          LAST SABBATH MORNING we treated upon the way by which faith comes to
          the soul. |Faith cometh by hearing.| It is our joyful persuasion that
          on the past Sabbath faith actually came to many, and they were enabled
          to rest themselves upon the Lord Jesus Christ to their soul's
          salvation. Now, every good shepherd knows that he ought to look very
          carefully after the newborn lambs, and, therefore, it seemed to me
          that it would be most expedient this morning to search after those who
          have just believed in Christ, and to endeavor to strengthen and help
          them against the very serious trials which are incident to their
          present weak condition. When a man first lays hold upon Jesus he is
          very apt to be in distress, if his joy be not always at its full
          height; he is untrained in spiritual conflict, and easily dismayed;
          the tremor of his former conviction is upon him, and he is prone to
          relapse into it. The light which he has received fills him with
          intense delight, but it is not very clear and abiding; he sees men as
          trees walking, and is ready to conjure up a thousand fears. The
          weakness of newborn faith, therefore, calls for the compassion of all
          who love the souls of men. In addition to their own weakness they are
          liable to special dangers, for at such times Satan is frequently very
          active. No king will willingly lose his subjects, and the Prince of
          Darkness labors to bring back those who have just escaped over the
          confines of his dominion. If souls are never tried afterwards, they
          are pretty sure to be assailed on their outset from the City of
          Destruction to the Celestial City. Bunyan very wisely placed the
          Slough of Despond at the very commencement of the spiritual journey.
          The cowardly fiend of hell assails the weak, because he would put an
          end to them before they get strong enough to do mischief to his
          kingdom. Like Pharaoh, he would destroy the little ones. He seeks, if
          possible, to beat out of them every comfortable hope, so that their
          trembling faith may utterly perish. Perhaps, the text of this morning
          will be suitable to many here. I trust it may, and that the Spirit of
          God will give us reflections upon it which shall come home comfortably
          to all troubled souls. |Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.|
        </p>
        <p>
          In the text there are three things very clearly. Here is true faith;
          here is grievous unbelief; here is a battle between the two.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Very clearly in the text there is TRUE FAITH. |Lord, I believe,|
          says the anxious father. When our Lord tells him that, if he can
          believe, all things are possible to him, he makes no demur, asks for
          no pause, wishes to hear no more evidence, but cries at once, |Lord, I
          believe.| Now, observe we have called this faith true faith, and we
          will prove it to have been so. First, it was faith in the person of
          Christ. It is a great mistake to fancy that to endorse sound doctrine
          is the same thing as possessing saving faith, for while saving faith
          accepts the truth of God, it mainly concerns itself with the person
          and work of the Lord Jesus Christ, and its essence lies in reliance
          upon Jesus himself. I am not saved because I believe the Scriptures,
          or because I believe the doctrines of grace, but I am saved if I
          believe Christ; or, in other words, trust in him. Jesus is my creed.
          He is the truth. In the highest sense the Lord Jesus is the Word of
          God. To know him is life eternal. By his knowledge he justifies many.
          I do not know that the father in the narrative before us had heard
          many sermons. I am not sure that he had very clear notions about
          everything that concerned the Savior's kingdom: it was not essential
          that he should have in order to obtain a cure for his son. It was a
          very desirable thing that he should be an instructed disciple, but in
          the emergency before us the main thing was that he should believe
          Christ to be both able and willing to cast the devil out of his son.
          Up to that point he did believe; and, though his faith may have been
          deficient as well in breadth as in depth, yet it enabled him to
          realize that the Messiah who stood before him was the Lord, and it led
          him to place all his reliance upon him. He did not believe in the
          disciples; he had once trusted them and failed. He did not believe in
          himself; he knew his own impotence to drive out the evil spirit from
          his child. He believed no longer in any medicines or men, for
          doubtless he had spent much on physicians; but he believed the man of
          the shining countenance who had just come down from the mountain. When
          he heard him say, |If thou canst believe, all things are possible to
          him that believeth,| he at once said, |Lord, I believe.| Beloved
          hearer, I hope that thou hast come, at some time or other -- perhaps
          it is since last Sabbath day -- to put thy trust in Jesus in the same
          way, believing him to be able and willing to save thee. This is the
          faith that will effectually save thee. Dost thou rest in him, in him
          thy God, thy brother, thy Savior; in him as living among the sons of
          men; in him as bleeding and suffering, as a substitutionary sacrifice,
          in thy stead; in him as risen from the dead no more to die; in him as
          sitting at the right hand of the Father, clothed with power to save?
          Dost thou trust him? If not, whatever thou believest, and however
          orthodox thy creed, thou art short of eternal life; but, if all thy
          trust is stayed in him, if thou bringest all thy help from him, if his
          wounds are thine only shelter, his blood thine only plea, himself
          thine only confidence, then art thou a saved man, thy transgressions
          are forgiven thee for his name's sake, thou art accepted in the
          Beloved. Rejoice with fullness of joy, for thou hast a right so to do,
          since every gladsome thing is thine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The faith of this good man was true and saving for another reason. It
          was personal faith about the matter in hand, faith about the case
          which he was pleading. Have you never found it to be wonderfully easy
          to believe for other people? I know when I was seeking the Savior, I
          had no doubt about his receiving any other penitent. I felt certain
          that if the vilest sinner out of hell had come to him, he was able to
          save him: and though I had no faith in him on my own account, yet had
          I met with another distressed soul in a similar condition to myself, I
          believe I should have encouraged him to put his trust in Jesus, though
          I was afraid to do so myself. To believe for others is an easy matter,
          but when it comes to your own case, to believe that sins like yours
          can be blotted out, that you, who have so badly played the prodigal,
          may be received by your loving Father, that your spiritual diseases
          can be cured, and that the devil can be cast out of you; -- here is
          the labor, here is the difficulty. But, beloved, we must believe this
          or else we have not saving faith. O my Savior, shall I trifle in faith
          by believing or pretending to believe that thou canst heal a case
          parallel to mine, and yet cannot heal mine? Shall I draw a line and
          limit thee, thou Holy One of Israel, and say, |Thou canst save up to
          me, but not so far as I have gone?| Shall I dream that thy precious
          blood has some power, but not power enough to blot out my sins? Shall
          I dare, in the arrogance of my despair, to set a boundary to the
          merits of thy plea, and to the virtue of thine atoning sacrifice? God
          forbid. Jesus is able to save to the uttermost them that come unto God
          by him, -- he is able to save me. Him that cometh unto him he will in
          no wise cast out; I come to him, and he will not, cannot cast me out.
          Hast thou a personal faith, a faith about thyself, about thine own
          sins, and thine own condition before God? Dost thou believe that
          Christ can save thee? Sink or swim, dost thou cast thyself upon him,
          thine own proper self? He, his own self, bore our sins in his own body
          on the tree; and we, our own selves, must cast ourselves upon him. If
          we have so done, then we, like the man in the narrative, have the real
          faith, the faith of God's elect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lest any, however, should think this a very small thing, let me go on
          to show you that this man's faith was real, because it was faith which
          triumphed over difficulties, difficulties which typify our own, and
          hence it was clearly the work of the Spirit of God, for no other will
          endure the trial. I shall ask thee, dear hearer, whether faith has
          triumphed over difficulties in thy case. For observe, his child was
          grievously tormented, and the malady was of long standing. When the
          Savior said to him, |How long hath this happened unto him?| he said,
          |Of a child.| Must it not have seemed, now that his son had grown
          older, a very unlikely thing that he should be recovered. We expect
          our children to outgrow some of their complaints; but here was one
          who, after many years, was none the better. Years had only increased
          but not diminished his pains. Yet in the teeth of that the man
          believed that Christ could cast that long-established demon out of his
          son. Dear friend, thy case of sin is similar. The sins of thy youth
          rise up before thee now: are they not in thy bones? The sins of thine
          early manhood, and the sins of thy riper years, and, mayhap, the sins
          of thy decaying years; all these come up before thee. Can the
          Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? If so, then he
          that is accustomed to do evil may learn to do well. Can I, after lying
          asoak in the scarlet dye till it is ingrained in my very nature, --
          can I be washed and made whiter than snow? Crimes so long continued,
          evil habits so deeply rooted, can all these be overcome? O soul, if
          thou hast true faith, thou wilt say, |Yes,| I believe that since
          Christ is God he can deliver me from all evil, and forgive me all sin.
          Even if I had lived as long as Methuselah, and had continued all that
          while in the vilest of transgression, yet Jesus is so mighty to save
          that he could deliver me in a moment. His word is, |All manner of sin
          and of blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men.| Looking to those dear
          wounds, those founts of love and blood, I do believe, and will
          believe, that all my years of sin are gone as in a moment, and like
          thick clouds before a mighty wind are blown away never to return. Oh,
          this is faith, poor soul. I pray God enable thee to exercise it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This man had for a long time considered his son's case to be hopeless.
          Well he might. In addition to the fact that the child was subject to
          attacks of epilepsy and to extreme fits of fury, he was deaf and dumb,
          so that no intelligent expression of feeling could come from him: if
          at any time he felt stronger and better, he could not give his father
          a word of hope, he could not utter his gratitude for the sympathetic
          care that watched over him, neither could he hear any word of
          consolation which his father addressed to him. The ear was closed and
          the tongue was bound. Painful affliction, exceedingly painful to the
          parent, and to be continued year after year! At last the father must
          have felt there was no use in making any further effort. The child
          must be controlled, but he could not be restored; he was a hopeless
          maniac. Peradventure, there is one here, this morning, who had grown
          hopeless of salvation; he has felt as if his case was one out of the
          catalogue of mercy; he has written bitter things against himself, and
          supposed that God has sealed those bitter things and made them true;
          but you see the father in the presence of Christ believed over the
          head of his despair, |in hope believing against hope,| and I pray that
          you may do the same. In the presence of Christ the man's confidence
          came back to him. Hast thou, my hearer, a hope that can do the same? I
          never could have believed it was possible for me to be delivered from
          my sins till now I see that he who came to save me is my Maker; he who
          came to redeem me is he who bears the earth's huge pillars on his
          shoulders and sustaineth all things by the word of his power. With him
          nothing can be impossible. I see his pierced hands and feet, and feel
          that if he stooped to suffer in the sinner's stead, the merit of his
          sacrifice must be beyond conception great. In Jesus the hopeless one
          hath hope, he who had despaired else now bids his heart be of good
          cheer. Oh, that is true faith which will not suffer itself to be any
          longer the slave of doubt and despondency now that it sees Jesus the
          Lord drawing near. It is a mighty faith which refuses to sit any
          longer in the valley of the shadow of death, but arises and shakes
          itself from the dust, and puts on its beautiful garments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The father had another trial for his faith in the fact that he had
          just then tried the disciples. He brought his child to Christ, and
          Christ being absent, he asked the apostles who were in the valley what
          they could do. They tried their best, but having lost their Master's
          power they utterly failed; and this must have been a very violent
          trial to the father's confidence. He knew that on other occasions
          Christ's power had passed through the apostles, and he had wrought his
          miracles by them; but here was a complete cessation of their healing
          energy. If Jesus did not choose to work by them on this occasion, the
          suggestion would arise in the man's heart, |Perhaps his own power also
          has become lessened.| But he put the thought aside, and believed
          notwithstanding all. And, O soul, hast thou tried ministers and tried
          God's people, and hoped to get comfort, and hast thou found none? Hast
          thou gone to the ordinances and found them like dry wells? Hast thou
          resorted to the hearing of the gospel and found even it to be
          barrenness to thy spirit? Yes, yet suffer no shadow of suspicion to
          cross thy mind as to the Lord's ability or willingness to save thee.
          Come to the feet of Jesus and still believe in him. Whatever reason
          may say in thy soul to excite thee to despondency on account of past
          defeats, believe thou firmly that his power is still invincible; his
          arm is not shortened that he cannot save, neither is his ear heavy
          that he cannot hear. It was meet that thou shouldst see the failure of
          man that thou mightest glorify the grace of God; it was meet that the
          servants should be unable that the Master's ability might be the more
          conspicuous. May the Lord help thee to believe that though no man can
          do thee good, though all the pastors and bishops of the church, and
          all the martyrs and confessors of past ages, and all the apostles, and
          all the prophets, are unable to find a balm in Gilead that can meet
          thy case, yet there is a hand, a pierced hand, which can heal thy
          wounds and bleed a balm into thy soul which shall effectually restore
          thee. Yes, true faith believes over even such a discouragement as
          this.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would have you notice, also, once more, while we are upon this
          point, that this father believed in Christ and his power to save,
          though the child was at that very moment passing through a horrible
          stage of pain and misery. The spirit which possessed this poor child
          was accustomed to throw him sometimes into the fire, and sometimes
          into the water. Just our condition; for our spirit has sometimes been
          thrown into the very fire of presumption, and at another season into
          the floods of despair. We have alternated between the cold of
          melancholy and the heat of self-conceit. We have at one time cried, |I
          love pleasure, and after it I will go;| and at another time we have
          said, |My soul chooseth strangling rather than life; I would not live
          always.| When Satan is in a man, and he is full of despair, he goes to
          all extremes, and resteth nowhere, walking like the unclean spirit
          himself through dry places, seeking rest and finding none. At the
          moment while the father was speaking, the poor boy was on the ground
          wallowing in dreadful paroxysms of his disorder, foaming at the mouth,
          and gnashing with his teeth. Satan had great wrath, because he knew
          that his time was short. When the Savior spoke, and bade the devil
          come out of him, the fiercest struggle of all took place; for the
          unclean spirit rent the child, and the most terrible cries were heard.
          Still the father said, |Lord, I believe.| Now, it may be, dear hearer,
          you are this morning yourself full of great trouble, vexed and
          tormented with innumerable fears of wrath to come; a little hell burns
          within your soul, anguish unutterable has taken hold upon you, your
          heart is like a battle field torn by contending hosts, which rush
          hither and thither, destroying on every side. You are yourself an
          embodied agony; you are like David when he said, |The pains of hell
          get hold upon me, I found trouble and sorrow.| Can you now believe?
          Will now accept the word of the Most High? If thou canst, thou wilt
          greatly glorify God, and thou wilt bring to thyself much blessedness.
          Happy is that man who can not only believe when the waves softly
          ripple to the music of peace, but continues to trust in him who is
          almighty to save when the hurricane is let loose in its fury, and the
          Atlantic breakers follow each other, eager to swallow up the barque of
          the mariner. Surely Christ Jesus is fit to be believed at all times,
          for, like the pole star, he abides in his faithfulness, let storms
          rage as they may. He is always divine, always omnipotent to succor,
          always overflowing with lovingkindness, ready and willing to receive
          sinners, even the very chief of them. Sorrowful one, do not add to thy
          sorrows by unbelief, that is a bitterness which it is superfluous to
          mingle with thy cup. Better far is it to say, |Though he slay me yet
          will I trust in him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          There must be power unbounded in him who deigned to die upon the
          cross. Come ye to Calvary and see! Can you look to that head crowned
          with thorns, and mark the ruby drops standing on his brow, and yet be
          doubtful of his power to save? Can you mark that sacred face, more
          marred than that of any man -- marred with our griefs and stained with
          our sins, can you gaze on it and remain an unbeliever? Survey that
          precious body tortured in every part for our transgressions, and can
          you yet distrust him upon whom the chastisement of our peace was laid?
          Can you behold those hands and feet fastened to the ignominious wood
          for the guilty? Can you look upon that spectacle of woe, and know that
          Christ is divine, and yet harbour doubts as to his power to save you?
          As for myself, I am constrained to cry, |Lord, I believe, I must
          believe; thou hast thyself compelled my faith.| Let all things reel
          beneath my feet, but the cross of my Lord stands fast. If the Son of
          God has died for sinners, it is certain that the believing sinner
          cannot die, but must be saved, since Jesus bled for him. May God grant
          to every one of us to stand just there where the poor father did as to
          his faith, and say as he did, |Lord, I believe.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I am forced to leave this head incomplete, for the hour commands me to
          hasten on. The faith before us was earnest, it led the man to tears of
          repentance, it taught him to pray, it led him to open confession; in
          all these points may your faith be of a like character.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But, now, we must turn to the second part of the subject, for HERE
          IS UNBELIEF. |Help thou mine unbelief,| said he. He had doubted the
          power of Christ, he had said, |If thou canst do anything for us, have
          compassion on us and heal us;| but yet he had faith and he had avowed
          it; he had not kept it secret within himself as though he were ashamed
          of it; before the scoffing scribes he had confessed, |Lord, I
          believe.| He avowed it, too, with remarkable earnestness, for he said
          it with tears, as though his heart saturated his confession, running
          over at his eyes to bedew the words, |Lord, I do believe; do not doubt
          it, I lie not; I do believe in thee.| But, then, he went on to make
          the confession at the same time there was an unbelief lingering in his
          soul. |Help thou,| said he, |mine unbelief.| Albeit that his faith had
          triumphed over the considerations which I just now mentioned, which
          appeared enough to damp, if not to quench it, yet these considerations
          may have had some effect upon his mind: they did not prevent his
          believing, but they hampered his faith with many questions. Some
          unbelief lingered, though faith was supreme. Learn from this that a
          measure of doubt is consistent with saving faith; that weak faith is
          true faith, and a trembling faith will save the soul. If thou
          believest, even though thou be compelled to say, |Help thou mine
          unbelief,| yet that faith makes thee whole, and thou art justified
          before God.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought I would, under this second head, mention some reflections
          which often cause unbelief to trouble the heart which, nevertheless,
          has been enabled by the Holy Spirit to believe.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, there are many true believers who at the first are tried with
          unbelief, because they have now, more than ever they had before, a
          sense of their past sins. Many a man receives a far deeper sense of
          sin after he is forgiven than he ever had before. The light of the law
          is but moonlight compared with the light of the gospel, which is the
          light of the sun. Love makes sin to become exceeding sinful.
        </p>
        <p>|My Sins, my Sins, my Savior!</p>
        <p>How sad on thee they fall;</p>
        <p>Seen through thy gentle patience,</p>
        <p>I tenfold feel them all.</p>
        <p>I know they are forgiven,</p>
        <p>But still their pain to me</p>
        <p>Is all the grief and anguish</p>
        <p>They laid, my Lord, on thee.|</p>
        <p>
          The light of the promise gleaming in the soul reveals the infinite
          abyss of horror which lies in indwelling sin. In the light of God's
          countenance we discover the filthiness, the abomination, the
          detestable ingratitude of our past conduct. We loathe ourselves in our
          own sight. While we bless God that sin is pardoned, we are staggered
          to think it should have been such sin as it is, and the natural
          feeling resulting from our discovery is a fear that we cannot be
          pardoned. We ask ourselves, can it be that such sins are forgiven?
          Possibly the memory of certain peculiarly heinous sins becomes very
          vivid to our conscience: we had half forgotten them, but they start up
          with dreadful energy, and cast suspicions into our mind as to whether
          forgiveness is possible. Oh, that we could blot out those evil days!
          We have said, |Cursed be the sun that it rose on such a day as that in
          which I so defiled myself with iniquity.| Thus, under a sense of sin,
          though there is the belief that we are pardoned, there may also arise
          the unbelief against which we need the Lord to help us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some have been staggered, at times, by a consciousness of their
          present feebleness. |Yes,| saith one, |I trust the past is blotted
          out, but then how can I hope that I am saved? What a poor creature I
          am. I try to pray, but it is not worth calling prayer. I go up to
          God's house vowing that I will praise his name, and I get talking on
          the way and forget all about it, and I am dull all through the
          service. Then I was tempted yesterday, and I spoke unadvisably with my
          lips, or I did not defend the cause of my Lord and Master against that
          skeptic as I ought to have done. Only, just lately, I hoped that I had
          found peace with God, and yet I am behaving like this. Why I must be a
          hypocrite, it cannot be that I am a saved soul. Surely if my sins were
          forgiven me I should act very differently from this.| Now that is
          often the cause of unbelief. The soul still hopes in Jesus and rests
          in him, and she has nowhere else to go; but for all that the old
          monster unbelief gives her a desperate twitch, and she trembles while
          she hopes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some others have been made to shiver with unbelief on account of fears
          for the future. |I am afraid I shall not hold on,| says one. |Why, to
          be a Christian you must persevere to the end. With such a heart as
          mine, how can I hope to be steadfast: and in such a position as mine,
          surrounded by so many ungodly associates, how can I hope to persevere?
          I see so-and-so made a profession, and he is gone back; and I know
          such an one who said he was a Christian, and he is a worse man than he
          used to be. Suppose the last end of me should be worse than the first;
          suppose I should put my hand to the plough and should look back and
          prove unworthy of the kingdom.| Poor heart, it forgets that word, |I
          will never leave thee nor forsake thee;| and remembers not that other
          word, |I give unto my sheep eternal life, and they shall never perish,
          neither shall any pluck them out of my hand.| Rightly filled with a
          holy anxiety to hold on to the end, it gives way to improper unbelief,
          for it ought to rest confident that Jesus changeth not; and, where he
          has begun the good work, he will carry it on and perfect it unto the
          day of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have known some, again, whose unbelief has been excited by a
          consideration of the freeness and greatness of the mercy bestowed. I
          recollect how this staggered me once. I had believed in Jesus, and
          rejoiced in his salvation, but in meditating upon divine grace I was
          overcome with fear. What, pardoned, justified, a child of God, an heir
          of heaven, a joint heir with Christ, one of God's elect, secure of
          heaven, with a crown waiting for me at the last, and power to win that
          crown daily secured to me; -- why, it seemed altogether too good to be
          true. Unbelief whispered, |it cannot be.| If such great grace had been
          shown to others I should not have marvelled. If men of great
          abilities, at high station, and of eminent character, had received
          such grace, I could have believed it; or even if that holy woman, who
          had so long been a patient sufferer, had been so blessed, it would
          have appeared an ordinary circumstance; but for such a sinner as I was
          to be thus favored appeared to be too strange a miracle of love. I do
          remember how the very grandeur of the divine mercy threatened to crush
          me down and bury me under its own mass of goodness. I could believe
          that the Lord would give me a little mercy, but that he should give me
          such mercy, such unexpected favor, almost exceeded belief. And yet,
          what fully is there in such ideas, for were we not told beforehand
          that |as high as the heavens are above the earth, so high are his ways
          above our ways, and his thoughts above our thoughts?| Do we not know
          that we are dealing with a great God, of whom the prophet asks, |Who
          is a God like unto thee, passing by iniquity, transgression, and sin?|
          Do we think that God will only give according to our stinted measure?
          Is God to take man for his model? Remember ye that word, |He is able
          to do exceeding abundantly above what we ask or even think.| Instead
          of the greatness of the divine mercy staggering us, it ought to
          console us and assist us to believe, seeing that it is so congruous
          with his nature. Yet, ofttimes, on this sea of love poor leaky vessels
          have begun to sink.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have known, too, not a few, whose unbelief has arisen through a
          sacred anxiety to be right -- a most proper anxiety if not pushed
          beyond its sphere. The idea has been suggested to them: |Suppose I
          should be after all presumptuous, and should deceive myself, by
          thinking I am saved, whereas I am not? What if I should film the
          wound, when it ought to be lanced, before there can be effectual
          healing.| How I wish that all hypocrites would be troubled with this
          sort of fear. It would be a great mercy for many boastful professors
          if they had grace enough to doubt. I think Cowper was right when he
          said --
        </p>
        <p>|He that never doubted of his state,</p>
        <p>He may, perhaps he may too late.|</p>
        <p>
          But yet, this anxiety may be carried too far, and the soul may slide
          into despondency through it. I ought to be afraid of presumption, but
          it cannot be presumptuous to believe God's word. I ought to be afraid
          of saying, |Peace, peace, where there is no peace;| but if peace comes
          to me through the word of Christ, I need never be suspicious of it,
          let it be as profound as it may. I may doubt myself; I may go further,
          I may despair of self, but I must not doubt the Lord. If he has said,
          |Trust in me, believe in me, and thou shalt be saved;| if I believe in
          him, it is no presumption to know that I am saved. If he has declared
          that he that believeth in him is justified from all things from which
          he could not be justified by the law of Moses; if I have believed in
          him, I am justified from all my sins. There is far more presumption in
          doubting the Lord than there ever can be in trusting him. Faith is no
          more than God's due, it ought never to be looked at as too daring. If
          I believe in Jesus I have no right to say, |I hope I am saved,| for
          that implies a doubt of God's declaration that the believer is saved.
          I have no right to say, |I sometimes think I am safe.| I am so
          undoubtedly if I believe in Jesus. It is no matter of opinion, but a
          matter of certainty. There is nothing in this world about which a man
          may be so sure as about his own salvation, because other things come
          to us by the evidence of our own fallible senses, or by the testimony
          of men who may be mistaken; but the fact that the believer is saved is
          sealed to us by the testimony of God himself, who cannot lie. When the
          Scripture says plainly, |He that believeth and is baptized shall be
          saved,| I, having believed, and having been baptized, ought not to
          question the divine declaration, but should be as sure that, if I have
          believed, I am saved, as I am sure that I exist. This assurance is
          attainable, and should be the common condition of the believer. Yet
          has it often happened, I say, that an anxiety, which was commendable
          in its outset, has ended in a censurable unbelief.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, I have known unbelief arise in some souls through a most
          proper reverence for Christ, and a high esteem for all that belongs to
          him. You remember our text a few Sabbath mornings ago told us of John,
          who when he saw his Master in all his glory fell at his feet as dead.
          Ah, when the soul gets near to Jesus it perceives his perfection, and
          becomes conscious of its own imperfection; it sees his glory, and
          becomes aware of its own nothingness; it sees his love, and blushes at
          its own unloveliness; and then it is very, very apt to be tortured
          with mistrust, though it ought not so to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I have even known when children of God just converted have come
          into the church, they have had such a high esteem for their brethren
          and sisters, that they have feared to be numbered with them. When they
          have heard some earnest brother pray they have said, |Oh, what a
          prayer, I shall never be like that man;| and, perhaps, they have
          listened to the preachings of some servant of God and said, |Ah, I
          cannot come up to that standard; the very existence of such a man as
          that condemns me.| It is beautiful so see the little children loving
          the elder sons of the family, and admiring what they see of the father
          in them; but even this holy modesty may be turned into unbelief,
          though it ought not so to be; for, O child of God, if Christ be so
          lovely, thou art on the way to be made like him; and if there be
          anything beautiful in any of his people, that same shall be given unto
          thee, for they also are as thou art, men of like passions with
          thyself; and God who has done great things for them will do the like
          for thee, for he loves thee with the self-same love.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have thus set before you the unbelief which often will exist side by
          side with faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now, let us notice very briefly THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TWO.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is observable that this poor man did not say, |Lord, I believe, but
          have some doubts,| and mention it as if it were a mere matter of
          common intelligence which did not grieve him. Oh, no; he said it with
          tears; he made a sorrowful confession of it. It was not the mere
          statement of a fact, but it was the acknowledgment of a fault. With
          tears he said, |Lord, I believe,| and then acknowledged his unbelief.
          Learn then, dear hearer, always to look at unbelief in Christ in the
          light of a fault. Never say, |This is my infirmity,| but say, |This is
          my sin.| There has been too much in the Church of God of regarding
          unbelief as though it were a calamity commanding sympathy, rather than
          a fault demanding censure as well. I am not to say to myself, |I am
          unbelieving, and therefore I am to be pitied.| No, |I am unbelieving,
          and therefore I must blame myself for it.| Why should I disbelieve my
          God? How dare I doubt him who cannot lie? How can I mistrust the
          faithful promiser who has added to his promise his oath, and over and
          above his promise and his oath has given his own blood as a seal, that
          by two immutable things, wherein it was impossible for God to die, we
          might have strong consolation. Chide yourselves, ye doubters. Doubts
          are among the worst enemies of your souls. Do not entertain them. Do
          not treat them as though they were poor forlorn travelers to be
          hospitably entertained, but as rogues and vagabonds to be chased from
          thy door. Fight them, slay them, and pray God to help thee to kill
          them, and bury them, and not even to leave a bone or a piece of a bone
          of a doubt above ground. Doubting and unbelief are to be abhorred, and
          to be confessed with tears as sins before God. We need pardon for
          doubting as much as for blasphemy. We ought no more to excuse doubting
          than lying, for doubting slanders God and makes him a liar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, again, having made a confession of his unbelief as you observe,
          the father, in the narrative, prayed against it, and an earnest prayer
          it was. It was, |Help thou mine unbelief.| It is very noticeable that
          he does not say, |Lord, I believe; help thou my child.| No, nor does
          he say, |Lord, I believe; now cast the devil out of my boy:| not at
          all; he perceives that his own unbelief was harder to overcome than
          the devil, and that to heal him of his spiritual disease was a more
          needful work, than even to heal his child of the sad malady under
          which he labored. This is the point to arrive at, to feel that there
          is no deficiency in the merit of Christ; no lack of power in his
          precious blood; no unwillingness in Christ's heart to save me; but all
          the hindrance lies in my unbelief. There is the point. O God, bring
          thy power to bear where it is wanted. It is not because the blood will
          not cleanse me, it is because I will not believe; it is not because
          Christ's plea is not heard, but because I do not trust that plea. If I
          am not in the possession of full salvation, it is not because Christ
          is not mighty to save, but because I do not lean on him fully and
          entirely. O God, thou seest this is the center of the difficulty,
          bring, thy power to bear on that difficulty. I ask only this. No more
          do I cry, |Help me here, or help me there;| but, |Help mine unbelief.|
          That is the Slough of Despond; I carry that in my heart; that is the
          weak point. |Lord, strengthen me just there.| It is well when, in
          addition to confession, we bring up all the great guns of fervent
          prayer to bear upon that position which needs to be carried by storm.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, lastly, this man did well in looking for the help against his
          unbelief to the right quarter. He did not say, |Lord, I believe; and
          now I will try to overcome my belief.| No; but |Lord help,| as if he
          felt that the Lord alone could do it. No physician can cure unbelief
          but Christ. He is the physic for it, and he is the physician too. If
          thou hast any unbelief, take thou the blood of Christ to cure it with.
          Think of him, -- God in the glory of his person, tabernacling among
          men, working out a perfect righteousness, dying a felon's death upon
          the cross in the sinner's stead; think of him as rising from the dead,
          no more to die: think of him as ascending into heaven amidst the
          shouts of angels: think of him as standing at the right hand of God
          with the keys of death and hell at his girdle: think of him as always
          pleading the merit of his blood before the Father's throne; and, as
          thou considerest concerning him, in the power of the Spirit, thine
          unbelief will die, for thou wilt say, |Lord, the thought of thee has
          helped mine unbelief; while I have been studying thee, and feeding my
          soul on thee, and making thee to be as bread and wine to my soul, my
          unbelief has gone. I do believe in thee, and I will; for thou hast
          helped mine unbelief.| Go, any of you who are in trouble about this
          matter, go where you gained your first faith, go there to get more. If
          you first obtained your faith at the cross foot, go there again to end
          your unbelief. View the flowing of his soul-redeeming blood, and
          continue viewing it till thou shalt by divine assurance know; that he
          has made thy peace with God. God bless thee in Christ Jesus. Amen.
