        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.255)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, May 29th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>

          "Just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus." -- Romans
          3:26.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
          unrighteousness." -- 1 John 1:9.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHEN THE SOUL is seriously impressed with the conviction of its guilt,
          when terror and alarm get hold upon it concerning the inevitable
          consequences of its sin, the soul is afraid of God. It dreads at that
          time every attribute of divinity. But most of all the sinner is afraid
          of God's justice. "Ah," saith he to himself, "God is a just God; and
          if so, how can he pardon my sins? for my iniquities cry aloud for
          punishment, and my transgressions demand that his right hand should
          smite me low. How can I be saved? Were God unjust, he might forgive:
          but, alas! he is not so, he is severely just. He layeth justice to the
          line, and righteousness to the plummet.' He is the judge of all the
          earth, and he must do right. How then can I escape from his righteous
          wrath which must be stirred up against me?" Let us be assured that the
          sinner is quite right in the conviction that there is here a great
          difficulty. The justice of God is in itself a great barrier to the
          salvation of sinners. There is no possibility for that barrier to be
          surmounted, nor even for it to be removed except by one means, which
          shall this day be proclaimed unto you through the gospel of Jesus
          Christ our Lord. It is true that God is just. Let old Sodom tell you
          how God rained fire and brimstone out of heaven upon man's iniquity.
          Let a drowning world tell you how God lifted the sluices of the
          fountains of the great deep, and bade the bubbling waters spring up
          and swallow up man alive. Let the earth tell you; for she opened her
          mouth when Korah, Dathan, and Abiram rebelled against God. Let the
          buried cities of Nineveh, and the tattered relics of Tyre and Sidon,
          tell you that God is just, and will by no means spare the guilty. And
          direst of all, let hell's bottomless lake declare what is the awful
          vengeance of God against the sins of man. Let the sighs, and groans,
          and moans, and shrieks of spirits condemned of God, rise in your ears,
          and bear witness that he is a God who will not spare the guilty, who
          will not wink at iniquity, transgression, and sin, but who will have
          vengeance upon every rebel, and will give justice its full
          satisfaction for every offence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sinner is right in his conviction that God is just, and he is
          moreover right in the inference which follows from it, that because
          God is just his sin must be punished. Ah, sinner, if God punish not
          thy sin, he has ceased to be what he has always been -- the severely
          just, the inflexibly righteous. Never has there been a sin pardoned,
          absolutely and without atonement, since the world began. There has
          never been an offense yet remitted by the great Judge of heaven, until
          the law has received the fullest vindication. You are right, O
          convicted sinner, that such shall be the case even to the end. Every
          transgression shall have its just recompense of reward. For every
          offence there shall be its stroke, and for every iniquity there shall
          be its doom. "Ah," now says the sinner, "then I am shut out of heaven.
          If God be just and he must punish sin, then what can I do? Justice,
          like some dark angel, strides across the road of mercy, and with his
          sword drawn, athirst for blood and winged to slay, he strides across
          my path, and threatens to drive me backwards over the precipice of
          death into the ever-burning lake." Sinner, thou art right; it is even
          so. Except through the gospel which I am about to preach to thee,
          justice is thine antagonist, thy lawful, irresistible, and insatiable
          enemy. It cannot suffer thee to enter heaven, for thou hast sinned;
          and punished that sin must be, avenged that transgression must be, as
          long as God is God -- the holy and the just.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it possible, then, that the sinner cannot be saved? This is the
          great riddle of the law, and the grand discovery of the gospel. Wonder
          ye heavens! be astonished O earth! that very justice which stood in
          the sinner's way and prevented his being pardoned, has been by the
          gospel of Christ appeased; by the rich atonement offered upon Calvary,
          justice is satisfied, has sheathed its sword, and has now not a word
          to say against the pardon of the penitent. Nay, more, that justice
          once so angry, whose brow was lightning, and whose voice was thunder,
          has now become the sinner's advocate, and itself with its mighty voice
          pleads with God, that whosoever confesses his sin should be pardoned
          and be cleansed from all unrighteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The business of this morning shall be to show, in the first place,
          according to the first text, how justice is no longer the sinner's
          enemy -- "God is just, and yet the justifier of him that believeth;"
          and then, in the second place, that justice has become the sinner's
          advocate, and that "God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,
          and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          But here let me utter a caution; I shall speak this morning, only to
          those who feel their guilt, and who are ready to confess their sin.
          For to those who still love sin, and will not acknowledge their guilt,
          there is no promise of mercy or pardon. For them there remains nothing
          but the fearful looking for of judgment. "He that being often reproved
          hardeneth his heart shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without
          remedy." The soul that neglects this great salvation cannot escape;
          there is no door of escape provided for it. Unless the Lord has now
          brought us to feel our need of mercy, has compelled us to confess that
          unless he gives us mercy we must righteously perish, and unless,
          moreover, he has made us willing now to be saved on any terms, so that
          we may be saved at all, this gospel which I am about to preach is not
          ours. But if we be convinced of sin and are now trembling before the
          thunders of God's wrath, every word that I am now about to speak will
          be full of encouragement and consolation to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, HOW HAS JUSTICE BEEN PUT ASIDE? or rather, HOW HAS IT
          BEEN SO SATISFIED THAT IT NO LONGER STANDS IN THE WAY OF GOD'S
          JUSTIFYING THE SINNER?
        </p>
        <p>
          The one answer to that is, Justice has been satisfied through the
          substitution of our blessed Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. When man
          sinned the law demanded that man must be punished. The first offense
          of man was committed by Adam, who was the representative of the entire
          race. When God would punish sin, in his own infinite mind he thought
          of the blessed expedient, not of punishing his people, but of
          punishing their representative, the covenant head, the second Adam. It
          was by one man, the first man, that sin entered into the world, and
          death by sin. It was by another man, the second Adam, who is the Lord
          from heaven, it was by him that this sin was borne; by him its
          punishment was endured; by him the whole wrath of heaven was suffered.
          And through that second representative of manhood, Jesus, the second
          Adam, God is now able and willing to forgive the vilest of the vile,
          and justify even the ungodly, and he is able to do so without the
          slightest violation of his justice. For, mark, when Jesus Christ the
          Son of God suffered on the tree, he did not suffer for himself. He had
          no sin, either natural or actual. He had done nothing whatever that
          could bring him under the ban of heaven, or subject his holy soul and
          his perfect body to grief and pain. When he suffered it was as a
          substitute. He died -- "the just for the unjust, that he might bring
          us to God." Had his sorrows been personally deserved they would have
          had no efficacy in them. But inasmuch as for sins not his own he died
          to atone; inasmuch as he was punished, not for any guilt that he had
          done or could do, but for the guilt incurred by others, there was a
          merit and an efficacy in all that he suffered, by which the law was
          satisfied, and God is able to forgive.
        </p>
        <p>Let us show very briefly how fully the law is satisfied.</p>
        <p>
          1. Note first the dignity of the victim who offered himself up to
          divine justice. Man had sinned; the law required the punishment of
          manhood. But Jesus, the eternal Son of God, "very God of very God,"
          who had been hymned through eternal ages by joyous angels, who had
          been the favourite of his Father's court, exalted high above
          principalities and powers, and every name that is named, he himself
          condescended to become man; was born of the Virgin Mary; was cradled
          in a manger; lived a life of suffering, and at last died a death of
          agony. If you will but think of the wondrous person whom Jesus was --
          as very God of very God, king of angels, creator, preserver, Lord of
          all -- I think you will see that in his sufferings, the law received a
          greater vindication than it could have done even in the sufferings of
          all the men that have ever lived or ever could live. If God had
          consumed the whole human race, if all the worlds that float in ether
          had been sacrificed as one mighty holocaust to the vengeance of the
          law, it would not have been so well vindicated as when Jesus died. For
          the deaths of all men and all angels would have been but the deaths
          and sufferings of creatures; but when Jesus died, the Creator himself
          underwent the pang, it was the divine preserver of the world hanging
          on the cross. There is such dignity in the Godhead, that all it does
          is marvellous and infinite in its merit; and when he stooped to
          suffer, when he bowed his awful head, cast aside his diadem of stars
          to have his brow girt about with thorns; when his hands that once
          swayed the sceptre of all worlds were nailed to the tree; when his
          feet that erst had pressed the clouds, when these were fastened to the
          wood, then did the law receive an honour such as it never could have
          received if a whole universe in one devouring conflagration had blazed
          and burned for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In the next place, just pause and think of the relationship which
          Jesus Christ had towards the great judge of all the earth, and then
          you will see again that the law must have been fully satisfied
          thereby. We hear of Brutus that he was the most inflexible of
          law-givers; that when he sat upon the bench he knew no distinction of
          persons. Imagine dragged before Brutus many of the noblest Roman
          senators, convicted of crime: he condemns them, and without mercy they
          are rent away by the lictors to their doom. You would admire certainly
          all this justice of Brutus But suppose Brutus' own son brought before
          him -- and such was the case -- imagine the father sitting on the
          judgment-bench and declaring that he knew no distinction whatever,
          even of his own children. Conceive that son tried and condemned out of
          his father's own mouth. See him tied up before his father's own eyes,
          while, as the inflexible judge, that father bids the lictor lay on the
          rod, and afterwards cries, "Take him away and use the axe!" See you
          not here how he loves his country better than his son, and he loves
          justice better than either. "Now," says the world, "Brutus is just
          indeed." Now, if God had condemned each of us one by one, or the whole
          race in a mass, there would certainly have been a vindication of his
          justice. But lo! his own son takes upon him the sins of the world, and
          he comes before his Father's presence. He is not guilty in himself,
          but the sins of man are laid upon his shoulders. The Father condemns
          his Son; he gives him up to the Roman rod; he gives him up to Jewish
          mockery, to military scorn, and to priestly arrogance. He delivers up
          his Son to the executioner, and bids him nail him to the tree; and as
          if that were not enough, since the creature had not power of itself to
          give forth all the vengeance of God upon its own substitute, God
          himself smites his Son. Are you staggered at such an expression? It is
          scriptural. Read in the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, and there you
          have the proof thereof: -- "It pleased the Lord to bruise him: he hath
          put him to grief." When the whip had gone round to every hand, when
          the betrayer had smitten him, when Pilate and Herod, and Jew and
          Gentile, had each laid on the stroke, it was seen that human arm was
          not powerful enough to execute the full vengeance: then did the Father
          take his sword, and cry, "Awake! O sword, against my shepherd, against
          the man that is my fellow," and he smote him sternly, as if he had
          been his enemy, as if he were a common culprit, as if he were the
          worst of criminals -- he smote him again and again, till that awful
          shriek was forced from the lips of the dying substitute, "Eloi, Eloi,
          lama sabacthani," -- my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
          Surely, when God smites his Son, and such a Son, when God smites his
          only begotten and well-beloved, then Justice has more than its due,
          more than itself could ask, Christ himself did freely give!
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Furthermore, if you will please for a moment to consider how
          terrible were the agonies of Christ, which, mark you, he endured in
          the room, the place, the stead of all poor penitent sinners, of all
          those who confess their sins and believe in him; I say, when you mark
          these agonies, you will readily see why Justice does not stand in the
          sinner's way. Doth Justice come to thee this morning, and say,
          "Sinner, thou hast sinned, I will punish thee?" Answer thus --
          "Justice, thou hast punished all my sins. All I ought to have suffered
          has been suffered by my substitute, Jesus. It is true that in myself I
          owe thee a debt greater than I can pay, but it is true that in Christ
          I owe thee nothing; for all I did owe is paid, every farthing of it;
          the utmost drachm has been counted down; not a doit remains that is
          due from me to thee, O thou avenging justice of God." But if Justice
          still accuse, and conscience clamour, go thou and take Justice with
          thee to Gethsemane, and stand there with it: -- see that man so
          oppressed with grief, that all his head, his hair, his garments bloody
          be. Sin was a press -- a vice which forced his blood from every vein,
          and wrapped him in a sheet of his own blood. Dost see that man there!
          canst hear his groans, his cries, his earnest intercessions, his
          strong crying and tears! canst mark that clotted sweat as it crimsons
          the frozen soil, strong enough to unloose the curse! dost see him in
          the desperate agony of his spirit, crushed, broken, bruised beneath
          the feet of the Justice in the olive press of God! Justice, is not
          that enough? will not that content thee? In a whole hell there is not
          so much dignity of vengeance as there is in the garden of Gethsemane.
          Art thou not yet satisfied? Come, Justice, to the hall of Pilate.
          Seest thou that man arraigned, accused, charged with sedition and with
          blasphemy! See him taken to the guard-room, spat upon, buffetted with
          hands, crowned with thorns, robed in mockery, and insulted with a reed
          for a sceptre. I say, Justice, seest thou that man, and dost thou know
          that he is "God over all blessed for ever?" and yet he endureth all
          this to satisfy thy demands! Art thou not content with that? Dost thou
          still frown? Let me show thee this man on the pavement. He is
          stripped. Stand, Justice, and listen to those stripes, those bloody
          scourges, and as they fall upon his devoted back and plough deep
          furrows there, dost thou see thong-full after thong-full of his
          quivering flesh torn from his poor bare back! Art not content yet,
          Justice? Then what will satisfy thee? "Nothing," says Justice, "but
          his death." Come thou with me, then thou canst see that feeble man
          hurried through the streets! Seest thou him driven to the top of
          Calvary, hurled on his back, nailed to the transverse wood? Oh,
          Justice, canst thou see his dislocated bones, now that his cross is
          lifted up? Stand with me, O Justice, see him as he weeps, and sighs,
          and cries; see his soul-agonies! Canst thou read that tale of terror
          which is veiled in that flesh and blood? Come, listen Justice, whilst
          thou hearest him cry, "I thirst," and whilst thou seest the burning
          fever devouring him, till he is dried up like a potsherd, and his
          tongue cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst! And lastly, O
          Justice, dost thou see him bow his head, and die? "Yes," saith
          Justice, "and I am satisfied; I have nothing that I can ask more; I am
          fully content; my uttermost demands are more than satisfied."
        </p>
        <p>
          And am I not content, too? Guilty though I am and vile, can I not
          plead that this bloody sacrifice is enough to satisfy God's demands
          against me? Oh, yes, I trust I can,
        </p>
        <p>"My faith doth lay its hand,</p>
        <p>On that dear head of thine,</p>
        <p>While like a penitent I stand,</p>
        <p>And here confess my sin."</p>
        <p>
          Jesus, I believe that they sufferings were for me; and I believe that
          they are more than enough to satisfy for all my sins. By faith I cast
          myself at the foot of thy cross and cling to it. This is my only hope,
          my shelter, and my shield. It cannot be, that God can smite me now.
          Justice itself prevents, for when Justice once is satisfied it were
          injustice if it should ask for more. Now, is it not clear enough to
          the eye of every one, whose soul has been aroused, that Justice stands
          no longer in the way of the sinner's pardon? God can be just, and yet
          the justifier. He has punished Christ, why should he punish twice for
          one offence? Christ has died for all his people's sins, and if thou
          art in the covenant, thou art one of Christ's people. Damned thou
          canst not be. Suffer for thy sins thou canst not. Until God can be
          unjust, and demand two payments for one debt, he cannot destroy the
          soul for whom Jesus died. "Away goes universal redemption," says one.
          Yes, away it goes, indeed. I am sure there is nothing about that in
          the Word of God. A redemption that does not redeem is not worth my
          preaching, or your hearing, Christ redeemed every soul that is saved;
          no more, and no less. Every spirit that shall be seen in heaven Christ
          bought. If he had redeemed those in hell, they never could have come
          there. He has bought his people with his blood, and they alone shall
          he bring with him. "But who are they?" says one. Thou art one, if thou
          believest. Thou art one if thou repentest of thy sin. If thou wilt now
          take Christ to be thy all in all, then thou art one of his; for the
          covenant must prove a lie, and God must be unjust, and justice must
          become unrighteousness, and love must become cruelty, and the cross
          must become a fiction, ere thou canst be condemned if thou trustest in
          Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>This is the way in which Justice ceases to be the enemy of souls.</p>
        <p>
          II. The second text says that not only can God be just, but it says
          something more: it says, "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and
          just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
          unrighteousness." Now, if I understand this text, it means this: that
          IT IS AN ACT OF JUSTICE ON GOD'S PART TO FORGIVE THE SINNER WHO MAKES
          A CONFESSION OF HIS SIN TO GOD. Mark! not that the sinner deserves
          forgiveness: that can never be. Sin can never merit anything but
          punishment, and repentance is no atonement for sin. Not that God is
          bound from any necessity of his nature to forgive every one that
          repents, because repentance has not in itself sufficient efficacy and
          power to merit forgiveness at the hand of God. Yet, nevertheless, it
          is a truth that, because God is just, he must forgive every sinner who
          confesses his sin. And if he did not -- and mark, it is a bold thing
          to say, but it is warranted by the text -- if a sinner should be led
          truly and solemnly to make confession of his sins and cast himself on
          Christ, if God did not forgive him, then he were not the God that he
          is represented to be in the Word of God: he were a God unjust, and
          that may God forbid, such a thing must not, cannot be. But how, then,
          is it that Justice itself actually demands that every soul that
          repents should be pardoned? It is so. The same Justice that just now
          stood with a fiery sword in his hand, like the cherubim of old keeping
          the way of the tree of life, now goes hand in hand with the sinner.
          "Sinner," he says, "I will go with thee. When thou goest to plead for
          pardon I will go and plead for thee. Once I spoke against thee: but
          now I am so satisfied with what Christ has done, that I will go with
          thee and plead for thee. I will change my language I will not say a
          word to oppose thy pardon, but I will go with thee and demand it. It
          is but an act of justice that God should now forgive." And the sinner
          goes up with Justice, and what has Justice got to say? Why, it says
          this: "God must forgive the repenting sinner, if he be just, according
          to his promise." A God who could break his promise were unjust. We do
          not believe in men who tell us lies. I have known some of so gentle a
          disposition, that they could never say "No;" if they were asked to do
          a thing they have said, "Yes." But they have never earned a character
          for it, when they have said "Yes," and afterwards did not fulfil. It
          is not so with God. He is no tender-hearted being who promises more
          than he can perform, and no forgetful one who promises what afterwards
          shall slip from his memory. Every word which God utters shall be
          fulfilled, whether it be decree, threatening, or promise. Sinner! go
          to God with a promise in your hand. -- "Lord thou hast said, He that
          confesseth his sin, and forsaketh it, shall find mercy.' I confess my
          sin, and I forsake it: Lord, give me mercy!" Don't doubt but that God
          will give it you. You have his own pledge in your hand; you have his
          own bond in your keeping. Take that pledge and that bond before his
          throne of mercy, and that bond never shall be cancelled till it has
          been honoured. You shall see that promise fulfilled to the uttermost
          letter, though your sin be never so black. Suppose the promise you
          take should be this. "Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast
          out." "But," says the Law, "thou art one of the greatest sinners that
          ever lived." "Ay, but the promise says, Him that cometh,' and I come,
          and I claim the fulfillment of it." "No, but thou hast been a
          blasphemer." "I know it, but the promise says, Him that cometh,' and I
          come, and blasphemer though I am, I claim the promise." "But thou hast
          been a thief, thou hast deceived thy neighbour, and thou hast robbed
          men." "I have, but the promise says, Him that cometh to me I will in
          no wise case out;' I come, and I claim the promise. It does not say
          anything at all about character in the promise: it says, Him that
          cometh,' and I come, and if I be black as the devil, nevertheless God
          is true, and I claim the promise. I confess all that can be said
          against me. Will God be untrue, and send a seeking soul away with a
          promise unfulfilled? Never!" "But," says one, "you have lived many
          years in this way; your conscience has often checked you, and you have
          resisted conscience often: it is too late now." "But I have the
          promise, Him that cometh,' -- there is no time stipulated in it --
          'Him that cometh;' I come, and O God, thou canst not break the
          promise!" Challenge God by faith, and you will see that he will be as
          good as his word to you. Though you are worse than words can tell,
          God, I repeat it, as long as he is just, must honour his own promise.
          Go and confess your sin, trust in Christ, and you shall find pardon.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, again, not only did God make the promise, but according to the
          text man has been induced to act upon it; and, therefore, this becomes
          a double bond upon the justice of God. Suppose you made a promise to
          any man, that if such a thing was done, you would do something else,
          and suppose that man were to do something quite contrary to his own
          nature, quite abhorent to himself; but he did it nevertheless, because
          he expected to get great blessings thereby, do you mean to say you
          would tempt a man to do that, and put him to vast expense, and care
          and trouble, and then turn round and say? "There I shall have nothing
          to do with that promise: I only promised to make you do so-and-so,
          now, I will not fulfil my engagement." Why the man would turn about
          and call you base to make a promise to lead him to do something and
          then not fulfil your promise. Now, God has said, "If we confess our
          sins and trust in Christ, we shall have mercy." You have done it; you
          have made the most abject and sincere confession, and you do declare
          that you have no trust but the blood and righteousness of Christ. Now,
          on the faith of the promise you have been led into this state. Do you
          imagine when God has brought you through much pain and agony of mind
          to repent of sin, to give up self-righteousness, and rely on Christ,
          he will afterwards turn round and tell you he did not mean what he
          said? It cannot be -- it cannot be. Suppose, now you were about to
          engage a man to be your servant, and you say to him, renounce such a
          situation, give that up; come and take a house in the neighbourhood
          where I live, and I will take you to be my servant." Suppose he does
          it, and you then say, "I am glad for your own sake that you have left
          your master, still I will not take you." What would he say to you? He
          would say, "I gave up my situation on the faith of your promise, and
          now, you break it." Ah! but it never can be said of Almighty God,
          that, if a sinner acted on the faith of his promise, then that promise
          was not kept. God ceases to be God when he ceases to have mercy upon
          the soul who seeks pardon through the blood of Christ. No, he is a
          just God, "Faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us
          from all unrighteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          One more aspect of this case. God's justice demands that the sinner
          should be forgiven if he seeks mercy, for this reason: Christ died on
          purpose to secure pardon for every seeking soul. Now, I hold it to be
          an axiom, a self-evident truth, that whatever Christ died for he will
          have. I cannot believe that when he paid to his Father the price of
          blood, and groans and tears, he bought something which the Father will
          not give him. Now, Christ died to purchase the pardon of sin for all
          those who believe on him, and do you suppose that the Father will rob
          him of that which be has bought so dearly? No, God were untrue to his
          own Son, he would break his oath to his well-beloved and only begotten
          Son, if he were not to give pardon, peace, and purity to every soul
          that comes to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Oh, I would that I
          could preach it as with a tongue of thunder everywhere, God is just,
          and yet the justifier of him that believeth. God is just to forgive us
          our sins, if we confess them; just to cleanse us from all
          unrighteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now, to close. I must just enter into some little EXPLANATION OF
          THE TWO GREAT DUTIES THAT ARE TAUGHT IN THE TWO TEXTS. Tile first duty
          is faith -- "believeth in Christ;" the second text is confession --
          "if we confess our sins."
        </p>
        <p>
          I will begin with confession first. Expect not that God will forgive
          you until you confess; not in the general confession of a prayer book,
          but in the particular confession of your own inmost heart. You are not
          to confess to a priest or a man, unless you have offended against him.
          In that respect, if you have been an offender against any man, be at
          peace with him and ask his pardon for aught you have done against him.
          It is a proof of a noble mind when you can ask pardon of another for
          having done amiss. Whenever grace comes into the heart it will lead
          you to make amends for any injury which you have done either by word
          or deed to any of your fellow-men; and you cannot expect that you
          shall be forgiven of God until you have forgiven men, and have been
          ready to make peace with those who are now your enemies. That is a
          beautiful trait in the character of a true Christian. I have heard of
          Mr. John Wesley, that he was attended in most of his journeyings by
          one who loved him very much, and was willing, I believe, to have died
          for him. Still he was a man of a very stubborn and obstinate
          disposition, and Mr. Wesley was not perhaps the very kindest man at
          all times. Upon one occasion he said to this man, "Joseph, take these
          letters to the post." "I will take them after preaching, sir." "Take
          them now, Joseph," said Mr. Wesley. "I wish to hear you preach, sir;
          and there will be sufficient time for the post after service." "I
          insist upon your going now, Joseph." "I will not go at present" "You
          won't!" "No, sir." "Then you and I must part," said Mr. Wesley. "Very
          good, sir." The good men slept over it. Both were early risers. At
          four o'clock the next morning, the refractory helper was accosted
          with, "Joseph, have you considered what I said -- that we must part?"
          "Yes, sir." "And must we part?" "please yourself, sir." "Will you ask
          my pardon, Joseph?" "No, sir." "You won't?" "No, sir." "Then I will
          ask yours, Joseph!" Poor Joseph was instantly melted, and they were at
          once reconciled. When once the grace of God has entered the heart, a
          man ought to be ready to seek forgiveness for an injury done to
          another. There is nothing wrong in a man confessing an offense against
          a fellow-man, and asking pardon for the wrong he has done him. It you
          have done aught, then, against any man, leave thy gift before the
          altar, and go and make peace with him, and then come and make peace
          with God. You are to make confession of your sin to God. Let that be
          humble and sincere. You cannot mention every offense, but do not hide
          one. If you hide one it will be a millstone round your neck to sink
          you into the lowest hell. Confess that you are vile in your nature,
          evil in your practice, that in you there is no good thing. Lie as low
          as ever you can at the footstool of divine grace, and confess that you
          are a wretch undone unless God have mercy upon you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, the next duty is faith. Whilst thou art lying there in the dust
          turn thine eye to Christ and say. "Black as I am, and hell-deserving
          as I confess myself to be, I believe that Jesus Christ died for the
          penitent; and inasmuch as he died, he died that the penitent might not
          die. I believe thy merits to be great; I believe thy blood to be
          efficacious; and more than that, I risk my eternal salvation -- and
          yet it is no risk -- I venture my eternal salvation upon the merit of
          thy blood. Jesus, I cannot save myself. Cast the skirts of thy
          blood-red atonement over me. Come, take me in thine arms; come, wrap
          me in thy crimson vest, and tell me I am thine. I will trust in
          nothing else but thee. Nothing I can do or ever did shall be my
          dependence. I rely simply and entirely upon thy mighty cross, upon
          which thou didst die for sinners."
        </p>
        <p>
          My dear hearers, as to any probability of your being lost after such a
          confession and such a faith, I assure you there is neither possibility
          nor probability thereof. You are saved; you are saved in time, you are
          saved in eternity. Your sins are forgiven; your iniquities are all put
          away. In this life you shall be fed, and blessed and kept. Remaining
          sin within you shall be overcome and conquered; and you shall see his
          face at the last in glory everlasting, when he shall come in the glory
          of his Father, and all his holy angels with him. "Whosoever believeth
          on the Son of God hath eternal life, and shall never come into
          condemnation." "He that believeth on the Lord Jesus and is baptized,
          shall be saved; and he that believeth not shall be damned."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now in conclusion, I have tried to tell out simply and plainly the
          story of how God's justice is satisfied, and has become the sinners
          friend, and I look for fruit, for where the gospel is simply preached
          it is never preached in vain. Only let us go home and pray now, that
          we may know the Saviour. Let us pray that others may know him too. If
          you are convinced of sin, my dear friends, do not lose a moment. Go to
          your chamber as soon as you get home, shut to your door, go alone to
          Jesus, and there repeat your confession, and once more affirm your
          faith in Christ; and you shall have that peace with God which the
          world cannot give, and which the world cannot take away. Your troubled
          conscience shalt find rest: your feet shall be on a rock; and a new
          song shall be in your mouth, even praise for evermore.
