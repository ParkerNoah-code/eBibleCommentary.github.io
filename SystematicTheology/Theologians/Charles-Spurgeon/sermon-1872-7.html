        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1034)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's Day Morning, February 4th, 1872, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes
          the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: But this man,
          after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the
          right hand of God: From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made
          his footstool. For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them
          that are sanctified." -- Hebrews 10:11-14.
        </p>
        <p>
          WE SHALL HAVE this morning to repeat a truth which has sounded forth
          from this pulpit many hundreds of times; but we shall offer no apology
          for our repetitions, seeing that the truth to be preached is one which
          cannot too often be proclaimed. If you lift up your eyes at night to
          the stars what a wonderful variety of celestial scenery is there! The
          astronomer can turn his telescope first to one quarter of the heavens,
          and then to another, and find an endless change in the sublimities
          which meet his gaze. Such are the doctrines of the gospel; they are
          full of variety and beauty, and glory: but yet in the heavens one or
          two conspicuous constellations are more often regarded by the human
          eye than all the rest put together. The mariner looks for the Great
          Bear, the pointers, and the pole star; or, if he should cross the
          equator, he gazes on the southern cross. Though these stars have been
          often looked upon, it is never thought to be superfluous that
          practical men should still observe them. Night by night they have
          their watchers; for by them ten thousand sails are steered. I should
          suppose that in those days, now happily past, when slavery reigned in
          the Southern States of America, the Negro if he desired liberty for
          his boy would be sure, whatever else of the stars he did not teach
          him, to point out to him the star of liberty. "Know well, my child,
          those friendly stars which point to the lone star of liberty. Follow
          that light till it leads you to a land. There fetters no longer clank
          on human limbs." Even so it seems to me that certain doctrines, and
          especially the doctrines of atonement and justification by faith, are
          like these guiding stars; and we ought frequently to point them out,
          make sure that our children know them, and that all who listen to us,
          whatever else they may be mistaken about, are clear about these, the
          guides of men to the haven of freedom and eternal rest. I believe if I
          should preach to you the atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ every
          Sabbath-day and that twice, and nothing else, my ministry would not be
          unprofitable, perhaps it might be more profitable than it is; so we
          are coming to the same truth which we handled last Sabbath evening.
          Many dishes are put upon the table at intervals, but bread and salt
          are always placed there; and so we will have the atonement again, and
          again, and again; for this is the bread and salt of the gospel feast.

          I purpose, this morning, to handle the text thus. First, we will read,
          mark, and learn it; and then, secondly, we will ask God's grace that
          we may inwardly digest it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Come, then, first of all to THE READING, MARKING, AND LEARNING OF
          IT; and you will observe that in it there are three things very
          clearly stated. The atoning sacrifice of Jesus, our great High Priest,
          is set forth first by way of contrast; then its character is
          described; and, then, thirdly, its consequences are mentioned. Briefly
          upon each.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it is set forth by way of contrast -- contrast with that
          ancient dispensation which was of divine origin, which conveyed much
          blessing to Israel, and which had the divine approval resting upon it.
          In that old dispensation, the first point mentioned in the text is,
          that there were many priests. "For every priest standeth" -- implying
          that there were several. There were many priests at the same time --
          the sacrifices of the temple were too numerous to have been all of
          them performed by one man: all the descendants of Aaron were set apart
          to this work, and even then they required the aid of the Levites in
          certain inferior duties. And as there were many priests at one time,
          so there were many in succession. As a priest died, he was succeeded
          by his sons. By reason of infirmity, they were not able to continue in
          their office even through the whole of their lifetime; there was a
          certain period at which they were commanded to surrender their office
          to younger men. By reason of mortality the priesthood was perpetually
          changing; one high priest died, and was succeeded by another. Now the
          reason for the existence of many priests was this, that no one priest
          had accomplished the work of expiation. The good man has gone to his
          fathers and offered up the last of the morning lambs -- but the
          morning lambs must still be offered. The high priest is dead, and
          there shall be no more opportunity for him to enter into that which is
          within the veil, but there must be a new high priest appointed, for
          the work is not finished. There were many priests, and as one
          generation passed away, another inherited the mitre. Now, herein is
          the glory of Christ that he is but one, and to this our attention is
          called by the apostle; that whereas there were many priests, and the
          sacrifices were hereby proved to be incomplete, since others had to
          take up the work; here is but one priest for ever, and he has finished
          his work, and therefore sits down at the right hand of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          In further contrast, we observe that as there were many priests, so
          there were many sacrifices for sins. The sacrifice was offered once,
          but sin was not put away, and therefore had to be offered again. The
          great day of atonement came every year, wherein sin was afresh brought
          to remembrance. There was a day of atonement last year, but the people
          are unforgiven, and there must be a day of atonement this year; and
          when that day is over and the priest has come forth in his holy and
          beautiful apparel, with the breastplate gleaming in the light of God,
          Israel may rejoice for awhile, but there is one thought that will
          sadden her; there must be an atonement day next year, for sin still
          remaineth upon Israel, notwithstanding all that the house of Aaron can
          do by all their sacrifices. Yea, and moreover, remembrance of sin was
          of necessity made every day. There was the lamb for the morning, the
          innocent victim was slaughtered and burned; but the morning sacrifice
          did not put away the day's sin, for as the sun began to descend in the
          west another victim must be brought, and so on each morning and each
          night, victim, victim, victim, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice,
          because the expiation was always incomplete. But our blessed Lord,
          "the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world," was
          sacrificed but once, and that one sacrifice hath completed his
          expiatory work. In very truth his was a sacrifice of nobler name and
          richer blood than theirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Follow the contrast a little further, and observe the Apostle's
          assertion that the repeated sacrifices of the law could never take
          away sin. Those must have been strangely blind who thought they could.
          How could the blood of bulls and of goats put away sin? What
          conceivable connection can there be, except in symbol, between the
          death pangs of a beast and the sin of a man before God? The principle
          of substitution was by the legal sacrifices clearly set forth, but
          that was all; those offerings did not and could not provide the actual
          substitute. The principle of vicarious sacrifice they plainly
          unfolded, but they provided no real sin-offering. How could they?
          Where but in the Christ of God could a propitiation be found? Where
          else is there one who could in our nature make recompense to the
          injured law of God?
        </p>
        <p>
          You will observe, dear brethren, that the words used in the text are
          these, "Can never take away sin." The word is, "Can never strip off
          sin." As if our sins were like filthy garments -- the vestures of our
          disgrace -- these could not be taken from us by the daily ministering
          of priests. There was no power in their sacrifices to remove the
          polluted coverings. Yet the priests were very diligent, for "every
          priest standeth" in the posture of activity, and they were persevering
          too, for "every priest standeth daily." They were obedient too, for
          they did not offer sacrifices according to their own devices, but, as
          the text saith, "the same sacrifices" -- that is to say, such as were
          ordained of God. The priests were both diligent, constant, and
          obedient, and the principle of the truth was in their offerings --
          viz., the doctrine of substitution; yet sin still remained upon the
          consciences of the offerers, and none of them were made perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark well one inference from this. If the sacrifices which were
          presented reverently and perpetually, according to God's own command,
          and were presented by men about whose priesthood there could be no
          manner of question -- for they had received it indisputably of the
          Lord -- if these offerings were of no service to the taking away of
          sin, it is clear enough that the offerings of so-called priests in
          these modern times cannot have any efficacy. Here is a priesthood,
          certainly appointed of God, offering victims ordained by divine order,
          and yet their service does not put away sin. How much less, then, can
          it be wise to trust in doubtful priests, who present sacrifices
          unwarranted by the word of God. Their descent cannot be proved, their
          title their pretensions of one sect are ridiculed by another, they are
          all alike deceivers; have done with them and rest alone in Jesus, the
          apostle and high priest of our profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Jerusalem has no sacrifice in all her flocks, what use can it be to
          look to Rome? If Aaron's seed cannot put away sin, to what end shall
          we look to the shavelings of Antichrist?
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the apostle's words, we come to the character of our Lord's
          sacrifice, and we perceive, in reading, that his priesthood was
          personal, and entirely within himself. There is but one true atoning
          priest. The twelfth verse says, "this man." The word "man" is not in
          the original; it is "this," "this priest," if you will; "this man," if
          you please; but its vagueness may make us think that the apostle
          scarcely knew what to say. You see the stars and the moon in their
          brightness, but suddenly they are all eclipsed and lost in a superior
          light. What can this glory be which has paled their fires? It is the
          sun rising in his strength. So, while we are beholding the priesthood
          of Aaron with all its excellence, it suddenly ceases to shine, because
          of the glory which excelleth, the radiant presence of one, for whom,
          like heaven's manna, it is not easy to find one fully descriptive
          name. Shall we call him "man?" Blessed be his name; he is so, our near
          kinsman, the "Son of Man." Shall we call him "priest?" He is so.
          Blessed be his name; he is the true Melchisedec. Shall we call him
          "God?" Well may we do so, for he counts it not robbery to be equal
          with God. But this one divinely mysterious person -- this unique and
          solitary high-priest, accomplishes what the many priests of Aaron's
          race could not compass. They were weak, but he is allsufficient. He
          has wrought out eternal redemption, and made an end of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note well, that none stand with him at the altar; none is appointed to
          aid him, neither before him nor after him is there one to share his
          office. He is without father, without mother, without predecessor, and
          without successor. He stands alone and by himself, this glorious one
          who looked and there was no man, and therefore his own arm brought
          salvation; he trod the wine-press alone, and of the people there was
          none with him. Jesus, the sole sacrificing priest of our profession,
          has completed what the long line of the Levitical priesthood must have
          left for ever incomplete.
        </p>
        <p>
          And we are told further, by the apostle, that as there was but one
          priest, so there was only one sacrifice. He "offered one sacrifice for
          sins." He himself was the sacrifice; his body the altar, himself the
          priest, himself also the victim. On Calvary's tree he presented
          himself a substitute for human guilt, and there he bore the crushing
          weight of Jehovah's wrath in his own body, on the behalf of all his
          people. On him their sins were laid, and he was numbered with the
          transgressors; and there he, in their stead, suffered what was due to
          the righteousness of God, and made atonement to divine justice for the
          sins of his people. This was done, not by many offerings, but by one
          sacrifice, and that one alone. Jesus offered no other sacrifice: he
          had never made one before, nor since, nor will he present another
          sacrifice in the future. His sin offering is one.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text adds further that, as there was but one sacrifice, so it was
          but once offered for ever, or, as puts it, "Once for all." "Christ was
          once offered to bear the sins of many." There is in the Scriptures no
          such idea as that of Christ perpetually offering himself; it is a
          childish invention of superstition. We are expressly told that he
          offered himself "once." Under the law the lamb was offered many times,
          the same sacrifices were repeated; but our Lord exclaimed, "It is
          finished," and concluded all his sacrificing works. He "offered one
          sacrifice for sins for ever." I do not know how your Bibles happen to
          be marked as to the comma in the passage; mine, now before me, reads
          thus: -- "After he had offered one sacrifice for sin for ever sat
          down;" but that which I use at home is marked in the other way --
          "After he had offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down." We
          do not quite know where the comma should be; some of the best scholars
          maintain that it should be joined to the preceding words, others that
          it belongs to the succeeding. It does not involve any point of
          doctrine; and it may be read whichever way you please, without error.
          I think, however, the preponderating testimony is in favor of its
          being read, "he offered one sacrifice for sins for ever;" at any rate
          those words express a great and precious truth. Look back as far as
          you can, there was no sacrifice for sins, except the "lamb slain from
          before the foundation of the world;" look on as far as you will, till
          this present dispensation shall have completed its circle, and men
          shall have passed the judgment-seat, and you shall find no atonement
          for sin except this one -- it stands alone, shining as a lone star, or
          a solitary rock in the midst of a raging sea. The propitiation which
          God has set forth was and ever must be one. The Lord Jesus offered
          himself once, once only, once only for ever: there is no other atoning
          priest, no other sacrifice, and there is no repetition of that one
          sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we go on to notice the results of Christ's one offering, which
          are, in the text, described as threefold -- towards himself, his
          enemies, and his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Towards himself: After he had offered one sacrifice for sins he for
          ever sat down at the right hand of God. Every priest, under the old
          dispensation, stood; but this man sat down, and the posture is very
          instructive. The typical priests stood because there was work to do;
          still must they present their sacrifices; but our Lord sits down
          because there is no more sacrificial work to do; atonement is
          complete, he has finished his task. There were no seats in the
          tabernacle. Observe the Levitical descriptions and you will see that
          there were no resting-places for the priests in the holy place. Not
          only were none allowed to sit, but there was nothing whatever to sit
          upon. According to the rabbis, the king might sit in the holy places,
          and, perhaps, David did sit there; if so, he was a striking type of
          Christ sitting as king. A priest never sat in the tabernacle, he was
          under a dispensation which did not afford rest, and was not intended
          to give it, a covenant of works which gives the soul no repose. Jesus
          sits in the holy of holies, and herein we see that his work is
          finished.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is more teaching in the passage. He "sat down;" this shows that
          he took possession of the holy place. Under the law, when the priest
          had done his work, what did he do? He went home. Neither the temple
          nor the tabernacle was his home. If you had asked a priest, "Where
          dwellest thou?" he would have said, "amongst the tribe of Levi yonder
          I have my abode." But this man, when he had finished his work, sat
          down in the holy place, because he was at home, not a servant only but
          a son, yea, and Lord of the whole house; and, therefore, he took his
          own seat therein by right. It is a joyful truth that he did this
          representatively, to show us that while the law gave no permanent
          possession, and could not establish the seed of Israel in possession
          of sacred privileges, the gospel gives us an abiding place amongst the
          children of God, who dwell in his house for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle tells us where this seat of Christ was. He says, he "sat
          down at the right hand of God." This indicates the highest glory
          possible; our poet calls it
        </p>
        <p>"The highest place that heaven affords."</p>
        <p>
          There was no nobler position, or Jesus should have had it. Note the
          remark of this same apostle in the first chapter of this epistle:
          "Unto which of the angels said he at any time, sit thou at my right
          hand?" Angels do not sit at the right hand of God; they are constantly
          in the place of service, and therefore they stand ready to fly on
          their Master's commands; but Jesus sits in the highest seat as Lord
          over his own house, clothed with honor and dignity, enthroned in the
          place of favor at the right hand of God. Sitting there he is to be
          viewed as clothed with everlasting power, "able to save unto the
          uttermost them that come unto God by him." "Exalted to be a Prince and
          a Savior to give repentance unto Israel, and remission of sins;" no
          more the "despised and rejected, the Man of Sorrows, and acquainted
          with grief," no more in weakness and dishonor taken out to die; he
          sits as a king upon his throne, distributing royal bounties, coequal
          with Jehovah himself. As King of kings, Jesus Christ is exalted at the
          right hand of the Father. So much with regard to the result of the
          Redeemer's passion in reference to himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, observe carefully the result of his offering with regard to his
          enemies. He sits there "expecting till they be made his footstool."
          They are crushed already; sin which is the sting of death has been
          removed, and the law which was the strength of sin has been satisfied.
          Sin being put away by Christ's death, he has effectually broken the
          jawteeth of all his enemies. When Jesus Christ offered himself unto
          God he fulfilled that ancient promise, "The seed of the woman shall
          bruise the serpent's head." Christ has set his foot upon the old
          dragon's head, and crushed out his power. Still, however, a feeble
          fight is kept up; feeble, I say, for so it is to Christ, though to us
          it seems vigorous. Sin and Satan within us, and all Christ's enemies
          without us, including death itself, are vainly raging against the
          Christ of God, for every day they are being put beneath his feet;
          every day as the battle rages the victory turns unto the enthroned
          Christ. In us I trust sin has been put beneath Christ's feet; in
          thousands of others it shall yet be so. Jesus upon the throne expects
          the growth of that victory till all his enemies shall be utterly and
          ignominiously beaten. "O long expected day, begin!" Father, fulfill
          thy Son's expectations, for thy saints expect it in him. Let the time
          come when every enemy shall be beneath his feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will not tarry, however, on that, but close this exposition of the
          words of the text by noticing the effect of Christ's death upon his
          own people. We are informed that he hath "perfected" them. What a
          glorious word! Those for whom Christ has died were perfected by his
          death. It does not mean that he made them perfect in characters so
          that they are no longer sinners, but that he made those for whom he
          died perfectly free from the guilt of sin. When Christ took their sins
          upon himself, sin remained no longer upon them, for it could not be in
          two places at one and the same time; if it was on Christ it was not
          upon them; they were acquitted at the bar of God when Christ was, on
          their behalf, "numbered with the transgressors." When Jesus suffered
          the penalty due to his people's sins to the last jot and tittle, then
          their sins ceased to be, and the covenant was fulfilled: "Their sins
          and iniquities will I remember no more for ever." There was a clean
          sweep made of sin: "He hath finished transgression, and made an end of
          sin;" and that for all his people. They want no other washing, no
          further purging, as far as pardon of sin and acceptance with God in
          the matter of justification are concerned, for they are all perfected
          by his sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
          His people are described in the text as "them that are sanctified,"
          and you must beware of misunderstanding that word as though it meant
          those who are made perfectly holy in character. The word implies an
          inward work of grace, but it means a great deal more. The passage
          should be read "He hath perfected for ever them that are being
          sanctified," for it is in the present in the Greek. The text is not to
          be made to say that those who are perfectly sanctified are perfected,
          that would be a common-place, self-evident truth; but the great high
          priest perfected for ever those who are being sanctified. Now,
          sanctification means, primarily, the setting apart of a people by God
          to be holy to himself. Election is sanctification virtually; all God's
          people were sanctified -- set apart and made holy to the Lord -- in
          the eternal purpose and sovereign decree or ever the earth was. Christ
          has by his death perfected all who were sanctified or set apart in
          election. This purpose of sanctification is carried out further when
          those set apart are called out by grace. When effectual grace
          separates men from the world by conversion and regeneration, then they
          become, in another sense, the sanctified; they are set apart even as
          Christ set apart himself, dedicated to God's service, and separated
          from sinners. As the work which began at regeneration is continued and
          carried on in them, they are in another aspect sanctified; they are
          realising in themselves that sanctification or dedication to God,
          which was theirs from before the foundation of the world. The text
          relates not only to those in heaven who are perfectly sanctified, but
          it relates to all who were set apart in the purposes of grace, that as
          far as their pardon and justification are concerned, Christ perfected
          them for ever when he offered up himself without spot unto God.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We have thus studied the interpretation of the words, reading,
          marking, and learning them. Now, I ask your earnest attention while we
          try to DIGEST THESE TRUTHS. It is in the digestion that the real
          nutriment shall come to our hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          All ye who desire eternal life lend me your ears, for this matter
          concerns you -- observe that the whole business of this passage
          concerns sinners. The verse speaks about the Jewish priests who
          offered sacrifices for sins, and then it further speaks concerning
          Christ Jesus who has put away sin. O ye guilty, the gospel is meant
          for you. If there be any of you who are innocent and pure, and without
          spot, for you I have no words of consolation; but oh, ye sinners, the
          gospel is for you, for you the priesthood and the substitution of
          Jesus, for you his death on earth, for you his reign and power in
          heaven. This fact ought to encourage every trembling conscience. Are
          any of you saying, "Ah, I shall never be saved, I am so guilty?"
          Believe not that lie of Satan. "The Son of Man has come to seek and to
          save that which was lost." The gospel has for its special aim and
          intent the putting away of sin, and therefore it is suitable to your
          case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hearken then further to me. See in the text the position out of which
          you should labor to escape. It is the position of those who stand
          daily ministering and daily offering sacrifices which can never put
          away sin. You are seeking mercy and I know what you are doing; you are
          going about to establish a righteousness of your own. You thought, "I
          will pray very regularly," -- you have done so for months, but prayers
          can never put away sin. What is there in prayer itself that can have
          merit in it to make atonement for sin? You have read the Scriptures
          regularly, for which I am most glad, but this you always ought to have
          done, and if you now do it most commendably, in what way will that put
          away sin? "Ah, but I have been a regular attendant at a place of
          worship." It is well you should, for "faith cometh by hearing;" but I
          see no connection between the mere fact of your sitting in a place of
          worship and the putting away of sin; you know it has not eased your
          conscience yet, but has even increased your sense of sin. Perhaps some
          of you have for years been trying to save yourselves, and you have got
          no further; you feel as if you were further off than ever you were.
          "Wherefore do you spend your money for that which is not bread, and
          your labor for that which profiteth not?" Why stand you daily at the
          altar offering that which can never put away sin? It would be
          infinitely wiser to flee to the sacrifice which can atone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, follow on the text, and, oh, may it come into your very soul, for
          its practical teaching is that the one sole object of faith for the
          pardon of sin, is the man, the priest, Christ Jesus. "This man," says
          the Apostle, "offered one sacrifice for sins for ever." If thou
          wouldst have peace of heart, thou must get it only from this one
          glorious person, the Christ of God. I tell thee solemnly, thou wilt
          damn thyself by thy prayers, and thy tears, and thy repentings, and
          thy church goings, and thy chapel goings, as easily as by blasphemy
          and fornication, if thou trustest in them; for if thou makest a Savior
          and an idol of thy best works, they are accursed. Though thine idol be
          of purest gold, it is as much an abomination unto the living God as if
          thou hadst made it of filth. There must be no looking anywhere but to
          Jesus, not in any measure or degree. He who looks partly to Jesus, and
          partly to himself, looks not to Christ at all. If a man shall put one
          foot upon the land and the other on the sea -- the foot that is on the
          land will not avail him, he must certainly fall, because his other
          standing place is weak. If a chain be made strong enough to bear huge
          weights in every portion except one link, yet as we all know its
          strength is not to be measured by the stronger portions, but by the
          weak link; and if you have one weak link in your hope, if you are
          resting in anything you are or hope to be, or can do or feel, that one
          weak link will snap and ruin you for ever.
        </p>
        <p>"None but Jesus, none but Jesus,</p>
        <p>Can do helpless sinners good."</p>
        <p>
          From top to bottom, from foundation to pinnacle, our hopes must be in
          the work of Jesus, and we must trust in him alone, or else we shall
          build in vain. "Other foundation can no man lay than that which is
          laid." Other hope beneath the skies there is none. O soul, learn the
          uselessness of looking to anything but Christ; but, be thou assured of
          this, if thou wilt look to him, and to him alone, he will put away thy
          sin, nay, he has done it by the sacrifice of himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, here is another thought -- I would that you would drink
          it in as Gideon's fleece drank in the dew -- it is this: the efficacy
          of the atonement of Christ for sin is as great to-day as ever it was.
          He "offered one sacrifice for sins," for what? for a thousand years?
          No! But the text says "for ever!" -- for ever!
        </p>
        <p>"The dying thief rejoiced to see,</p>
        <p>That fountain in his day,</p>
        <p>Anal there may I, though vile as he,</p>
        <p>Wash all my sins away.</p>
        <p>Dear dying Lamb, thy precious blood,</p>
        <p>Shall never loose its power;</p>
        <p>Till all the ransomed church of God,</p>
        <p>Be saved to sin no more."</p>
        <p>
          "One sacrifice for sins for ever." The devil tells you it is of no use
          for you to believe in Christ, there is not efficacy for you, you have
          sinned away your day of grace; tell him he is a liar, Christ has
          offered one sacrifice for sins for ever; and while a man lives beneath
          the covenant of mercy, where the gospel is sounded in his ears, there
          is efficacy in the atonement for ever. The atoning sacrifice has no
          limit in its merit, the salvation of some has not drained it of even
          the smallest degree of its power. As the sunlight, though it be seen
          by millions of eyes, is as bright as ever it was, so is it with Jesus.
          Perhaps the Sun's fires may grow dull, and become dimmed in the course
          of ages, but it is certain that the eternal fount of mercy, the Sun of
          Righteousness, will never fail. He will continue to flood his people
          with the golden sunlight of his forgiving grace. He has made one
          sacrifice for sins for ever. I will come to him then. He is able to
          save me -- he is able to save me even though I were a sinner of
          seventy years of age. I will come to him, I will rest in him -- in him
          alone. Oh, believe me, if you do this you have eternal life abiding in
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          A further thought. The text leads me to say to you that it is utterly
          hopeless, if you desire salvation, for you to expect Jesus Christ to
          do anything more than he has already done. Many are waiting for a
          something, and they scarce know what. Now Jesus, when he died and went
          to heaven, perfected for ever all his work; and if you do not believe
          to-day in what he has done, there will be no surer grounds for belief
          to-morrow. If faith be difficult to me to-day, I must not expect that
          I shall have any more evidence, or that there will be any more truth
          for me to rely upon, if I live another twenty years. God has set forth
          Christ for you as guilty sinners to rest on; and if that is not enough
          for you, what more would you have? Christ has offered himself, and
          died and suffered in our stead, and gone into his glory; and, if you
          cannot depend upon him, what more would you have him do? Shall he come
          and die again? You have rejected him once; you would reject him though
          he died twice. But that cannot be done; there is enough in his
          sacrifice to answer all the purposes of mercy, and if you sin wilfully
          by rejecting him, "there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin, but a
          fearful looking for of judgment and of fiery indignation." This is the
          point; all the atonement that could save me in ten years time is here
          now; all that I can ever rely upon if I postpone all thoughts of
          faith, all is here already. There will be no improvement in Christ. He
          has perfected his work. Oh, poor troubled soul, rest thou on him now.
          While I put these words, as it were, into your mouths, how I wish I
          could put them into your hearts! How foolish you are who are looking
          for signs and wonders or else you will not believe. May the Spirit of
          God show you that Jesus is now able and willing to save you, and that
          all you have to do is to take what he has done, and simply trust him,
          and you shall be saved this morning, completely saved, perfected
          through his one sacrifice. There remaineth no more to be done by the
          Redeemer. He sits down, and he will not rise for any further
          sacrifice. He has finished his atonement and perfected those he means
          to save; and if you believe not in him, there remaineth no more
          sacrifice for sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, again, I want you, dearly beloved brethren, to gather from the
          text before us the true posture of every believer in Christ. "This
          man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down."
          If I am a believer that is my posture, if you are a believer that is
          yours, -- you are to sit down. Under the law there was no sitting
          down. Even at the Passover the Israelites stood with their loins girt
          and their staves in their hands. There was no sitting down. It is only
          at the gospel supper that our proper posture is that of recumbency,
          reclining, or sitting down, because our warfare is accomplished. They
          that have believed have entered into rest. Jesus hath given us rest,
          we are not traversing the wilderness, we are come unto mount Zion,
          unto the glorious assembly of the church of the first born whose names
          are written in heaven. Our justifying work is finished, finished by
          Christ. Sit down Christian, sit down and rest in thy Lord. There is
          much to be done as to fighting your sins, much to be done for Christ
          in the world, but so far as justification and forgiveness are
          concerned, rest is your proper place, peace in Christ Jesus your
          lawful portion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your position is also to be one of expectancy. Christ, when he sits
          down, expects his enemies to be made his footstool. Expect, O
          believer, the time when you shall be rid of all sin. Fight manfully
          against your inbred corruptions, struggle against sin as you see it in
          the outside world, and expect every day with holy faith that you shall
          get the victory. As Christ sits there expecting, he hath raised us up
          together and made us sit together in the heavenly places in himself;
          and we will sit there and look down upon this erring world, and expect
          the time when all evil shall be beneath our feet as it is beneath his.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, our posture is, once again, that of those who are perfected
          in Christ Jesus. How I wish that we could all realize this, and live
          in the power of it. If I am, indeed, a believer, I have nothing
          whatever to do in order to put away the guilt of my sins. I have much
          to do by faith to overcome the power of sin in me, and to seek after
          holiness; but so far as the guilt of transgression is concerned, Jesus
          Christ's one offering hath perfected all his people, there is not a
          sin remaining upon them, nor a trace of sin; they are "without spot,
          or wrinkle, or any such thing;" before God's sight they are perfectly
          lovely; they are not somewhat beautiful, but they are altogether
          lovely in Christ; they are accepted not in part but altogether,
          "accepted in the Beloved." When I get upon this strain, words are
          quite inadequate to express the emotions of my soul. This truth might
          well make David dance before the ark of the Lord -- to think that
          though black in ourselves, we are comely in Christ; though like the
          smokedried tents of Kedar we are foul, yet clothed in our Savior's
          beauties we are like the curtains of Solomon for glory. The glory of
          the text is that we are perfected for ever; not for to-morrow, and
          then suffered to fall from grace; not for the next twenty years, and
          then turned out of the covenant; but he hath perfected "for ever"
          those that are set apart. It is a work which abides like the worker
          himself, and while Christ sits on the throne his people cannot die;
          while his work remains for ever perfect, they are also for ever
          perfect in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, brethren, another practical point is this, that it becomes us to
          make the evidence of our interest in this gracious work more and more
          clear to others. The text says, "Hath perfected them that are
          sanctified," or set apart as holy unto God. We must be more and more
          set apart every day, we must labor after holiness; this must be our
          object, not in order that we may be saved, for we are saved already,
          but in order that by others it may be clearly seen that we are saved,
          and they seeing our good works may glorify our Father which is in
          heaven. If I have in myself no measure of holiness, how shall I be
          recognized as belonging to Christ? Is it not foolish presumption to
          say "I am perfect in Christ," if still my soul lives in sin, and loves
          it? May the Lord, by his Spirit, lead us in the ways of holiness, and
          then, walking in the light as he is in the light, we shall have
          fellowship one with another; and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
          shall cleanse us from all sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, brethren, it remains for us to recollect that Christ will be
          one of two things to every one of us here present: either we shall see
          him at the right hand of God and rejoice that he is lifted so high, or
          else we shall behold him there with horror as we writhe beneath his
          feet. For his people, perfected for ever, it is their heaven to think
          that Christ is highly exalted. Oh, would we not exalt him if we could!
          Is there anything in this world that we would keep back from him? Is
          there any suffering from which we would shrink if we could lift him
          high? I hope I can speak for all of God's people and say, the dearest
          object of our life is to honor him. Oh for high thrones for Jesus and
          bright crowns for Jesus!
        </p>
        <p>"Let him be crowned with majesty</p>
        <p>Who bowed his head to death!</p>
        <p>And be his honors sounded high</p>
        <p>By all things that have breath!"</p>
        <p>Let him have the highest place that heaven can yield him.</p>
        <p>
          But, if we will not believe his Godhead, if we will not trust him as
          the Mediator, if we have no part in his sacrifice, if we oppose his
          gospel, if we reject his claims to our obedience, there is another
          position we shall have to take up, and that is, beneath his feet.
          Those feet will be heavy indeed! They were pierced once; but if ever
          those pierced feet come upon you, they will crush you to powder.
          Nothing is so terrible as love when once it is turned to anger. Oil is
          soft, but how it burns. Inflame love into jealousy and it is cruel as
          the grave. Beware, ye that reject the Savior, for in the day when he
          cometh he will smite you with a rod of iron, and even his face, which
          is full of tenderness to-day, shall then be full of terror, and this
          shall be your cry, "Hide us ye mountains, ye rocks conceal us, from
          the face of him that sitteth upon the throne, and from the wrath of
          the Lamb." What a wonderful mixture of words, "The wrath of the Lamb."
          It is one of the most dreadful expressions in Scripture. The Lord
          grant we may never feel its terrible meaning. May his blood cleanse
          us. Amen.
