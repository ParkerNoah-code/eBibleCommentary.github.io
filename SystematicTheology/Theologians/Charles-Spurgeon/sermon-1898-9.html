          SINCE the Essay on Bunsen's Biblical Researches was in type, two more
          parts of the Bible for the People' have reached England. One includes
          a translation of Isaiah, but does not separate the distinguishable
          portions in the manner of Ewald, or with the freedom which the
          translator's criticisms would justify. The other part comprehends
          numerous dissertations on the Pentateuch, entering largely on
          questions of its origin, materials, and interpretation. There seems
          not an entire consistency of detail in these dissertations, and in the
          views deducible from the author's Egypt, but the same spirit and
          breadth of treatment pervade both. The analysis of the Levitical laws,
          by which the Mosaic germs are distinguished from subsequent
          accretions, is of the highest interest. The Ten Plagues of Egypt are
          somewhat rationalistically handled, as having a true historical basis,
          but as explicable by natural phenomena, indigenous to Egypt in all
          ages. The author's tone upon the technical definition of miracles, as
          distinct from great marvels and wonders, has acquired a firmer
          freedom, and would be represented by some among ourselves as painfully
          sceptical.' But even those who hesitate to follow the author in his
          details must be struck by the brilliant suggestiveness of his
          researches, which tend more and more, in proportion as they are
          developed, to justify the presentiment of their creating a new epoch
          in the science of Biblical criticism.
