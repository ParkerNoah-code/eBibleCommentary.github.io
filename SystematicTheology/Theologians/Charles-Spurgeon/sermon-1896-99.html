          5. The Lord at thy right hand hath broken in pieces kings in the day
          of his wrath.6. He shalt judge among the heathen, he shall fill all
          with ruins; he shall break the head over a great country.7. He shall
          drink of the torrent in the way, and therefore shall he elevate his
          head on high.

          5. The Lord at thy right hand In these words David celebrates the
          dreadful nature of that power which Christ possesses for the
          dispersion and destruction of his enemies; and by this means he
          affirms, that though encompassed by bands of deadly foes, yet their
          malignant attempts would not prevent God from upholding the King whom
          he has set up. It is proper to consider the expression, in the day of
          his wrath, by which we are instructed patiently to endure the cross,
          if it happen that God, for a time, conceals himself during the
          prevalence of the cruelty and fury of enemies; for he knows well when
          the full and fit season arrives for executing vengeance upon them.
          Next, he invests Christ with power over the nations, and the people of
          uncircumcised lips; meaning, that he was not chosen King to reign over
          the inhabitants of Judea only, but also to keep under his sway distant
          nations, agreeably to what was predicated of him in Psalm 2:8. And
          because, in all parts of the earth, as well as in the confines of
          Judea, there would be many rebellious and disobedient persons, he
          adverts also to their destruction; thus intimating, that all who
          should set themselves in opposition to Christ, must be made to fall
          before him, and their obstinacy be subdued.

          7 He shall drink Not a few interpreters, in my opinion, expound this
          verse in a very harsh manner: that the carnage would be so great, as
          to cause the blood of the slain to flow in torrents, out of which
          Christ, the Conqueror, might drink till he was satiated. Akin to this
          is the exposition of those who would have it to be a figurative
          representation of misery and grief, and thus descriptive of the many
          afflictions to which Christ was liable during this transitory life.
          The similitude seems rather to be drawn from the conduct of brave and
          powerful generals, who, when in hot pursuit of the enemy, do not
          suffer themselves to be diverted from their purpose by attending to
          luxuries; but, without kneeling down, are content to quench their
          thirst by drinking of the stream which they are passing. It was in
          this way that Gideon found out the brave and warlike soldiers;
          regarding such as kneeled down to drink as destitute of courage, he
          sent them back to their homes, Judges 7:5. It therefore appears to me
          that David figuratively attributes military prowess to Christ,
          declaring that he would not take time to refresh himself, but would
          hastily drink of the river which might come in his way. This is
          designed to strike his enemies with terror, intimating to them the
          rapid approach of impending destruction. Should any one be disposed to
          ask, Where then is that spirit of meekness and gentleness with which
          the Scripture elsewhere informs us he shall be endued? Isaiah 42:2, 3;
          61:1, 2; I answer, that, as a shepherd is gentle towards his flock,
          but fierce and formidable towards wolves and thieves; in like manner,
          Christ is kind and gentle towards those who commit themselves to his
          care, while they who wilfully and obstinately reject his yoke, shall
          feel with what awful and terrible power he is armed. In Psalm 2:9, we
          saw that he had in his hand an iron scepter, by which he will beat
          down all the obduracy of his enemies; and, accordingly, he is here
          said to assume the aspect of cruelty, with the view of taking
          vengeance upon them. Wherefore it becomes us carefully to refrain from
          provoking his wrath against us by a stiff-necked and rebellious
          spirit, when he is tenderly and sweetly inviting us to come to him.<br />
