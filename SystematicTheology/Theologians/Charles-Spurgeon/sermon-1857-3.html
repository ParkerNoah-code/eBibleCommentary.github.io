        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.109)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, December 21, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath
          done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee." -- Mark 5:19.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE CASE of the man here referred to is a very extraordinary one: it
          occupies a place among the memorabilia of Christ's life, perhaps as
          high as anything which is recorded by either of the evangelists. This
          poor wretch being possessed with a legion of evil spirits had been
          driven to something worse than madness. He fixed his home among the
          tombs, where he dwelt by night and day, and was the terror of all
          those who passed by. The authorities had attempted to curb him; he had
          been bound with fetters and chains, but in the paroxysms of his
          madness he had torn the chains in sunder, and broken the fetters in
          pieces. Attempts had been made to reclaim him; but no man could tame
          him. He was worse than the wild beasts, for they might be tamed; but
          his fierce nature would not yield. He was a misery to himself, for he
          would run upon the mountains by night and day, crying and howling
          fearfully, cutting himself with the sharp flints, and torturing his
          poor body in the most frightful manner. Jesus Christ passed by; he
          said to the devils, "Come out of him." The man was healed in a moment;
          he fell down at Jesus' feet; he became a rational being -- an
          intelligent man, yea, what is more, a convert to the Saviour. Out of
          gratitude to his deliverer, he said, "Lord, I will follow thee
          whithersoever thou goest; I will be thy constant companion and thy
          servant; permit me so to be." "No," said Christ, "I esteem your
          motive; it is one of gratitude to me; but if you would show your
          gratitude, go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the
          Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, this teaches us a very important fact, namely, this, that true
          religion does not break in sunder the bonds of family relationship.
          True religion seldom encroaches upon that sacred, I had almost said
          divine institution called home; it does not separate men from their
          families, and make them aliens to their flesh and blood. Superstition
          has done that; an awful superstition, which calls itself Christianity,
          has sundered men from their kind; but true religion has never done so.
          Why, if I might be allowed to do such a thing, I would seek out the
          hermit in his lonely cavern, and I would go to him and say, "Friend,
          if thou art what thou dost profess to be, a true servant of the living
          God, and not a hypocrite, as I guess thou art -- if thou art a true
          believer in Christ, and would show forth what he has done for thee,
          upset that pitcher, eat the last piece of thy bread, leave this dreary
          cave, wash thy face, untie thy hempen girdle; and if thou wouldst show
          thy gratitude, go home to thy friends, and tell them what great things
          the Lord hath done for thee. Canst thou edify the sere leaves of the
          forest? Can the beasts learn to adore that God whom thy gratitude
          should strive to honor? Dost thou hope to convert these rocks, and
          wake the echoes into songs? Nay, go back; dwell with thy friends,
          reclaim thy kinship with men, and unite again with thy fellows, for
          this is Christ's approved way of showing gratitude." And I would go to
          every monastery and every nunnery, and say to the monks, Come out
          brethren, come out! If you are what you say you are, servants of God,
          go home to your friends. No more of this absurd discipline; it is not
          Christ's rule; you are acting differently from what he would have you;
          go home to your friends!" And to the sisters of mercy we would say,
          "Be sisters of mercy to your own sisters; go home to your friends;
          take care of your aged parents; turn your own houses into convents; do
          not sit here nursing your pride by a disobedience to Christ's rule,
          which says, "go home to thy friends." "Go home to thy friends, and
          tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had
          compassion on thee." The love of a solitary and ascetic life, which is
          by some considered to be a divine virtue, is neither more nor less
          than a disease of the mind. In the ages when there was but little
          benevolence, and consequently few hands to build lunatic asylums,
          superstition supplied the lack of charity, and silly men and women
          were allowed the indulgence of their fancies in secluded haunts or in
          easy laziness. Young has most truly said, --
        </p>
        <p>"The first sure symptoms of a mind in health</p>
        <p>Are rest of heart and pleasure found at home."</p>
        <p>
          Avoid, my friends, above all things, those romantic and absurd
          conceptions of virtue which are the offspring of superstition and the
          enemies of righteousness. Be not without natural affection, but love
          those who are knit to you by time of nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          True religion cannot be inconsistent with nature. It never can demand
          that I should abstain from weeping when my friend is dead. "Jesus
          wept." It cannot deny me the privilege of a smile, when providence
          looks favorably upon me; for once "Jesus rejoiced in the spirit, and
          said, Father, I thank thee." It does not make a man say to his father
          and mother, "I am no longer your son." That is not Christianity, but
          something worse than what beasts would do, which would lead us to be
          entirely sundered from our fellows, to walk among them as if we had no
          kinship with them. To all who think a solitary life must be a life of
          piety, I would say, "It is the greatest delusion." To all who think
          that those must be good people who snap the ties of relationship, let
          us say, "Those are the best who maintain them." Christianity makes a
          husband a better husband, it makes a wife a better wife than she was
          before. It does not free me from my duties as a son; it makes me a
          better son, and my parents better parents. Instead of weakening my
          love, it gives me fresh reason for my affection; and he whom I loved
          before as my father, I now love as my brother and co-worker in Christ
          Jesus; and she whom I reverenced as my mother, I now love as my sister
          in the covenant of grace, to be mine for ever in the state that is to
          come. Oh! suppose not, any of you, that Christianity was ever meant to
          interfere with households; it is intended to cement them, and to make
          them households which death itself shall never sever, for it binds
          them up in the bundle of life with the Lord their God, and re-unites
          the several individuals on the other side of the flood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I will just tell you the reason why I selected my text. I thought
          within myself, there are a large number of young men who always come
          to hear me preach; they always crowd the aisles of my chapel, and many
          of them have been converted to God. Now, here is Christmas-day come
          round again, and they are going home to see their friends. When they
          get home they will want a Christmas Carol in the evening; I think I
          will suggest one to them -- more especially to such of them as have
          been lately converted. I will give them a theme for their discourse on
          Christmas evening; it may not be quite so amusing as "The Wreck of the
          Golden Mary," but it will be quite as interesting to Christian people.
          It shall be this: "Go home and tell your friends what the Lord hath
          done for your souls, and how he hath had compassion on you." For my
          part, I wish there were twenty Christmas days in the year. It is
          seldom that young men can meet with their friends; it is rarely they
          can all be united as happy families; and though I have no respect to
          the religious observance of the day, yet I love it as a family
          institution, as one of England's brightest days, the great Sabbath of
          the year, when the plough rests in its furrow, when the din of
          business is hushed, when the mechanic and the working man go out to
          refresh themselves upon the green award of the glad earth. If any of
          you are masters you will pardon me for the digression, when I most
          respectfully beg you to pay your servants the same wages on
          Christmas-day as if they were at work. I am sure it will make their
          houses glad if you will do so. It is unfair for you to make them feast
          or fast, unless you give them wherewithal to feast and make themselves
          glad on that day of joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now to come to the subject. We are going home to see our friends,
          and here is the story some of us have to tell. "Go home to thy
          friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for them,
          and hath had compassion on thee." First, here is what they are to
          tell; secondly, why they are to tell it; and then thirdly, how they
          ought to tell it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, HERE IS WHAT THEY ARE TO TELL. It is to be a story of
          personal experience. "Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great
          things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee."
          You are not to repair to your houses and forthwith begin to preach.
          That you are not commanded to do. You are not to begin to take up
          doctrinal subjects and expatiate on them, and endeavour to bring
          persons to your peculiar views and sentiments. You are not to go home
          with sundry doctrines you have lately learned, and try to teach these.
          At least you are not commanded so to do; you may, if you please, and
          none shall hinder you; but you are to go home and tell not what you
          have believed, but what you have felt -- what you really know to be
          your own; not what great things you have read, but what great things
          the Lord hath done for you; not alone what you have seen done in the
          great congregation, and how great sinners have turned to God, but what
          the Lord has done for you. And mark this: there is never a more
          interesting story than that which a man tells about himself. The Rhyme
          of the Ancient Mariner derives much of its interest because the man
          who told it was himself the mariner. He sat down, that man whose
          finger was skinny, like the finger of death, and began to tell that
          dismal story of the ship at sea in the great calm, when slimy things
          did crawl with legs over the shiny sea. The Wedding guest sat still to
          listen, for the old man was himself a story. There is always a great
          deal of interest excited by a personal narrative. Virgil, the poet,
          knew this, and therefore he wisely makes Aeneas tell his own story,
          and makes him begin it by saying, "In which I also had a great part
          myself." So if you would interest your friends, tell them what you
          felt yourself. Tell them how you were once a lost abandoned sinner,
          how the Lord met with you, how you bowed your knees, and poured out
          your soul before God, and how at last you leaped with joy, for you
          thought you heard him say within you, "I, even I, am he that blotteth
          out thy transgressions for my name's sake." Tell your friends a story
          of your own personal experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, next, it must be a story of free grace. It is not, "Tell thy
          friends how great things thou hast done thyself," but "how great
          things the Lord hath done for thee." The man who always dwells upon
          free will and the power of the creature, and denies the doctrines of
          grace, invariably mixes up a great deal of what he has done himself in
          telling his experience; but the believer in free grace, who holds the
          great cardinal truths of the gospel, ignores this, and declares, "I
          will tell what the Lord hath done for me. It is true I must tell how I
          was first made to pray; but I will tell it thus --
        </p>
        <p>'Grace taught my soul to pray,</p>
        <p>Grace made my eyes o'erflow.'</p>
        <p>
          It is true, I must tell in how many troubles and trials God has been
          with me; but I will tell it thus: --
        </p>
        <p>"Twas grace which kept me to this day,</p>
        <p>And will not let me go.'"</p>
        <p>
          He says nothing about his own doings, or willings, or prayings, or
          seekings, but he ascribes it all to the love and grace of the great
          God who looks on sinners in love, and makes them his children, heirs
          of everlasting life. Go home, you man, and tell the poor sinner's
          story; go home, young woman, and open your diary, and give your
          friends stories of grace. Tell them of the mighty works of God's hand
          which he hath wrought in you from his own free, sovereign, undeserved
          love. Make it a free grace story around your family fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next place, this poor man's tale was a grateful story. I know
          it was grateful, because the man said, "I will tell thee how great
          things the Lord hath done for me;" and (not meaning a pun in the least
          degree) I may observe, that a man who is grateful is always full of
          the greatness of the mercy which God has shown him; he always thinks
          that what God has done for him is immensely good and supremely great.
          Perhaps when you are telling the story one of your friends will say,
          "And what of that?" And your answer will be, "It may not be a great
          thing to you, but it is to me. You say it is little to repent, but I
          have not found it so; it is a great and precious thing to be brought
          to know myself to be a sinner, and to confess it; do you say it is a
          little thing to have found a Saviour." Look them in the face and say,
          "If you had found him too you would not think it little. You think it
          little I have lost the burden from my back; but if you had suffered
          with it, and felt its weight as I have for many a long year, you would
          think it no little thing to be emancipated and free, through a sight
          of the cross." Tell them it is a great story, and if they cannot see
          its greatness shed great tears, and tell it to them with great
          earnestness, and I hope they may be brought to believe that you at
          least are grateful, if they are not. May God grant that you may tell a
          grateful story. No story is more worth hearing than a tale of
          gratitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          And lastly, upon this point: it must be a tale told by a poor sinner
          who feels himself not to have deserved what he has received. "How he
          hath had compassion on thee." It was not a mere act of kindness, but
          and act of free compassion towards one who was in misery. Oh! I have
          heard men tell the story of their conversion and of their spiritual
          life in such a way that my heart hath loathed them and their story
          too, for they have told of their sins as if they did boast in the
          greatness of their crime, and they have mentioned the love of God not
          with a tear of gratitude, not with the simple thanksgiving of the
          really humble heart, but as if they as much exalted themselves as they
          exalted God. Oh! when we tell the story of our own conversion, I would
          have it done with deep sorrow, remembering what we used to be, and
          with great joy and gratitude, remembering how little we deserve these
          things, I was once preaching upon conversion and salvation, and I felt
          within myself, as preachers often do, that it was but dry work to tell
          this story, and a dull, dull tale it was to me; but on a sudden the
          thought crossed my mind, "Why, you are a poor lost ruined sinner
          yourself; tell it, tell it, as you received it; begin to tell of the
          grace of God as you trust you feel it yourself." Why, then, my eyes
          began to be fountains of tears; those hearers who had nodded their
          heads began to brighten up, and they listened, because they were
          hearing something which the man felt himself, and which they
          recognised as being true to him, if it was not true in them. Tell your
          story, my hearers, as lost sinners. Do not go to your home, and walk
          into your house with a supercilious air, as much as to say, "Here's a
          saint come home to the poor sinners, to tell them a story;" but go
          home like a poor sinner yourself; and when you go in, your mother
          remembers what you used to be, you need not tell her there is a change
          -- she will notice it, if it is only one day you are with her; and
          perhaps she will say, "John, what is this change that is in you?" and
          if she is a pious mother, you will begin to tell her the story, and I
          know, man though you are, you will not blush when I say it, she will
          put her arms round your neck, and kiss you as she never did before,
          for you are her twice-born son, hers from whom she shall never part,
          even though death itself shall divide you for a brief moment. "Go
          home, then, and tell your friends what great things the Lord hath done
          for you, and how he hath had compassion on you."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But now, in the second place, WHY SHOULD WE TELL THIS STORY? For I
          hear many of my congregation say, "Sir, I could relate that story to
          any one sooner than I could to my own friends; I could come to your
          vestry, and tell you something of what I have tasted and handled of
          the Word of God; but I could not tell my father, nor my mother, nor my
          brethren, nor my sisters." Come, then; I will try and argue with you,
          to induce you to do so, that I may send you home this Christmas-day,
          to be missionaries in the localities to which you belong, and to be
          real preachers, though you are not so by name. Dear friends, do tell
          this story when you go home.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, for your Master's sake. Oh! I know you love him; I am sure you
          do, if you have proof that he loved you. You can never think of
          Gethsemane and of its bloody sweat, of Gabbatha and of the mangled
          back of Christ, flayed by the whip: you can never think of Calvary and
          his pierced hands and feet, without loving him; and it is a strong
          argument when I say to you, for his dear sake who loved you so much,
          go home and tell it. What! do you think we can have so much done for
          us, and yet not tell it? Our children, if anything should be done for
          them, do not stay many minutes before they are telling all the
          company, "such an one hath give me such a present, and bestowed on me
          such-and-such a favor." And should the children of God be backward in
          declaring how they were saved when their feet made haste to hell, and
          how redeeming mercy snatched them as brands from the burning? You love
          Jesus, young man! I put it to you, then, will you refuse to tell the
          tale of his love to you? Shall your lips be dumb, when his honor is
          concerned? Will you not, wherever you go, tell of the God who loved
          you and died for you? This poor man, we are told, "Departed and began
          to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him, and
          all men did marvel." So with you. If Christ has done much for you, you
          cannot help it -- you must tell it. My esteemed friend, Mr. Oncken, a
          minister in Germany told us last Monday evening, that so soon as he
          was converted himself, the first impulse of his new-born soul was to
          do good to others. And where should he do that good? Well, he thought
          he would go to Germany. It was his own native land, and he thought the
          command was, "Go home to thy friends and tell them." Well, there was
          not a single Baptist in all Germany, nor any with whom he could
          sympathise, for the Lutherans had swerved from the faith of Luther,
          and gone aside from the truth of God. But he went there and preached,
          and he has now seventy or eighty churches established on the
          continent. What made him do it? Nothing but love for his Master, who
          had done so much for him, could have forced him to go and tell his
          kinsmen the marvellous tale of Divine goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, in the next place, are your friends pious? Then go home and tell
          them, in order to make their hearts glad. I received last night a
          short epistle written with a trembling hand by one who is past the
          natural age of man, living in the country of Essex. His son, under
          God, had been converted by hearing the Word preached, and the good man
          could not help writing to the minister, thanking him, and blessing
          most of all, his God, that his son had been regenerated. "Sir," he
          begins, "an old rebel writes to thank you, and above all to thank his
          God, that his dear son has been converted." I shall treasure up that
          epistle. It goes on to say, "Go on! and the Lord bless you." And there
          was another case I heard some time ago, where a young woman went home
          to her parents, and when her mother saw her, she said, "There! if the
          minister had made me a present of all London, I should not have
          thought so much of it as I do of this -- to think that you have really
          become a changed character, and are living in the fear of God." Oh! if
          you want to make your mother's heart leap within her, and to make your
          father glad -- if you would make that sister happy who sent you so
          many letters, which sometimes you read against a lamp-post, with your
          pipe in your mouth -- go home and tell your mother that her wishes are
          all accomplished, that her prayers are heard, that you will no longer
          chaff her about her Sunday-school class, and no longer laugh at her
          because she loves the Lord, but that you will go with her to the house
          of God, for you love God, and you have said, "Your people shall be my
          people, and your God shall be my God, for I have a hope that your
          heaven shall be my heaven for ever." Oh! what a happy thing it would
          be if some here who had gone astray, should thus go home! It was my
          privilege a little while ago to preach for a noble institution for the
          reception of women who had led abandoned lives -- and before I
          preached the sermon I prayed to God to bless it, and in the printed
          sermon you will notice that at the end of it there is an account of
          two persons who were blessed by that sermon and restored. Now, let me
          tell you a story of what happened to Mr. Vanderkist, a city
          missionary, who toils all night long to do good in that great work.
          There had been a drunken broil in the street; he stepped between the
          men to part them, and said something to a woman who stood there
          concerning how dreadful a thing it was that men should thus be
          intemperate. She walked with him a little way, and he with her, and
          she began to tell him such a tale of woe and sin too -- how she had
          been lured away from her parents' home in Somersetshire, and have been
          brought up here to her soul's eternal hurt. He took her home with him,
          and taught her the fear and love of Christ; and what was the first
          thing she did, when she returned to the paths of godliness, and found
          Christ to be the sinner's Saviour? She said, "Now, I must go home to
          my friends." Her friends were written to; they came to meet her at the
          station at Bristol, and you can hardly conceive what a happy meeting
          it was. The father and mother had lost their daughter, they had never
          heard from her; and there she was, brought back by the agency of this
          institution, and restored to the bosom of her family. Ah! if such an
          one be here! I know not; among such a multitude there may be such an
          one. Woman! hast thou strayed from thy family? Hast thou left them
          long? "Go home to thy friends," I beseech thee, ere thy father totters
          to his grave, and ere thy mother's grey hairs sleep on the snow-white
          pillow of her coffin. Go back. I beseech thee! Tell her thou art
          penitent; tell her that God hath met with thee -- that the young
          minister said, "Go back to thy friends." And if so, I shall not blush
          to have said these things, though you may think I ought not to have
          mentioned them; for if I may but win one such soul, I will bless God
          to all eternity. "Go home to thy friends. Go home and tell them how
          great things the Lord hath done for thee." Cannot you imagine the
          scene, when the poor demoniac mentioned in my text went home? He had
          been a raving madman; and when he came and knocked at the door, don't
          you think you see his friends calling to one another in affright, "Oh!
          there he is again," and the mother running up stairs and locking all
          the doors, because her son had come back that was raving mad; and the
          little ones crying because they knew what he had been before -- how he
          cut himself with stones, because he was possessed with devils. And can
          you picture their joy, when the man said, "Mother! Jesus Christ has
          healed me; let me in; I am no lunatic now!" And when the father opened
          the door, he said, "Father! I am not what I was; all the evil spirits
          are gone; I shall live in the tombs no longer. I want to tell you how
          the glorious man who wrought my deliverance accomplished the miracle
          -- how he said to the devils, Get ye hence,' and they ran down a steep
          place into the sea, an I am come home healed and saved." Oh! if such
          an one, possessed with sin, were here this morning, and would go home
          to his friends, to tell them of his release, methinks this scene would
          be somewhat similar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, dear friends. I hear one of you say. "Ah! Sir, would to God
          I could go home to pious friends! But when I go home I go into the
          worst of places; for my home is amongst those who never knew God
          themselves, and consequently never prayed for me, and never taught me
          anything concerning heaven." Well, young man, go home to your friends.
          If they are ever so bad they are your friends. I sometimes meet with
          young men wishing to join the church, who say, when I ask them about
          their father, "Oh, sir, I am parted from my father." Then I say,
          "Young man, you may just go and see your father before I have anything
          to do with you; if you are at ill-will with your father and mother I
          will not receive you into the church; if they are ever so bad they are
          your parents." Go home to them, and tell them, not to make them glad,
          for they will very likely be angry with you; but tell them for their
          soul's salvation. I hope, when you are telling the story of what God
          did for you, that they will be led by the Spirit to desire the same
          mercy themselves. But I will give you a piece of advice. Do not tell
          this story to your ungodly friends when they are all together, for
          they will laugh at you. Take them one by one, when you can get them
          alone, and begin to tell it to them, and they will hear you seriously.
          There was once a very pious lady who kept a lodging-house for young
          men. All the young men were very gay and giddy, and she wanted to say
          something to them concerning religion. She introduced the subject, and
          it was passed off immediately with a laugh. She thought within
          herself, "I have made a mistake." The next morning, after breakfast,
          when they were all going, she said to one of them, "Sir, I should like
          to speak with you a moment or two," and taking him aside into another
          room she talked with him. The next morning she took another, and the
          next morning another, and it pleased God to bless her simple
          statement, when it was given individually: but, without doubt, if she
          had spoken to them altogether, they would have backed each other up in
          laughing her to scorn. Reprove a man alone. A verse may hit him whom a
          sermon flies. You may be the means of bringing a man to Christ who has
          often heard the Word and only laughed at it, but who cannot resist a
          gentle admonition. In one of the states of America, there was an
          infidel who was a great despiser of God, a hater of the Sabbath and
          all religious institutions. What to do with him the ministers did not
          know. They met together and prayed for him. But among the rest, one
          Elder B____ resolved to spend a long time in prayer for the man; after
          that he got on horseback, and rode down to the man's forge, for he was
          a blacksmith. He left his horse outside, and said, "Neighbour, I am
          under very great concern about your soul's salvation; I tell you I
          pray day and night for your soul's salvation." He left him, and rode
          home on his horse. The man went inside to his house after a minute or
          two, and said to one of his faithful friends, "Here's a new argument;
          here's Elder B____ been down here, he did not dispute, and never said
          a word to me except this, I say, I am under great concern about your
          soul; I cannot bear that you should be lost.' Oh! that fellow," he
          said, "I cannot answer him;" and the tears began to roll down his
          cheeks. He went to his wife, and said, "I can't make this out; I never
          cared about my soul, but here's an elder, that has no connection with
          me, but I have always laughed at him, and he has come five miles this
          morning on horseback just to tell me he is under concern about my
          salvation. After a little while he thought it was time he should be
          under concern about his salvation too. He went in, shut the door,
          began to pray, and the next day he was at the deacon's house, telling
          him that he too was under concern about his salvation, and asking him
          to tell him what he must do to be saved. Oh! that the everlasting God
          might make use of some of those now present in the same way, that they
          might be induced to
        </p>
        <p>"Tell to others round</p>
        <p>What a dear Saviour they have found;</p>
        <p>To point to his redeeming blood,</p>
        <p>And say, Behold the way to God!"</p>
        <p>
          III. I shall not detain you much longer; but there is a third point,
          upon which we must be very brief. HOW IS THIS STORY TO BE TOLD?
        </p>
        <p>
          First, tell it truthfully. Do not tell more than you know; do not tell
          John Bunyan's experience, when you ought to tell your own. Do not tell
          your mother you have felt what only Rutherford felt. Tell her no more
          than the truth. Tell your experience truthfully; for mayhap one single
          fly in the pot of ointment will spoil it, and one statement you may
          make which is not true may ruin it all. Tell the story truthfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next place, tell it very humbly. I have said that before. Do
          not intrude yourselves upon those who are older, and know more; but
          tell your story humbly; not as a preacher, not ex-cathedra, but as a
          friend and as a son.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, tell it very earnestly. Let them see you mean it. Do not talk
          about religion flippantly; you will do not good if you do. Do not make
          puns on texts; do not quote Scripture by way of joke: if you do, you
          may talk till you are dumb, you will do no good, if you in the least
          degree give them occasion to laugh by laughing at holy things
          yourself. Tell it very earnestly.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, tell it very devoutly. Do not try to tell your tale to man
          till you have told it first to God. When you are at home on
          Christmas-day, let no one see your face till God has seen it. Be up in
          the morning, wrestle with God; and if you friends are not converted,
          wrestle with God for them; and then you will find it easy work to
          wrestle with them for God. Seek, if you can, to get them one by one,
          and tell them the story. Do not be afraid; only think of the good you
          may possibly do. Remember, he that saves a soul from death hath
          covereth a multitude of sins, and he shall have stars in his crown for
          ever and ever. Seek to be under God -- Saviours in your family, to be
          the means of leading your own beloved brethren and sisters to seek and
          to find the Lord Jesus Christ, and then one day, when you shall meet
          in Paradise, it will be a joy and blessedness to think that you are
          there, and that your friends are there too, whom God will have made
          you the instrument of saving. Let your reliance in the Holy Spirit be
          entire and honest. Trust not yourself, but fear not to trust him. He
          can give you words. He can apply those words to their heart, and so
          enable you to "minister grace to the hearers."
        </p>
        <p>
          To close up, by a short, and I think, a pleasant turning of the text,
          to suggest another meaning to it. Soon, dear friends, very soon with
          some of us, the Master will say, "Go home to thy friends." You know
          where the home is. It is up above the stars.
        </p>
        <p>"Where our best friends, our kindred dwell,</p>
        <p>Where God our Saviour reigns."</p>
        <p>
          Yon grey-headed man has buried all his friends; he has said, "I shall
          go to them, but they will not return to me." Soon his Master will say,
          "Thou hast had enough tarrying here in this vale of tears: goo home to
          thy friends!" Oh! happy hour! Oh! blessed moment, when that shall be
          the word -- "Go home to thy friends!" And when we go home to our
          friends in Paradise, what shall we do? Why, first we will repair to
          that blest seat where Jesus sits, take off our crown and cast it at
          his feet, and crown him Lord of all. And when we have done that, what
          shall be our next employ? Why, we will tell the blessed ones in heaven
          what the Lord hath done for us, and how he hath had compassion on us.
          And shall such a tale be told in heaven? Shall that be the Christmas
          Carol of the angels? Yes, it shall be; it has been published there
          before -- blush not to tell it yet again -- for Jesus has told it
          before, "When he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and
          neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my
          sheep which was lost." And thou, poor sheep, when thou shall be
          gathered in, wilt thou not tell how thy Shepherd sought thee, and how
          he found thee? Will thou not sit in the grassy meads of heaven, and
          tell the story of thine own redemption? Wilt thou not talk with thy
          brethren and thy sisters, and tell them how God loved thee and hath
          brought thee there? Perhaps thou sayest, "It will be a very short
          story." Ah! it would be if you could write now. A little book might be
          the whole of your biography; but up there when your memory shall be
          enlarged, when your passion shall be purified and your understanding
          clear, you will find that what was but a tract on earth will be a huge
          tome in heaven. You will tell a long story there of God's sustaining,
          restraining, constraining grace, and I think that when you pause to
          let another tell his tale, and then another, and then another, you
          will at last, when you have been in heaven a thousand years, break out
          and exclaim, "O saints, I have something else to say." Again they will
          tell their tales, and again you will interrupt them with "Oh, beloved,
          I have thought of another case of God's delivering mercy." And so you
          will go on, giving them themes for songs, finding them the material
          for the warp and woof of heavenly sonnets. "Go home," he will soon
          say, "go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord
          hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee." Wait awhile;
          tarry his leisure, and ye shall soon be gathered to the land of the
          hereafter, to the home of the blessed, where endless felicity shall be
          thy portion. God grant a blessing for his name's sake!
