        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.361)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, February 17th, 1861 by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand</p>
        <p>"He that believeth on him is not condemned" -- John 3:18</p>
        <p>
          THE way of salvation is stated in Scripture in the very plainest
          terms, and yet, perhaps, there is no truth about which more errors
          have been uttered, than concerning the faith which saves the soul.
          Well has it been proved by experience, that all doctrines of Christ
          are mysteries -- mysteries, not so much in themselves, but because
          they are hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath
          blinded their eyes. So plain is Scripture, that one would have said,
          "He that runs may read"; but so dim is man's eye, and so marred is his
          understanding, that the very simplest truth of Scripture he distorts
          and misrepresents. And indeed, my brethren, even those who know what
          faith is, personally and experimentally, do not always find it easy to
          give a good definition of it. They think they have hit the mark, and
          then afterwards they lament that they have failed. Straining
          themselves to describe some one part of faith, they find they have
          forgotten another, and in the excess of their earnestness to clear the
          poor sinner out of one mistake, they often lead him into a worse
          error. So that I think I may say that, while faith is the simplest
          thing in all the world, yet it is one of the most difficult upon which
          to preach, because from its very importance, our soul begins to
          tremble while speaking of it, and then we are not able to describe it
          so clearly as we would.
        </p>
        <p>
          I intend this morning, by God's help, to put together sundry thoughts
          upon faith, each of which I may have uttered in your hearing at
          different times, but which have not been collected into one sermon
          before, and which, I have no doubt, have been misunderstood from the
          want of their having been put together in their proper consecutive
          order. I shall speak a little on each of these points; first, the
          object of faith, to what it looks; next, the reason of faith, whence
          it comes; thirdly, the ground of faith, or what it wears when it
          comes; fourthly, the warrant of faith, or why it dares to come to
          Christ; and fifthly, the result of faith, or, how it speeds when it
          doth come to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>I. First, then, THE OBJECT OF FAITH, or to what faith looks.</p>
        <p>
          I am told in the Word of God to believe -- What am I to believe? I am
          bidden to look -- to what am I to look? What is to be the object of my
          hope, belief, and confidence? The reply is simple. The object of Faith
          to a sinner is Christ Jesus. How many make a mistake about this and
          think that they are to believe on God the Father! Now belief in God is
          an after-result of faith in Jesus. We come to believe in the eternal
          love of the Father as the result of trusting the precious blood of the
          Son. Many men say, "I would believe in Christ if I knew that I were
          elect." This is coming to the Father, and no man can come to the
          Father except by Christ. It is the Father's work to elect; you cannot
          come directly to him, therefore you cannot know your election until
          first you have believed on Christ the Redeemer, and then through
          redemption you can approach to the Father and know your election.
          Some, too, make the mistake of looking to the work of God the Holy
          Spirit. They look within to see if they have certain feelings, and if
          they find them their faith is strong, but if their feelings have
          departed from them, then their faith is weak, so that they look to the
          work of the Spirit which is not the object of a sinner's faith. Both
          the Father and the Spirit must be trusted in order to complete
          redemption, but for the particular mercy of justification and pardon
          the blood of the Mediator is the only plea. Christians have to trust
          the Spirit after conversion, but the sinner's business, if he would be
          saved, is not with trusting the Spirit nor with looking to the Spirit,
          but looking to Christ Jesus, and to him alone. I know your salvation
          depends on the whole Trinity, but yet the first and immediate object
          of a sinner's justifying faith is neither God the Father nor God the
          Holy Ghost, but God the Son, incarnate in human flesh, and offering
          atonement for sinners. Hast thou the eye of faith? Then, soul, look
          thou to Christ as God. If thou wouldst be saved, believe him to be God
          over all, blessed for ever. Bow before him, and accept him as being
          "Very God of very God," for if thou do not, thou hast no part in him.
          When thou hast this believed, believe in him as man. Believe the
          wondrous story of his incarnation; rely upon the testimony of the
          evangelists, who declare that the Infinite was robed in the infant,
          that the Eternal was concealed within the mortal; that he who was King
          of heaven became a servant of servants and the Son of man. Believe and
          admire the mystery of his incarnation, for unless thou believe this,
          thou canst not be saved thereby. Then, specially, if thou wouldst be
          saved, let thy faith behold Christ in his perfect righteousness. See
          him keeping the law without blemish, obeying his Father without error;
          preserving his integrity without flaw. All this thou are to consider
          as being done on thy behalf. Thou couldst not keep the law; he kept it
          for thee. Thou couldst not obey God perfectly -- lo! his obedience
          standeth in the stead of thy obedience -- by it, thou art saved. But
          take care that thy faith mainly fixes itself upon Christ as dying and
          as dead. View the Lamb of God as dumb before his shearers; view him as
          the man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; go thou with him to
          Gethsemane, and behold him sweating drops of blood. Mark, thy faith
          has nothing to do with anything within thyself; the object of thy
          faith is nothing within thee, but a something without thee. Believe on
          him, then, who on yonder tree with nailed hands and feet pours out his
          life for sinners. There is the object of thy faith for justification;
          not in thyself, nor in anything which the Holy Spirit has done in
          thee, or anything he has promised to do for thee; but thou art to look
          to Christ and to Christ alone. Then let thy faith behold Christ as
          rising from the dead. See him -- he has borne the curse, and now he
          receives the justification. He dies to pay the debt; he rises that he
          may nail the handwriting of that discharged debt to the cross. See him
          ascending up on high, and behold him this day pleading before the
          Father's throne. He is there pleading for his people, offering up
          to-day his authoritative petition for all that come to God by him. And
          he, as God, as man, as living, as dying, as rising, and as reigning
          above, -- he, and he alone, is to be the object of thy faith for the
          pardon of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          On nothing else must thou trust; he is to be the only prop and pillar
          of thy confidence; and all thou addest thereunto will be a wicked
          antichrist, a rebellion against the sovereignty of the Lord Jesus. But
          take care if your faith save you, that while you look to Christ in all
          these matters you view him as being a substitute. This doctrine of
          substitution is so essential to the whole plan of salvation that I
          must explain it here for the thousandth time. God is just, he must
          punish sin; God is merciful, he wills to pardon those who believe in
          Jesus. How is this to be done? How can he be just and exact the
          penalty, -- merciful, and accept the sinner? He doeth it thus: he
          taketh the sins of his people and actually lifteth them up from off
          his people to Christ, so that they stand as innocent as though they
          had never sinned, and Christ is looked upon by God as though he had
          been all the sinners in the world rolled into one. The sin of his
          people was taken from their persons, and really and actually, not
          typically and metaphorically, but really and actually laid on Christ.
          Then God came forth with his fiery sword to meet the sinner and to
          punish him. He met Christ. Christ was not a sinner himself; but the
          sins of his people were all imputed to him. Justice, therefore, met
          Christ as though he had been the sinner -- punished Christ for his
          people's sins -- punished him as far as its rights could go, --
          exacted from him the last atom of the penalty, and left not a dreg in
          the cup. And now, he who can see Christ as being his substitute, and
          puts his trust in him, is thereby delivered from the curse of the law.
          Soul, when thou seest Christ obeying the law -- thy faith is to say,
          "He obeys that for his people." When thou seest him dying, thou art to
          count the purple drops, and say, "Thus he took my sins away." When
          thou seest him rising from the dead, thou art to say -- "He rises as
          the head and representative of all his elect"; and when thou seest him
          sitting at the right hand of God, thou art to view him there as the
          pledge that all for whom he died shall most surely sit at the Father's
          right hand. Learn to look on Christ as being in God's sight as though
          he were the sinner. "In him was no sin." He was "the just," but he
          suffered for the unjust. He was the righteous, but he stood in the
          place of the unrighteous; and all that the unrighteous ought to have
          endured, Christ has endured once for all, and put away their sins for
          ever by the sacrifice of himself. Now this is the great object of
          faith. I pray you, do not make any mistake about this, for a mistake
          here will be dangerous, if not fatal. View Christ, by your faith, as
          being in his life, and death, and sufferings, and resurrection, the
          substitute for all whom his Father gave him, -- the vicarious
          sacrifice for the sins of all those who will trust him with their
          souls. Christ, then, thus set forth, is the object of justifying
          faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let me further remark that there are some of you, no doubt, saying
          -- "Oh, I should believe and I would be saved if" -- If what? If
          Christ had died? "Oh no, sir, my doubt is nothing about Christ." I
          thought so. Then what is the doubt? "Why, I should believe if I felt
          this, or if I had done that." Just so; but I tell you, you could not
          believe in Jesus if you felt that, or if you had done that, for then
          you would believe in yourself, and not in Christ. That is the English
          of it. If you were so-and-so, or so-and-so, then you could have
          confidence. Confidence in what? Why, confidence in your feelings, and
          confidence in your doings, and that is just the clear contrary of
          confidence in Christ. Faith is not to infer from something good within
          me that I shall be saved, but to say in the teeth, and despite of the
          fact that I am guilty in the sight of God and deserve his wrath, yet I
          do nevertheless believe that the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
          cleanseth me from all sin; and though my present consciousness
          condemns me, yet my faith overpowers my consciousness, and I do
          believe that "he is able to save to the uttermost them that come unto
          God by him." To come to Christ as a saint is very easy work; to trust
          to a doctor to cure you when you believe you are getting better, is
          very easy; but to trust your physician when you feel as if the
          sentence of death were in your body, to bear up when the disease is
          rising into the very skin, and when the ulcer is gathering its venom
          -- to believe even then in the efficacy of the medicine -- that is
          faith. And so, when sin gets the mastery of thee, when thou feelest
          that the law condemns thee, then, even then, as a sinner, to trust
          Christ, this is the most daring feat in all the world; and the faith
          which shook down the walls of Jericho, the faith which raised the
          dead, the faith which stopped the mouths of lions, was not greater
          than that of a poor sinner, when in the teeth of all his sins he dares
          to trust the blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ. Do this, soul,
          then thou are saved, whosoever thou mayest be. The object of faith,
          then, is Christ as the substitute for sinners. God in Christ, but not
          God apart from Christ, nor any work of the Spirit, but the work of
          Jesus only must be viewed by you as the foundation of your hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now, secondly, THE REASON OF FAITH, or why doth any man
          believe, and whence doth his faith come?
        </p>
        <p>
          "Faith cometh by hearing." Granted, but do not all men hear, and do
          not many still remain unbelieving? How, then, doth any man come by his
          faith? To his own experience his faith comes as the result of a sense
          of need. He feels himself needing a Saviour; he finds Christ to be
          just such a Saviour as he wants, and therefore because he cannot help
          himself, he believes in Jesus. Having nothing of his own, he feels he
          must take Christ or else perish, and therefore he doth it because he
          cannot help doing it. He is fairly driven up into a corner, and there
          is but this one way of escape, namely, by the righteousness of
          another; for he feels he cannot escape by any good deeds, or
          sufferings of his own, and he cometh to Christ and humbleth himself,
          because he cannot do without Christ, and must perish unless he lay
          hold of him. But to carry the question further back, where does that
          man get his sense of need? How is it that he, rather than others,
          feels his need of Christ? It is certain he has no more necessity for
          Christ than other men. How doth he come to know, then, that he is lost
          and ruined? How is it that he is driven by the sense of ruin to take
          hold on Christ the restorer? The reply is, this is the gift of God;
          this is the work of the Spirit. No man comes to Christ except the
          Spirit draw him, and the Spirit draws men to Christ by shutting them
          up under the law to a conviction that if they do not come to Christ
          they must perish. Then by sheer stress of weather, they tack about and
          run into this heavenly port. Salvation by Christ is so disagreeable to
          our carnal mind, so inconsistent with our love of human merit, that we
          never would take Christ to be our all in all, if the Spirit did not
          convince us that we were nothing at all, and did not so compel us to
          lay hold on Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, then, the question goes further back still; how is it that the
          Spirit of God teaches some men their need, and not other men? Why is
          it that some of you were driven by your sense of need to Christ, while
          others go on in their self-righteousness and perish? There is no
          answer to be given but this, "Even so, Father, for so it seemed good
          in thy sight." It comes to divine sovereignty at the last. The Lord
          hath "hidden those things from the wise and prudent, and hath revealed
          them unto babes." According to the way in which Christ put it -- "My
          sheep, hear my voice"; "ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep,
          as I said unto you." Some divines would like to read that -- "Ye are
          not my sheep, because ye do not believe." As if believing made us the
          sheep of Christ; but the text puts it -- "Ye believe not, because ye
          are not of my sheep." "All that the Father giveth me shall come to
          me." If they come not, it is a clear proof that they were never given;
          for those who were given of old eternity to Christ, chosen of God the
          Father, and then redeemed by God the Son -- these are led by the
          Spirit, through a sense of need to come and lay hold on Christ. No man
          yet ever did, or ever will believe in Christ, unless he feels his need
          of him. No man ever did, or will feel his need of Christ, unless the
          Spirit makes him feel, and the Spirit will make no man feel his need
          of Jesus savingly, unless it be so written in that eternal book, in
          which God hath surely engraved the names of his chosen. So, then, I
          think I am not to be misunderstood on this point, that the reason of
          faith, or why men believe, is God's electing love working through the
          Spirit by a sense of need, and so bringing them to Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But now I shall want your careful attention, while I come to
          another point, upon which you, perhaps, will think I contradict
          myself, and that is, THE GROUND OF THE SINNER'S FAITH, or on what
          ground he dares to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dear friends, I have already said that no man will believe in
          Jesus, unless he feels his need of him. But you have often heard me
          say, and I repeat it again, that I do not come to Christ pleading that
          I feel my need of him; my reason for believing in Christ, is not that
          I feel my need of him, but that I have a need of him. The ground on
          which a man comes to Jesus, is not as a sensible sinner, but as a
          sinner, and nothing but a sinner. He will not come unless he is
          awakened; but when he comes, he does not say, "Lord, I come to thee
          because I am an awakened sinner, save me." But he says, "Lord, I am a
          sinner, save me." Not his awakening, but his sinnership is the method
          and plan upon which he dares to come. You will, perhaps, perceive what
          I mean, for I cannot exactly explain myself just now. If I refer to
          the preaching of a great many Calvinistic divines, they say to a
          sinner, "Now, if you feel your need of Christ, if you have repented so
          much, if you have been harrowed by the law to such-and-such a degree,
          then you may come to Christ on the ground that you are an awakened
          sinner." I say that is false. No man may come to Christ on the ground
          of his being an awakened sinner; he must come to him as a sinner. When
          I come to Jesus, I know I am not come unless I am awakened, but still,
          I do not come as an awakened sinner. I do not stand at the foot of his
          cross to be washed because I have repented; I bring nothing when I
          come but sin. A sense of need is a good feeling, but when I stand at
          the foot of the cross, I do not believe in Christ because I have got
          good feelings, but I believe in him whether I have good feelings or
          not.
        </p>
        <p>"Just as I am without one plea,</p>
        <p>But that thy blood was shed for me,</p>
        <p>And that thou bidst me come to thee,</p>
        <p>O Lamb of God I come."</p>
        <p>
          Mr. Roger, Mr. Sheppard, Mr. Flavel, and several excellent divines, in
          the Puritanic age, and especially Richard Baxter, used to give
          descriptions of what a man must feel before he may dare to come to
          Christ. Now, I say in the language of good Mr. Fenner, another of
          those divines, who said he was but a babe in grace when compared with
          them -- "I dare to say it, that all this is not Scriptural. Sinners do
          feel these things before they come, but they do not come on the ground
          of having felt it; they come on the ground of being sinners, and on no
          other ground whatever." The gate of Mercy is opened, and over the door
          it is written, "This is a faithful saying and worthy of all
          acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners."
          Between that word "save" and the next word "sinners," there is no
          adjective. It does not say, "penitent sinners," "awakened sinners,"
          "sensible sinners," "grieving sinners," or "alarmed sinners." No, it
          only says, "sinners," and I know this, that when I come, I come to
          Christ to-day, for I feel it is as much a necessity of my life to come
          to the cross of Christ to-day as it was to come ten years ago, -- when
          I come to him I dare not come as a conscious sinner or an awakened
          sinner, but I have to come still as a sinner with nothing in my hands.
          I saw an aged man this week in the vestry of a chapel in Yorkshire. I
          had been saying something to this effect: the old man had been a
          Christian for years, and he said, "I never saw it put exactly so, but
          still I know that is just the way I come; I say, Lord,
        </p>
        <p>'Nothing in my hands I bring,</p>
        <p>Simply to thy cross I cling;</p>
        <p>Naked, look to thee for dress;</p>
        <p>Helpless, come to thee for grace;</p>
        <p>Black' --</p>
        <p>("Black enough," said the old man)</p>
        <p>'I to the fountain fly,</p>
        <p>Wash me, Saviour, or I die.'"</p>
        <p>
          Faith is getting right out of yourself and getting into Christ. I know
          that many hundreds of poor souls have been troubled because the
          minister has said, "if you feel your need, you may come to Christ."
          "But," say they, "I do not feel my need enough; I am sure I do not."
          Many a score letters have I received from poor troubled consciences
          who have said, "I would venture to believe in Christ to save me if I
          had a tender conscience; if I had a soft heart -- but oh my heart is
          like a rock of ice which will not melt. I cannot feel as I would like
          to feel, and therefore I must not believe in Jesus." Oh! down with it,
          down with it! It is a wicked anti-Christ; it is flat Popery! It is not
          your soft heart that entitles you to believe. You are to believe in
          Christ to renew your hard heart, and come to him with nothing about
          you but sin. The ground on which a sinner comes to Christ is that he
          is black; that he is dead, and not that he knows he is dead; that he
          is lost, and not that he knows he is lost. I know he will not come
          unless he does know it, but that is not the ground on which he comes.
          It is the secret reason why, but it is not the public positive ground
          which he understands. Here was I, year after year, afraid to come to
          Christ because I thought I did not feel enough; and I used to read
          that hymn of Cowper's about being insensible as steel --
        </p>
        <p>"If aught is felt tis only pain</p>
        <p>To find I cannot feel."</p>
        <p>
          When I believed in Christ, I thought I did not feel at all. Now when I
          look back I find that I had been feeling all the while most acutely
          and intensely, and most of all because I thought I did not feel.
          Generally the people who repent the most, think they are impenitent,
          and people feel most their need when they think they do not feel at
          all, for we are no judges of our feelings, and hence the gospel
          invitation is not put upon the ground of anything of which we can be a
          judge; it is put on the ground of our being sinners and nothing but
          sinners. "Well," says one, "but it says, Come unto me all ye that are
          weary and heavy-laden and I will give you rest' -- then we must be
          weary and heavy-laden." Just so; so it is in the text, but then there
          is another. "Whosoever will let him come"; and that does not say
          anything about "weary and heavy-laden." Besides, while the invitation
          is given to the weary and heavy-laden, you will perceive that the
          promise is not made to them as weary and heavy-laden, but it is made
          to them as coming to Christ. They did not know that they were weary
          and heavy-laden when they came; they thought they were not. They
          really were, but part of their weariness was that they could not be as
          weary as they would like to be, and part of their load was that they
          did not feel their load enough. They came to Christ just as they were,
          and he saved them, not because there was any merit in their weariness,
          or any efficacy in their being heavy-laden, but he saved them as
          sinners and nothing but sinners, and so they were washed in his blood
          and made clean. My dear hearer, do let me put this truth home to thee.
          If thou wilt come to Christ this morning, as nothing but a sinner, he
          will not cast thee out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Old Tobias Crisp says in one of his sermons upon this very point, "I
          dare to say it, but if thou dost come to Christ, whosoever thou mayest
          be, if he does not receive thee, then he is not true to his word, for
          he says, Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.'" If thou
          comest, never mind qualification or preparation. He needeth no
          qualification of duties or of feelings either. Thou art to come just
          as thou art, and if thou art the biggest sinner out of hell, thou art
          as fit to come to Christ as if thou wert the most moral and most
          excellent of men. There is a bath: who is fit to be washed? A man's
          blackness is no reason why he should not be washed, but the clearer
          reason why he should be. When our City magistrates were giving relief
          to the poor, nobody said, "I am so poor, therefore I am not fit to
          have relief." Your poverty is your preparation, the black is the white
          here. Strange contradiction! The only thing you can bring to Christ is
          your sin and your wickedness. All he asks is, that you will come
          empty. If you have anything of your own, you must leave all before you
          come. If there be anything good in you, you cannot trust Christ, you
          must come with nothing in your hand. Take him as all in all, and that
          is the only ground upon which a poor soul can be saved -- as a sinner,
          and nothing but a sinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. But not to stay longer, my fourth point has to do with THE WARRANT
          OF FAITH, or why a man dares to trust in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it not imprudent for any man to trust Christ to save him, and
          especially when he has no good thing whatever? Is it not an arrogant
          presumption for any man to trust Christ? No, sirs, it is not. It is a
          grand and noble work of God the Holy Spirit for a man to give the lie
          to all his sins, and still to believe and set to his seal that God is
          true, and believe in the virtue of the blood of Jesus. But why does
          any man dare to believe in Christ I will ask you now. "Well," saith
          one man, "I summoned faith to believe in Christ because I did feel
          there was a work of the Spirit in me." You do not believe in Christ at
          all. "Well," says another, "I thought that I had a right to believe in
          Christ, because I felt somewhat." You had not any right to believe in
          Christ at all on such a warranty as that. What is a man's warrant then
          for believing in Christ. Here it is. Christ tells him to do it, that
          is his warrant. Christ's word is the warrant of the sinner for
          believing in Christ -- not what he feels nor what he is, nor what he
          is not, but that Christ has told him to do it. The Gospel runs thus:
          "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved. He that
          believeth not shall be damned." Faith in Christ then is a commanded
          duty as well as a blessed privilege, and what a mercy it is that it is
          a duty; because there never can be any question but that a man has a
          right to do his duty. Now on the ground that God commands me to
          believe, I have a right to believe, be I who I may. The gospel is sent
          to every creature. Well, I belong to that tribe; I am one of the every
          creatures, and that gospel commands me to believe and I do it. I
          cannot have done wrong in doing it for I was commanded to do so. I
          cannot be wrong in obeying a command of God. Now it is a command of
          God given to every creature that he should believe on Jesus Christ
          whom God hath sent. This is your warrant, sinner, and a blessed
          warrant it is, for it is one which hell cannot gainsay, and which
          heaven cannot withdraw. You need not be looking within to look for the
          misty warrants of your experience, you need not be looking to your
          works, and to your feelings, to get some dull and insufficient
          warrants for your confidence in Christ. You may believe Christ because
          he tells you to do so. That is a sure ground to stand on, and one
          which admits of no doubt. I will suppose that we are all starving;
          that the city has been besieged and shut up, and there has been a
          long, long famine, and we are ready to die of hunger. There comes out
          an invitation to us to repair at once to the palace of some great one
          there to eat and drink; but we have grown foolish, and will not accept
          the invitation. Suppose now that some hideous madness has got hold of
          us, and we prefer to die, and had rather starve than come. Suppose the
          king's herald should say, "Come and feast, poor hungry souls, and
          because I know you are unwilling to come, I add this threat, if you
          come not my warriors shall be upon you; they shall make you feel the
          sharpness of their swords." I think my dear friends, we should say,
          "We bless the great man for that threatening because now we need not
          say, I may not come,' while the fact is we may not stop away. Now I
          need not say I am not fit to come for I am commanded to come, and I am
          threatened if I do not come; and I will even go." That awful sentence
          -- "He that believeth not shall be damned," was added not out of
          anger, but because the Lord knew our silly madness, and that we should
          refuse our own mercies unless he thundered at us to make us come to
          the feast, "Compel them to come in"; this was the Word of the Master
          of old, and that text is part of the carrying out of that exhortation,
          "Compel them to come in." Sinner, you cannot be lost by trusting
          Christ, but you will be lost if you do not trust him, ay, and lost for
          not trusting him. I put it boldly now -- sinner, not only may you
          come, but oh! I pray you, do not defy the wrath of God by refusing to
          come. The gate of mercy stands wide open; why will you not come? Why
          will you not? Why so proud? Why will you still refuse his voice and
          perish in your sins? Mark, if you perish, any one of you, your blood
          lies not at God's door, nor Christ's door, but at your own. He can say
          of you, "Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life." Oh! poor
          trembler, if thou be willing to come, there is nothing in God's Word
          to keep thee from coming, but there are both threatenings to drive
          thee, and powers to draw thee. Still I hear you say, "I must not trust
          Christ." You may, I say, for every creature under heaven is commanded
          to do it, and what you are commanded to do, you may do. "Ah! well,"
          saith one, "still I do not feel that I may." There you are again; you
          say you will not do what God tells you, because of some stupid
          feelings of your own. You are not told to trust Christ because you
          feel anything, but simply because you are a sinner. Now you know you
          are a sinner. "I am," says one, "and that is my sorrow." Why your
          sorrow? That is some sign that you do feel. "Ay," saith one, "but I do
          not feel enough, and that is why I sorrow. I do not feel as I should."
          Well, suppose you do feel, or suppose you do not, you are a sinner,
          and "this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that
          Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners." "Oh, but I am such
          an old sinner; I have been sixty years in sin." Where is it written
          that after sixty you cannot be saved? Sir, Christ could save you at a
          hundred -- ay, if you were a Methuselah in guilt. "The blood of Jesus
          Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin." "Whosoever will let him
          come." "He is able to save to the uttermost them that come unto God by
          him." "Yes," says one, "but I have been a drunkard, a swearer, or
          lascivious, or profane." Then you are a sinner, you have not gone
          further than the uttermost, and he is able to save you still. "Ay,"
          saith another, "but you do not know how my guilt has been aggravated."
          That only proves you to be a sinner, and that you are commanded to
          trust Christ and be saved. "Ay," cries yet another, "but you do not
          know how often I have rejected Christ." Yes, but that only makes you
          the more a sinner. "You do not know how hard my heart is." Just so,
          but that only proves you to be a sinner, and still proves you to be
          one whom Christ came to save. "Oh, but, sir, I have not any good
          thing. If I had, you know, I should have something to encourage me."
          The fact of your not having any good thing just proves to me that you
          are the man I am sent to preach to. Christ came to save that which was
          lost, and all you have said only proves that you are lost, and
          therefore he came to save you. Do trust him; do trust him. "But if I
          am saved," saith one, "I shall be the biggest sinner that ever was
          saved." Then the greater music in heaven when you get there; the more
          glory to Christ, for the bigger the sinner the more honour to Christ
          when at last he shall be brought home. "Ay, but my sin has abounded."
          His grace shall much more abound. "But my sin has reached even to
          heaven." Yes, but his mercy reaches above the heavens. "Oh! but my
          guilt is as broad as the world." Yes, but his righteousness is broader
          than a thousand worlds. "Ay, but my sin is scarlet." Yes, but his
          blood is more scarlet than your sins, and can wash the scarlet out by
          a richer scarlet. "Ay! but I deserve to be lost, and death and hell
          cry for my damnation." Yes, and so they may, but the blood of Jesus
          Christ can cry louder than either death or hell; and it cries to-day,
          "Father, let the sinner live." Oh! I wish I could get this thought out
          of my own mouth, and get it into your heads, that when God saves you,
          it is not because of anything in you, it is because of something in
          himself. God's love has no reason except in his own bowels; God's
          reason for pardoning a sinner is found in his own heart, and not in
          the sinner. And there is as much reason in you why you should be saved
          as why another should be saved, namely, no reason at all. There is no
          reason in you why he should have mercy on you, but there is no reason
          wanted, for the reason lies in God and in God alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. And now I come to the conclusion, and I trust you will have
          patience with me, for my last point is a very glorious one, and full
          of joy to those souls who as sinners dare to believe in Christ -- THE
          RESULT OF FAITH, or how it speeds when it comes to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text says, "He that believeth is not condemned." There is a man
          there who has just this moment believed; he is not condemned. But he
          has been fifty years in sin, and has plunged into all manner of vice;
          his sins, which are many, are all forgiven him. He stands in the sight
          of God now as innocent as though he had never sinned. Such is the
          power of Jesus' blood, that "he that believeth is not condemned." Does
          this relate to what is to happen at the day of Judgment? I pray you
          look at the text, and you will find it does not say, "He that
          believeth shall not be condemned," but he is not; he is not now. And
          if he is not now, then it follows that he never shall be; for having
          believed in Christ that promise still stands, "He that believeth is
          not condemned." I believe to-day I am not condemned; in fifty years'
          time that promise will be just the same -- "He that believeth is not
          condemned." So that the moment a man puts his trust in Christ, he is
          freed from all condemnation -- past, present, and to come; and from
          that day he stands in God's sight as though he were without spot or
          wrinkle, or any such thing. "But he sins," you say. He does indeed,
          but his sins are not laid to his charge. They were laid to the charge
          of Christ of old, and God can never charge the offence on two -- first
          on Christ, and then on the sinner. "Ay, but he often falls into sin."
          That may be possible; though if the Spirit of God be in him he sinneth
          not as he was wont to do. He sins by reason of infirmity, not by
          reason of his love to sin, for now he hateth it. But mark, you shall
          put it in your own way if you will, and I will answer, "Yes, but
          though he sin, yet is he no more guilty in the sight of God, for all
          his guilt has been taken from him, and put on Christ, -- positively,
          literally, and actually lifted off from him, and put upon Jesus
          Christ." Do you see the Jewish host? There is a scapegoat brought out;
          the high priest confesses the sin of the people over the scapegoat's
          head. The sin is all gone from the people, and laid upon the
          scapegoat. Away goes the scapegoat into the wilderness. Is there any
          sin left on the people? If there be, then the scapegoat has not
          carried it away. Because it cannot be here and there too. It cannot be
          carried away and left behind too. "No," say you, "Scripture says the
          scapegoat carried away the sin; there was none left on the people when
          the scapegoat had taken away the sin. And so, when by faith we put our
          hand upon the head of Christ, does Christ take away our sin, or does
          he not? If he does not, then it is of no use our believing in him; but
          if he doth really take away our sin, then our sin cannot be on him and
          on us too; if it be on Christ, we are free, clear, accepted,
          justified, and this is the true doctrine of justification by faith. As
          soon as a man believeth in Christ Jesus, his sins are gone from him,
          and gone away for ever. They are blotted out now. What if a man owe a
          hundred pounds, yet if he has got a receipt for it, he is free; it is
          blotted out; there is an erasure made in the book, and the debt is
          gone. Though the man commit sin, yet the debt having been paid before
          even the debt was acquired, he is no more a debtor to the law of God.
          Doth not Scripture say, that God has cast his people's sins into the
          depths of the sea? Now, if they are in the depths of the sea, they
          cannot be on his people too. Blessed be his name, in the day when he
          casts our sins into the depth of the sea, he views us as pure in his
          sight, and we stand accepted in the beloved. Then he says, "As far as
          the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions
          from us." They cannot be removed and be here still. Then if thou
          believest in Christ, thou art no more in the sight of God a sinner;
          thou art accepted as though thou wert perfect, as though thou hadst
          kept the law, -- for Christ has kept it, and his righteousness is
          thine. You have broken it, but your sin is his, and he has been
          punished for it. Mistake not yourselves any longer; you are no more
          what you were; when you believe, you stand in Christ's stead, even as
          Christ of old stood in your stead. The transformation is complete, the
          exchange is positive and eternal. They who believe in Jesus are as
          much accepted of God the Father as even his Eternal Son is accepted;
          and they that believe not, let them do what they will, they shall but
          go about to work out their own righteousness; but they abide under the
          law, and still shall they be under the curse. Now, ye that believe in
          Jesus, walk up and down the earth in the glory of this great truth.
          You are sinners in yourselves, but you are washed in the blood of
          Christ. David says, "Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow." You
          have lately seen the snow come down -- how clear! how white! What
          could be whiter? Why, the Christian is whiter than that. You say, "He
          is black." I know he is as black as anyone -- as black as hell -- but
          the blooddrop falls on him, and he is as white -- "whiter than snow."
          The next time you see the snow-white crystals falling from heaven,
          look on them and say, "Ah! though I must confess within myself that I
          am unworthy and unclean, yet, believing in Christ, he hath given me
          his righteousness so completely, that I am even whiter than the snow
          as it descends from the treasury of God." Oh! for faith to lay hold on
          this. Oh! for an overpowering faith that shall get the victory over
          doubts and fears, and make us enjoy the liberty wherewith Christ makes
          men free. Go home, ye that believe in Christ, and go to your beds this
          night, and say, "If I die in my bed I cannot be condemned." Should you
          wake the next morning, go into the world and say, "I am not
          condemned." When the devil howls at you, tell him, "Ah! you may
          accuse, but I am not condemned." And if sometimes your sins rise --
          say, "Ah, I know you, but you are all gone for ever; I am not
          condemned." And when your turn shall come to die shut your eyes in
          peace.

        <p>For who aught to your charge can lay?"</p>
        <p>
          Fully absolved by grace you shall be found at last and all sin's
          tremendous curse and blame shall be taken away, not because of
          anything you have done. I pray you do all you can for Christ out of
          gratitude, but even when you have done all, do not rest there. Rest
          still in the substitution and the sacrifice. Be you what Christ was in
          his Father's sight, and when conscience awakens, you can tell it that
          Christ was for you all that you ought to have been, that he has
          suffered all your penalty; and now neither mercy nor justice can smite
          you, since justice has clasped hands with mercy in a firm decree to
          save that man whose faith is in the cross of Christ. The Lord bless
          these words for his sake. Amen.<br />
