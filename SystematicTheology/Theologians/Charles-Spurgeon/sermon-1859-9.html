        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.233)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, January 9th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>

          "Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord God, be it known unto
          you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel."
          -- Ezekiel 36:32.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two sins of man that are bred in the bone, and that
          continually come out in the flesh. One is self-dependence and the
          other is self-exaltation. It is very hard, even for the best of men,
          to keep themselves from the first error. The holiest of Christians,
          and those who understand best the gospel of Christ, find in themselves
          a constant inclination to look to the power of the creature, instead
          of looking to the power of God and the power of God alone. Over and
          over again, Holy Scripture has to remind us of that which we never
          ought to forget, that salvation is God's work from first to last, and
          is not of man, neither by man. But so it is, this old error -- that we
          are to save ourselves, or that we are to do something in the matter of
          salvation -- always rises up, and we find ourselves continually
          tempted by it to step aside from the simplicity of our faith in the
          power of the Lord our God. Why, even Abraham himself was not free from
          the great error of relying upon his own strength. God had promised to
          him that He would give him a son -- Isaac, the child of promise.
          Abraham believed it, but at last, weary with waiting, he adopted the
          carnal expedient of taking to himself Hagar, to wife, and he fancied
          that Ishmael would most certainly be the fulfillment of God's promise;
          but instead of Ishmael's helping to fulfill the promise, he brought
          sorrow unto Abraham's heart, for God would not have it that Ishmael
          should dwell with Isaac. "Cast out," said the Scripture, "the
          bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir
          with the son of the free woman." Now we, in the matter of salvation,
          are apt to think that God is tarrying long in the fulfillment of His
          promise, and we set to work ourselves to do something, and what do we
          do?sink ourselves deeper in the mire and pile up for ourselves a store
          of future troubles and trials. Do we not read that it grieved
          Abraham's heart to send Ishmael away? Ah! and many a Christian has
          been grieved by those works of nature which he accomplished with the
          design of helping the God of grace. Oh, beloved, we shall find
          ourselves very frequently attempting the foolish task of assisting
          Omnipotence and teaching the Omniscient One. Instead of looking to
          grace alone to sanctify us, we find ourselves adopting Philosophic
          rules and principles which we think will effect the Divine work. We
          shall but mar it; we shall bring grief into our own spirits. But if,
          instead thereof, we in every work look up to the God of our salvation
          for help, and strength, and grace, and succor, then our work will
          proceed to our own joy and comfort, and to God's glory. That error,
          then, I say is in our bone, and will always dwell with us, and hence
          it is that the words of the text are put as an antidote against that
          error. It is distinctly stated in our text that salvation is of God.
          "Not for your sakes do I this." He says nothing about what we have
          done or can do. All the preceding and all the succeeding verses speak
          of what God does. "I will take you from among the heathen." "I will
          sprinkle clean water upon you." "I will give you a new heart." "I will
          put my Spirit within you." It is all of God: therefore, again recall
          to our recollection this doctrine, and give up all dependence upon our
          own strength and power.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other error to which man is very prone, is that of relying upon
          his own merit. Though there is no righteousness in any man, yet in
          every man there is a proneness to truth in some fancied merit. Strange
          that it should be so, but the most reprobate characters have yet some
          virtue as they imagine, upon which they rely. You will find the most
          abandoned drunkard pride himself that he is not a swearer. You will
          find the blaspheming drunkard pride himself that at least he is
          honest. You will find men with no other virtue in the world, exalt
          what they imagine to be a virtue -- the fact that they do not profess
          to have any; and they think themselves to be extremely excellent,
          because they have honesty or rather impudence enough to confess that
          they are utterly vile. Somehow the human mind clings to human merit;
          it always will hold to it, and when you take away everything upon
          which you think it could rely, in less than a moment it fashions some
          other ground for confidence out of itself. Human nature with regard to
          its own merit, is like the spider, it bears its support in its own
          bowels, and it seems as if it would keep spinning on to all eternity.
          You may brush down one web, but it soon forms another, you may take
          the thread from one place, and you will find it clinging to your
          finger, and when you seek to brush it down with one hand you find it
          clinging to the other. It is hard to get rid of; it is ever ready to
          spin its web and bind itself to some false ground of trust. It is
          against all human merit that I am this morning going to speak, and I
          feel that I shall offend a great many people here. I am about to
          preach a doctrine that is gall and vinegar to flesh and blood, one
          that will make righteous moralists gnash their teeth, and make others
          go away and declare that I am an Antinomian, and perhaps scarcely fit
          to live. However, that consequence is one which I shall not greatly
          deplore, if connected with it there should be in other hearts a
          yielding to this glorious truth, and a giving up to the power and
          grace of God, who will never save us, unless we are prepared to let
          Him have all the glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I shall endeavor to expound at large the doctrine contained in
          this text; in the next place I shall endeavour to show its force and
          truthfulness; and then in the third place I shall seek God's Holy
          Spirit to apply the useful, practical lessons which are to be drawn
          from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I shall endeavour to EXPOUND THIS TEXT. "Not for your sakes do I
          this saith the Lord God." The motive for the salvation of the human
          race is to be found in the breast of God, and not in the character or
          condition of man. Two races have revolted against God -- the one
          angelic, the other human. When a part of this angelic race revolted
          against the Most High, justice speedily overtook them; they were swept
          from their starry seats in Heaven, and henceforth they have been
          reserved in darkness unto the great day of the wrath of God. No mercy
          was ever presented to them, no sacrifice ever offered for them; but
          they were without hope and mercy, forever consigned to the pit of
          eternal torment. The human race, far inferior in order of
          intelligence, sinned as atrociously; at any rate, if the sins of
          manhood that we have heard of be put together and rightly weighed, I
          can scarcely understand how even the sins of devils could be much
          blacker than the sin of mankind. However, the God who in His infinite
          justice passed over angels, and suffered them forever to expiate their
          offences in the fires of hell, was pleased to look down on man. Here
          was election on a grand scale; the election of manhood, and the
          reprobation of fallen angelhood. What was the reason for it? The
          reason was in God's mind, an inscrutable reason which we do not know,
          and which if we knew probably we could not understand. Had you and I
          been put upon the choice of which should have been spared, I do think
          it probable we should have chosen that fallen angels should have been
          saved. Are they not the brightest? Have they not the greatest mental
          strength? If they had been redeemed, would it not have glorified God
          more, as we judge, than the salvation of worms like ourselves? Those
          bright beings -- Lucifer, son of the morning, and those stars that
          walked in his train -- if they had been washed in His redeeming blood,
          if they had been saved by sovereign mercy, what a song would they have
          lifted up to the Most High and everlasting God! But God, who doeth as
          He wills with His own, and giveth no account of His matters, but who
          deals with His creatures as the potter deals with his clay, took not
          upon Him the nature of angels, but took upon Him the seed of Abraham,
          and chose men to be the vessels of His mercy. This fact we know, but
          where is its reason? certainly not in man. "Not for your sakes do I
          this. O house of Israel, be ashamed and be confounded for your own
          ways."
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, very few men object. We notice that if we talk about the
          election of men and the non-election of fallen angels, there is not a
          cavil for a moment. Every man approves of Calvinism till he feels that
          he is the loser by it; but when it begins to touch his own bone and
          his own flesh then he kicks against it. Come, then, we must go
          further. The only reason why one man is saved, and not another, lies
          not, in any sense, in the man saved, but in God's bosom. The reason
          why this day the gospel is preached to you and not the heathen far
          away, is not because, as a race, we are superior to the heathen; it is
          not because we deserve more at God's hands; His choice of Britain, in
          the election of outward privilege, is not caused by the excellency of
          the British nation, but entirely because of His own mercy and His own
          love. There is not reason in us why we should have the gospel preached
          to us more than any other nation. Today, some of us have received the
          gospel, and have been changed by it, and have become the heirs of
          light and immorality, whereas others are left still to be the heirs of
          wrath. But there is no reason in us why we should have been taken and
          others left.
        </p>
        <p>"There was nothing in us to merit esteem,</p>
        <p>Or give the Creator delight.</p>
        <p>'Twas Even so, Father!' we ever must sing,</p>
        <p>Because it seem'd good in thy sight."</p>
        <p>
          And now, let us review this doctrine at length. We are taught in Holy
          Scripture that, long before this world was made, God foreknew and
          foresaw all the creatures He intended to fashion; and there and then
          foreseeing that the human race would fall into sin, and deserve His
          anger, determined, in His own sovereign mind, that an immense portion
          of the human race should be His children, and should be brought to
          Heaven. As to the rest, He left them to their own deserts. to sow the
          wind and reap the whirlwind, to scatter crime and inherit punishment.
          Now, in the great decree of election, the only reason why God selected
          the vessels of mercy must have been because He would do it. There was
          nothing in any one of them which caused God to choose them. We all
          were alike, all lost, all ruined by the fall; all without the
          slightest claim upon His mercy; all, in fact, deserving His utmost
          vengeance. His choice of any one, and His choice of all His people,
          are causeless, so far as anything in them was concerned. It was the
          effect of His sovereign will, and of nothing which they did, could do,
          or even would do; for thus saith the text: "Not for your sakes do I
          this, O house of Israel!"
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the fruit of our election, in due time Christ came into this
          world, and purchased with His blood all those whom the Father hath
          chosen. Now come ye to the cross of Christ; bring this doctrine with
          you, and remember that the only reason why Christ gave up His life to
          be a ransom for His sheep was because He loved His people, but there
          was nothing in His people that made Him die for them. I was thinking
          as I came here this morning, if any man should imagine that the love
          of God to us was caused by anything in us, it would be as if a man
          should look into a well to find the springs of the ocean, or dig into
          an anthill to find an Alp. The love of God is so immense, so boundless
          and so infinite, that you cannot conceive for a moment that it could
          have been caused by anything in us. The little good that is in us --
          the no good that is in us -- for there is none, could not have caused
          the boundless, bottomless, shoreless, summitless love which God
          manifests to His people. Stand at the foot of the cross, ye
          merit-mongers, ye that delight in your own works; and answer this
          question: Do you think that the Lord of life and glory could have been
          brought down from Heaven, could have been fashioned like a man, and
          have been led to die through any merit of yours? Shall these sacred
          veins be opened with any lancet less sharp than His own infinite love?
          Do you conceive that your poor merits, such as they are, could be so
          efficacious as to nail the Redeemer to the tree, and make Him bend His
          shoulders beneath the enormous load of the world's guilt? You cannot
          imagine it. The consequence is so great, compared with what you
          suppose to be the case, that your logic fails in a moment. You may
          conceive that a coral insect rears a rock by its multitude, and by its
          many years of working; but you cannot conceive that all the
          accumulated merits of manhood, if there were such things, could have
          brought the Eternal from the throne of His majesty, and bowed Him to
          the death of the cross: that is a thing as clearly impossible to any
          thoughtful mind, as impossibility can be. No; from the cross comes the
          cry -- "Not for your sakes do I this, O house of Israel."
        </p>
        <p>
          After Christ's death, there comes, in the next place, the work of the
          Holy Spirit. Those whom the Father hath chosen, and whom the Son has
          redeemed, in due time the Holy Spirit calls "out of darkness into
          marvelous light." Now, the calling of the Holy Spirit is without any
          regard to any, merit in us. If this day the Holy Spirit shall call out
          of this congregation a hundred men, and bring them out of their estate
          of sin into a state of righteousness, you shall bring these hundred
          men, and let them march in review, and if you could read their hearts,
          you would be compelled to say, "I see no reason why the Spirit of God
          should have operated upon these. I see nothing whatever that could
          have merited such grace as this -- nothing that could have caused the
          operations and motions of the Spirit to work in these men." For, look
          ye here. By nature, men are said to be dead in sin. If the Holy Spirit
          quickens, it cannot be because of any power in the dead men, or any
          merit in them, for they are dead, corrupt and rotten in the grave of
          their sin. If then, the Holy Spirit says, "Come forth and live," it is
          not because of anything in the dry bones, it must be for some reason
          in His own mind, but not in us. Therefore, know ye this, men and
          brethren, that we all stand upon a level. We have none of us anything
          that can recommend us to God; and if the Spirit shall choose to
          operate in our hearts unto salvation, He must be moved to do it by His
          own supreme love, for He cannot be moved to do it by any good will,
          good desire, or good deed, that dwells in us by nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          To go a little further: this truth, which holds good so far, holds
          good all the way. God's people, after they are called by grace, are
          preserved in Christ Jesus; they are "kept by the power of God through
          faith unto salvation;" they are not suffered to sin away their eternal
          inheritance, but as temptations arise they have strength given with
          which to encounter them, and as sin blackens them they are washed
          afresh, and again cleansed. But mark, the reason why God keeps His
          people is the same as that which made them His people -- His own free
          sovereign grace. If, my brother, you have been delivered in the hour
          of temptation, pause and remember that you were not delivered for your
          own sake. There was nothing in you that deserved the deliverance. If
          you have been fed and supplied in your hour of need, it is not because
          you have been a faithful servant of God, nor because you have been a
          prayerful Christian; it is simply and only because of God's mercy. He
          is not moved to anything He does for you by anything .that you do for
          Him; His motive for blessing you lies wholly and entirely in the
          depths of His own bosom. Blessed be God, His people shall be kept.
        </p>
        <p>"Nor death, nor Hell shall e'er remove</p>
        <p>His favourites from His breast;</p>
        <p>In the dear bosom of His love</p>
        <p>They must forever rest."</p>
        <p>
          But why? Because they are holy? Because they are sanctified? Because
          they serve God with good works? No, but because he in his sovereign
          grace has loved them, does love them, and will love them, even to the
          end.
        </p>
        <p>
          And to conclude my exposition of this text. This shall hold good in
          Heaven itself. The day is coming when every blood-bought, blood-washed
          child of God shall walk the golden streets arrayed in white. Our hands
          shall soon bear the palm; our ears shall be delighted with celestial
          melodies, and our eyes filled with the transporting visions of God's
          glory. But mark, the only reason why God shall bring us to Heaven
          shall be His own love, and not because we deserved it. We must fight
          the fight, but we do not win the victory because we fight it; we must
          labour, but the wage at the days' end shall be a wage of grace, and
          not a debt. We must honour God here, looking for the recompense of the
          reward; but that recompense will not be given on a legal ground,
          because we merited it, but given to us entirely because God had loved
          us, for no reason that was in us. When you and I and each of us shall
          enter Heaven, our song shall be, "Not unto us, not unto us, but unto
          thy name be all the glory;" and that shall be true, it shall not be a
          mere exaggeration of gratitude. It shall be true; we shall be
          compelled to sing it, because we could not sing anything else. We
          shall feel that we did nothing, and that we were nothing, but that God
          did it all -- that we had nothing in us to be the motive of his doing
          it, but that His motive lay in Himself; therefore unto Him shall be
          every particle of the honour forever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, this, I take it, is the meaning of the text; distasteful it is to
          the great majority, even of professing Christians in this age. It is a
          doctrine that requires a great deal of salt, or else few people will
          receive it. It is very unsavory to them. However, there It stands.
          "Let God be true, and every man a liar." His truth we must preach, and
          this we must proclaim. Salvation is "not of men, neither by man; not
          of the will of the flesh, nor of blood," nor of birth, but of the
          sovereign will of God, and God alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now, in the second place, I have to ILLUSTRATE AND ENFORCE
          THIS TEXT.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider a moment man's character. It will humble us, and it will tend
          to confirm this truth in our minds. Let me take an illustration. I
          will consider man as a criminal. He certainly is such in the sight of
          God, and I shall not slander him. Suppose now that some great criminal
          is at last overtaken in his sin, and shut up in Newgate. He has
          committed high treason, murder, rebellion, and every possible
          iniquity. He has broken all the laws of the realm -- every one of
          them. The public cry is everywhere -- "This man must die; the laws
          cannot be maintained unless he shall be made an example of their
          rigour. He who beareth not the sword in vain must this time let the
          sword taste blood. The man must die; he richly deserves it." You look
          through his character: you cannot see one solitary redeeming trait. He
          is an old offender; he has so long persevered in his iniquity that you
          are compelled to say, "The case is hopeless with this man; his crimes
          have such aggravation we cannot make an apology for him, even should
          we try. Not jesuitical cunning itself could devise any pretence of
          excuse, or any hope of a plea for this abandoned wretch; let him die!"
          Now, if her Majesty the Queen, having in her hands the sovereign power
          of life and death, chooses that this man shall not die, but that he
          shall be spared, do you not see as plain as daylight, that the only
          reason that can move her to spare that man, must be her own love, her
          own compassion? For, as I have supposed already that there is nothing
          in that man's character that can be a plea for mercy, but that,
          contrariwise, his whole character cries aloud for vengeance against
          his sin. Whether we like it or not, this is just the truth concerning
          ourselves. This is just our character and position before God. Ah! my
          hearer, you may turn upon your heel, disgusted and offended; but there
          are some here who feel it to be solemnly true in their own experience,
          and they will therefore drink in the doctrine, for it is the only way
          whereby they can be saved. My hearer, your conscience perhaps is
          telling you this morning that you have sinned so heinously that there
          is not an inlet for a solitary ray of hope in your character. You have
          added to your sins this great one, that you have rebelled against the
          Most High wantonly and wickedly. If you have not committed all the
          sins in the calendar of crime, It has been because providence has
          stayed your hand, Your heart has been black enough for it all. You
          feel that the vileness of your imagination and desires has achieved
          the consummation of human guilt, and further you could not go. Your
          sins have prevailed against you, and have gone over your head. Now,
          man, the only ground upon which God can save you is His own love. He
          cannot save you because you deserve it, for you do not deserve it,
          because there is no excuse that might be made for your sin. No, you
          are without any excuse, and you feel it. Oh! bless His dear name, that
          He has devised this way, whereby He can save you upon the basis of His
          own sovereign love and unbounded grace, without anything in you. I
          want you to go back to Newgate again to this criminal. We suppose now
          that this criminal is visited by her Majesty in person. She goes to
          him, and she says to him, "Rebel, traitor, murderer, I have in my
          heart compassion for you; you deserve it not; but I am come this day
          to you, to tell you that if you repent you shall have mercy at my
          hands." Suppose this man, springing up, should curse her -- curse this
          angel of mercy to her face, spit upon her, and utter blasphemies, and
          imprecate curses upon her head. She retires; she is gone; but so great
          is her compassion, that the next day she sends a messenger, and days,
          and weeks, and months, and years, she continually sends messengers,
          and these go to him, and they say, "If you will repent of your
          transgressions you shall have mercy; not because you deserve it, but
          because her Majesty is compassionate, and out of her gracious soul she
          desires your salvation. Will you repent?" Suppose this man should
          curse at the messenger, stop his ears against the message, spit upon
          him, tell him he does not care for him at all. Or to suppose a better
          case -- suppose he turns upon his seat and says, "I don't care whether
          I am hanged or not; I'll take my chance along with other people; I
          shall take no notice of you." And suppose more than that, rising from
          his seat, he indulges again in all the crimes for which he has already
          been condemned, and plunges headlong afresh into the very sins which
          have brought his neck under the rope of the gallows. Now, if her
          Majesty would spare such a man as that, on what terms can she do it?
          You say, "Why, she cannot, unless she does it out of love; she cannot
          because of any merit in him, because such a beast as that ought to
          die." And now what are you and I by nature but like this? And my
          unconverted hearer, what is this but a picture of you? Has not God
          Himself visited your conscience? and has He not said to you, "Sinner!
          come now, let us reason together; though your sins be as scarlet they
          shall be as wool." And what have you done? Stopped your ear against
          the voice of conscience -- cursed and swore at God, blasphemed His
          holy name, despised His Word, and railed against His ministers. And
          this day, again, with tears in his eyes, a servant of God is come to
          you, and his message is, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou
          shalt be saved; as I live, saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the
          death of him that dieth, but had rather that he should turn unto me
          and live." And what will you do. Why, if left to yourselves you will
          laugh at the message -- despise it. It will glance off from you like
          an arrow from a man that is girt about with mail, and you will go away
          to despise God again, as you have done before. Do you not see, then,
          that if God ever shall save you, it cannot be for your sakes; but must
          be from His own infinite love; it cannot be from any other reason,
          since you have rejected Christ, despised His gospel, trodden under
          foot the blood of Jesus, and have refused to be saved. If He saves
          you, it must be free grace, and free grace alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now picture a little more about this criminal at Newgate. Not
          content with having added sin to sin, and having rejected mercy for
          himself, this wretch industriously employs himself in going round to
          all the cells where others are confined, and hardening their hearts
          also against the mercy of the Queen. He can scarce see a person but he
          begins to taint him with the blasphemy of his own heart; he utters
          injurious things against the majesty that spares him, and endeavours
          to make others as vile as himself. Now, what does justice say? If this
          man ought not to die on his own account, yet he ought to die for the
          sake of others; and if he be spared, is it not as plain as a pike --
          staff that he cannot be spared because of any reason in him? It must
          be because of the unconquerable compassion of the Sovereign. And now
          look you here: is not this the case of some here present? Not only do
          you sin yourselves, but lead others into sin? I know this was one of
          my plagues and torments, when first God brought me to Himself, that I
          have led others into temptation. Are there not men here that have
          taught others to swear? Are there not fathers here that have helped to
          destroy their own children's souls? Are there not some of you that are
          like the deadly Upas tree? You stretch out your branches, and from
          every leaf there drops poison upon those who come beneath its deadly
          range. Are there not some here who have seduced the virtuous, that
          have misled those who were seemingly pious, and that are perhaps so
          hardened that they even glory in it? Not content with being damned
          yourselves, you are seeking to lead others to the pit also. Thinking
          it not enough yourselves to be at enmity with God, you want to imitate
          Satan by dragging others with you. O my hearer, is not this thy case?
          Does not thy heart confess it? And does not the tear flow down thy
          cheek? Remember, then, this must be true: if God shall save thee, it
          must be because He will do it. It cannot be because there is anything
          good in thee, for thou deservedst now to die, and if He spare thee it
          must be sovereign love and sovereign grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will just use one other illustration, and then, I think I shall have
          made the text clear enough. There is not so much difference between
          black and a darker shade of black as there is between pure white and
          black. Every one can see that. Then there is not so much difference
          between man and the devil as there is between God and man. God is
          perfection; we are black with sin. The devil is only a darker shade of
          black; and great as may be the difference between our sin and the sin
          of Satan, yet it is not so great as the difference between the
          perfection of God and the imperfection of man. Now, imagine for a
          minute that somewhere in Africa there should be a tribe of devils
          living, that you and I had it in our power to save these devils from
          some threatened wrath which must overtake them. If you or I should go
          there and die to save those devils, what could be our motive? From
          what we know of the character of a devil, the only motive that could
          make us do that must be love. There could not be any other. It must be
          simply because we had such big hearts that we could even embrace
          fiends within them. Well, now, there is not so much difference between
          man and the devil as between God and man. If, then, the only motive
          that could make men save a devil must be man's love, does it not
          follow with irresistible force, that the only motive that could lead
          God to save men must be God's own love. At any rate, if that reason be
          not cogent the fact is indisputable -- "Not for your sakes do I this,
          O house of Israel." God sees us, abandoned, evil, wicked, and
          deserving His wrath; if He saves us, it is His boundless, fathomless
          love that leads Him to do it -- nothing whatever in us.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, having thus preached this doctrine, and enforced it, I
          come to a very solemn PRACTICAL APPLICATION. And here may God the Holy
          Spirit help me labour with your hearts!
        </p>
        <p>
          First, since this doctrine is true, how humble a Christian man ought
          to be. If thou be saved, thou hast had nought to do with it; God has
          done it. If thou be saved, thou hast not deserved it. It is mercy
          undeserved which thou hast received. I have sometimes been delighted
          when I have seen the gratitude of abandoned characters to any who have
          assisted them. I remember visiting a house of refuge. There was a poor
          girl there who had fallen into sin long, and when she found herself
          kindly addressed and recognized by society, and saw a Christian
          minister longing after her soul's good, it broke her heart. What
          should a man of God care about her? she was so vile. How could it be
          that a Christian should speak to her? Ah! but how much more should
          that feeling rise in our hearts? My God! I have rebelled against thee,
          and yet thou hast loved me, unworthy me! How can it be? I cannot lift
          myself up with pride, I must bow down before Thee in speechless
          gratitude. Remember, my dear brethren, that not only is the mercy
          which you and I have received undeserved, but it was unasked. It is
          true you prayed, but not till free grace made you pray. You would have
          been, to this day, hardened in heart, without God, and without Christ,
          had not free grace saved you. Can you be proud then? -- proud of mercy
          which, if I may use the term, has been forced upon you? -- proud of
          grace which has been given you against your will, until your will was
          changed by sovereign grace? And think again. All the mercy you have
          you once refused, Christ sups with you; be not proud of His company.
          Remember, there was a day when He knocked, and you refused -- when He
          came to the door and said, "My head is wet with dew, and my locks with
          the drops of the night; open to me, my beloved;" and you barred it in
          His face and would not let Him enter. Be not proud, then, of what thou
          hast, when thou rememberest that thou didst once reject Him. Does God
          embrace Thee in His arms of love? Remember, once thou liftedst up
          thine hand of rebellion against Him. Is thy name written in His book?
          Ah! there was a time when, if it had been in thy power, thou wouldst
          have erased the sacred lines that contained thine own salvation. Can
          we, dare we, lift up our wicked head with pride, when all these things
          should make us hang our heads down in the deepest humility? That is
          one lesson: let us learn another.
        </p>
        <p>
          This doctrine is true, and therefore it should be a subject of the
          greatest gratitude. When meditating upon this text yesterday, the
          effect it had upon me was one of transport and joy. Oh! I thought,
          upon what other condition could I have been saved? And I looked back
          upon my past estate; I saw myself piously trained and educated, but
          revolting against all that. I saw a mother's tears shed over me in
          vain, and a father's admonition lost upon me, and yet I found myself
          saved by grace, and I could only say, "Lord, I bless Thee that it is
          by grace, for if it had been by merit I had never been saved. If thou
          hadst waited till there was something good in me, thou wouldst have
          waited till I sank into the hopeless perdition of hell, for good in
          man there never would have been, unless thou hadst first put it
          there." And then I thought immediately, "Oh! how I could go and preach
          that to the poor sinner!" Ah! let me try if I cannot. O sinner! you
          say you dare not come to Christ because you have nothing to recommend
          you. He does not want anything to recommend you; He will not save you,
          if you have anything to recommend you, for His says, "Not for you sake
          do I this." Go to Christ with earrings in your ears, and jewels upon
          you; wash your face, and array yourself with gold and silver, and go
          before Him and say, "Lord, save me; I have washed myself and clothed
          myself; save me!" "Get you gone! Not for your sakes will I do this."
          Go to Him again, and say, "Lord, I have put a rope about my neck, and
          sackcloth about my loins; see how repentant I am, see how I feel my
          need; now save me!" "No," saith He, "I would not save you on account
          of your flaunting robes, and now I will not save you because of your
          rags; I will save you for nothing about you; if I do save you, it will
          be from something in my heart, not from anything you feel. Get ye
          gone!" But if today you go to Christ and say, "Lord Jesus, there is no
          reason in the world why I should be saved -- there is one in Heaven;
          Lord, I cannot urge any plea, I deserve to be lost, I have no excuse
          to make for all my sins, no apology to offer; Lord, I deserve it, and
          there is nothing in me why I should be saved, for if thou wouldst save
          me I should make but a poor Christian, after all; I fear that my
          future works will be no honour to Thee -- I wish they could be, but
          thy grace must make them good, else they will still be bad. But, Lord,
          thou I have nothing to bring, and nothing to say for myself, I do say
          this: I have heard that thou hast come into the world to save sinners
          -- O Lord, save me!
        </p>
        <p>'I the chief of sinners am.'</p>
        <p>
          I confess I do not feel this as I ought, I do not mourn it as I ought;
          I have no repentance to recommend me; nay, Lord, I have no faith to
          recommend me either, for I do not believe thy promise as I ought; but
          oh! I cling to this text. Lord, thou hast said thou wilt not do it for
          my sake. I thank Thee thou hast said that. Thou couldst not do it for
          my sake, for I have no reason why thou shouldst. Lord, I claim thy
          gracious promise. Be merciful to me, a sinner."' Ah! you good people,
          this doctrine does not suit some of you; it is too humbling, is it
          not? You that have kept your churches regularly, and been to meetings
          so piously, you that never broke the Sabbath, or never swore an oath,
          or did anything wrong, this does not suit you. You say it will do very
          well to preach to harlots, and drunkards, and swearers, but it will
          not suit such good people as we are. Ah! well, this is your text -- "I
          have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." You
          are "whole" -- you are; you "need not a physician, but they that are
          sick." Go your way. Christ came to save such as you are. You think you
          can save yourselves. Do it, and perish in the doing of it. But I feel
          that the same gospel that suits a harlot suits me, and that that free
          grace which saved Saul of Tarsus must save me, else I am never saved.
          Come, let us all go together. We are all guilty -- some more, some
          less, but all hopelessly guilty. Let us go together to the footstool
          of His mercy, and though we dare not look up, let us lie there in the
          dust, and sigh out again, "Lord have mercy upon us for whom Jesus
          died."
        </p>
        <p>"Just as I am, without one plea,</p>
        <p>But that thy blood was shed for me,</p>
        <p>And that thou bidst me come to Thee,</p>
        <p>O Lamb of God, I come, I come."</p>
        <p>
          Sinner, come now; come now, I beseech thee; I entreat thee, come now.
          O Spirit of the living God, draw them now! Let these feeble weak words
          be the means of drawing souls to Christ. Will you reject my Master
          again? Will you go out of this house hardened once more? You may never
          again have such feelings as those which are aroused in your soul.
          Come, now, receive His mercy; now bend your willing necks to His yoke;
          and then I know you shall go away to taste His faithful love, and at
          last to sing in Heaven the song of the redeemed -- "Unto him that
          loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, unto him be
          glory forever. Amen."
        </p>
        <p>"O thou great eternal Jesus,</p>
        <p>High and mighty Prince of Peace,</p>
        <p>How Thy wonders shine resplendent,</p>
        <p>In the wonders of Thy grace:</p>
        <p>Thy rich gospel scorns conditions,</p>
        <p>Breathes salvation free as air;</p>
        <p>Only breathes triumphant mercy,</p>
        <p>Baffling guilt, and all despair.</p>
        <p>"O the grandeur of the gospel,</p>
        <p>How it sounds the cleansing blood;</p>
        <p>Shows the bowels of a Saviour,</p>
        <p>Shows the tender heart of God.</p>
        <p>Only treats of love eternal,</p>
        <p>Swells the all-abounding grace,</p>
        <p>Nothing knows but life and pardon,</p>
        <p>Full redemption, endless peace."<br /></p>
