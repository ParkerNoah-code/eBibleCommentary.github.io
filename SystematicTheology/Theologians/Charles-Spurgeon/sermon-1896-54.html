          10. Sending out springs by the valleys, which shall run between the
          hills.11. All the beasts of the field shall drink thereof: the wild
          asses shall quench their thirst.12. Nigh them the fowls of the air
          shall dwell, from the midst of the branches they shall send out their
          voice. 13. Watering the mountains from his chambers: the earth shall
          be satisfied from the fruit of thy works.14. Making grass to grow for
          cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may produce bread out
          of the earth.15. And wine cheereth the heart of man, to make his face
          to shine with oil, and bread sustaineth man's heart.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          10. Sending out springs by the valleys The Psalmist here describes
          another instance both of the power and goodness of God, which is, that
          he makes fountains to gush out in the mountains, and to run down
          through the midst of the valleys. Although it is necessary for the
          earth to be dry, to render it a fit habitation for us, yet, unless we
          had water to drink, and unless the earth opened her veins, all kinds
          of living creatures would perish. The prophet, therefore, speaks in
          commendation of that arrangement by which the earth, though dry, yet
          supplies us with water by its moisture. The word nchlym, nechalim,
          which I have rendered springs, is by some translated, torrents or
          rivers; but springs is more appropriate. In the same sense it is added
          immediately after, that they run among the hills; and yet, it is
          scarcely credible that fountains could spring forth from rocks and
          stony places. But here it may be asked, why the prophet says that the
          beasts of the field quench their thirst, rather than men, for whose
          sake the world was created? I would observe, in reply, that he
          obviously spake in this manner, for the purpose of enhancing the
          goodness of God, who vouchsafes to extend his care to the brute
          creation, yea, even to the wild asses, under which species are
          included all other kinds of wild beasts. And he purposely refers to
          desert places, that each of us may compare with them the more
          pleasant, and the cultivated parts of the earth, afterwards mentioned.
          Rivers run even through great and desolate wildernesses, where the
          wild beasts enjoy some blessing of God; and no country is so barren as
          not to have trees growing here and there, on which birds make the air
          to resound with the melody of their singing. Since even those regions
          where all lies waste and uncultivated, furnish manifest tokens of the
          Divine goodness and power, with what admiration ought we to regard
          that most abundant supply of all good things, which is to be seen in
          cultivated and favorable regions? Surely in countries where not only
          one river flows, or where not only grass grows for the feeding of wild
          beasts, or where the singing of birds is heard not only from a few
          trees, but where a manifold and varied abundance of good things
          everywhere presents itself to our view, our stupidity is more than
          brutish, if our minds, by such manifestations of the goodness of God,
          are not fixed in devout meditation on his glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same subject is prosecuted in the 13th verse, where it is said
          that God watereth the mountains from his chambers It is no ordinary
          miracle that the mountains, which seem to be condemned to perpetual
          drought, and which, in a manner, are suspended in the air,
          nevertheless abound in pastures. The prophet, therefore, justly
          concludes that this fruitfulness proceeds from nothing else but the
          agency of God, who is their secret cultivator. Labour cannot indeed,
          in the proper sense, be attributed to God, but still it is not without
          reason applied to him, for, by merely blessing the earth from the
          place of his repose, he works more efficaciously than if all the men
          in the world were to waste themselves by incessant labor.
        </p>
        <p>
          14. Making grass to grow for cattle The Psalmist now comes to men, of
          whom God vouchsafes to take a special care as his children. After
          having spoken of the brute creation, he declares, that corn is
          produced, and bread made of it, for the nourishment of the human race;
          and he mentions in addition to this, wine and oil, two things which
          not only supply the need of mankind, but also contribute to their
          cheerful enjoyment of life. Some understand the Hebrew word lvdt,
          la√§bodath, which I have rendered for the service, to denote the labor
          which men bestow in husbandry; for while grass grows on the mountains
          of itself, and without human labor, corn and herbs, which are sown,
          can only be produced, as is well known, by the labor and sweat of men.
          According to them the meaning is, that God blesses the toil of men in
          the cultivation of the fields. But this being too strained an
          interpretation, it is better to understand the word service, in the
          ordinary sense of the term. With respect to the word bread, I do not
          object to the view of those who understand it in a restricted sense,
          although it probably includes all kinds of food; only I dislike the
          opinion of those who exclude bread. There is no force in the reason
          which they allege for taking this view, namely, that in the following
          verse another use of bread is added, when it is said, that it
          strengthens the heart of man; for there the same thing is expressed in
          different words. The prophet, in stating that God causeth the earth to
          bring forth herbs for the support of men, intends to say that the
          earth supplies them not only with food in corn, but also with other
          herbs and fruits; for the means of our sustenance is not limited
          exclusively to one kind of food.
        </p>
        <p>
          15. And wine that cheereth the heart of man In these words we are
          taught, that God not only provides for men's necessity, and bestows
          upon them as much as is sufficient for the ordinary purposes of life,
          but that in his goodness he deals still more bountifully with them by
          cheering their hearts with wine and oil. Nature would certainly be
          satisfied with water to drink; and therefore the addition of wine is
          owing to God's superabundant liberality. The expression, and oil to
          make his face to shine, has been explained in different ways. As
          sadness spreads a gloom over the countenance, some give this
          exposition, That when men enjoy the commodities of wine and oil, their
          faces shine with gladness. Some with more refinement of
          interpretation, but without foundation, refer this to lamps. Others,
          considering the letter m, mem to be the sign of the comparative
          degree, take the meaning to be, that wine makes men's faces shine more
          than if they were anointed with oil. But the prophet, I have no doubt,
          speaks of unguents, intimating that God not only bestows upon men what
          is sufficient for their moderate use, but that he goes beyond this,
          giving them even their delicacies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The words in the last clause, and bread that sustains man's heart, I
          interpret thus: Bread would be sufficient to support the life of man,
          but God over and above, to use a common expression, bestows upon them
          wine and oil. The repetition then of the purpose which bread serves is
          not superfluous: it is employed to commend to us the goodness of God
          in his tenderly and abundantly nourishing men as a kind-hearted father
          does his children. For this reason, it is here stated again, that as
          God shows himself a foster-father sufficiently bountiful in providing
          bread, his liberality appears still more conspicuous in giving us
          dainties.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as there is nothing to which we are more prone, than to abuse
          God's benefits by giving way to excess, the more bountiful he is
          towards men, the more ought they to take care not to pollute, by their
          intemperance, the abundance which is presented before them. Paul had
          therefore good reason for giving that prohibition, (Romans 13:14)
        </p>
        <p>"Make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof;"</p>
        <p>
          for if we give full scope to the desires of the flesh, there will be
          no bounds. As God bountifully provides for us, so he has appointed a
          law of temperance, that each may voluntarily restrain himself in his
          abundance. He sends out oxen and asses into pastures, and they content
          themselves with a sufficiency; but while furnishing us with more than
          we need, he enjoins upon us an observance of the rules of moderation,
          that we may not voraciously devour his benefits; and in lavishing upon
          us a more abundant supply of good things than our necessities require,
          he puts our moderation to the test. The proper rule with respect to
          the use of bodily sustenance, is to partake of it that it may sustain,
          but not oppress us. The mutual communication of the things needful for
          the support of the body, which God has enjoined upon us, is a very
          good check to intemperance; for the condition upon which the rich are
          favored with their abundance is, that they should relieve the wants of
          their brethren. As the prophet in this account of the divine goodness
          in providence makes no reference to the excesses of men, we gather
          from his words that it is lawful to use wine not only in cases of
          necessity, but also thereby to make us merry. This mirth must however
          be tempered with sobriety, first, that men may not forget themselves,
          drown their senses, and destroy their strength, but rejoice before
          their God, according to the injunction of Moses, (Leviticus 23:40;)
          and, secondly, that they may exhilarate their minds under a sense of
          gratitude, so as to be rendered more active in the service of God. He
          who rejoices in this way will also be always prepared to endure
          sadness, whenever God is pleased to send it. That rule of Paul ought
          to be kept in mind, (Philippians 4:12,)
        </p>
        <p>"I have learned to abound, -- I have learned to suffer want."</p>
        <p>
          If some token of the divine anger is manifest, even he who has an
          overflowing abundance of all kinds of dainty food, will restrict
          himself in his diet knowing that he is called to put on sackcloth, and
          to sit among ashes. Much more ought he whom poverty compels to be
          temperate and sober, to abstain from such delicacies. In short, if one
          man is constrained to abstain from wine by sickness, if another has
          only vapid wine, and a third nothing but water, let each be content
          with his own lot, and willingly and submissively wean himself from
          those gratifications which God denies him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same remarks apply to oil. We see from this passage that ointments
          were much in use among the Jews, as well as among the other eastern
          nations. At the present day, it is different with us, who rather keep
          ointments for medicinal purposes, than use them as articles of luxury.
          The prophet, however, says, that oil also is given to men, that they
          may anoint themselves therewith. But as men are too prone to pleasure,
          it is to be observed, that the law of temperance ought not to be
          separated from the beneficence of God, lest they abuse their liberty
          by indulging in luxurious excess. This exception must always be added,
          that no person may take encouragement from this doctrine to
          licentiousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, when men have been carefully taught to bridle their lust, it
          is important for them to know, that God permits them to enjoy
          pleasures in moderation, where there is the ability to provide them;
          else they will never partake even of bread and wine with a tranquil
          conscience; yea, they will begin to scruple about the tasting of
          water, at least they will never come to the table but in fearfulness.
          Meanwhile, the greater part of the world will wallow in pleasures
          without discrimination, because they do not consider what God permits
          them; for his fatherly kindness should be to us the best mistress to
          teach us moderation.<br />
