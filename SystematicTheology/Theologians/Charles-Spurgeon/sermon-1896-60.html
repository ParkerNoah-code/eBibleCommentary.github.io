          The Psalmist magnifies the singular grace of God displayed in
          selecting and freely adopting one people from amongst all nations of
          the world. To show that it was not in word only that he had made a
          covenant with Abraham and his offspring, God did not cease, after
          having delivered them from Egypt, to confer upon them innumerable
          benefits; and his design in this was, that those who had been
          delivered might on their part faithfully keep his covenant, and devote
          themselves unfeignedly to his service. <br />
