<p align="center">PSALM 62 <br/>
 </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">TITLE. <b>To the Chief Musician, to Jeduthun.</b> This is 
    the second Psalm which is dedicated to Jeduthun, or Ethan, the former one 
    being the thirty-ninth, a Psalm which is almost a twin with this in many 
    respects, containing in the original the word translated only four times as 
    this does six. </p>
<p align="justify">We shall meet with two other Psalms similarly appointed 
    for Jeduthun: namely, Psalms 77, and 89.</p>
<p align="justify">The sons of Jeduthun were porters or doorkeepers, 
    according to 1 Chronicles 16:42. Those who serve well make the best of 
    singers, and those who occupy the highest posts in the choir must not be 
    ashamed to wait at the posts of the doors of the Lord's house. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">A PSALM OF DAVID.</p></b> Even had not the signature of the 
    royal poet been here placed, we should have been sure from internal evidence 
    that he alone penned these stanzas; they are truly Davidic. From the 
    six-fold use of the word <i>only</i>, we have been accustomed to call it THE 
    ONLY PSALM.
<p align="justify">DIVISION. The Psalmist has marked his own pauses, by 
    inserting SELAH at the end of verses 4 and 8. His true and sole confidence 
    in God laughs to scorn all its enemies. When this Psalm was composed it was 
    not necessary for us to know, since true faith is always in season, and is 
    usually under trial. Moreover, the sentiments here uttered are suitable to 
    occasions which are very frequent in a believer's life, and therefore no one 
    historic incident is needful for their explanation.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. Truly</p></b>, or truly, or only. The last is 
    probably the most prominent sense here. That faith alone is true which rests 
    on God alone, that confidence which relies but partly on the Lord is vain 
    confidence. If we Anglicized the word by our word truly, as some do, we 
    should have here a striking reminder of our blessed Lord's frequent use of 
    that adverb. 
<b>
<p align="justify">My soul waits upon God.</p></b> My inmost self draws near in 
    reverent obedience to God. I am no hypocrite or mere posture maker. To wait 
    upon God, and for God, is the habitual position of faith; to wait on him 
    truly is sincerity; to wait on him <i>only </i>is spiritual chastity. 
<p align="justify">The original is, "only to God is my soul silence." <i>The 
    presence of God alone could awe his heart into quietude, submission, rest, 
    and acquiescence</i>; but when that was felt, not a rebellious word or 
    thought broke the peaceful silence. </p>
<p align="justify">The proverb that "speech is silver but silence is gold," 
    is more than true in this case. <i>No eloquence in the world is half so full 
    of meaning as the patient silence of a child of God. </i>It is an eminent 
    work of grace to bring down the will and subdue the affections to such a 
    degree, that the whole mind lies before the Lord like the sea beneath the 
    wind, ready to be moved by every breath of his mouth, but free from all 
    inward and self-caused emotion, as also from all power to be moved by 
    anything other than the divine will. We should be wax to the Lord, but 
    adamant to every other force. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">From him comes my salvation. </p></b>The godly man will, 
    therefore, in patience possess his soul until deliverance comes. Faith can 
    hear the footsteps of coming salvation, because she has learned to be 
    silent. Our salvation in no measure or degree comes to us from any inferior 
    source; let us, therefore, look alone to the true fountain, and avoid the 
    detestable crime of ascribing to the creature what belongs alone to the 
    Creator. 
<p align="justify">If to wait on God be worship, to wait on the creature is 
    idolatry. If to wait on God alone be true faith, to associate an arm of the 
    flesh with him is audacious unbelief.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. He only is my rock and my salvation. </p></b>
    Sometimes a metaphor may be more full of meaning and more suggestive than 
    literal speech: hence the use of the figure of a rock, the very mention of 
    which would awaken grateful memories in the psalmists' mind. David had often 
    lain concealed in rocky caverns, and here he compares his God to such a 
    secure refuge; and, indeed, declares him to be his only real protection, 
    all-sufficient in himself and never failing. 
<p align="justify">At the same time, as if to show us that what he wrote was 
    not mere poetic sentiment but blessed reality, the literal word salvation 
    follows the figurative expression: that our God is our refuge is no fiction, 
    nothing in the world is more a matter of fact. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">He is my fortress</p></b>, my height, my lofty rampart, my 
    high fort. Here we have another and bolder image; the tried believer not 
    only abides in God as in a cavernous rock; but dwells in him as a warrior in 
    some bravely defiant tower or lordly castle. 
<b>
<p align="justify">I shall not be greatly moved.</p></b> His personal weakness 
    might cause him to be somewhat moved; but his faith would come in to prevent 
    any very great disturbance; not much would he be tossed about. Moved, as one 
    says, "but not removed." Moved like a ship at anchor which swings with the 
    tide, but is not swept away by the tempest. 
<p align="justify">When a man knows assuredly that the Lord is his 
    salvation, he cannot be very much cast down: it would need more than all the 
    devils in Hell greatly to alarm a heart which knows God to be its salvation.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. How long will you imagine mischief against a 
    man? </p></b>It is always best to begin with God, and then we may confront our 
    enemies. Make all sure with Heaven, then may you grapple with earth and 
    Hell.
<p align="justify">David expostulates with his insensate foes; he marvels at 
    their dogged perseverance in malice, after so many failures and with certain 
    defeat before them. He tells them that their design was an imaginary one, 
    which they never could accomplish however deeply they might plot. </p>
<p align="justify">It is a marvel that men will readily enough continue in 
    vain and sinful courses, and yet to persevere in grace is so great a 
    difficulty as to be an impossibility, were it not for divine assistance. The 
    persistency of those who oppose the people of God is so strange that we may 
    well expostulate with them and say, "How long will you thus display your 
    malice?" </p>
<p align="justify">A hint is given in the text as to the cowardliness of so 
    many pressing upon one man; but none are less likely to act a fair and manly 
    part than those who are opposed to God's people for righteousness' sake. </p>
<p align="justify">Satan could not enter into combat with Job in fair duel, 
    but must needs call in the Sabeans and Chaldeans, and even then must borrow 
    the lightning and the wind before his first attack was complete. If there 
    were any shame in him, or in his children, they would be ashamed of the 
    dastardly manner in which they have waged war against the seed of the woman. 
    Ten thousand to one has not seemed to them too mean an advantage; there is 
    not a drop of chivalrous blood in all their veins. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">You shall be slain all of you.</p></b> Your sharp-edged tools 
    will cut your own fingers. Those who take the sword shall perish with the 
    sword. However many or fierce the bands of the wicked may be, they shall not 
    escape the just retribution of Heaven; rigorously shall the great Lawgiver 
    exact blood from men of blood, and award death to those who seek the death 
    of others.
<b>
<p align="justify">As a bowing wall shall you be, and as a tottering fence.</p></b> 
    Boastful persecutors bulge and swell with pride, but they are only as a 
    bulging wall ready to fall in a heap; they lean forward to seize their prey, 
    but it is only as a tottering fence inclines to the earth upon which it will 
    soon lie at length. They expect men to bow to them, and quake for fear in 
    their presence; but men made bold by faith see nothing in them to honor, and 
    very, very much to despise. 
<i>
<p align="justify">It is never well on our part to think highly of ungodly 
    people; whatever their position, they are near their destruction,</p></i> they 
    totter to their fall; it will be our wisdom to keep our distance, for no one 
    is advantaged by being near a falling wall; if it does not crush with its 
    weight, it may stifle with its dust. 
<p align="justify">The passage is thought to be more correctly rendered as 
    follows: "How long will you press on one man, that you may crush him in a 
    body, like a toppling wall, a sinking fence?"</p>
<p align="justify">We have, however, kept to our own version as yielding a 
    good and profitable meaning. Both senses may blend in our meditations; for 
    if David's enemies battered him as though they could throw him down like a 
    bulging wall, he, on the other hand, foresaw that they themselves would by 
    retributive justice be overthrown like an old crumbling, leaning, yielding 
    fence.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. They only consult to cast him down from his 
    excellency. </p></b>The excellencies of the righteous are obnoxious to the 
    wicked, and the main object of their fury. The elevation which God gives to 
    the godly in Providence, or in disputation, is also the envy of the baser 
    sort, and they labor to pull them down to their own level. 
<p align="justify">Observe the concentration of malice upon our point only, 
    as here set in contrast with the sole reliance of the gracious one upon his 
    Lord. If the wicked could but ruin the work of grace in us, they would be 
    content; to crush our character, to overturn our influence, is the object of 
    their consultation. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">They delight in lies</p></b>; hence they hate the truth and 
    the truthful, and by falsehood endeavor to compass their overthrow. To lie 
    is base enough, but to <i>delight </i>in it is one of the blackest marks of 
    infamy. 
<b>
<p align="justify">They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. </p></b>
    Flattery has ever been a favorite weapon with the enemies of godly men; they 
    can curse bitterly enough when it serves their turn; meanwhile, since it 
    answers their purpose, <i>they mask their wrath, and with smooth words 
    pretend to bless those whom they would willingly tear in pieces</i>. It was 
    fortunate for David that he was well practiced in silence, for to cozening 
    deceivers there is no other safe reply. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Selah. </p></b>Here pause, and consider with astonishment the 
    futile rancor of unholy men, and the perfect security of such as rest 
    themselves upon the Lord.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. My soul, wait only upon God.</p></b> When we have 
    already practiced a virtue, it is yet needful that we bind ourselves to a 
    continuance in it. The soul is apt to be dragged away from its anchorage, or 
    is readily tempted to add a second confidence to the one sole and sure 
    ground of reliance; we must, therefore, stir ourselves up to maintain the 
    holy position which we were at first able to assume. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Be still silent, O my soul!</p></b> submit yourself 
    completely, trust immovably, wait patiently. Let none of your enemies' 
    imaginings, consultings, flatteries, or maledictions cause you to break the 
    King's peace. Be like the sheep before her shearers, and like your Lord, 
    conquer by the passive resistance of victorious patience. You can only 
    achieve this as you shall be inwardly persuaded of God's presence, and as 
    you wait solely and alone on him. 
<p align="justify">Unmingled faith is undismayed. Faith with a single eye 
    sees herself secure, but if her eye be darkened by two confidences, she is 
    blind and useless. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">For my expectation is from him.</p></b> We expect from God 
    because we believe in him. Expectation is the child of prayer and faith, and 
    is owned of the Lord as an acceptable grace. We should desire nothing but 
    what would be right for God to give, then our expectation would be all from 
    God; and concerning truly good things we should not look to second causes, 
    but to the Lord alone, and so again our expectation would be all from him. 
    The vain expectations of worldly men come not; they promise but there is no 
    performance. Our expectations are on the way, and in due season will arrive 
    to satisfy our hopes.<i> Happy is the man who feels that all he has, all he 
    wants, and all he expects are to be found in his God.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. He only is my rock and my salvation. </p></b>Alone, 
    and without other help, God is the foundation and completion of my safety. 
    We cannot too often hear the toll of that great bell only; let it ring the 
    death knell of all carnal reliances, and lead us to cast ourselves on the 
    bare arm of God.
<b>
<p align="justify">He is my defense. </p></b>Not my defender only, but my actual 
    protection. I am secure, because he is faithful. 
<b>
<p align="justify">I shall not be moved</p></b>—not even in the least degree.
    
<p align="justify">See how his confidence grows. In the second verse an 
    adverb qualified his quiet; here, however, it is absolute; he altogether 
    defies the rage of his adversaries, he will not stir an inch, nor be made to 
    fear even in the smallest degree. A living faith grows; experience develops 
    the spiritual muscles of the saint, and gives a manly force which our 
    religious childhood has not yet reached.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. In God is my salvation and my glory. </p></b>Wherein 
    should we glory but in him who saves us? Our honor may well be left with him 
    who secures our souls. <i>To find all in God, and to glory that it is so, is 
    one of the sure marks of an enlightened soul. 
</i><b>
<p align="justify">The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. </p></b>He 
    multiplies titles, for he would render much honor to the Lord, whom he had 
    tried, and proved to be a faithful God under so many aspects. Ignorance 
    needs but few words, but when experience brings a wealth of knowledge, we 
    need varied expressions to serve as coffers for our treasure. God who is our 
    rock when we flee for shelter, is also our strong rock when we stand firm 
    and defy the foe; he is to be praised under both characters. 
<p align="justify">Observe how the psalmist brands his own initials upon 
    every name which he rejoicingly gives to his God—<i>my</i> expectation, <i>
    my </i>rock, <i>my </i>salvation, <i>my </i>glory, <i>my </i>strength, <i>my
    </i>refuge. He is not content to know that the Lord is all these things; he 
    acts faith towards him, and lays claim to him under every character. </p>
<p align="justify">What are the mines of Peru or Golconda to me if I have no 
    inheritance in them? It is the word MY which puts the honey into the comb. 
    If our experience has not yet enabled us to realize the Lord under any of 
    these consoling titles, we must seek grace that we may yet be partakers of 
    their sweetness. </p>
<p align="justify">The bees in some way or other penetrate the flowers and 
    collect their juices; it must be hard for them to enter the closed cups and 
    mouthless bags of some of the favorites of the garden—yet the honey 
    gatherers find or make a passage; and in this they are our instructors, for 
    into each delightful name, character, and office of our covenant God our 
    persevering faith must find an entrance, and from each it must draw delight.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. Trust in him at all times.</p></b> Faith is an 
    abiding duty, a perpetual privilege. We should trust when we can see, as 
    well as when we are utterly in the dark. Adversity is a fit season for 
    faith; but prosperity is not less so. <i>God at all times deserves our 
    confidence. We at all times need to place our confidence in him</i>. A day 
    without trust in God is a day of wrath, even if it be a day of mirth. Lean 
    ever, you saints, on him, on whom the world leans. 
<b>
<p align="justify">You people, pour out your heart before him.</p></b> You to 
    whom his love is revealed, reveal yourselves to him. His heart is set on 
    you, lay bare your hearts to him. Turn the vessel of your soul upside down 
    in his secret presence, and let your inmost thoughts, desires, sorrows, and 
    sins be poured out like water. Hide nothing from him, for you can hide 
    nothing. To the Lord unburden your soul; let him be your only father 
    confessor, for he only can absolve you when he has heard your confession.
    
<p align="justify">To keep our griefs to ourselves is to hoard up 
    wretchedness. The stream will swell and rage if you dam it up: give it a 
    clear course, and it leaps along and creates no alarm. Sympathy we need, and 
    if we unload our hearts at Jesus' feet, we shall obtain a sympathy as 
    practical as it is sincere, as consolatory as it is ennobling. </p>
<p align="justify">The writer in the Westminster Assembly's Annotations well 
    observes that it is the tendency of our wicked nature to bite the bridle, 
    and hide our grief in sullenness; but the gracious soul will overcome this 
    propensity, and utter its sorrow before the Lord. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">God is a refuge for us.</p></b> Whatever he may be to others, 
    his own people have a peculiar heritage in him; for us he is undoubtedly a 
    refuge: here then is the best of reasons for resorting to him whenever 
    sorrows weigh upon our bosoms. Prayer is peculiarly the duty of those to 
    whom the Lord has specially revealed himself as their defense. 
<b>
<p align="justify">SELAH.</p></b> Precious pause! Timely silence! Sheep may well 
    lie down when such pasture is before them.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. Surely men of low degree are vanity.</p></b> Here 
    the word is only again; men of low degree are <i>only vanity</i>, nothing 
    more. They are many and enthusiastic, but they are not to be depended on; 
    they are mobile as the waves of the sea, ready to be driven to and fro by 
    any and every wind; they cry "Hosanna" today, and "Crucify him" tomorrow.
    
<p align="justify">The instability of popular applause is a proverb; as well 
    build a house with smoke as find comfort in the adulation of the multitude.
    </p>
<p align="justify">As the first son of Adam was called Abel or vanity, so 
    here we are taught that all the sons of Adam are Abels. It were well if they 
    were all so in character as well as in name; but alas! in this respect, too 
    many of them are Cains.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And men of high degree are a lie.</p></b> That is worse. We 
    gain little by putting our trust in the aristocracy, they are not one whit 
    better than the democracy—nay, they are even worse, for we expect something 
    from them, but get nothing. 
<p align="justify">May we not trust the elite? Surely reliance may be placed 
    in the educated, the chivalrous, the intelligent? For this reason are they a 
    lie; because they promise so much, and in the end, when relied upon, yield 
    nothing but disappointment. How wretched is that poor man who puts his trust 
    in princes. </p>
<p align="justify">The more we rely upon God, the more shall we perceive <i>
    the utter hollowness of every other confidence</i>.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">To be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter 
    than vanity. </p></b>Take a true estimate of them; judge them neither by 
    quantity nor by appearance, but by weight, and they will no longer deceive 
    you. Calmly deliberate, quietly ponder, and your verdict will be that which 
    inspiration here records. 
<p align="justify">Vainer than vanity itself are all human confidences—the 
    great and the mean, alike, are unworthy of our trust.<i> A feather has some 
    weight in the scale, vanity has none, and creature confidence has less than 
    that</i>. Yet such is the universal infatuation, that mankind prefer an arm 
    of flesh to the power of the invisible but almighty Creator; and even God's 
    own children are too apt to be bitten with this madness.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in 
    robbery.</p></b> Wealth ill gotten is the trust only of fools, for the deadly 
    pest lies in it; it is full of canker, it reeks with God's curse. 
<p align="justify">To tread down the poor and silence their cries for 
    justice, is the delight of many a braggart bully, who in his arrogance 
    imagines that he may defy both God and man; but he is warned in these words, 
    and it will be well for him if he takes the warning, for the Judge of all 
    the earth will surely visit upon men the oppression of the innocent, and the 
    robbery of the poor.</p>
<p align="justify">Both of these may be effected legally in the courts of 
    man, but no twistings of the law, no tricks and evasions will avail with the 
    Court of Heaven. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">If riches increase, set not your heart upon them. </p></b>If 
    they grow in an honest, providential manner, as the result of industry or 
    commercial success, do not make much account of the circumstance; be not 
    unduly elated, <i>do not fix your love upon your money bags</i>. To bow an 
    immortal spirit to the constant contemplation of fading possessions, is 
    extreme folly. <i>Shall those who call the Lord their glory, glory in yellow 
    earth? </i>Shall the image and superscription of Caesar deprive them of 
    communion with him who is the image of the invisible God?<i> As we must not 
    rest in men, so neither must we repose in money. Gain and fame are only so 
    much foam of the sea. All the wealth and honor the whole world can afford 
    would be too slender a thread to bear up the happiness of an immortal soul.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. God has spoken once. </p></b>So <i>immutable </i>is 
    God that he need not speak twice, as though he had changed; so <i>infallible</i>, 
    that one utterance suffices, for he cannot err; so <i>omnipotent</i>, that 
    his solitary word achieves all his designs. 
<i>
<p align="justify">We </p></i>speak often and say nothing; <i>God </i>speaks 
    once and utters eternal verities. All <i>our </i>speaking may yet end in 
    sound; but he speaks, and it is done; he commands, and it stands fast. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Twice have I heard this.</p></b> Our meditative soul should 
    hear the echo of God's voice again and again. <i>What he speaks once in 
    revelation, we should be always hearing</i>. Creation and providence are 
    evermore echoing the voice of God; "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."<i> 
    We have two ears, that we may hear attentively, and the spiritual have inner 
    ears with which they hear indeed</i>. <i>He hears twice in the best sense 
    who hears with his heart as well as his ears. 
</i><b>
<p align="justify">That power belongs unto God.</p></b> He is the source of it, 
    and in him it actually abides. This one voice of God we ought always to 
    hear, so as to be preserved from putting our trust in creatures in whom 
    there can be no power, since all power is in God. What reason for faith is 
    here! It can never be unwise to rest upon the almighty arm. Out of all 
    troubles he can release us, under all burdens sustain us, while men must 
    fail us at the last, and may deceive us even now. May our souls hear the 
    thunder of Jehovah's voice as he claims all power, and henceforth may we 
    wait only upon God!
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. Also unto you, O Lord, belongs mercy. </p></b>This 
    tender attribute sweetens the grand thought of his power. His divine 
    strength will not crush us, but will be used for our good. God is so full of 
    mercy that it belongs to him, as if all the mercy in the universe came from 
    God, and still was claimed by him as his possession. His mercy, like his 
    power, endures forever, and is ever present in him, ready to be revealed.
<b>
<p align="justify">For you render to every man according to his work. </p></b>
    This looks rather like justice than mercy; but if we understand it to mean 
    that God graciously rewards the poor, imperfect works of his people, we see 
    in it a clear display of mercy. 
<p align="justify">May it not also mean that according to the work he allots 
    us, is the strength which he renders to us? He is not a hard master; he does 
    not bid us to make bricks without straw, but he metes out to us strength 
    equal to our day. In either meaning we have power and mercy blended, and 
    have a double reason for waiting only upon God. Man neither helps us nor 
    rewards us; God will do both. In him power and grace are eternally resident; 
    our faith should therefore patiently hope and quietly wait, for we shall 
    surely see the salvation of God. <i>Deo soli gloria. </i>All glory be to God 
    only.</p>
