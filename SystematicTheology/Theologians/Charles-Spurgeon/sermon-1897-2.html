          How is He, Who is beyond all , both above source of Divinity and above
          source of Good? Provided you understand Deity and Goodness, as the
          very Actuality of the Good-making and God-making gift, and the
          inimitable imitation of the super-divine and super-good (gift), by aid
          of which we are deified and made good. For, moreover, if this becomes
          source of the deification and making good of those who are being
          deified and made good, He, -- Who is super-source of every source,
          even of the so-called Deity and Goodness, seeing He is beyond source
          of Divinity and source of Goodness, in so far as He is inimitable, and
          not to be retained -- excels the imitations and retentions, and the
          things which are imitated and those participating.<br />
