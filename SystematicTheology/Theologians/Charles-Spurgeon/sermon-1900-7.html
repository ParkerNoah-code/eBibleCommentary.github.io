          |Should it be according to thy mind; he will recompense it whether
          thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what
          thou knowest.| -- Job 34:33.
        </p>
        <p>
          DEAR FRIENDS, it is never wise to dispute with God. Let a man strive
          with his fellow, but not with his Maker. If we must discuss any point,
          let it be with imperfect beings like ourselves, but not with the
          infallible and infinitely wise God; for, in most of our discussions,
          these questions wilt come back to us, |Should it be according to thy
          mind? Art thou master? Is everyone to be subordinate to thee?|
        </p>
        <p>
          I am going to speak, this evening, to those who have a quarrel with
          God concerning the way of salvation. They are very unwise not to take
          salvation just as God brings it to them; but they do not. They have
          some difficulty or other, so they raise a dispute, and they have been,
          perhaps for years, cavilling at the Saviour whose infinite goodness
          has provided a way of salvation exactly adapted to their needs. I am
          going to use Elihu's words, and apply them to their case.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. To begin at the beginning, here is, first, A QUESTION: |Should it
          be according to thy mind?| You say that you are willing to find mercy,
          and that you are very teachable; but you object to the plan of
          salvation as it is revealed in the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, then, what is it to which you object? Do you object to the very
          basis of the plan, namely, that God will forgive sin through the
          atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ, his Son? I know that some do object
          to this; they cannot bear to hear about atonement by blood, or
          justification by imputed righteousness. Others, who will not say that
          they object to atonement, spirit away the very meaning of it. They
          cannot endure that glorious doctrine of substitution which is such a
          joy to us. Christ standing in the sinner's stead, and the sinner then
          standing in the place of Christ, -- Christ taking the sinner's sin,
          and the sinner wearing Christ's righteousness, -- all this they
          absolutely reject. |No doubt Christ did something for sinners,| they
          say; but they cannot define what he did; and, as for the sin of any
          man being actually put away by Christ being punished in the room and
          place and stead of the ungodly sinner, they will not believe it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, that is God's plan of salvation, and some of us know, in our
          inmost hearts, that we never had peace until we accepted that plan of
          salvation; and that now, if it should be taken away from us, we should
          lose all the joy of existence, and should go back to the despair
          which, at one time, was so heavy upon us that we could sympathize with
          Job when be said, |My soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than
          my life.| We could better afford that the sun should be quenched, that
          the moon should be darkened, that all springs should be dried, that
          the very air itself should disappear, -- we could better afford to
          die, and rot in our graves, than that we should lose our Saviour, and
          his atoning blood, and justifying righteousness. Whatever you, Mr.
          Objector, may say about it, we say to you, |Should it be according to
          thy mind?| Would you have Christ to die, and yet not really secure
          salvation by his death? Could you invent a better plan, or even one
          half as good, --
        </p>
        <p>|So just to God, so safe for man,| --</p>
        <p>
          so consolatory to a wounded conscience, so constraining to gratitude
          when that conscience has been pacified? Would you, could you, propose
          anything one thousandth part as good as God's plan of salvation? Even
          if you could, |should it be according to thy mind?| Who are you, a
          guilty sinner, to despise the Saviour's blood? If you had your
          deserts, you would years ago have been in the lowest pit of hell; will
          you set aside the cross of Christ, and seek to put something else in
          the place of the crucified Redeemer?
        </p>
        <p>
          But, possibly, you do not object to the doctrine of substitution, but
          your objection is to the way of salvation by faith. |I don't like that
          doctrine of justification by faith,| says one, |for I am sure that,
          when it is preached, people will begin to think that there is no
          virtue in good works, and that they may live as they like.| I have
          often heard such a remark as yours, my friend, but experience is dead
          against you. Whenever justification by faith has been uppermost in the
          preaching, the morals of the people have been purest, and their
          spirituality has been brightest. But whenever the preachers have
          extolled the works and ceremonies of the law, or the Arminianism which
          brings in something of trust in works, or human power, it is most
          certain that there has been a declension in point of morals, while
          religion itself has seemed almost ready to expire. You may go to those
          who preach up salvation by works to hear them talk, but you had better
          not go to see how they live, whereas those who preach justification by
          faith can boldly point to the multitudes who have accepted this truth,
          and whose godly lives prove the sanctifying power of the doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if you object to this doctrine, how would you like to have it
          altered? |Oh, well! I would like to have some good feelings put in
          with faith.| And how, then, would any man be saved? Can he command his
          own feelings? Those feelings come naturally enough after faith; but,
          if they be demanded without faith, how will they ever be presented to
          God? Besides, feelings would claim some credit if they were thus
          joined with faith. A man would be able to boast that he had felt his
          way to heaven, and he would have the same self-congratulatory spirit
          which we see in those who trust in works and ceremonies; and thus
          Christ would be robbed of his glory as the sinner's Saviour. Man would
          put his dirty hand upon the crown, and place it upon his own head; but
          that must never be the case. You shall be saved if you trust the
          Saviour; but if you do not like that way of salvation, you never can
          be saved. Why should the plan of salvation be changed for you? Is God
          to be tied down to act only as you please? Is he to alter his gospel
          to suit the fancies of rebellious men? That must not be. There is no
          mistake about this matter: |He that believeth not the Son shall not
          see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him;| and our Lord himself
          said, |He that believeth not shall be damned.| That is the only
          message for him if he continues in his unbelief; and it shall not be
          altered to suit the mind of any man that lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Oh, but!| say some, |we object to the requirements of the gospel,
          especially to that verse where Christ says, 'Ye must be born again.'
          Where is the need of that? We were christened when we were children;
          We were confirmed as we grew older; we have taken the sacrament; but
          we do not agree with that hard saying, 'Ye must be born again.'| They
          will not walk with Christ if he insists upon that condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, he requires the giving up of all known sin, the hating of
          all sin, and the objector says, |But may I not retain my one darling
          sin? May I not keep my pet evil? I will give up all else, but that one
          I must have.| And when men are told that, wherever Christ comes, he
          makes a radical change, he casts out Satan and all his imps, drives
          them out by main force, and takes complete possession of the soul, --
          they bar the door of their heart against the Saviour, for they do not
          want such strong measures as his in their case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, sirs, as you say that Christ's requirements are not according to
          your mind, what would you like them to be? Do you wish to be allowed
          to continue taking what you call your little drop, which is powerful
          enough to make you reel across the street? Then there is somebody over
          yonder who would like to keep his adulteries, and another who would
          like to keep his petty thefts, and another who would like to keep on
          with his swearing, and another who would like to retain his
          covetousness, so that he could still grind the poor to powder, and
          make money by crushing them, What sin is there, in the whole world,
          that would be put to death if men were left to pick and choose the
          Agag which each one wished to save? No; Christ came to save his people
          from their sins, -- not in them; and it is essential to salvation that
          sin should be repented of, and, being repented of, should be
          renounced, and that, by the help of God, we should lead a new life,
          under a new Master, serving from a new motive, because the grace of
          God has renewed our spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Should it be according to thy mind?| No, certainly not; for, putting
          all reasons into one, it is not the slightest use for you to make any
          objection to the gospel, for you wilt be lost if you do not accept it
          just as it is revealed in the Scriptures. Christ will never alter the
          gospel one jot or tittle not the cross of a |t| or the dot of an |i|
          -- to please the biggest man that lives. |Oh! but, really, I am a man
          of education; am I to be saved in the same way as the man who does not
          know A from B?| Precisely; there is no other way of salvation for you.
          There is not one gate for Doctors of Divinity and another for the poor
          and ignorant. |But I am a person of good character, a matronly woman;
          am I to be saved just in the same way as a Magdalene?| Precisely the
          same; there Is no other Saviour for you than the one in whom Mary
          Magdalene delighted and trusted. |But, sir, you do not surely mean to
          say that all these street Arabs are to go to heaven in the same way as
          a man who has kept shop, and been respectable, all his life!| Yes, I
          do; all must go in exactly the same road. Queens and chimney-sweeps
          must enter heaven by the same gate, or not enter at all. There is but
          one name given among men whereby we must be saved; there is no other
          Saviour but Christ Jesus the Lord; he suits every class of persons,
          big sinners and little ones, if there are any little sinners anywhere.
          All must come to Christ, and at his feet confess their sin, for God's
          plan cannot be altered for anyone. My dear sir, we are not going to
          have any enlargement, or rather, any mystification, of the plan of
          salvation to suit your profound mind. There will be no golden handles
          put to the doors of heaven to suit you, my lord, with all your wealth
          and pride. Nay, nay, nay; come to Christ, all ye that labour and are
          heavy laden, and he will give you rest; but there is no other way of
          obtaining rest of heart and conscience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have thus tried to mention a few of the objections which men make to
          God's plan of salvation. Now let me ask two or three questions. First,
          should not God have his way? Is it not intolerable that you and I
          should raise objections at all when the mercy of God, if it ever comes
          to us, is a pure gift of charity? God may well say to us, |Shall I not
          do as I will with mine own?| There is no man living who has any
          absolute right to receive anything from God except destruction. That
          terrible doom we have all merited, but nothing beyond that. If we were
          shut up in prison, and kept upon dry bread, so long as we were out of
          hell, we should still be under obligation to God. If the Lord should
          choose to show mercy to only one man in the world, he has a perfect
          right to do so; if he chooses to give it to a few, or if he chooses to
          give it to all, he has the right to do so. He is absolutely sovereign,
          and these are the words that he would have every one of us to hear and
          to heed: |I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have
          compassion on whom I will have compassion.| The crown rights of the
          King of kings must never be assailed; for us beggars to turn choosers,
          and to dictate to God what he shall give to us; -- for us condemned
          criminals to begin to make bargains with God as to how he shall
          preserve our lives, if he chooses to do so, -- oh, this will never do!
          You know, dear friends, that when we give even a triffing charity, we
          like to do it in our own way. I remember that, one Christmas-time, a
          certain gentleman had given away a quantity of meat to many poor
          people; he had been so generous that he had given away all he had. The
          next morning, a woman came to him, bringing back the piece of meat
          which she had received, which was meant for boiling, and she said she
          wanted to have a piece for roasting. There was none left for changing,
          so she had to take what had been given to her, or go without any at
          all. You are quite sure that, the next year, that woman's name was put
          down among the first to have a Christmas gift, are you not! On the
          contrary, the gentleman said, |She will not be troubled, next year,
          either with a boiling piece or a roasting piece from me; I will take
          good care of that.| I think it was quite natural that he should say
          so, for our common proverb regards it as ingratitude When we |look a
          gift horse in the mouth.| When anything comes to us entirely as a
          gift, it is not for us to cavil at it, but to accept it; and this is
          specially true of God's great gift of salvation. O Lord, if thou wilt
          but save me, save me anyhow! If I may be delivered from this accursed
          sin of mine, and made pure and holy, do it, Lord, after thine own
          gracious fashion! It is not for me to suggest any plan to thee, but to
          leave myself entirely in thy hands, and to let it be according to thy
          mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, is not God's way the best? The mind of God is so infinitely
          great, and good, and wise, that it cannot be supposed that, even if he
          left the plan of salvation to our option, we could choose anything
          half as good as what he decrees and appoints. Should he, for a single
          moment, hold his sovereignty in abeyance, and allow us to be kings and
          princes on our own account, what follies we should perpetrate! We
          should choose a way of salvation that would not honour God, nor
          destroy evil, nor even be good for our own selves. Some people would
          like a heaven into which they could enter without being born again;
          but what kind of heaven would that be! Some would like to have joy and
          peace without believing in Christ. Some would like to have eternal
          felicity, and yet indulge their lusts. This would be an evil of the
          most awful kind. It is better that sin should bring to man infinite
          sorrow than that it should be linked with eternal enjoyment. The
          mischief of it is that it does get linked with enjoyment for a while
          by foolish men, who forget what must come afterwards; but God has
          never joined these two things together, it is only wicked men who have
          pretended to celebrate this unholy marriage. God proclaims a perpetual
          separation between sin and happiness, and it is well that it should be
          so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, to conclude this first part of our subject, suppose the plan of
          salvation should be according to any human mind, whose mind is to
          decide what it shall be? Yours? Nay, mine. And another says, |No,
          mine.| Our proverb rightly says, |Many men, many minds;| and if we
          were to have salvation arranged according to the mind of each one of
          us, there would be a pretty quarrel before we left this place. You
          say, friend, that it is to be according to your mind; but why not
          according to your neighbour's mind? If man's mind were to decide it,
          what should we have? Why, you would all contradict each other, and
          there would be no plan of salvation at all it God did not settle it
          once for all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, besides, should it be according to your mind to-day? |Yes,| you
          say, |I have made up my mind.| But you will take your mind to pieces
          to-morrow, -- what little there is of it, -- and then you will put it
          together again the next day, and say, |I have made up my mind; I am a
          man of mind, you know.| Ah, yes! we know you, sir. There is a certain
          tribe of people about, nowadays, who call themselves |men of culture,|
          and they sneer at everybody who does not go in for that kind of
          boasting. If they were really men of mind, they would never talk like
          that, for the man who has the most culture generally has enough to be
          a little modest, and not to brag about what he is. Well, then, if
          salvation is to be according to man's mind, whose mind is to decide
          it, and on what day, and at what hour of the day is the verdict of
          that man's mind to be taken? It is vacillating, changing like the
          moon, never twice in the same mood on the same day; so salvation
          cannot be according to our mind, for it would be chaos, it would be
          destruction, if that were the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, secondly, here is A WARNING: |He will recompense it, whether
          thou refuse, or whether thou choose.|
        </p>
        <p>
          By this I understand that, whatever our will may be, God will carry
          out his own purpose. As surely as God is God, he will never be
          defeated in anything. He who is omniscient, and therefore sees the end
          from the beginning, is also omnipotent, and therefore can work his own
          will exactly as he chooses, -- he will never be baffled by the will of
          men. I believe in the free agency of man as much as anyone who lives;
          but I equally believe in the eternal purpose of God. If you ask, |How
          do you reconcile those beliefs?| I answer, -- They have never been at
          variance yet, so there is no need to attempt to reconcile them. They
          are like two parallel lines, which will run side by side for ever; --
          man responsible because he does what he wills, and God infinitely
          glorious, achieving his own purposes, not only in the world of dead,
          inert matter, but also through those who are free agents; without
          changing them in the least degree, leaving them just as free as ever
          they were, he yet, in every jot and tittle, performs the eternal
          purpose of his will.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would also remind you that, though you cavil at God's way of
          salvation, God will punish sin just the same. There is many a man who
          has said, |I will never believe that God will send men to hell;| but
          he has himself gone there, and then he has changed his mind in a very
          remarkable and terrible fashion when it is too late. There are many
          who say, |It should be this, or it should not be that;| but they do
          not ask, |What saith the Scripture?| Yet that is the all-important
          point; for, whatever you may say as to what it should be or should not
          be, makes no difference to God. He will take less notice of you and
          your opinion than you do of a gnat or a midge that flies about you on
          a summer's evening. He is so infinitely great and good that any
          opposition you and I may think that we can raise against him shall be
          less than nothing, and vanity. Shall tow contend with fire, or the war
          with the flame? Shall nothing oppose itself to omnipotence? Shall the
          creature of a day, that is and is not, attempt to wrestle with the
          Eternal? No, this cannot be; therefore, God will have his way, and he
          will punish sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, further, my friends, though you may object to God's way of
          salvation, others will be saved by it. Christ did not die in vain. He
          will rejoice in every one whom he purchased with his blood. He will
          not lose one of the jewels that are to deck his crown for ever. You
          may strive against his kingdom, but that kingdom will come when he
          pleases. The King eternal, immortal, invisible, shall surely reign for
          ever and ever; and if your voice is not heard in the great Hallelujah
          chorus of heaven, yet not one of its notes will be missing. Christ
          shall be glorified to the highest possible degree, whosoever may
          oppose him. It is well that those who object to God's plan of
          salvation should know these facts. That is how Christ treated
          objectors when he was upon the earth. When they murmured at what he
          told them, he did not tone down the unpalatable truth; he did not say
          to them, |You are robbing me of my honour and glory, and I shall never
          prosper; | but he said, |No man can come to me, except the Father,
          which hath sent me draw him.| On another occasion, he said, |Ye
          believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.| He
          did not humble himself to them, but again proclaimed his own truth in
          all its majesty and sublimity, that they might bow before him and his
          message.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just once more, upon this point, let me say that God will certainly
          magnify his own name, whoever may oppose him: |Whether thou refuse, or
          whether thou choose,| shall make no difference to him. His grace comes
          like the dew, which tarries not for man, neither waits for the sons of
          men. Oftentimes, he is found of them that seek him not; and to those
          who were not his people, he says, |Ye are my people;| thus magnifying
          his own amazing grace. Whoever may stand out against him, he shall
          lack none of his honour and glory, world without end.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. This brings us to the third part of our subject, on which I
          desire to say exactly what Elihu said: |and not I.| We cannot be
          absolutely sure what these three words mean; but, if they mean what I
          think they do, they teach us a lesson, Which I have called A PROTEST.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever you find anyone opposing God, say to yourself, |and not I.|
          When there is any wrong thing being done, and it comes under your
          notice, say, |and not I.| Take care that you go not with a multitude
          to do evil; do not take upon your tongue just what others may be
          saying, but bear your individual protest against the evil; even if you
          stand alone, say, |and not I.|
        </p>
        <p>
          What Elihu did mean, I think, was this. Whoever opposes God should
          know that he is not dealing with a man like himself. If you hear a
          preacher make a statement, and you feel, |That is not the Word of the
          Lord,| pray God to forgive him for his sin in making it; but if he
          speaks with the sound of his Master's feet behind him and what he says
          is the Word of God, then do not trifle with it. If it be clearly a
          revealed truth, it may grate against your feelings, and set your teeth
          on edge; but what of that? You had better get your teeth and your
          feelings put right, for the truth of God cannot be altered in order to
          please you. Someone says, |I cannot believe that statement, because it
          seems too shocking.| That is just why I do believe it, for it does me
          good by shocking me; and if it is in God's Word, I am bound to accept
          it. |Oh!| you say, |but something within me revolts against it.| It is
          only natural it should do so, for |the heart is deceitful above all
          things, and desperately wicked;| and it naturally cries out against
          the thing that is most surely true. The supreme majesty of God's Word
          is that before which we have to bow, and not the insignificant
          usurpers of our inward feelings, fancies, and whims. |Let God be true,
          and every man a liar.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Elihu also means, I think, |I will not he responsible for the man who
          refuses God's Word. I will not stand in his place, or take the blame
          which is due to him. He shall be recompensed, and not I, for I have
          spoken the truth. I will not bear the responsibility of it. If men
          choose to refuse it, they must take the consequences; to the Lord
          alone they must stand or fall.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And, once more, Elihu means, |If you refuse God's Word, it is not I. I
          will not share in your rebellion against him.| Ah! my dear hearers,
          there are some of you who think yourselves very intelligent, and wise,
          and thoughtful, and you imagine that you know a great deal more than I
          do, and therefore you refuse to receive God's Word. Well, if you do
          so, I will not; I am determined about this matter, and I say, with
          Joshua, |As for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah.| And, mark
          you, by |Jehovah| I mean the old Testament God. I have never seen him
          superseded in his own Word, though some men profess that it is so.
          According to them, the God of the Hebrews was not the God of our Lord
          Jesus Christ, though Jesus never said so, but quite the reverse. The
          God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, is he whom we worship this
          day; and his character, as it is written out in full in the Old and
          New Testament, is that which we admire and delight in. Others may have
          new gods, newly come up, which our fathers knew not; but not I. He who
          made the heavens and the earth, he who led forth his people out of
          Egypt, and divided the sea, even the Red Sea, he whose mercy endureth
          for ever, the God who shines forth all along as the God of a
          covenanted people to whom he did reveal himself, |this God is our God
          for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.| Learned men
          may dispute as much as they like about him, but we bow humbly at his
          feet. We question nothing that he does; we believe it to be right even
          when we do not understand it; and it is our hope that others will do
          the same; but if they will not, it will not affect our own decision.
        </p>
        <p>IV. Our last head is, A CHALLENGE AND AN INVITATION.</p>
        <p>
          If there are any who refuse the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, for
          any reason known only to themselves, we venture to ask them to say
          what it is: |Therefore speak what thou knowest.| It was not in Elihu's
          mind to tell Job to be silent, and never open his mouth again. Speech
          is the glory of man, and freedom of speech, as far as concerns his
          fellow-creatures, is the right of every man. It is far better that,
          when there is a difficulty or an objection, it should be fairly
          stated, than that it should lie smothered up within the soul to breed
          untold mischief. Therefore, if thou hast an objection to God's Word,
          write it out, and look at it. Or, if thou carest not to do that, state
          it, if not to thy friend, -- if thou preferest privacy, -- state it to
          thyself; only bring it out, and let it be known. But, at the same
          time, when thou art speaking, | speak what thou knowest.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, what dost thou really know of God? Little enough do the most of
          us know; but, still, I think we know enough to know that he is not the
          god of modern times, whom some preach. One single night of frost will
          destroy millions upon millions of creatures that were happy and
          enjoyed life; and this is done by that God of whom we are often
          assured that he cannot possibly punish sin, or put men to pain. But he
          does it. Hear the cry of the poor seamen, when the storm tosses the
          great barque, and drives it on the rock. See how everywhere the Lord
          is a great God and terrible. Even though he condescends to be a Father
          to those of us who trust in Jesus Christ, his Son, and is gentle as a
          nurse to us, yet is he the God of thunder and of fire, the great and
          almighty God, the King who will not be questioned by his subjects, and
          who will not alter his arrangements to please their fancies.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is well for us to speak of God as we have found him. He has dealt
          kindly and graciously with us: |he hath not dealt with us after our
          sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities; |else had we been
          cast away for ever. We long that others may be able to speak of God in
          the same way; not saying what they would have him to be, but what he
          has revealed himself to be, in nature, and in providence, and
          especially in grace. Let us all come humbly to his feet. He bids us
          look to his dear Son, and so find peace and salvation. If we will not
          do so, there is nothing for us but to be driven from his presence, and
          from the glory of his power, world without end. Will we dare to defy
          him? Have we the impiety so to do? O God, humble us! Beneath the
          terror of thy majesty, and the glory of thy righteousness, and the
          supreme splendour of thy love, bow us down, to accept thy grace, and
          to become thine for ever and ever! God grant that it may be so, for
          our Lord Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.<br />
