          "For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face." -- 1
          Corinthians 13:12.
        </p>
        <p>
          IN THIS CHAPTER the apostle Paul has spoken in the highest terms of
          charity or love. He accounts it to be a grace far more excellent than
          any of the spiritual gifts of which he had just before been speaking.
          It is easy to see that there were good reasons for the preference he
          gave to it. Those gifts you will observe, were distributed among godly
          men, to every man his several portion, so that what one had another
          might have lacked; but this grace belongs to all who have passed from
          death unto life. The proof that they are disciples of Christ is found
          in their love to him and to the brethren. Those gifts, again, were
          meant to fit them for service, that each member of the body should be
          profitable to the other members of the body; but this grace is of
          personal account: it is a light in the heart and a star on the breast
          of every one who possesses it. Those gifts, moreover, were of
          temporary use: their value was limited to the sphere in which they
          were exercised; but this grace thrives at all times and in all places,
          and it is no less essential to our eternal future state than it is to
          our present welfare. By all means covet the best gifts, my dear
          brother, as an artist would wish to be deft with all his limbs and
          quick with all his senses; but above all, cherish love, as that same
          artist would cultivate the pure taste which lives and breathes within
          him -- the secret spring of all his motions, the faculty that prompts
          his skill. Learn to esteem this sacred instinct of love beyond all the
          choicest endowments. However poor you may be in talents, let the love
          of Christ dwell in you richly. Such an exhortation as this is the more
          needful, because love has a powerful rival. Paul may have noticed that
          in the academies of Greece, as indeed in all our modern schools,
          knowledge was wont to take all the prizes. Who can tell how much of
          Dr. Arnold's success, as a schoolmaster, was due to the honor in which
          he held a good boy in preference to a clever boy? Most certainly Paul
          could discern in the church many jealousies to which the superior
          abilities of those who could speak foreign tongues, and those who
          could prophecy or preach well, gave rise. So, then, while he extols
          the grace of love, he seems rather to disparage knowledge; at least,
          he uses an illustration which tends to show that the kind of knowledge
          we pride ourselves in, is not the most reliable thing in the world.
          Paul remembered that he was once a child. A very good thing for any of
          us to bear in mind. If we forget it, our sympathies are soon dried up,
          our temper is apt to get churlish, our opinions may be rather
          overbearing, and our selfishness very repulsive. The foremost man of
          his day in the Christian church, and exerting the widest influence
          among the converts to Christ, Paul thought of the little while ago
          when he was a young child, and he thought of it very opportunely too.
          Though he might have hinted at the attainments he had made or the high
          office he held, and laid claim to some degree of respect, he rather
          looks back at his humble beginnings. If there is wisdom in his
          reflection, there is to my mind a vein of pleasantry in his manner of
          expressing it. "When I was a child I spake as a child, I understood as
          a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away
          childish things." Thus he compares two stages of his natural life, and
          it serves him for a parable. In spiritual knowledge he felt himself to
          be then in his infancy. His maturity, his thorough manhood, lay before
          him in prospect. He could easily imagine a future in which he should
          look back on his present self as a mere tyro, groping his way amidst
          the shadows of his own fancy. "For now," he says, "we see through a
          glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then
          shall I know even as also I am known." Here he employs one or two
          fresh figures. "Through a glass!" What kind of a glass he alluded to,
          we may not be able exactly to determine. Well; we will leave that
          question for the critics to disagree about. It is enough for us that
          the meaning is obvious. There is all the difference between viewing an
          object through an obscure medium, and closely inspecting it with the
          naked eye. We must have the power of vision in either case, but in the
          latter case we can use it to more advantage. "Now we see through a
          glass, darkly." Darkly -- in a riddle! So weak are our perceptions of
          mind, that plain truths often puzzle us. The words that teach us are
          pictures which need explanation. The thoughts that stir us are visions
          which coat in our brains and want rectifying. Oh, for clearer vision!
          Oh, for more perfect knowledge! Mark you, brethren, it is a matter of
          congratulation that we do see; though we have much cause for
          diffidence, because we do but "see through a glass, darkly." Thank God
          we do know; but let it cheek our conceit, We know only in part.
          Beloved, the objects we look at are distant, and we are near-sighted.
          The revelation of God is ample and profound, but our understanding is
          weak and shallow.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some things which we count very precious now, which will
          soon be of no value to us whatever. There are some things that we know
          or think we know, and we pride ourselves a good deal upon our
          knowledge; but when we shall become men we shall set no more value
          upon that knowledge than a child does upon his toys when he grows up
          to be a man. Our spiritual manhood in heaven will discard many things
          which we now count precious, as a full grown man discards the
          treasures of his childhood. And there are many things that we have
          been accustomed to see that, after this transient life has passed, we
          shall see no more. Though we delighted in them, and they pleased our
          eyes while sojourning on earth, they will pass away as a dream when
          one awaketh; we shall never see them again, and never want to see
          them; for our eyes in clearer light, anointed with eye-salve, shall
          see brighter visions, and we shall never regret what we have lost, in
          the presence of fairer scenes we shall have found. Other things there
          are that we know now and shall never forget; we shall know them for
          ever, only in a higher degree, because no longer with a partial
          knowledge; and there are some things that we see now that we shall see
          in eternity, only we shall see them there in a clearer light.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we shall speak upon some things that we do see now, which we are to
          see more fully and more distinctly hereafter; then enquire how it is
          we shall see them more clearly; and finish up by considering what this
          fact teaches us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Among the things that we see now, as many of us as have had our
          eyes enlightened by the Holy Spirit, is OURSELVES.
        </p>
        <p>
          To see ourselves is one of the first steps in true religion. The mass
          of men have never seen themselves. They have seen the flattering image
          of themselves, and they fancy that to be their own facsimile, but it
          is not. You and I have been taught of God's Holy Spirit to see our
          ruin in the fall; we have bemoaned ourselves on account of that fall;
          we have been made conscious of our own natural depravity; we have been
          ground to the very dust by the discovery; we have been shown our
          actual sinfulness and how we have transgressed against the Most High.
          We have repented for this, and have fled for refuge to the hope set
          before us in the gospel. Day by day we see a little more of ourselves
          -- nothing very pleasing, I grant you -- but something very
          profitable, for it is a great thing for us to know our emptiness. It
          is a step towards receiving his fullness. It is something to discover
          our weakness; it is a step essential towards our participation of
          divine strength. I suppose the longer we live the more we shall see
          ourselves; and we shall probably come to this conclusion: "Vanity of
          vanities; all is vanity:" and cry out with Job, "I am vile." The more
          we shall discover of ourselves, the more we shall be sick of
          ourselves. But in heaven, I doubt not, we shall find out that we never
          saw even ourselves in the clearest light, but only as "through a
          glass, darkly," only as an unriddled thing, as a deep enigma; for we
          shall understand more about ourselves in heaven than we do now. There
          we shall see, as we have not yet seen, how desperate a mischief was
          the Fall, into what a horrible pit we fell, and how fast we were stuck
          in the miry clay. There shall we see the blackness of sin as we have
          never seen it here, and understand its hell desert as we could not
          till we shall look down from yonder starry height whither infinite
          mercy shall bring us. When we shall be singing, "Worthy is the Lamb
          that was slain," we shall look at the robes that we have washed in his
          blood, and see how white they are. We shall better understand then
          than now how much we needed washing -- how crimson were the stains and
          how precious was that blood that effaced those scarlet spots. There,
          too, shall we know ourselves on the bright side better than we do now.
          We know to-day that we are saved, and there is therefore now no
          condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus; but that robe of
          righteousness which covers us now, as it shall cover us then, will be
          better seen by us, and we shall discern how lustrous it is, with its
          needlework and wrought gold -- how much better than the pearls and
          gems that have decked the robes of monarchs are the blood and
          righteousness of Jehovah Jesus, who has given himself for us. Here we
          know that we are adopted. We feel the spirit of sonship; "we cry,
          Abba, Father;" but there we shall know better what it is to be the
          sons of God, for here it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but
          when we shall be there, and when Christ shall appear, we shall be like
          him, for we shall see him as he is, and then we shall understand to
          the full what sonship means. So, too, I know to-day that I am a
          joint-heir with Christ, but I have a very poor idea of what it is I am
          heir to; but there shall I see the estates that belong to me; not only
          see them, but actually enjoy them. A part shall every Christian have
          in the inheritance undefiled and that fadeth not away, that is
          reserved in heaven for him, because he is in Christ Jesus; one with
          Christ -- by eternal union one. But I am afraid that is very much more
          a riddle to us than a matter of understanding. We see it as an enigma
          now, but there our oneness with Christ will be as conspicuous to us
          and as plain as the letters of the alphabet. There shall we know what
          it is to be a member of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones;
          there shall I understand the mystical marriage bond that knits the
          believer's soul to Christ; there shall I see how, as the branch
          springs from the stem, my soul stands in union, vital union, with her
          blessed Lord Jesus Christ. Thus, one thing that we see now which we
          shall see in a much clearer light hereafter, is "ourselves."
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, too, we see the CHURCH, but WE SHALL SEE THE CHURCH MUCH MORE
          CLEARLY BY-AND-BY.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know there is a church of God. We know that the Lord has a people
          whom he hath chosen from before the foundation of the world: we
          believe that these are scattered up and down throughout our land, and
          many other lands. There are many of them we do not know, many that we
          should not particularly like, I daresay if we did know them, on
          account of their outward characteristics; persons of very strange
          views, and very odd habits perhaps; and yet, for all that, the people
          of the living God; Now, we know this church, we know its glory, moved
          with one life, quickened with one Spirit, redeemed with one blood, we
          believe in this church, and we feel attachment to it for the sake of
          Jesus Christ, who has married the church as the Bride. But, oh! when
          we shall get to heaven, how much more we shall know of the church, and
          how we shall see her face to face, and not "through a glass, darkly."
          There we shall know something, more of the numbers of the chosen than
          we do now, it may be to our intense surprise. There we shall find some
          amongst the company of God's elect, whom we in our bitterness of
          spirit had condemned, and there we shall miss some who, in our
          charity, we have conceived to be perfectly secure. We shall know
          better then who are the Lord's and who are not than we ever can know
          here. Here all our processes of discernment fail us. Judas comes in
          with the apostles, and Demas takes his part among the saints, but
          there we shall know the righteous, for we shall see them; there will
          be one flock and one Shepherd, and he that on the throne doth reign
          for evermore shall be glorified. We shall understand then, what the
          history of the church has been in all the past, and why it has become
          so strange a history of conflict and conquest. Probably, we shall know
          more of the history of the church in the future. From that higher
          elevation and brighter atmosphere we shall understand better what are
          the Lord's designs concerning his people in the latter day; and what
          glory shall redound to his own name from his redeemed ones, when he
          shall have gathered together all that are called and chosen and
          faithful from among the sons of men. This is one of the joys we are
          looking for, that we shall come to the general assembly and church of
          the firstborn whose names are written in heaven; and have fellowship
          with those who have fellowship with God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly. Is it not possible, nay, is it not certain, that in the next
          state WE SHALL KNOW MORE OF THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD THAN WE DO NOW?
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we see the providence of God, but it is in a glass, darkly. The
          apostle says "through" a glass. There was glass in the apostles' days,
          not a substance such as our windows are now made of, but thick dull
          coloured glass, not much more transparent than that which is used in
          the manufacture of common bottles, so that looking through a piece of
          that glass you would not see much. That is like what we now see of
          divine providence. We believe all things work together for good to
          them that love God; we have seen how they work together for good in
          some cases, and experimentally proved it to be so. But still it is
          rather a matter of faith than a matter of sight with us. We cannot
          tell how "every dark and bending line meets in the center of his
          love." We do not yet perceive how he will make those dark
          dispensations of trials and afflictions that come upon his people
          really to subserve his glory and their lasting happiness; but up there
          we shall see providence, as it were, face to face; and I suppose it
          will be amongst our greatest surprises, the discovery of how the Lord
          dealt with us. "Why," we shall some of us say, "we prayed against
          those very circumstances which were the best that, could have been
          appointed for us." "Ah!" another will say, "I have fretted and
          troubled myself over what was, after all, the richest mercy the Lord
          ever sent." Sometimes I have known persons refuse a letter at the
          door, and it has happened, in some cases, that there has been
          something very valuable in it, and the postman has said, afterwards,
          "You did not know the contents, or else you would not have refused
          it." And often God has sent us, in the black envelope of trial, such a
          precious mass of mercy, that if we had known what was in it, we should
          have taken it in, and been glad to pay for it -- glad to give it house
          room, to entertain it; but because it looked black we were prone to
          shut our door against it. Now, up there we shall know not only more of
          ourselves, but perceive the reasons of many of God's dealings with us
          on a larger scale; and we shall there perhaps discover that wars that
          devasted nations, and pestilences that fill graves, and earthquakes
          that make cities tremble, are, after all, necessary cogs in the great
          wheel of the divine machinery; and he who sits upon the throne at this
          moment, and rules supremely every creature that is either in heaven,
          or earth, or hell, will there make it manifest to us that his
          government was right. It is good to think in these times when ever;
          thing seems loosening, that "the government shall be upon his
          shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The
          mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace." It must come
          out right in the long run; it must be well; every part and portion
          must work together with a unity of design to promote God's glory and
          the saint's good. We shall see it there! and we shall lift up our song
          with new zest and joy, as fresh displays of the wisdom and goodness of
          God, whose ways are past finding out, are unfolded to our admiring
          view.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly. It is surely no straining of the text to say, that, though
          here we know something of THE DOCTRINES OF THE GOSPEL, AND THE
          MYSTERIES OF THE FAITH, by-and-by, in a few months or years at the
          longest, we shall know a great deal more than we do now. There are
          some grand doctrines, brethren and sisters, we dearly love, but though
          we love them, our understanding is too feeble to grasp them fully. We
          account them to be mysteries; we reverently acknowledge them, yet we
          dare not attempt to explain them. They are matters of faith to us. It
          may be that in heaven there shall be counsels of eternal wisdom into
          which no saints or angels can peer. It is the glory of God to conceal
          a matter. Surely, no creature will ever be able, even when exalted to
          heaven, to comprehend all the thoughts of the Creator. We shall never
          be omniscient -- we cannot be. God alone knoweth everything, and
          understandeth everything. But how much more of authentic truth shall
          we discern when the mists and shadows have dissolved; and how much
          more shall we understand when raised to that higher sphere and endowed
          with brighter faculties, none of us can tell. Probably, things that
          puzzle us here will be as plain as possible there. We shall perhaps
          smile at our own ignorance. I have fancied sometimes that the
          elucidations of learned doctors of divinity, if they could be
          submitted to the very least in the kingdom of heaven, would only cause
          them to smile at the learned ignorance of the sons of earth. Oh! how
          little we do know, but how much we shall know! I am sure we shall
          know, for it is written, "Then shall I know even as also I have
          known." We now see things in a mist -- "men as trees, walking" -- a
          doctrine here, and a doctrine there. And we are often at a loss to
          conjecture how one part harmonizes with another part of the same
          system, or to make out how all these doctrines are consistent. This
          knot cannot be untied, that gnarl cannot be unravelled, but --
        </p>
        <p>"Then shall I see, and hear and know</p>
        <p>All I desired or wish'd below;</p>
        <p>And every power find sweet employ</p>
        <p>In that eternal world of joy."</p>
        <p>
          But, my dear brethren and sisters, having kept you thus far in the
          outer courts, I would fain lead you into the temple; or, to change the
          figure, if in the beginning I have set forth good wine, certainly I am
          not going to bring out that which is worse; rather would I have you
          say, as the ruler of the feast did to the bridegroom, "thou has kept
          the good wine until now." HERE WE SEE JESUS CHRIST, BUT WE DO NOT SEE
          HIM AS WE SHALL SEE HIM SOON. We have seen him by faith in such a way,
          that we have beheld our burdens laid on him, and our iniquities
          carried by him into the wilderness, where, if they be sought for, they
          shall not be found. We have seen enough of Jesus to know that "he is
          altogether lovely;" we can say of him, he "is all my salvation, and
          all my desire." Sometimes, when he throws up the lattice, and shows
          himself through those windows of agate and gates of carbuncle, in the
          ordinances of his house, at the Lord's Supper especially, the King's
          beauty has entranced us even to our heart's ravishment; yet all we
          have ever seen is somewhat like the report which the Queen of Sheba
          had of Solomon's wisdom. When we once get to the court of the Great
          King we shall declare that the half has not been told us. We shall
          say, "mine eyes shall behold, and not another." Brethren, is not this
          the very cream of heaven? There have been many suggestions of what we
          shall do in heaven, and what we shall enjoy, but they all seem to me
          to be wide of the mark compared with this one, that we shall be with
          Jesus, be like him, and shall behold his glory. Oh, to see the feet
          that were nailed, and to touch the hand that was pierced, and to look
          upon the head that wore the thorns, and to bow before him who is
          ineffable love, unspeakable condescension, infinite tenderness! Oh, to
          bow before him, and to kiss that blessed face! Jesu, what better do we
          want than to see thee by shine own light -- to see thee, and speak
          with thee, as when a man speaketh with his friend? It is pleasant to
          talk about this, but what will it be there when the pearl gates open?
          The streets of gold will have small attraction to us, and the harps of
          angels will but slightly enchant us, compared with the King in the
          midst of the throne. He it is who shall rivet our gaze, absorb our
          thoughts, enchain our affection, and move all our sacred passions to
          their highest pitch of celestial ardor. We shall see Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again (and here we come into the deep things), beyond a doubt WE
          SHALL ALSO SEE GOD. It is written that the pure in heart shall see
          God. God is seen now in his works and in his word. Little indeed could
          these eyes bear of the beatific vision, yet we have reason to expect
          that, as far as creatures can bear the sight of the infinite Creator,
          we shall be permitted to see God. We read that Aaron and certain
          chosen ones saw the throne of God, and the brightness as it were of
          sapphire stone -- light, pure as jasper. In heaven it is the presence
          of God that is the light thereof. God's more immediately dwelling in
          the midst of the new Jerusalem is its peerless glory and peculiar
          bliss. We shall then understand more of God than we do now; we shall
          come nearer to him, be more familiar with him, be more filled with
          him. The love of God shall be shed abroad in our hearts; we shall know
          our Father as we yet know him not; We shall know the Son to a fuller
          degree than he has yet revealed himself to us, and we shall know the
          Holy Spirit in his personal love and tenderness towards us, beyond all
          those influences and operations which have soothed us in our sorrows
          and guided us in our perplexities here below. I leave your thoughts
          and your desires to follow the teaching of the Spirit. As for me, I
          cower before the thought while I revel in it. I, who have strained my
          eyes while gazing at nature, where the things that are made show the
          handiwork of God; I, whose conscience has been awe-struck as I
          listened to the voice of God proclaiming his holy law; I, whose heart
          has been melted while there broke on my ears the tender accents of his
          blessed gospel in those snatches of sacred melody that relieve the
          burden of prophecy; I, who have recognised in the babe of Bethlehem
          the hope of Israel; in the man of Nazareth, the Messiah that should
          come; in the victim of Calvary, the one Mediator; in the risen Jesus,
          the well-beloved Son -- to me, verily, God incarnate has been so
          palpably revealed that I have almost seen God, for I have, as it were,
          seen him in whom all the fullness of the Godhead bodily doth dwell.
          Still I "see through a glass, darkly." Illumine these dark senses,
          waken this drowsy conscience, purify my heart, give me fellowship with
          Christ, end thee bear me up, translate me to the third heavens; so I
          may, so I can, so I shall see God. But what that means, or what it is,
          ah me! I cannot tell.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We proposed to enquire, in the second place, HOW THIS VERY
          REMARKABLE CHANGE SHALL BE EFFECTED? WHY IS IT THAT WE SHALL BE MORE
          CLEARLY THEN THAN NOW? We cannot altogether answer the question, but
          one or two suggestions may help us. No doubt many of these things will
          be more clearly revealed in the next state. Here the light is like the
          dawn: it is dim twilight. In heaven it will be the blaze of noon. God
          has declared somethings of himself by the mouth of his holy prophets
          and apostles. He has been pleased, through the lips of his Son, whom
          he hath appointed heir of all things, to speak to us more plainly, to
          show us more openly the thoughts of his heart and the counsel of his
          will. These are the first steps to knowledge. But there the light will
          be as the light of seven days, and there the manifestation of all the
          treasures of wisdom shall be brighter and clearer than it is now; for
          God, the only-wise God, shall unveil to us the mysteries, and exhibit
          to us the glories of his everlasting kingdom. The revelation we now
          have suits us as men clad in our poor mortal bodies; the revelation
          then will suit us as immortal spirits. When we have been raised from
          the dead, it will be suitable to our immortal spiritual bodies. Here,
          too, we are at a distance from many of the things we long to know
          something of, but there we shall be nearer to them. We shall then be
          on a vantage ground, with the entire horizon spread out before us. Our
          Lord Jesus is, as to his personal presence, far away from us. We see
          him through the telescope of faith, but then we shall see him face to
          face. His literal and bodily presence is in heaven, since he was taken
          up, and we need to be taken up likewise to be with him where he is
          that we may literally behold him. Get to the fountain-head, and you
          understand more; stand in the center, and things seem regular and
          orderly. If you could stand in the sun and see the orbits in which the
          planets revolve round that central luminary, it would become clear
          enough; but for many an age astronomers were unable to discover
          anything of order, and spoke of the planets as progressive,
          retrograde, and standing still. Let us get to God, the center, and we
          shall see how providence in order revolves round his sapphire throne.
          We, ourselves, too, when we get to heaven, shall be better qualified
          to see than we are now. It would be an inconvenience for us to know
          here as much as we shall know in heaven. No doubt we have sometimes
          thought that if we had better ears it would be a great blessing. We
          have wished we could hear ten miles off; but probably we should be no
          better off; we might hear too much, and the sounds might drown each
          other. Probably our sight is not as good as we wish it were, but a
          large increase of ocular power might not be of any use to us. Our
          natural organs are fitted for our present sphere of being; and our
          mental faculties are, in the case of most of us, properly adapted to
          our moral requirements. If we knew more of our own sinfulness, we
          might be driven to despair; if we knew more of God's glory, we might
          die of terror; if we had more understanding, unless we had equivalent
          capacity to employ it, we might be filled with conceit and tormented
          with ambition. But up there we shall have our minds and our systems
          strengthened to receive more, without the damage that would come to us
          here from overleaping the boundaries of order, supremely appointed and
          divinely regulated. We cannot here drink the wine of the kingdom, it
          is too strong for us; but up there we shall drink it new in our
          heavenly Father's kingdom, without fear of the intoxications of pride,
          or the staggerings of passions. We shall know even as we are known.
          Besides, dear friends, the atmosphere of heaven is so much clearer
          than this, that I do not wonder we can see better there. Here Here is
          the smoke of daily care; the constant dust of toil; the mist of
          trouble perpetually rising. We cannot be expected to see much in such
          a smoky atmosphere as this; but when we shall pass beyond, we shall
          find no clouds ever gather round the sun to hide his everlasting
          brightness. There all is clear. The daylight is serene as the noonday.
          We shall be in a clearer atmosphere and brighter light.
        </p>

          III. The practical lessons we may learn from this subject demand your
          attention before I close. Methinks there is an appeal to our
          gratitude. Let us be very thankful for all we do see. Those, who do
          not see now -- ah, not even "through a glass, darkly" -- shall never
          see face to face. The eyes that never see Christ by faith shall never
          see him with joy in heaven. If thou hast never seen thyself a leper,
          defiled with sin and abashed with penitence, thou shalt never see
          thyself redeemed from sin, renewed by grace, a white-robed spirit. If
          thou hast no sense of God's presence here, constraining thee to
          worship and love him, thou shalt have no sight of his glory hereafter,
          introducing thee to the fullness of joy and pleasure for evermore. Oh!
          be glad for the sight you have, dear brother, dear sister. It is God
          that gave it to thee. Thou art one born blind; and "Since the world
          began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was
          born blind." This miracle has been wrought on thee; thou canst see,
          and thou canst say: "One thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I
          see."
        </p>
        <p>
          Our text teaches us that this feeble vision is very hopeful. You shall
          see better by-and-by. Oh, you know not how soon -- it may be a day or
          two hence -- that we shall be in glory! God may so have ordained it,
          that betwixt us and heaven there may be but a step.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another lesson is that of forbearance one with another. Let the
          matters we have spoken of soften the asperity of our debates; let us
          feel when we are disputing about points of difficulty, that we need
          not get cross about them, because after all there are limits to our
          present capacity as well as to our actual knowledge. Our disputes are
          often childish. We might as well leave some questions in abeyance for
          a little while. Two persons in the dark have differed about a color,
          and they are wrangling about it. If we brought candles in and held
          them to the color, the candles would not show what it was; but if we
          look at it to-morrow morning, when the sun shines, we shall be able to
          tell. How many difficulties in the word of God are like this! Not yet
          can they be justly discriminated; till the day dawn, the apocalyptic
          symbols will not be all transparent to our own understanding. Besides,
          we have no time to waste while there is so much work to do. Much time
          is already spent. Sailing is dangerous; the winds are high; the sea is
          rough. Trim the ship; keep the sails in good order; manage her and
          keep her off quicksands. As to certain other matters, we must wait
          till we get into the fair haven, and are able to talk with some of the
          bright spirits now before the throne. When some of the things they
          know shall be opened unto us, we shall confess the mistakes we made,
          and rejoice in the light we shall receive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should not this happy prospect excite our aspiration and make us very
          desirous to be there? It is natural for us to want to know, but we
          shall not know as we are known till we are present with the Lord. We
          are at school now -- children at school. We shall go to the college
          soon -- the great University of Heaven -- and take our degree there.
          Yet some of us, instead of being anxious to go, are shuddering at the
          thought of death -- the gate of endless joy we dread to enter! There
          are many persons who die suddenly; some die in their sleep, and many
          have passed out of time into eternity when it has scarcely been known
          by those who have been sitting at their bedsides. Depend upon it,
          there is no pain in dying; the pain is in living. When they leave off
          living here, they have done with pain. Do not blame death for what it
          does not deserve; it is life that lingers on in pain: death is the end
          of it. The man that is afraid of dying ought to be afraid of living.
          Be content to die whenever the Master's will shall bid thee. Commit
          thy spirit to his keeping. Who that hath seen but the glimpses of his
          beaming countenance doth not long to see his face, that is as the sun
          shining in his strength? O Lord! thy will be done. Let us speedily
          behold thee, if so it may be -- only this one word, if so it may be.
          Do we now see, and do we expect to see better? Let us bless the name
          of the Lord, who hath chosen us of his mercy and of his infinite
          lovingkindness. On the other hand, let it cause us great anxiety if we
          have not believed in Jesus, for he that hath not believed in him,
          dying as he is, will never see the face of God with joy. Oh!
          unbeliever, be concerned about your soul, and seek thou after him,
          repair thou to him. Oh! that God would open thy eyes now in this very
          house of prayer. Blessed for thee to know in part. Thrice blessed, I
          say; for as surely as thou knowest in part now, thou shalt fully know
          hereafter. Be it your happy lot to know him, whom to know is life
          eternal. God grant it, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

        <p>PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON -- 2 Corinthians 5.</p>
        <p>
          SOME of the Sermon readers may not be aware that we issue a monthly
          magazine, entitled The Sword and the Trowel, price 3d. In it will be
          found interesting descriptions of holy works in all denominations,
          theological articles, and periodical information as to the various
          institutions connected with the Tabernacle. It is believed that The
          Sword and the Trowel has the largest circulation of any magazine of
          its class, with the exception of those which attract readers by
          religious novels; such a mode of gaining popularity the Editor will
          never employ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The volume entitled Feathers for Arrows was compiled by us with the
          view of furnishing fresh illustrations to religious teachers. The
          first edition of ten thousand was sold at once, and we went to press
          with a second ten thousand. It is a beautifully bound volume, and a
          very cheap half-crown's worth. Passmore &amp; Alabaster are the
          publishers.
