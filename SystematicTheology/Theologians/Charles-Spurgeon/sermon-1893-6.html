          There were two extraordinary men living in the city of Jerusalem when
          Christ was on earth. One of them has come down through history
          nameless -- we do not know who he was; the name of the other is given.
          One was not only a beggar, but blind from his birth; the other was one
          of the rich men of Jerusalem. Yet in the Gospel of John, there is more
          space given to this blind beggar than to any other character. The
          reason why so much has been recorded of this man is because he took
          his stand for Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at the account given in John ix., beginning at the fifth verse.
          In the previous chapter Christ had been telling them that He was the
          Light of the world, and that if any man would follow Him he should not
          walk in darkness, but should have the light of life. After making a
          statement of that kind, Christ often gave
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>AN EVIDENCE OF THE TRUTH</p>
        <p>
          of what He said by performing some miracle. If He had said He was the
          Light of the world, He would show them in what way He was the Light of
          the world. If He had said He was the Life of the world, He would prove
          Himself to be such by quickening and raising the dead; just as He did,
          after telling them that He was the Resurrection and the Life, by going
          to the graveyard of Bethany and calling Lazarus forth. When Lazarus
          heard the voice of his friend saying, "Lazarus, come forth!" he came
          forth immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Son of God does not ask men to believe Him without a reason for so
          doing. We need to keep this in mind. You might as well ask a man to
          see without light or eyes, as to believe without testimony.
        </p>
        <p>
          He gave them good reason for believing in Him, and proved His
          Messiahship and authority. He not only told them that He had the
          power, but He showed them that He had.
        </p>
        <p>
          These two men, then, were both at Jerusalem. One held as high a
          position, and the other as low a position, as any in the city. One was
          at the top of the social ladder, and the other at the bottom. And yet
          they both made a good confession; and one was as acceptable to Jesus
          as the other.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          The man mentioned in this chapter was born blind. We find the Lord's
          disciples asking Him:
        </p>
        <p>
          "Master, who did sin, this man or his parents, that he was born
          blind?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus answered, "Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents; but
          that the works of God should be manifest in him."
        </p>
        <p>
          When He had thus spoken, He spat on the ground, and made clay of the
          spittle; and He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, and
          said unto him:
        </p>
        <p>"Go wash in the pool of Siloam."</p>
        <p>
          The blind man went his way and washed, and his eyesight was restored.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe what that man did. He did
          <i>just what Christ told him to do</i>. The Savior's command to him
          was to go to the pool of Siloam and wash; and "he went his way
          therefore, and came seeing." He was blessed in the very act of
          obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thought: God does not generally repeat Himself. Of all the
          blind men who were healed while Christ was on earth, no two were
          healed in exactly the same way. Jesus met blind Bartimeus near the
          gates of Jericho, and called him to Him and said:
        </p>
        <p>"What wilt thou that I should do unto thee?"</p>
        <p>The answer was: "Lord, that I might receive my sight."</p>
        <p>
          Now, see what He did. He did not send Bartimeus off to Jerusalem
          twenty miles away to the pool of Siloam to wash. He did not spit on
          the ground, and make clay, and anoint his eyes; but with a word He
          wrought the cure, saying:
        </p>
        <p>"Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole."</p>
        <p>
          Suppose Bartimeus had gone from Jericho and had met the other blind
          beggar at the gate of the city of Jerusalem, and asked him how it was
          he got his sight; suppose they began to compare notes -- one telling
          his experience, and the other telling his. Imagine the first saying:
        </p>
        <p>
          "I do not believe that you have got your sight, because you did not
          get it in the same way that I got mine."
        </p>
        <p>
          Would the different ways the Lord Jesus had in healing them make their
          cases the less true? Yet there are some people who talk just that way
          now. Because God does not deal with some exactly as He does with
          others, people think that God is not dealing with them at all. God
          seldom repeats Himself. No two persons were ever converted exactly
          alike, so far as my experience goes. Each one must have an experience
          of his own. Let the Lord give sight in His own way.
        </p>
        <p>There are thousands of people who</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>KEEP AWAY FROM CHRIST</p>
        <p>
          because they are looking for the experience of some dear friend or
          relative. They should not judge of their conversion by the experiences
          of others. They have heard some one tell how he was converted twenty
          years ago, and they expect to be converted in the same way. Persons
          should never count upon having an experience precisely similar to that
          of some one else of whom they have heard or read. They must go right
          to the Lord Himself, and do what He tells them to do. If He says, "Go
          to the pool of Siloam and wash," then they must go. If He says, "Come
          just as you are," and promises to give sight, then they must come, and
          let Him do His own work in His own way, just as this blind man did. It
          was a peculiar way by which to give a man sight; but it was the Lord's
          way; and the man's sight was given him. We might think it was enough
          to make a man blind to fill his eyes with clay. True, he was now
          doubly blind; for if he had been able to see before, the clay would
          have deprived him of his sight. But the Lord wanted to show the people
          that they were not only spiritually blind by nature, but that they had
          also allowed themselves to be blinded by the clay of this world, which
          had been spread over their eyes. But God's ways are not our ways. If
          He is going to work, we must let Him act as He pleases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shall we dictate to the Almighty? Shall the clay say to the potter,
          "Why hast thou made me thus?" Who art thou, O man, that repliest
          against God? Let God work in His own way; and when the Holy Ghost
          comes, let Him mark out a way for Himself. We must be willing to
          submit, and to do what the Lord tells us, without any questioning
          whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He went his way, therefore, and washed, and came seeing. The
          neighbors, therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was
          blind, said, 'Is not this he that sat and begged?'"
        </p>
        <p>"Some said, 'This is he'; others said, 'He is like him.'"</p>
        <p>
          Now, if he had been like a good many at the present time, I am afraid
          he would have remained silent. He would have said:
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, now I have got my sight, and I will just keep quiet about it.
          It is not necessary for me to confess it. Why should I say anything?
          There is a good deal of opposition to this man Jesus Christ. There are
          a great many bitter things said in Jerusalem against Him. He has a
          great many enemies. I think there will be trouble if I talk about Him;
          so I will say nothing."
        </p>
        <p>
          Some said, "This is he"; others said, "He is like him." But he said,
          "I am he." He not only got his eyes opened, but, thank God, he got his
          mouth open too!
        </p>
        <p>
          Surely, the next thing after we get our eyes opened is for us to open
          our lips and begin to testify for Him.
        </p>
        <p>The people asked him, "How were thine eyes opened?"</p>
        <p>
          He answered: "A man that is called Jesus made clay and anointed mine
          eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash: and I went
          and washed, and I received sight."
        </p>
        <p>
          He told a straightforward story, just what the Lord had done for him.
          That is all. That is what a witness ought to do -- tell what he knows,
          not what he does not know. He did not try to make a long speech. It is
          not the most flippant and fluent witness who has the most influence
          with a jury.
        </p>
        <p>
          This man's testimony is what I call "experience." One of the greatest
          hindrances to the progress of the Gospel to-day is that the narration
          of the experience of the Church is not encouraged. There are a great
          many men and women who come into the Church, and we never hear
          anything of their experiences, or of the Lord's dealings with them. If
          we could, it would be a great help to others. It would stimulate faith
          and encourage the more feeble of the flock.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>THE APOSTLE PAUL'S EXPERIENCE</p>
        <p>
          has been recorded three times. I have no doubt that he told it
          everywhere he went: how God had met him; how God had opened his eyes
          and his heart; and how God had blessed him. Depend upon it, experience
          has its place; the great mistake that is made now is in the other
          extreme. In some places and at some periods there has been too much of
          it -- it has been all experience; and now we have let the pendulum
          swing too far the other way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think it is not only right, but exceedingly useful, that we should
          give our experience. This man bore testimony to what the Lord had done
          for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And it was the Sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his
          eyes; Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his
          sight. He said unto them, 'He put clay upon mine eyes; and I washed,
          and do see.' Therefore said some of the Pharisees, 'This man is not of
          God, because he keepeth not the Sabbath day.' Others said, 'How can a
          man that is a sinner do such miracles?' And there was a division among
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          They say unto the blind man again, 'What sayest thou of Him, that He
          hath opened thine eyes?'"
        </p>
        <p>
          What an opportunity he had for evading the questions! He might have
          said: "Why, I have never seen Him. When He met me I was blind; I could
          not see Him. When I came back I could not find Him; and I have not
          formed any opinion yet." He might have put them off in that way, but
          he said:
        </p>
        <p>"He is a prophet."</p>
        <p>
          He gave them his opinion. He was a man of backbone. He had moral
          courage. He stood right up among the enemies of Jesus Christ, the
          Pharisees, and told them what he thought of Him --
        </p>
        <p>"He is a prophet."</p>
        <p>
          If you can get young Christians to talk, not about themselves, but
          about Christ, their testimony will have power. Many converts talk
          altogether about their own experience -- "I," "I," "I," "I." But this
          blind man got away to the Master, and said, "He is a prophet." He
          believed, and he told them what he believed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind,
          and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had
          received his sight. And they asked them, saying, 'Is this your son,
          who ye say was born blind? How then doth he now see?' His parents
          answered them, and said, 'We know that this is our son, and that he
          was born blind: but by what means he now seeth, we know not: or who
          hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall
          speak for himself.' These words spake his parents, because they feared
          the Jews; for the Jews had agreed already that if any man did confess
          that He was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. Therefore
          said his parents, 'He is of age; ask him.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always had great contempt for those parents. They had a noble
          son, and their lack of moral courage then and there to confess what
          the Lord Jesus Christ had done for their son, makes them unworthy of
          him. They say, "We do not know how he got it," which looks as if they
          did not believe their own son. "He is of age; ask him."
        </p>
        <p>
          It is sorrowfully true to-day that we have hundreds and thousands of
          people who are professed disciples of Jesus Christ, but when the time
          comes that they ought to take their stand, and give a clear testimony
          for Him, they testify against Him. You can always tell those who are
          really converted to God. The new man always takes his stand for God;
          and the old man takes his stand against Him. These parents had an
          opportunity to confess the Lord Jesus Christ, and to do great things
          for Him; but they neglected their golden opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          If they had but stood up with their noble son, and said, "This is our
          son. We have tried all the physicians, and used all the means in our
          power, and were unable to do anything for him; but now, out of
          gratitude, we confess that he received his sight from the prophet of
          Galilee, Jesus of Nazareth," they might have led many to believe on
          Him. But, instead of that, they said, "We know that this is our son,
          and that he was born blind: but by what means he now seeth, we know
          not."
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you know why they did not want to tell how he got his sight? Simply
          because it would
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>COST THEM TOO MUCH.</p>
        <p>
          They represent those Christians who do not want to serve Christ if it
          is going to cost them anything; if they have to give up society,
          position, or worldly pleasures. They do not want to come out. This is
          what keeps hundreds and thousands from becoming Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a serious thing to be put out of the synagogue in those days.
          It does not amount to much now. If a man is put out of one church,
          another may receive him; but when he went out of the synagogue there
          was no other to take him in. It was the State church: it was the only
          one they had. If he were cast out of that, he was cast out of society,
          position, and everything else; and his business suffered also.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then again the Jews called the man that was blind, "and said unto him,
          'Give God the praise; we know that this man is a sinner.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          It looks now as if they were trying to prejudice him against Christ:
          but he "answered and said, 'Whether He be a sinner or no, I know not;
          one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          There were no infidels or philosophers there who could persuade him
          out of that. There were not men enough in Jerusalem to make him
          believe that his eyes were not opened. Did he not <i>know</i> that for
          over twenty years he had been feeling his way around Jerusalem; that
          he had been led by children and friends; and that during all those
          years he had not seen the sun in its glory, or any of the beauties of
          nature? Did he not know that he had been feeling his way through life
          up to that very day?
        </p>
        <p>
          And do we not know that we have been born of God, and that we have got
          the eyes of our souls opened? Do we not know that old things have
          passed away and all things have become new, and that the eternal light
          has dawned upon our souls? Do we not know that the chains that once
          bound us have snapped asunder, that the darkness is gone, and that the
          light has come? Have we not liberty where we once had bondage? Do we
          not know it? If so, then let us not hold our peace. Let us testify for
          the Son of God, and say, as the blind man did in Jerusalem, "ONE THING
          I KNOW, that whereas I was blind, now I see. I have a new power. I
          have a new light. I have a new love. I have a new nature. I have
          something that reaches out toward God. By the eye of faith I can see
          yonder heaven. I can see Christ standing at the right hand of God. By
          and by, when my journey is over, I am going to hear that voice saying,
          'Come hither,' when I shall sit down in the kingdom of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Then said they to him again, 'What did He do to thee? how opened He
          thine eyes?' But he answered them, 'I have told you already, and ye
          did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again? Will ye also be His
          disciples?'"
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a most extraordinary man. Here was a young convert in
          Jerusalem, not a day old,
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>TRYING TO MAKE CONVERTS</p>
        <p>
          of these Pharisees -- men who had been fighting Christ for nearly
          three years! He asked them if they would also become His disciples. He
          was ready to tell his experience to all who were willing to hear it.
          If he had covered it up at the first, and had not come out at once, he
          would not have had the privilege of testifying in that way, neither
          would he have been a winner of souls. This man was going to be a
          soul-winner.
        </p>
        <p>
          I venture to say he became one of the best workers in Jerusalem. I
          have no doubt he stood well to the front on the day of Pentecost, when
          Peter preached, and when the wounded were around him; he went to work
          and told how the Lord had blessed him, and how He would bless them. He
          was a <i>worker</i>, not an <i>idler</i>, and he kept his lips open.

          It is a very sad thing that so many of God's children are dumb; yet it
          is true. Parents would think it a great calamity to have their
          children born dumb; they would mourn over it, and weep; and well they
          might; but did you ever think of the many dumb children God has? The
          churches are full of them; they never speak for Christ. They can talk
          about politics, art, and science; they can speak well enough and fast
          enough about the fashions of the day; but they have
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>NO VOICE FOR THE SON OF GOD.</p>
        <p>
          Dear friend, if He is your Savior, confess Him. Every follower of
          Jesus should bear testimony for Him. How many opportunities each one
          has in society and in business to speak a word for Jesus Christ! How
          many opportunities occur daily wherein every Christian might be
          "instant in season and out of season" in pleading for Jesus! In so
          doing we receive blessing for ourselves, and also become a means of
          blessing to others.
        </p>
        <p>
          This man wanted to make converts of those Pharisees, who only a little
          while before had their hands full of stones, ready to put the Son of
          God to death, and even now had murder in their hearts. They reviled
          him, saying, "Thou art His disciple, but we are Moses' disciples. We
          know that God spake unto Moses. As for this fellow, we know not from
          whence He is."
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, now the once blind man might have said, "There is a good deal of
          opposition, and I will say no more; I will keep quiet, and walk off
          and leave them." But, thank God, he stood right up with the courage of
          a Paul! He answered and said unto them:
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why, herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence He
          is, and yet He hath opened mine eyes! Now we know that God heareth not
          sinners; but if any man be a worshiper of God, and doeth His will, him
          He heareth."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I call that logic. If he had been through a theological seminary
          he could not have given a better answer. It is sound doctrine, and was
          a good sermon for those who were opposed to the work of Christ. "If
          this man were not of God He could do nothing." This is very strong
          proof of the man's conviction as to who the Lord Jesus was. It is as
          though he said: "I, a man born blind, and He can give me sight. He a
          <i>sinner!</i>" Why, it is unreasonable! If Jesus Christ were a man
          only, how could He give that man sight?
        </p>
        <p>Let philosophers, skeptics, and infidels answer the question,</p>
        <p>
          Neither had he to wear glasses. He received good sight, not short
          sight, or weak sight, but as good sight as any man in Jerusalem, and
          perhaps a little better. They could all look at him and see for
          themselves. His testimony was beyond dispute.
        </p>
        <p>
          After his splendid confession of the divinity and power of Christ,
          "they answered and said unto him, 'Thou wast altogether born in sin,
          and dost thou teach us?' And they cast him out." They could not meet
          his argument, and so they cast him out. So it is now. If we give a
          clear testimony for Christ, the world will cast us out. It is a good
          thing to give our testimony so clearly for Christ that the world
          dislikes it; it is a good thing when such testimony for Christ causes
          the world to cast us out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us see what happened when they cast him out. "Jesus heard," that
          is the next thing. No sooner did they cast him out than Jesus heard of
          it. No man was ever cast out by the world for the sake of Jesus Christ
          but He heard of it; indeed, He will be the first one to hear of it.
          "Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when He found him He said
          unto him, 'Dost thou believe in the Son of God?' He answered and said,
          'Who is He, Lord, that I might believe on Him?' And Jesus said unto
          him, 'Thou hast both seen Him, and it is He that talketh with thee.'
          And he said, 'Lord, I believe!' And he worshiped Him."
        </p>
        <p>That was</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>A GOOD PLACE TO LEAVE HIM</p>
        <p>
          -- at the feet of Jesus. We shall meet him by and by in the kingdom of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          His testimony has been ringing down through the ages these last
          nineteen hundred years. It has been talked about wherever the Word of
          God has been known. It was a wonderful day's work that man did for the
          Son of God; doubtless there will be many in eternity who will thank
          God for his confession of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          By thus showing his gratitude in coming out and confessing Christ, he
          has left a record that has stirred the Church of God ever since. He is
          one of the characters that always stirs one up, imparting new life and
          fire, new boldness and courage when one reads about him. This is what
          we need to-day as much as ever -- to stand up for the Son of God. Let
          the Pharisees rage against us; let the world go on mocking, and
          sneering, and scoffing; we will stand up courageously for the Son of
          God. If they cast us out, they will cast us right into His own bosom.
          He will take us to His own loving arms. It is a blessed thing to live
          so godly in Christ Jesus that the world will not want you -- that they
          will cast you out.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>II</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Now we come to Joseph of Arimathea.</p>
        <p>
          I do not think he came out quite so nobly as this blind beggar did;
          but he did come out, and we will thank God for that. We read in John
          that for fear of the Jews he was kept back from confessing openly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And after this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but
          secretly, <i>for fear of the Jews</i>, besought Pilate that he might
          take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him leave. He came,
          therefore, and took the body of Jesus."
        </p>
        <p>
          Read the four accounts given in the four Gospels of Joseph of
          Arimathea. There is very seldom anything mentioned by all four of the
          Evangelists. If Matthew and Mark refer to an event it is often omitted
          by Luke and John; and, if it occur in the latter, it may not be
          contained in the former. John's Gospel is made up of that which is
          absent from the others in most instances -- as in the case of the
          blind man alluded to. But all four record what Joseph did for Christ.
          All His disciples had forsaken Him. One had sold Him, and another had
          denied Him. He was left in gloom and darkness, when Joseph of
          Arimathea came out and confessed Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the death of Jesus Christ that brought out Joseph of Arimathea.
          Probably he was one of the number that stood at the cross when the
          centurion smote his breast, and cried out, "Truly, this was the Son of
          God," and he was doubtless convinced at the same time. He was a
          disciple before, because we read that on the night of the trial he did
          not give his consent to the death of Christ. There must have been some
          surprise in the Council-chamber on that occasion, when Joseph of
          Arimathea, a rich man, stood up and said:
        </p>
        <p>"I will never give my consent to His death."</p>
        <p>
          There were seventy of those men, but we have very good reason to
          believe that there were two of them that, like Caleb and Joshua of
          old, had the courage to stand up for Jesus Christ -- these were Joseph
          of Arimathea and Nicodemus: neither of them gave their consent to the
          death of Christ. But I am afraid Joseph did not come out and say that
          he was a disciple -- for we do not find a word said about his being
          one until after the crucifixion.
        </p>
        <p>I am afraid there are</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>MANY JOSEPHS TODAY,</p>
        <p>
          men of position, of whom it could be said they are secret disciples.
          Such would probably say to-day, "I do not need to take my stand on
          Christ's side. What more do <i>I</i> need? I have everything." We read
          that he was a rich and honorable councillor, a just and a good man,
          and holding a high position in the government of the nation. He was
          also a benevolent man, and a devout man too. What more could he need?
          God wants something more than Joseph's good life and high position. A
          man may be all Joseph was and yet be without Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          But a crisis came in his history. If he was to take his stand, now was
          the time for him to do it, I consider that this is one of the
          grandest, the noblest acts that any man ever did, to take his stand
          for Christ when there seemed nothing, humanly speaking, that Christ
          could give him. Joseph had no hope concerning the resurrection. It
          seems that none of our Lord's disciples understood that He was going
          to rise again even Peter, James, and John, as well as the rest,
          scarcely believed that He had risen when He appeared to them. They had
          anticipated that He would set up His kingdom, but He had no sceptre in
          His hand; and, so far as they could see, no kingdom in view. In fact,
          He was dead on the cross, with nails through His hands and feet. There
          He hung until His spirit took its flight; that which had made Him so
          grand, so glorious, and so noble, had now left the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joseph might have said, "It will be no use my taking a stand for Him
          now. If I come out and confess Him I shall probably lose my position
          in society and in the council, and my influence. I had better remain
          where I am."
        </p>
        <p>
          There was no earthly reward for him; there was nothing, humanly
          speaking, that could have induced him to come out; and yet we are told
          by Mark that he went boldly into Pilate's judgment-hall and begged the
          body of Jesus. I consider this was
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>ONE OF THE SUBLIMEST, GRANDEST ACTS</p>
        <p>
          that any man ever did. In that darkness and gloom, His disciples
          having all forsaken Him; Judas having sold Him for thirty pieces of
          silver; the chief apostle Peter having denied Him with a curse,
          swearing that he never knew Him; the chief priests having found Him
          guilty of blasphemy; the Council having condemned him to death; and
          when there was a hiss going up to heaven over all Jerusalem, Joseph
          went right against the current, right against the influence of all his
          friends, and begged the body of Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blessed act! Doubtless he upbraided himself for not having been more
          bold in his defence of Christ when He was tried, and before He was
          condemned to be crucified. The Scripture says he was an honorable man,
          an honorable councillor, a rich man, and yet we have only the record
          of that one thing -- the one act of begging the body of Jesus. But I
          tell you, that what he did for the Son of God, out of pure love for
          Him, will live for ever; that one act rises up above everything else
          that Joseph of Arimathea ever did. He might have given large sums of
          money to different institutions, he might have been very good to the
          poor, he might have been very kind to the needy in various ways; but
          that one act for Jesus Christ, on that memorable, that dark afternoon,
          was one of the noblest acts that a man ever did. He must have been a
          man of great influence, or Pilate would not have given him the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now you see another secret disciple, Nicodemus. Nicodemus and
          Joseph go to the cross. Joseph is there first, and while he is waiting
          for Nicodemus to come, he looks down the hill; and I can imagine his
          delight as he sees his friend coming with a hundred pounds of
          ointment. Although Jesus Christ had led such a lowly life, He was to
          have a kingly anointing and burial. God has touched the hearts of
          these two noble men and they drew out the nails, and took the body
          down, washed the blood away from the wounds that had been made on His
          back by the scourge, and on His head by the crown of thorns; then they
          took the lifeless form, washed it clean, and wrapped it in fine linen,
          and Joseph laid Him in his own sepulchre.
        </p>
        <p>
          When all was dark and gloomy, when His cause seemed to be lost, and
          the hope of the Church buried in that new tomb, Joseph took his stand
          for the One "despised and rejected of men." It was the greatest act of
          his life; and, my reader, if you want to stand with the Lord Jesus
          Christ in glory; if you want the power of God to be bestowed upon you
          for service down here, you must not hesitate to take your stand boldly
          and manfully for the most despised of all men -- the Man Christ Jesus.
          His cause is unpopular. The ungodly sneer at His name. But if you want
          the blessings of heaven on your soul, and to hear the "Well done, good
          and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord," take your
          stand at once for Him; whatever your position may be, or however much
          your friends may be against you. Decide for Jesus Christ, the
          crucified but risen Savior. Go outside the camp and bear His reproach.
          Take up your cross and follow Him, and by and by you will lay it down
          and take the crown to wear it for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember some meetings being held in a locality where the tide did
          not rise very quickly, and bitter and reproachful things were being
          said about the work. But one day, one of the most prominent men in the
          place rose and said:
        </p>
        <p>
          "I want it to be known that I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, and if
          there is any odium to be cast on His cause, I am prepared to take my
          share of it."
        </p>
        <p>
          It went through the meeting like an electric current, and a blessing
          came at once to his own soul and to the souls of others.
        </p>
        <p>Depend upon it, there is</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>NO CROWN WITHOUT A CROSS.</p>
        <p>
          We must take our proper position here, as Joseph did. It cost him
          something to take up his cross. I have no doubt they put him out of
          the council and out of the synagogue. He lost his standing, and
          perhaps his wealth: like other faithful followers of Christ, he
          became, henceforth, a despised and unpopular man.
        </p>
        <p>
          The blind man could not have done what Joseph did. Some men can do
          what others cannot. God will hold us responsible for our own
          influence. Let each of us do what we can. Even though the conduct of
          our Lord's professed followers was anything but helpful to those who,
          like Joseph, had but little courage to come out on the Lord's side, he
          was not deterred from taking his stand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever it costs us, let us be true Christians, and take a firm
          stand. It is like the dust in the balance in comparison to what God
          has in store for us. We can afford to suffer with Him a little while
          if we are going to reign with Him for ever. We can afford to take up
          the cross and follow Him, to be despised and rejected by the world,
          with such a bright prospect in view. If the glories of heaven are
          real, it will be to His praise and to our advantage to share in His
          rejection now.
        </p>
        <p>
          May the Lord keep us from halting; and may we, when weighed in the
          balance, not be found wanting! May God help every reader to do all
          that the poor blind beggar did, and all that Joseph did!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us confess Him at all times and in all places. Let us show our
          friends that we are out and out on His side. Every one has a circle
          that he can influence, and God will hold us responsible for the
          influence we possess. Joseph of Arimathea and the blind man had
          circles in which their influence was powerful. I can influence people
          that others cannot reach; and they, in their turn, can reach a class
          that I could not touch. It is only for a little while that we can
          confess Him and work for Him. It is only for a few months or years;
          and then the eternal ages will roll on, and great will be our reward
          in the crowning day that is coming. We shall then hear the Master say
          to us:
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy
          Lord."
        </p>
        <p>God grant it may be so!</p>
