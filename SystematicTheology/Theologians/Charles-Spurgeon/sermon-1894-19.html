          There is one that toileth, and laboureth, and maketh haste, and is so
          much the more behind. There is one that is sluggish, and hath need of
          help, lacking in strength, and that aboundeth in poverty; and the eyes
          of the Lord looked upon him for good, and he set him up from his low
          estate, and lifted up his head; and many marvelled at him. Good things
          and evil, life and death, poverty and riches, are from the Lord. The
          gift of the Lord remaineth with the godly, and his good pleasure shall
          prosper for ever. There is that waxeth rich by his wariness and
          pinching, and this is the portion of his reward: when he saith, I have
          found rest, and now will I eat of my goods -- yet he knoweth not what
          time shall pass, and he shall leave them to others, and die. Be
          stedfast in thy covenant, and be conversant therein, and wax old in
          thy work. Marvel not at the works of a sinner, but trust the Lord, and
          abide in thy labour; for it is an easy thing in the sight of the Lord
          swiftly on the sudden to make a poor man rich. The blessing of the
          Lord is in the reward of the godly; and in an hour that cometh swiftly
          he maketh his blessing to flourish. Say not, What use is there of me?
          And what from henceforth shall my good things be? Say not, I have
          sufficient, and from henceforth what harm shall happen unto me? In the
          day of good things there is a forgetfulness of evil things; and in the
          day of evil things a man will not remember things that are good. For
          it is an easy thing in the sight of the Lord to reward a man in the
          day of death according to his ways. The affliction of an hour causeth
          forgetfulness of delight; and in the last end of a man is the
          revelation of his deeds. Call no man blessed before his death; and a
          man shall be known in his children.
