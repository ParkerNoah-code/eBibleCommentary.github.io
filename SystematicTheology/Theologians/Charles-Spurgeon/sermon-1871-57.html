        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1024)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, November 19th, 1871, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>|The throne of grace.| -- Hebrews 4:16</p>
        <p>
          THESE words are found embedded in that gracious verse, |Let us
          therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain
          mercy, and find grace to help in time of need|; they are a gem in a
          golden setting. True prayer is an approach of the soul by the Spirit
          of God to the throne of God. It is not the utterance of words, it is
          not alone the feeling of desires, but it is the advance of the desires
          to God, the spiritual approach of our nature towards the Lord our God.
          True prayer is not a mere mental exercise, nor a vocal performance,
          but it is deeper far than that -- it is spiritual commerce with the
          Creator of heaven and earth. God is a Spirit unseen of mortal eye, and
          only to be perceived by the inner man; our spirit within us, begotten
          by the Holy Ghost at our regeneration, discerns the Great Spirit,
          communes with him, prefers to him its requests, and receives from him
          answers of peace. It is a spiritual business from beginning to end;
          and its aim and object end not with man, but reach to God himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to such prayer, the work of the Holy Ghost himself is needed.
          If prayer were of the lips alone, we should only need breath in our
          nostrils to pray: if prayer were of the desires alone, many excellent
          desires are easily felt, even by natural men: but when it is the
          spiritual desire, and the spiritual fellowship of the human spirit
          with the Great Spirit, then the Holy Ghost himself must be present all
          through it, to help infirmity, and give life and power, or else true
          prayer will never be presented, but the thing offered to God will wear
          the name and have the form, but the inner life of prayer will be far
          from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, it is clear from the connection of our text, that the
          interposition of the Lord Jesus Christ is essential to acceptable
          prayer. As prayer will not be truly prayer without the Spirit of God,
          so it will not be prevailing prayer without the Son of God. he, the
          Great High Priest, must go within the veil for us; nay, through his
          crucified person the veil must be entirely taken away; for, until
          then, we are shut out from the living God. The man who, despite the
          teaching of Scripture, tries to pray without a Saviour insults the
          Deity; and he who imagines that his own natural desires, coming up
          before God, unsprinkled with the precious blood, will be an acceptable
          sacrifice before God, makes a mistake; he has not brought an offering
          that God can accept, any more than if he had struck off a dog's neck,
          or offered an unclean sacrifice. Wrought in us by the Spirit,
          presented for us by the Christ of God, prayer becomes power before the
          Most High, but not else.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order, dear friends, that I may stir you up to prayer this morning,
          and that your souls may be led to come near to the Throne of Grace, I
          purpose to take these few words and handle them as God shall give me
          ability. You have begun to pray; God has begun to answer. This week
          has been a very memorable one in the history of this church. Larger
          numbers than ever before at one time have come forward to confess
          Christ, -- as plain an answer to the supplications of God's people, as
          though the hand of the Most High had been stretched out of heaven
          handing down to us the blessings for which we asked. Now, let us
          continue in prayer, yea, let us gather strength in intercession, and
          the more we succeed, the more earnest let us be to succeed yet more
          and more. Let us not be straitened in our own bowels, since we are not
          straitened in our God. This is a good day, and a time of glad tidings,
          and seeing that we have the King's ear, I am most anxious that we
          should speak to him for thousands of others; that they also, in answer
          to our pleadings, may be brought nigh unto Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          In trying to speak of the text this morning, I shall take it thus:
          First, here is a throne; then, secondly, here is grace; then we will
          put the two together, and we shall see grace on a throne; and putting
          them together in another order, we shall see sovereignty manifesting
          itself, and resplendent in grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Our text speaks of A THRONE: -- |The Throne of Grace.| God is to
          be viewed in prayer as our Father; that is the aspect which is dearest
          to us; but still we are not to regard him as though he were such as we
          are; for our Saviour has qualified the expression |Our Father,| with
          the words |who art in heaven|; and close at the heels of that
          condescending name, in order to remind us that our Father is still
          infinitely greater than ourselves, he has bidden us say, |Hallowed be
          thy name; thy kingdom come|; so that our Father is still to be
          regarded as a King, and in prayer we come, not only to our Father's
          feet, but we come also to the throne of the Great Monarch of the
          universe. The mercy-seat is a throne, and we must not forget this.
        </p>
        <p>
          If prayer should always be regarded by us as an entrance into the
          courts of the royalty of heaven; if we are to behave ourselves as
          courtiers should in the presence of an illustrious majesty, then we
          are not at a loss to know the right spirit in which to pray. If in
          prayer we come to a throne, it is clear that our spirit should, in the
          first place, be one of lowly reverence. It is expected that the
          subject in approaching to the king should pay him homage and honour.
          The pride that will not own the king, the treason which rebels against
          the sovereign will should, if it be wise, avoid any near approach to
          the throne. Let pride bite the curb at a distance, let treason lurk in
          corners, for only lowly reverence may come before the king himself
          when he sits clothed in his robes of majesty. In our case, the king
          before whom we come is the highest of all monarchs, the King of kings,
          the Lord of lords. Emperors are but the shadows of his imperial power.
          They call themselves kings by right divine, but what divine right have
          they? Common sense laughs their pretensions to scorn. The Lord alone
          hath divine right, and to him only doth the kingdom belong. He is the
          blessed and only potentate. They are but nominal kings, to be set up
          and put down at the will of men, or the decree of providence, but he
          is Lord alone, the Prince of the kings of the earth.
        </p>
        <p>|He sits on no precarious throne,</p>
        <p>Nor borrows leave to be.|</p>
        <p>
          My heart, be sure that thou prostrate thyself in such a presence. If
          he be so great, place thy mouth in the dust before him, for he is the
          most powerful of all kings; his throne hath sway in all worlds; heaven
          obeys him cheerfully, hell trembles at his frown, and earth is
          constrained to yield to him homage willingly or unwillingly. His power
          can make or can destroy. To create or to crush, either is easy enough
          to him. My soul be thou sure that when thou drawest nigh to the
          Omnipotent, who is as a consuming fire, thou put thy shoes from off
          thy feet, and worship him with lowliest humility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, he is the most Holy of all kings. His throne is a great white
          throne, unspotted, and clear as crystal. |The heavens are not pure in
          his sight, and he charged his angels with folly.| And thou, a sinful
          creature, with what lowliness shouldst thou draw nigh to him.
          Familiarity there may be, but let it not be unhallowed. Boldness there
          should be, but let it not be impertinent. Still thou art on earth and
          he in heaven; still thou art a worm of the dust, a creature crushed
          before the moth, and he the Everlasting: before the mountains were
          brought forth, he was God, and if all created things should pass away
          again, yet still were he the same. My brethren, I am afraid we do not
          bow as we should before the Eternal Majesty; but, henceforth, let us
          ask the Spirit of God to put us in a right frame, that every one of
          our prayers may be a reverential approach to the Infinite Majesty
          above.
        </p>
        <p>
          A throne, and therefore, in the second place, to be approached with
          devout joyfulness. If I find myself favoured by divine grace to stand
          amongst those favoured ones who frequent his courts, shall I not feel
          glad? I might have been in his prison, but I am before his throne: I
          might have been driven from his presence for ever, but I am permitted
          to come near to him, even into his royal palace, into his secret
          chamber of gracious audience, shall I not then be thankful? Shall not
          my thankfulness ascend into joy, and shall I not feel that I am
          honoured, that I am made the recipient of great favours when I am
          permitted to pray? Wherefore is thy countenance sad, O suppliant, when
          thou standest before the throne of grace? If thou wert before the
          throne of justice to be condemned for thine iniquities, thy hands
          might well be on thy loins; but now thou art favoured to come before
          the King in his silken robes of love, let thy face shine with sacred
          delight. If thy sorrows be heavy, tell them unto him, for he can
          assuage them; if thy sins be multiplied, confess them, for he can
          forgive them. O ye courtiers in the halls of such a monarch, be ye
          exceeding glad, and mingle praises with your prayers.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a throne, and therefore, in the third place, whenever it is
          approached, it should be with complete submission. We do not pray to
          God to instruct him as to what he ought to do, neither for a moment
          must we presume to dictate the line of the divine procedure. We are
          permitted to say unto God, |Thus and thus would we have it,| but we
          must evermore add, |But, seeing that we are ignorant and may be
          mistaken -- seeing that we are still in the flesh, and, therefore, may
          be actuated by carnal motives -- not as we will, but as thou wilt.|
          Who shall dictate to the throne? No loyal child of God will for a
          moment imagine that he is to occupy the place of the King, but he bows
          before him who has a right to be Lord of all; and though he utters his
          desire earnestly, vehemently, importunately, and pleads and pleads
          again, yet it is evermore with this needful reservation: |Thy will be
          done, my Lord: and, if I ask anything that is not in accordance
          therewith, my inmost will is that thou wouldst be good enough to deny
          thy servant; I will take it as a true answer if thou refuse me, if I
          ask that which seemeth not good in thy sight.| If we constantly
          remembered this, I think we should be less inclined to push certain
          suits before the throne, for we should feel, |I am here in seeking my
          own ease, my own comfort, my own advantage, and peradventure, I may be
          asking for that which would dishonour God; therefore will I speak with
          the deepest submission to the divine decrees.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But, brethren, in the fourth place, if it be a throne, it ought to be
          approached with enlarged expectations. Well doth our hymn put it:
        </p>
        <p>|Thou art coming to a king:</p>
        <p>Large petitions with thee bring.|</p>
        <p>
          We do not come, as it were, in prayer, only to God's almonry where he
          dispenses his favours to the poor, nor do we come to the back-door of
          the house of mercy to receive the broken scraps, though that were more
          than we deserve; to eat the crumbs that fall from the Master's table
          is more than we could claim; but, when we pray, we are standing in the
          palace, on the glittering floor of the great King's own reception
          room, and thus we are placed upon a vantage ground. In prayer we stand
          where angels bow with veiled faces; there, even there, the cherubim
          and seraphim adore, before that selfsame throne to which our prayers
          ascend. And shall we come there with stunted requests, and narrow and
          contracted faith? Nay, it becomes not a King to be giving away pence
          and groats, he distributes pieces of broad gold; he scatters not as
          poor men must, scraps of bread and broken meat, but he makes a feast
          of fat things, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well
          refined. When Alexander's soldier was told to ask what he would, he
          did not ask stintedly after the nature of his own merits, but he made
          such a heavy demand, that the royal treasurer refused to pay it, and
          put the case to Alexander, and Alexander in right kingly sort replied:
          |He knows how great Alexander is, and he has asked as from a king; let
          him have what he requests.| Take heed of imagining that God's thoughts
          are as thy thoughts, and his ways as thy ways. Do not bring before God
          stinted petitions and narrow desires, and say, |Lord, do according to
          these,| but, remember, as high as the heavens are above the earth, so
          high are his ways above your ways, and his thoughts above your
          thoughts, and ask, therefore, after a God-like sort, ask for great
          things, for you are before the throne of grace, for then he would do
          for us exceeding abundantly above what we ask or even think.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, beloved, I may add, in the fifth place, that the right spirit in
          which to approach the throne of grace, is that of unstaggering
          confidence. Who shall doubt the King? Who dares impugn the Imperial
          word? It was well said that if integrity were banished from the hearts
          of all mankind besides, it ought still to dwell in the hearts of
          kings. Shame on a king if he can lie. The veriest beggar in the
          streets is dishonoured by a broken promise, but what shall we say of a
          king if his word cannot be depended upon? Oh, shame upon us, if we are
          unbelieving before the throne of the King of heaven and earth. With
          our God before us in all his glory, sitting on the throne of grace,
          will our hearts dare to say we mistrust him? Shall we imagine either
          that he cannot, or will not, keep his promise? Banished be such
          blasphemous thoughts, and if they must come, let them come upon us
          when we are somewhere in the outskirts of his dominions, if such a
          place there be, but not in prayer, when we are in his immediate
          presence, and behold him in all the glory of his throne of grace.
          There, surely, is the place for the child to trust its Father, for the
          loyal subject to trust his monarch; and, therefore, far from it be all
          wavering or suspicion. Unstaggering faith should be predominant before
          the mercy-seat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only one other remark upon this point, and that is, that if prayer be
          a coming before the throne of God, it ought always to be conducted
          with the deepest sincerity, and in the spirit which makes everything
          real. If you are disloyal enough to despise the King, at least, for
          your own sake, do not mock him to his face, and when he is upon his
          throne. If anywhere you dare repeat holy words without heart, let it
          not be in Jehovah's palace. If a person should ask for audience with
          royalty, and then should say, |I scarce know why I have come, I do not
          know that I have anything very particular to ask; I have no very
          urgent suit to press;| would he not be guilty both of folly and
          baseness? As for our great King, when we venture into his presence,
          let us have an errand there. As I said the other Sabbath, let us
          beware of playing at praying. It is insolence toward God. If I am
          called upon to pray in public, I must not dare to use words that are
          intended to please the ears of my fellow-worshippers, but I must
          realize that I am speaking to God himself, and that I have business to
          transact with the great Lord. And, in my private prayer, if, when I
          rise from my bed in the morning, I bow my knee and repeat certain
          words, or when I retire to rest at night go through the same regular
          form, I rather sin than do anything that is good, unless my very soul
          doth speak unto the Most High. Dost thou think that the King of heaven
          is delighted to hear thee pronounce words with a frivolous tongue, and
          a thoughtless mind? Thou knowest him not. He is a Spirit, and they
          that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. If thou hast
          any empty forms to prate, go and pour them out into the ears of fools
          like thyself, but not before the Lord of Hosts. If thou hast certain
          words to utter, to which thou dost attach a superstitious reverence,
          go and say them in the bedizened courts of the harlot Rome, but not
          before the glorious Lord of Zion. The spiritual God seeks spiritual
          worshipers, and such he will accept, and only such; but the sacrifice
          of the wicked is an abomination unto the Lord, and only a sincere
          prayer is his delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, the gathering up of all our remarks is just this, -- prayer
          is no trifle. It is an eminent and elevated act. It is a high and
          wondrous privilege. Under the old Persian Empire a few of the nobility
          were permitted at any time to come in unto the king, and this was
          thought to be the highest privilege possessed by mortals. You and I,
          the people of God, have a permit, a passport to come before the throne
          of heaven at any time we will, and we are encouraged to come there
          with great boldness; but still let us not forget that it is no mean
          thing to be a courtier in the courts of heaven and earth, to worship
          him who made us and sustains us in being. Truly, when we attempt to
          pray, we may hear the voice saying out of the excellent glory: |Bow
          the knee.| From all the spirits that behold the face of our Father who
          is in heaven, even now, I hear a voice which saith, |Oh, come let us
          worship and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker; for he
          is our God, and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his
          hand. O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness; fear before him
          all the earth.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Lest the glow and brilliance of the word |throne| should be too
          much for mortal vision, our text now presents us with the soft, gentle
          radiance of that delightful word -- |GRACE.| We are called to the
          throne of grace, not to the throne of law. Rocky Sinai once was the
          throne of law, when God came to Paran with ten thousand of his holy
          ones. Who desired to draw near to that throne? Even Israel might not.
          Bounds were set about the mount, and if but a beast touched the mount,
          it was stoned or thrust through with a dart. O ye self-righteous ones
          who hope that you can obey the law, and think that you can be saved by
          it, look to the flames that Moses saw, and shrink, and tremble, and
          despair. To that throne we do not come now, for through Jesus the case
          is changed. To a conscience purged by the precious blood there is no
          anger upon the divine throne, though to our troubled minds --
        </p>
        <p>|Once twas a seat of burning wrath,</p>
        <p>And shot devouring flame;</p>
        <p>Our God appeared consuming fire,</p>
        <p>And jealous was his name.|</p>
        <p>
          And, blessed be God, we are not this morning to speak of the throne of
          ultimate justice. Before that we shall all come, and as many uf us as
          have believed will find it to be a throne of grace as well as of
          justice; for, he who sits upon that throne shall pronounce no sentence
          of condemnation against the man who is justified by faith. But I have
          not to call you this morning to the place from whence the
          resurrection-trumpet shall ring out so shrill and clear. Nor yet do we
          see the angels with their vengeful swords come forth to smite the foes
          of God; not yet are the great doors of the pit opened to swallow up
          the enemies who would not have the Son of God to reign over them. We
          are still on praying ground and pleading terms with God, and the
          throne to which we are bidden to come, and of which we speak at this
          time, is the throne of grace. It is a throne set up on purpose for the
          dispensation of grace; a throne from which every utterance is an
          utterance of grace; the scepter that is stretched out from it is the
          silver sceptre of grace; the decrees proclaimed from it are purposes
          of grace; the gifts that are scattered down its golden steps are gifts
          of grace; and he that sits upon the throne is grace itself. It is the
          throne of grace to which we approach when we pray; and let us for a
          moment or two think this over, by way of consolatory encouragement to
          those who are beginning to pray; indeed, to all of us who are praying
          men and women.
        </p>
        <p>
          If in prayer I come before a throne of grace, then the faults of my
          prayer will be overlooked. In beginning to pray, dear friends, you
          feel as if you did not pray. The groanings of your spirit, when you
          rise from your knees are such that you think there is nothing in them.
          What a blotted, blurred, smeared prayer it is. Never mind; you are not
          come to the throne of justice, else when God perceived the fault in
          the prayer he would spurn it, -- your broken words, your gaspings, and
          stammerings are before a throne of grace. When any one of us has
          presented his best prayer before God, if he saw it as God sees it,
          there is no doubt he would make great lamentation over it; for there
          is enough sin in the best prayer that was ever prayed to secure its
          being cast away from God. But it is not a throne of justice I say
          again, and here is the hope for our lame, limping supplications. Our
          condescending King does not maintain a stately etiquette in his court
          like that which has been observed by princes among men, where a little
          mistake or a flaw would secure the petitioner's being dismissed with
          disgrace. Oh, no; the faulty cries of his children are not severely
          criticized by him. The Lord High Chamberlain of the palace above, our
          Lord Jesus Christ, takes care to alter and amend every prayer before
          he presents it, and he makes the prayer perfect with his perfection,
          and prevalent with His own merits. God looks upon the prayer, as
          presented through Christ, and forgives all its own inherent
          faultiness. How this ought to encourage any of us who feel ourselves
          to be feeble, wandering, and unskillful in prayer. If you cannot plead
          with God as sometimes you did in years gone by, if you feel as if
          somehow or other you had grown rusty in the work of supplication,
          never give over, but come still, yea and come oftener, for it is not a
          throne of severe criticism, it is a throne of grace to which you come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, further, inasmuch as it is a throne of grace, the faults of the
          petitioner himself shall not prevent the success of his prayer. Oh,
          what faults there are in us! To come before a throne how unfit we are
          -- we, that are all defiled with sin within and without! Dare any of
          you think of praying were it not that God's throne is a throne of
          grace? If you could, I confess that I could not. An absolute God,
          infinitely holy and just, could not in consistency with his divine
          nature answer any prayer from such a sinner as I am, were it not that
          he has arranged a plan by which my prayer comes up no longer to a
          throne of absolute justice, but to a throne which is also the
          mercy-seat, the propitiation, the place where God meets sinners,
          through Jesus Christ. Ah, I could not say to you, |Pray,| not even to
          you saints, unless it were a throne of grace, much less could I talk
          of prayer to you sinners; but now I will say this to every sinner
          here, though he should think himself to be the worst sinner that ever
          lived, cry unto the Lord and seek him while he may be found. A throne
          of grace is a place fitted for you: go to your knees; by simple faith
          go to your Saviour, for he, he it is who is the throne of grace. It is
          in him that God is able to dispense grace unto the most guilty of
          mankind. Blessed be God, neither the faults of the prayer nor yet of
          the suppliant shall shut out our petitions from the God who delights
          in broken and contrite hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it be a throne of grace, then the desires of the pleader will be
          interpreted. If I cannot find words in which to utter my desires, God
          in his grace will read my desires without the words. He takes the
          meaning of his saints, the meaning of their groans. A throne that was
          not gracious would not trouble itself to make out our petitions; but
          God, the infinitely gracious One, will dive into the soul of our
          desires, and he will read there what we cannot speak with the tongue.
          Have you never seen the parent, when his child is trying to say
          something to him, and he knows very well what it is the little one has
          got to say, help him over the words and utter the syllables for him,
          and if the little one has half-forgotten what he would say, you have
          seen the father suggest the word: and so the ever-blessed Spirit, from
          the throne of grace, will help us and teach us words, nay, write in
          our hearts the desires themselves. We have in Scripture instances
          where God puts words into sinners' mouths. |Take with you words,|
          saith he, |and say unto him, Receive us graciously and love us
          freely.| He will put the desires, and put the expression of those
          desires into your spirit by his grace; he will direct your desires to
          the things which you ought to seek for; he will teach you your wants,
          though as yet you know them not; he will suggest to you his promises
          that you may be able to plead them; he will, in fact, be Alpha and
          Omega to your prayer, just as he is to your salvation; for as
          salvation is from first to last of grace, so the sinner's approach to
          the throne of grace is of grace from first to last. What comfort is
          this. Will we not, my dear friends, with the greater boldness draw
          near to this throne, as we suck out the sweet meaning of this precious
          word, |the throne of grace|?
        </p>
        <p>
          If it be a throne of grace, then all the wants of those who come to it
          will be supplied. The King from off such a throne will not say, |Thou
          must bring to Me gifts, thou must offer to Me sacrifices.| It is not a
          throne for receiving tribute; it is a throne for dispensing gifts.
          Come, then, ye who are poor as poverty itself; come ye that have no
          merits and are destitute of virtues, come ye that are reduced to a
          beggarly bankruptcy by Adam's fall and by your own transgressions;
          this is not the throne of majesty which supports itself by the
          taxation of its subjects, but a throne which glorifies itself by
          streaming forth like a fountain with floods of good things. Come ye,
          now, and receive the wine and milk which are freely given, yea, come
          buy wine and milk without money and without price. All the
          petitioner's wants shall be supplied, because it is a throne of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so, all the petitioner's miseries shall be compassionated. Suppose
          I come to the throne of grace with the burden of my sins; there is one
          on the throne who felt the burden of sin in ages long gone by, and has
          not forgotten its weight. Suppose I come loaded with sorrow; there is
          One there who knows all the sorrows to which humanity can be
          subjected. Am I depressed and distressed? Do I fear that God himself
          has forsaken me? There is One upon the throne who said, |My God, my
          God, why hast thou forsaken me?| It is a throne from which grace
          delights to look upon the miseries of mankind with tender eye, to
          consider them and to relieve them. Come, then; come, then; come, then,
          ye that are not only poor, but wretched, whose miseries make you long
          for death, and yet dread it. Ye captive ones, come in your chains; ye
          slaves, come with the irons upon your souls; ye who sit in darkness,
          come forth all blindfold as you are. The throne of grace will look on
          you if you cannot look on it, and will give to you, though you have
          nothing to give in return, and will deliver you, though you cannot
          raise a finger to deliver yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          |The throne of grace.| The word grows as I turn it over in my mind,
          and to me it is a most delightful reflection that if I come to the
          throne of God in prayer, I may feel a thousand defects, but yet there
          is hope. I usually feel more dissatisfied with my prayers than with
          anything else I do. I do not believe that it is an easy thing to pray
          in public so as to conduct the devotions of a large congregation
          aright. We sometimes hear persons commended for preaching well, but if
          any shall be enabled to pray well, there will be an equal gift and a
          higher grace in it. But, brethren, suppose in our prayers there should
          be defects of knowledge: it is a throne of grace, and our Father
          knoweth that we have need of these things. Suppose there should be
          defects of faith: he sees our little faith and still doth not reject
          it, small as it is. He doth not in every case measure out his gifts by
          the degree of our faith, but by the sincerity and trueness of faith.
          And if there should be grave defects in our spirit even, and failures
          in the fervency or in the humility of the prayer, still, though these
          should not be there and are much to be deplored; grace overlooks all
          this, forgives all this, and still its merciful hand is stretched out
          to enrich us according to our needs. Surely this ought to induce many
          to pray who have not prayed, and should make us who have been long
          accustomed to use the consecrated art of prayer, to draw near with
          greater boldness than ever to the throne of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But, now regarding our text as a whole, it conveys to us the idea
          of GRACE ENTHRONED. It is a throne, and who sits on it? It is grace
          personified that is here installed in dignity. And, truly, to-day
          grace is on a throne. In the gospel of Jesus Christ grace is the most
          predominant attribute of God. How comes it to be so exalted? We reply,
          well, grace has a throne by conquest. Grace came down to earth in the
          form of the Well-beloved, and it met with sin. Long and sharp was the
          struggle, and grace appeared to be trampled under foot of sin; but
          grace at last seized sin, threw it on its own shoulders, and, though
          all but crushed beneath the burden, grace carried sin up to the cross
          and nailed it there, slew it there, put it to death for ever, and
          triumphed gloriously. For this cause at this hour grace sits on a
          throne, because it has conquered human sin, has borne the penalty of
          human guilt, and overthrown all its enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grace, moreover, sits on the throne because it has established itself
          there by right. There is no injustice in the grace of God. God is as
          just when he forgives a believer as when he casts a sinner into hell.
          I believe in my own soul that there is as much and as pure a justice
          in the acceptance of a soul that believes in Christ as there will be
          in the rejection of those souls who die impenitent, and are banished
          from Jehovah's presence. The sacrifice of Christ has enabled God to be
          just, and yet the justifier of him that believeth. He who knows the
          word |substitution,| and can spell its meaning aright, will see that
          there is nothing due to punitive justice from any believer, seeing
          that Jesus Christ has paid all the believer's debts, and now God would
          be unjust if he did not save those for whom Christ vicariously
          suffered, for whom his righteousness was provided, and to whom it is
          imputed. Grace is on the throne by conquest, and sits there by right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grace is enthroned this day, brethren, because Christ has finished his
          work and gone into the heavens. It is enthroned in power. When we
          speak of its throne, we mean that it has unlimited might. Grace sits
          not on the footstool of God; grace stands not in the courts of God,
          but it sits on the throne; it is the regnant attribute; it is the king
          to-day. This is the dispensation of grace, the year of grace: grace
          reigns through righteousness unto eternal life. We live in the era of
          reigning grace, for seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for the
          sons of men, Jesus is able also to save them to the uttermost that
          come unto God by him. Sinner, if you were to meet grace in the by-way,
          like a traveller on his journey, I would bid you make its acquaintance
          and ask its influence; if you should meet grace as a merchant on the
          exchange, with treasure in his hand, I would bid you court its
          friendship, it will enrich you in the hour of poverty; if you should
          see grace as one of the peers of heaven, highly exalted, I would bid
          you seek to get its ear; but, oh, when grace sits on the throne, I
          beseech you close in with it at once. It can be no higher, it can be
          no greater, for it is written |God is love,| which is an alias for
          grace. Oh, come and bow before it; come and adore the infinite mercy
          and grace of God. Doubt not, halt not, hesitate not. Grace is
          reigning; grace is God; God is love. Oh that you, seeing grace is thus
          enthroned, would come and receive it. I say, then, that grace is
          enthroned by conquest, by right, and by power, and, I will add, it is
          enthroned in glory, for God glorifies his grace. It is one of his
          objects now to make his grace illustrious. He delights to pardon
          penitents, and so to show his pardoning grace; he delights to look
          upon wanderers and restore them, to show his reclaiming grace; he
          delights to look upon the broken-hearted and comfort them, that he may
          show his consoling grace. There is a grace to be had of various kinds,
          or rather the same grace acting different ways, and God delights to
          make his grace glorious. There is a rainbow round about the throne
          like unto an emerald, the emerald of his compassion and his love. O
          happy souls that can believe this, and believing it can come at once
          and glorify grace by becoming instances of its power.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Lastly, our text, if rightly read, has in it SOVEREIGNTY
          RESPLENDENT IN GLORY, -- THE GLORY OF GRACE. The mercy seat is a
          throne; though grace is there, it is still a throne. Grace does not
          displace sovereignty. Now, the attribute of sovereignty is very high
          and terrible; its light is like unto a jasper stone, most precious,
          and like unto a sapphire stone, or, as Ezekiel calls it, |the terrible
          crystal.| Thus saith the King, the Lord of hosts: |I will have mercy
          on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will
          have compassion.| |Who art thou, O man, that repliest against God?
          Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made
          me thus?| |Hath not the potter power over the clay to make of the same
          lump one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour?| These are
          great and terrible words, and are not to be answered. He is a King,
          and he will do as he wills. None shall stay his hand, or say unto him,
          What doest thou? But, ah! lest any of you should be downcast by the
          thought of his sovereignty, I invite you to the text. It is a throne,
          -- there is sovereignty; but to every soul that knows how to pray, to
          every soul that by faith comes to Jesus, the true mercy seat, divine
          sovereignty wears no dark and terrible aspect, but is full of love. It
          is a throne of grace; from which I gather that the sovereignty of God
          to a believer, to a pleader, to one who comes to God in Christ, is
          always exercised in pure grace. To you, to you who come to God in
          prayer, the sovereignty always runs thus: |I will have mercy on that
          sinner; though he deserves it not, though in him there is no merit,
          yet because I can do as I will with my own, I will bless him, I will
          make him my child, I will accept him; he shall be mine in the day when
          I make up my jewels.| On the mercy seat God never executed sovereignty
          otherwise than in a way of grace. He reigns, but in this case grace
          reigns through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our
          Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are these two or three things to be thought of, and I have done.
          On the throne of grace sovereignty has placed itself under bonds of
          love. I must speak with words choice and picked here, and I must
          hesitate and pause to get the right sentences, lest I err while
          endeavouring to speak the truth in plainness. God will do as he wills;
          but, on the mercy seat, he is under bonds -- bonds of his own making,
          for he has entered into covenant with Christ, and so into covenant
          with his chosen. Though God is and ever must be a sovereign, he never
          will break his covenant, not alter the word that is gone out of his
          mouth. He cannot be false to a covenant of his own making. When I come
          to God in Christ, to God on the mercy seat, I need not imagine that by
          any act of sovereignty God will set aside his covenant. That cannot
          be: it is impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, on the throne of grace, God is again bound to us by his
          promises. The covenant contains in it many gracious promises,
          exceeding great and precious. |Ask and it shall be given you; seek and
          ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you.| Until God had
          said that word or a word to that effect, it was at his own option to
          hear prayer or not, but it is not so now; for now, if it be true
          prayer offered through Jesus Christ, his truth binds him to hear it. A
          man may be perfectly free, but the moment he makes a promise, he is
          not free to break it; and the everlasting God wants not to break his
          promise. He delights to fulfil it. He hath declared that all his
          promises are yea and amen in Christ Jesus; but, for our consolation
          when we survey God under the high and terrible aspect of a sovereign,
          we have this to reflect on, that he is under covenant bonds of promise
          to be faithful to the souls that seek him. His throne must be a throne
          of grace to his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, once more, and sweetest thought of all, every covenant promise
          has been endorsed and sealed with blood, and far be it from the
          everlasting God to pour scorn upon the blood of his dear Son. When a
          king has given a charter to a city, he may before have been absolute,
          and there may have been nothing to check his prerogatives, but when
          the city has its charter, then it pleads its rights before the king.
          Even thus God has given to his people a charter of untold blessings,
          bestowing upon them the sure mercies of David. Very much of the
          validity of a charter depends upon the signature and the seal, and, my
          brethren, how sure is the charter of covenant grace. The signature is
          the hand-writing of God himself, and the seal is the blood of the
          Only-begotten. The covenant is ratified with blood, the blood of his
          own dear Son. It is not possible that we can plead in vain with God
          when we plead the blood-sealed covenant, ordered in all things and
          sure. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but the power of the blood of
          Jesus with God can never fail. It speaks when we are silent, and it
          prevails when we are defeated. Better things than that of Abel doth it
          ask for, and its cry is heard. Let us come boldly, for we hear the
          promise in our hearts. When we feel alarmed because of the sovereignty
          of God, let us cheerfully sing --
        </p>
        <p>|The gospel bears my spirit up,</p>
        <p>A faithful and unchanging God</p>
        <p>Lays the foundation for my hope</p>
        <p>In oaths, and promises, and blood.|</p>
        <p>
          May God the Holy Spirit help us to use aright from this time forward
          |the throne of grace.| Amen.
        </p>
        <p>Rome, Dec.7, 1871.</p>
        <p>TO MY BELOVED CHURCH AND FRIENDS IN GENERAL,</p>
        <p>
          Beloved in the Lord, having felt it to be my duty to leave England for
          a short time to prevent a return of my former complaint, I am bound
          gratefully to acknowledge the good hand of the Lord upon me during my
          sojourn abroad. I hope to return in a brief season, so strengthened as
          to continue to labour on for a considerable period without another
          pause. I take this opportunity of thanking my affectionate church and
          kind friends, for their innumerable acts of generous sympathy, in
          aiding our College and Orphanage, and especially for those many
          prayers which were turned to my comfort and healing in my late
          illness, and are the means of my upholding in my ever-growing service
          for the Lord. The Lord return into their bosoms a thousandfold the
          good which faithful friends have implored for me, and make me more
          than ever the means of blessing to them by ministry.

          Just now I implore a renewal of those prayers with increased
          earnestness, for a revival of religion is greatly needed; and it would
          be a sure evidence of its speedy coming, if believers united in prayer
          for it. Already the flame is kindled at the Tabernacle, but it needs
          to be fanned into a mighty conflagration. Our country requires a
          divine visitation, and the promise of it only needs to be pleaded to
          be fulfilled. Brethren, as one man, cry mightily to the God of our
          Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, beseeching him to put his hand
          to the work, and magnify his Son in the eyes of all the people.
          Standing where Satan's seat is, in the midst of ten thousand idols, I
          beseech those who worship God in the spirit to wrestle in prayer for
          times of refreshing, that all lands may know that Jesus Christ is
          Lord. How long shall the name of Jesus be blasphemed by the idolatries
          of Antichrist? It may be that the times of darkness will last till the
          children of light cry out bitterly, day and night, by reason of soul
          anguish. Then will God avenge his own elect, and that speedily.
        </p>

          As I have trodden the Appian way I have rejoiced that Jesus, whom Paul
          preached, is yet alive, and is certain in due season to put down his
          enemies. Already he has desolated the Colosseum where his faithful
          martyrs poured forth their blood; the pagan power has fallen, and so
          also shall the papal, and all other which opposes his kingdom. Let us
          proclaim a spiritual crusade, and set up our banners by redoubled
          prayer. It is certain that supplication produces marvellous results in
          heaven and earth; its power is proven in our own personal experience,
          and throughout the history of the church. Brethren, LET US PRAY.
        </p>
        <p>Yours, for Jesus' sake,</p>
        <p>C.H. SPURGEON.<br /></p>
