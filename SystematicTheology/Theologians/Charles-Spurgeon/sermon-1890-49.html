          Ye know that I said unto you, that none of the souls which go forth
          out of the bodies of men are under the power of death, but that they
          all live and continue to exist, and that there are for them mansions
          and an abode of rest. For the reasoning power of the soul does not
          cease, nor the knowledge, because it is the image of the immortal God.
          For it is not without perceptions, after the manner of the bodily
          frame, which has no perception of that corruption which has acquired
          dominion over it. Recompense, however, and reward it will not receive
          apart from its bodily form, because what it experiences belongs not to
          itself alone, but to the bodily form also in which it dwelt for a
          time. But the disobedient, who have not known God, will then repent
          without avail.
