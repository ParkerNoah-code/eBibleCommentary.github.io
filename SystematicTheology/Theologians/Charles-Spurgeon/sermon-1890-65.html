          Reign of Abgar; Armenia becomes completely tributary to the Romans;
          war with Herod's troops; his brother's son, Joseph, is killed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abgar, son of Archam, ascends the throne in the twentieth year of
          Archavir, king of the Persians. This Abgar was called Avak-air (great
          man), on account of his great gentleness and wisdom, and also on
          account of his size. Not being able to pronounce well, the Greeks and
          the Syrians called him Abgar. In the second year of his reign, all the
          districts of Armenia become tributary to the Romans. A command is
          given by the Emperor Augustus, as we are told in the Gospel of St.
          Luke, to number all the people in every part. Roman commissioners,
          sent for that purpose into Armenia, carried thither the statue of the
          Emperor Augustus, and set it up in all the temples. At this very time,
          our Saviour Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came into the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same period there was trouble between Abgar and Herod: for
          Herod wished that his statue should be erected near to that of Cæsar
          in the temples of Armenia. Abgar withstood this claim. Moreover, Herod
          was but seeking a pretext to attack Abgar: he sent an army of
          Thracians and Germans to make an incursion into the country of the
          Persians, with orders to pass through the territories of Abgar. But
          Abgar, far from submitting to this, resisted, saying that the
          emperor's command was to march the troops into Persia through the
          desert. Herod, indignant, and unable to act by himself, overwhelmed
          with troubles, as a punishment for his wicked conduct towards Christ,
          as Josephus relates, sent his nephew to whom he had given his
          daughter, who had been married in the first instance to Phéror, his
          brother. Herod's lieutenant, at the head of a considerable army,
          hastened to reach Mesopotamia, met Abgar at the camp in the province
          of Pouknan, fell in the combat, and his troops were put to flight.
          Soon afterwards, Herod died: Archelaus, his son, was appointed by
          Augustus ethnarch of Judæa.
