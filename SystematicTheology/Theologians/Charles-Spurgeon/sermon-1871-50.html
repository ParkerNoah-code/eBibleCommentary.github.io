        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1017)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, October 22nd, 1871 by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>"When thou awakest, it shall talk with thee" -- Proverbs 6:22.</p>
        <p>
          IT IS A VERY HAPPY CIRCUMSTANCE when the commandment of our father and
          the law of our mother are also the commandment of God and the law of
          the Lord. Happy are they who have a double force to draw them to the
          right -- the bonds of nature, and the cords of grace. They sin with a
          vengeance who sin both against a father on earth and the great Father
          in heaven, and they exhibit a virulence and a violence of sin who do
          despite to the tender obligations of childhood, as well as to the
          demands of conscience and God. Solomon, in the passage before us,
          evidently speaks of those who find in the parents' law and in God's
          law the same thing, and he admonishes such to bind the law of God
          about their heart, and to tie it about their neck; by which he intends
          inward affection and open avowal. The law of God should be so dear to
          us, that is should be bound about the most vital organ of our being,
          braided about our heart. That which a man carries in his hand he may
          forget and lose, that which he wears upon his person may be torn from
          him, but that which is bound about his heart will remain there as long
          as life remains. We are to love the Word of God with all our heart,
          and mind, and soul, and strength; with the full force of our nature we
          are to embrace it; all our warmest affections are to be bound up with
          it. When the wise man tells us, also, to wear it about our necks, he
          means that we are never to be ashamed of it. No blush is to mantle our
          cheek when we are called Christians; we are never to speak with bated
          breath in any company concerning the things of God. Manfully must we
          take up the cross of Christ; cheerfully must we avow ourselves to
          belong to those who have respect unto the divine testimonies. Let us
          count true religion to be our highest ornament; and, as magistrates
          put upon them their gold chains, and think themselves adorned thereby,
          so let us tie about our neck the commands and the gospel of the Lord
          our God.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order that we may be persuaded so to do, Solomon gives us three
          telling reasons. He says that God's law, by which I understand the
          whole run of Scripture, and, especially the gospel of Jesus Christ,
          will be a guide to us: -- "When thou goest, it shall lead thee." It
          will be a guardian to us: "When thou sleepest" -- when thou art
          defenceless and off thy guard -- "it shall keep thee." And it shall
          also be a dear companion to us: "When thou awakest, it shall talk with
          thee." Any one of these three arguments might surely suffice to make
          us seek a nearer acquaintance with the sacred word. We all need a
          guide, for "it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps." Left
          to our own way, we soon excel in folly. There are dilemmas in all
          lives where a guide is more precious than a wedge of gold. The Word of
          God, as an infallible director for human life, should be sought unto
          by us, and it will lead us in the highway of safety. Equally powerful
          is the second reason: the Word of God will become the guardian of our
          days; whoso hearkeneth unto it shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet
          from fear of evil. Unguarded moments there may be; times, inevitable
          to our imperfection, there will be, when, unless some other power
          protect us, we shall fall into the hands of the foe. Blessed is he who
          has God's law so written on his heart, and wears it about his neck as
          armour of proof, that at all times he is invulnerable, kept by the
          power of God through faith unto salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I prefer, this morning, to keep to the third reason for loving
          God's word. It is this, that is becomes our sweet companion: "When
          thou awakest, it shall talk with thee." The inspired law of God, which
          David in the hundred and nineteenth Psalm calls God's testimonies,
          precepts, statutes, and the like, is the friend of the righteous. Its
          essence and marrow is the gospel of Jesus, the law-fulfiller, and this
          also is the special solace of believers. Of the whole sacred volume it
          may be said, "When thou awakest, it shall talk with thee." I gather
          four or five thoughts from this expression, and upon these we will
          speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. We perceive here that THE WORD IS LIVING. How else could it be
          said: "It shall talk with thee"? A dead book cannot talk, nor can a
          dumb book speak. It is clearly a living book, then, and a speaking
          book: "The word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever." How many
          of us have found this to be most certainly true! A large proportion of
          human books are long ago dead, and even shrivelled like Egyptian
          mummies; the mere course of years has rendered them worthless, their
          teaching is disproved, and they have no life for us. Entomb them in
          your public libraries if you will, but, henceforth, they will stir no
          man's pulse and warm no man's heart. But this thrice blessed book of
          God, though it has been extant among us these many hundreds of years,
          is immortal in its life, unwithering in its strength: the dew of its
          youth is still upon it; its speech still drops as the rain fresh from
          heaven; its truths are overflowing founts of ever fresh consolation.
          Never book spake like this book; its voice, like the voice of God, is
          powerful and full of majesty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whence comes it that the word of God is living? Is it not, first,
          because it is pure truth? Error is death, truth is life. No matter how
          well established an error may be by philosophy, or by force of arms,
          or the current of human thought, the day cometh that shall burn as an
          oven, and all untruth shall be as stubble before the fire. The tooth
          of time devours all lies. Falsehoods are soon cut down, and they
          wither as the green herb. Truth never dies, it dates its origin from
          the immortals. Kindled at the source of light, its fame cannot be
          quenched; if by persecution it be for a time covered, it shall blaze
          forth anew to take reprisals upon its adversaries. Many a once
          venerated system of error now rots in the dead past among the tombs of
          the forgotten; but the truth as it is in Jesus knows no sepulchre, and
          fears no funeral; it lives on, and must live while the Eternal fills
          His throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word of God is living, because it is the utterance of an
          immutable, self-existing God. God doth not speak to-day what He meant
          not yesterday, neither will He to-morrow blot out what He records
          to-day. When I read a promise spoken three thousand years ago, it is
          as fresh as though it fell from the eternal lips to-day. There are,
          indeed, no dates to the Divine promises; they are not of private
          interpretation, nor to be monopolised by any generation. I say again,
          as fresh to-day the eternal word drops from the Almighty's lips as
          when He uttered it to Moses, or to Elias, or spake it by the tongue of
          Esaias or Jeremiah. The word is always sure, steadfast, and full of
          power. It is never out of date. Scripture bubbles up evermore with
          good matters, it is an eternal Geyser, a spiritual Niagara of grace,
          for ever falling, flashing, and flowing on; it is never stagnant,
          never brackish or defiled, but always clear, crystal, fresh, and
          refreshing; so, therefore, ever living.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word lives, again, because it enshrines the living heart of
          Christ. The heart of Christ is the most living of all existences. It
          was once pierced with a spear, but it lives on, and yearns towards
          sinners, and is as tender and compassionate as in the days of the
          Redeemer's flesh. Jesus, the Sinner's Friend, walks in the avenues of
          Scripture as once He traversed the plains and hills of Palestine: you
          can see Him still, if you have opened eyes, in the ancient prophecies;
          you can behold Him more clearly in the devout evangelists; He opens
          and lays bare His inmost soul to you in the epistles, and makes you
          hear the footsteps of His approaching advent in the symbols of the
          Apocalypse. The living Christ is in the book; you behold His face
          almost in every page; and, consequently, it is a book that can talk.
          The Christ of the mount of benedictions speaks in it still; the God
          who said, "Let there be light," gives forth from its pages the same
          divine fiat; while the incorruptible truth, which saturated every line
          and syllable of it when first it was penned, abides therein in full
          force, and preserves it from the finger of decay. "The grass
          withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: but the word of the
          Lord endureth for ever."
        </p>
        <p>
          Over and above all this, the Holy Spirit has a peculiar connection
          with the word of God. I know that He works in the ministries of all
          His servants whom He hath ordained to preach; but for the most part, I
          have remarked that the work of the Spirit of God in men's hearts is
          rather in connection with the texts we quote than with our
          explanations of them. "Depend upon it," says a deeply spiritual
          writer, "it is God's word, not man's comment on it, which saves
          souls." God does save souls by our comment, by still it is true that
          the majority of conversions have been wrought by the agency of a text
          of Scripture. It is the word of God that is living, and powerful, and
          sharper than any two-edged sword. There must be life in it, for by it
          men are born again. As for believers, the Holy Spirit often sets the
          word on a blaze while they are studying it. The letters were at one
          time before us as mere letters, but the Holy Ghost suddenly came upon
          them, and they spake with tongues. The chapter is lowly as the bush at
          Horeb, but the Spirit descends upon it, and lo! it glows with
          celestial splendour, God appearing in the words, so that we feel like
          Moses when he put off his shoes from his feet, because the place
          whereon he stood was holy ground. It is true, the mass of readers
          understand not this, and look upon the Bible as a common book; but if
          they understand it not, as least let them allow the truthfulness of
          our assertion, when we declare that hundreds of times we have as
          surely felt the presence of God in the page of Scripture as ever
          Elijah did when he heard the Lord speaking in a still small voice. The
          Bible has often appeared to us as a temple God, and the posts of its
          doors have moved at the voice of Him that cried, whose train also has
          filled the temple. We have been constrained adoringly to cry, with the
          seraphim. "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God of Hosts." God the Holy
          Spirit vivifies the letter with His presence, and then it is to us a
          living word indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, dear brethren, if these things be so -- and our experience
          certifies them -- let us take care how we trifle with a book which is
          so instinct with life. Might not many of you remember your faults this
          day were we to ask you whether you are habitual students of holy writ?
          Readers of it I believe you are; but are you searchers; for the
          promise is not to those who merely read, but to those who delight in
          the law of the Lord, and meditate therein both day and night. Are you
          sitting at the feet of Jesus, with His word as your school-book? If
          not, remember, though you may be saved, you lacked very much of the
          blessing which otherwise you might enjoy. Have you been backsliding?
          Refresh your soul by meditating in the divine statues, and you will
          say, with David, "Thy word hath quickened me." Are you faint and
          weary? Go and talk with this living book: it will give you back your
          energy, and you shall mount again as with the wings of eagles. But are
          you unconverted altogether? Then I cannot direct you to Bible-reading
          as being the way of salvation, nor speak of it as though it had any
          merit in it; but I would, nevertheless, urge upon you unconverted
          people great reverence for Scripture, an intimate acquaintance with
          its contents, and a frequent perusal of its pages, for it has occurred
          ten thousand times over that when men have been studying the word of
          life, the word has brought life to them. "The entrance of thy word
          giveth light." Like Elijah and the dead child, the word has stretched
          itself upon them, and their dead souls have been made to live. One of
          the likeliest places in which to find Christ is in the garden of the
          Scriptures, for there He delights to walk. As of old, the blind men
          were wont to sit by the wayside begging, so that, if Jesus passed by,
          they might cry to Him, so would I have you sit down by the wayside of
          the Holy Scriptures. Hear the promises, listen to their gracious
          words; they are the footsteps of the Saviour; and, as you hear them,
          may you be led to cry, "Thou Son of David, have mercy upon me!" Attend
          most those ministries which preach God's Word most. Do not select
          those that are fullest of fine speaking, and that dazzle you with
          expressions which are ornamental rather than edifying; but get to a
          ministry that is full of God's own Word, and, above all, learn God's
          Word itself. Read it with a desire to know its meaning, and I am
          persuaded that, thereby, many of you who are now far from God will be
          brought near to him, and led to a saving faith in Jesus, for "the Word
          of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul." "Faith cometh by
          hearing, and hearing by the word of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. If the text says, "When thou awakest, it shall talk with thee,"
          then it is clear THE WORD IS PERSONAL. "It shall talk with thee." It
          is not written, "It shall speak to the air, and thou shalt hear its
          voice," but, "It shall talk with thee." You know exactly what the
          expression means. I am not exactly talking with any one of you this
          morning; there are too many of you, and I am but one; but, when you
          are on the road home, each one will talk with his fellow: then it is
          truly talk when man speaks to man. Now, the word of God has the
          condescending habit of talking to men, speaking personally to them;
          and, herein, I desire to commend the word of God to your love. Oh!
          that you might esteem it very precious for this reason!
        </p>
        <p>
          "It shall talk with thee," that is to say, God's word talks about men,
          and about modern men; it speaks of ourselves, and of these latter
          days, as precisely as if it had only appeared this last week. Some go
          to the word of God with the idea that they shall find historical
          information about the ancient ages, and so they will, but that is not
          the object of the Word. Others look for facts upon geology, and great
          attempts have been made either to bring geology round to Scripture, or
          Scripture to geology. We may always rest assured that truth never
          contradicts itself; but, as nobody knows anything yet about geology --
          for its theory is a dream and an imagination altogether -- we will
          wait till the philosophers settle their own private matters, being
          confident that when they find out the truth, it will be quite
          consistent with what God has revealed. At any rate, we may leave that.
          The main teachings of Holy Scripture are about men, about the Paradise
          of unfallen manhood, the fall, the degeneracy of the race, and the
          means of its redemption. The book speaks of victims and sacrifices,
          priests and washings, and so points us to the divine plan by which man
          can be elevated from the fall and be reconciled to God. Read Scripture
          through, and you shall find that its great subject is that which
          concerns the race as to their most important interests. It is a book
          that talks, talks personally, for it deals with things not in the
          moon, nor in the planet Jupiter, nor in the distant ages long gone by,
          nor does it say much of the periods yet to come, but it deals with us,
          with the business of to-day; how sin may be to-day forgiven, and our
          souls brought at once into union with Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, this book is so personal, that it speaks to men in all
          states and conditions before God. How it talks to sinners -- talks, I
          say, for its puts it thus: "Come, now, and let us reason together;
          though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as wool; though they be
          red like crimson, they shall be as snow." It has many very tender
          expostulations for sinners. It stoops to their condition and position.
          If they will not stoop to God, it makes, as it were, eternal mercy
          stoop to them. It talks of feasts of fat things, of fat things full of
          marrow; and the book, as it talks, reasons with men's hunger, and bids
          them eat and be satisfied. In all conditions into which the sinner can
          be cast, there is a word that precisely meets his condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, certainly, when we become the children of God the book talks with
          us wondrously. In the family of heaven it is the child's own book. We
          no sooner know our Father than this dear book comes at once as a love
          letter from the far-off country, signed with our own Father's hand,
          and perfumed with our Father's love. If we grow in grace, or if we
          backslide, in either case Scripture still talks with us. Whatever our
          position before the eternal God, the book seems to be written on
          purpose to meet that position. It talks to you as you are, not only as
          you should be, or as others have been, but with you, with you
          personally, about your present condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have you never noticed how personal the book is as to all your states
          of mind, in reference to sadness or to joy? There was a time with some
          of us when we were very gloomy and sore depressed, and then the book
          of Job mourned to the same dolorous tune. I have turned over the
          Lamentations of Jeremiah wrote. It mourns unto us when we lament. On
          the other hand, when the soul gets up to the exceeding high mountains,
          to the top of Amana and Lebanon, when we behold visions of glory, and
          see our Beloved face to face, lo! The word is at our side, and in the
          delightful language of the Psalms, or in the yet sweeter expressions
          of the Song of Solomon, it tells us all that is in our heart, and
          talks to us as a living thing that has been in the deeps, and has been
          on the heights, that has known the overwhelmings of affliction, and
          has rejoiced in the triumphs of delight. The word of God is to me my
          own book: I have no doubt, brother, it is the same to you. There could
          not be a Bible that suited me better: it seems written on purpose for
          me. Dear sister, have not you often felt as you have put your finger
          on a promise, "Ah, that is my promise; if there be no other soul whose
          tearful eyes can bedew that page and say, It is mine,' yet I, a poor
          afflicted one, can do so!" Oh, yes; the book is very personal, for it
          goes into all the details of our case, let our state be what it may.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, how very faithful it always is. You never find the word of God
          keeping back that which is profitable to you. Like Nathan it cries,
          "Thou art the man." It never allows our sins to go unrebuked, nor our
          backslidings to escape notice till they grow into overt sin. It gives
          us timely notice; it cries to us as soon as we begin to go aside,
          "Awake thou that sleepest," "Watch and pray," "Keep thine heart with
          all diligence," and a thousand other words of warning does it address
          personally to each one of us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I would suggest, before I leave this point, a little
          self-examination as healthful for each of us. Does the word of God
          after this fashion speak to my soul? Then it is a gross folly to lose
          by generalisations that precious thing which can only be realised by a
          personal grasp. How sayest thou, dear hearer? Dost thou read the book
          for thyself, and does the book speak to thee? Has it ever condemned
          thee, and has thou trembled before the word of God? Has it ever
          pointed thee to Christ, and has thou looked to Jesus the incarnate
          Saviour? Does the book now seal, as with the witness of the Spirit,
          the witness of thine own spirit that thou art born of God? Art thou in
          the habit of going to the book to know thine own condition, to see
          thine own face as in a glass? Is it thy family medicine? Is it thy
          test and tell-tale to let thee know thy spiritual condition? Oh, do
          not treat the book otherwise than this, for if thou dost thus unto it,
          and takest it to be thy personal friend, happy art thou, since God
          will dwell with the man that trembles at His word; but, if you treat
          it as anybody's book rather than your own, then beware, lest you be
          numbered with the wicked who despise God's statutes.

          III. From the text we learn that HOLY SCRIPTURE IS VERY FAMILIAR.
          "When thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. To talk signifies
          fellowship, communion, familiarity. It does not say, "It shall preach
          to thee." Many persons have a high esteem for the book, but they look
          upon it as though it were some very elevated teacher speaking to them
          from a lofty tribunal, while they stand far below. I will not
          altogether condemn that reverence, but it were far better if they
          would understand the familiarity of God's word; it does not so much
          preach to us as talk to us. It is not, "When thou awakest, it shall
          lecture thee," or, it shall scold thee;" no, no, "it shall talk with
          thee." We sit at its feet, or rather at the feet of Jesus, in the
          Word, and it comes down to us; it is familiar with us, as a man
          talketh to his friend. And here let me remind you of the delightful
          familiarity of Scripture in this respect that it speaks the language
          of men. If God had written us a book in His own language, we could not
          have comprehended it, or what little we understood would have so
          alarmed us, that we should have besought that those words should not
          be spoken to us any more; but the Lord, in His Word, often uses
          language which, though it be infallibly true in its meaning, is not
          after the knowledge of God, but according to the manner of man. I mean
          this, that the word uses similes and analogies of which we may say
          that they speak humanly, and not according to the absolute truth as
          God Himself sees it. As men conversing with babes use their broken
          speech, so doth the condescending word. It is not written in the
          celestial tongue, but in the patois of this lowland country,
          condescending to men of low estate. It feeds us on bread broken down
          to our capacity, "food convenient for us". It speaks of God's arm, His
          hand, His finger, His wings, and even of His feathers. Now, all this
          is familiar picturing, to meet our childish capacities; for the
          Infinite One is not to be conceived of as though such similitudes were
          literal facts. It is an amazing instance of divine love, that He puts
          those things so that we may be helped to grasp sublime truths. Let us
          thank the Lord of the word for this.
        </p>
        <p>
          How tenderly Scripture comes down to simplicity. Suppose the sacred
          volume had all been like the book of the prophet Ezekiel, small would
          have been its service to the generality of mankind. Imagine that the
          entire volume had been as mysterious as the Book of Revelation: it
          might have been our duty to study it, but if its benefit depended upon
          our understanding it, wew should have failed to attain it. But how
          simple are the gospels, how plain these words, "He that believeth and
          is baptised shall be saved"; how deliciously clear those parables
          about the lost piece of money, the lost sheep, and the prodigal son.
          Wherever the word touches upon vital points, it is as bright as a
          sunbeam. Mysteries there are, and profound doctrines, deeps where
          Leviathan can swim; but, where it has to do immediately with what
          concerns us for eternity, it is so plain that the babe in grace may
          safely wade in its refreshing streams. In the gospel narrative the
          wayfaring man, though a fool, need not err. It is familiar talk; it is
          God's great mind brought down to our littleness, that it may lift us
          up.
        </p>
        <p>
          How familiar the book is too -- I speak now as to my own feelings --
          as to all that concerns us. It talks about my flesh, and my
          corruptions, and my sins, as only one that knew me could speak. It
          talks of my trials in the wisest way; some, I dare not tell, it knows
          all about. It talks about my difficulties; some would sneer at them
          and laugh, but this book sympathises with them, knows my tremblings,
          and my fears, and my doubts, and all the storm that rages within the
          little world of my nature. The book has been through all my
          experience; somehow or other it maps it all out, and talks with me as
          if it were a fellow-pilgrim. It does not speak to me unpractically,
          and scold me, and look down on me from an awful height of stern
          perfection, as if it were an angel, and could no sympathise with
          fallen men; but like the Lord whom it reveals, the book seems as if it
          were touched with a feeling of my infirmities, and had been tempted in
          all points like as I am. Have you not often wondered at the human
          utterances of the divine word: it thunders like God and yet weeps like
          man. It seems impossible that anything should be too little for the
          word of God to notice, or too bitter, or even too sinful for that book
          to overlook. It touches humanity at all points. Everywhere it is a
          personal, familiar acquaintance, and seems to say to itself, "Shall I
          hide this thing from Abraham my friend?"
        </p>
        <p>
          And, how often the book has answered enquiries! I have been amazed in
          times of difficulties to see how plain the oracle is. You have asked
          friends, and they could not advise you; but you have gone to your
          knees, and God has told you. You have questioned, and you have
          puzzled, and you have tried to elucidate the problem, and lo! In the
          chapter read at morning prayer, or in a passage of Scripture that lay
          open before you, the direction has been given. Have we not seen a
          text, as it were, plume its wings, and fly from the word like a
          seraph, and touch our lips with a live altar coal? It lay like a
          slumbering angel amidst the beds of spices of the sacred word, but it
          received a divine mission, and brought consolation and instruction to
          your heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word of God, then, talks with us in the sense of being familiar
          with us. Do we understand this? I will close this point by another
          word of application. Who, then, that finds God's word so dear and kind
          a friend would spurn or neglect it? If any of you have despised it,
          what shall I say to you? If it were a dreary book, written within and
          without with curses and lamentations, whose every letter flashed with
          declarations of vengeance, I might see some reason why we should not
          read it; but, O precious, priceless companion, dear friend of all my
          sorrows, making my bed in my sickness, the light of my darkness, and
          the joy of my soul, how can I forget thee -- how can I forsake thee? I
          have heard of one who said that the dust on some men's Bibles lay
          there so thick and long that you might write "Damnation" on it. I am
          afraid that such is that case with some of you. Mr. Rogers, of Dedham,
          on one occasion, after preaching about the preciousness of the Bible,
          took it away from the front of the pulpit, and, putting it down behind
          him, pictured God as saying, "You do not read the book: you do not
          care about it; I will take it back -- you shall not be wearied with it
          any more." And then he portrayed the grief of wise men's hearts when
          they found the blessed revelation withdrawn from men; and how they
          would besiege the throne of grace, day and night, to ask it back. I am
          sure he spoke the truth. Though we too much neglect it, yet ought we
          to prize it beyond all price, for, if it were taken from us, we should
          have lost our kindest comforter in the hour of need. God grant us to
          love the Scriptures more!
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Fourthly, and with brevity, our text evidently shows that THE WORD
          IS RESPONSIVE. "When thou awakest, it shall talk with thee," not to
          thee. Now, talk with a man is not all on one side. To talk with a man
          needs answering talk from him. You have both of you something to say
          when you talk together. It is a conversation to which each one
          contributes his part. Now, Scripture is a marvellously conversational
          book; it talks, and makes men talk. It is ever ready to respond to us.
          Suppose you go to the Scriptures in a certain state of spiritual life:
          you must have noticed, I think, that the word answer to that state. If
          you are dark and gloomy, it will appear as though it had put itself in
          mourning, so that it might lament with you. When you are on the
          dunghill, there sits Scripture, with dust and ashes on its head,
          weeping side by side with you, and not upbraiding like Job's miserable
          comforters. But suppose you come to the book with gleaming eyes of
          joy, you will hear it laugh; it will sing and play to you as with
          psaltery and harp, it will bring forth the high-sounding cymbals.
          Enter its goodly land in a happy state, and you shall go forth with
          you and be led forth with peace, its mountains and its hills shall
          break before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall
          clap their hands. As in water the face is reflected, so in the living
          stream of revealed truth a man sees his own image.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you come to Holy Scripture with growth in grace, and with
          aspirations for yet higher attainments, the book grows with you, grows
          upon you. It is ever beyond you, and cheerily cries, "Higher yet;
          Excelsior!" Many books in my library are now behind and beneath me; I
          read them years ago, with considerable pleasure; I have read them
          since, with disappointment; I shall never read them again, for they
          are of no service to me. They were good in their way once, and so were
          the clothes I wore when I was ten years old; but I have outgrown them
          I know more than these books know, and know wherein they are faulty.
          Nobody ever outgrows Scripture; the book widens and deepens with our
          years. It is true, it cannot really grow, for it is perfect; but it
          does so to our apprehension. The deeper you dig into Scripture, the
          more you find that it is a great abyss of truth. The beginner learns
          four or five points of orthodoxy, and says, "I understand the gospel,
          I have grasped all the Bible." Wait a bit, and when his soul grows and
          knows more of Christ, he will confess, "Thy commandment is exceeding
          broad, I have only begun to understand it."
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one thing about God's word which shows its responsiveness to
          us, and that is when you reveal your heart to it, it reveals its heart
          to you. If, as you read the word, you say, "O blessed truth, thou art
          indeed realised in my experience; come thou still further into my
          heart. I give up my prejudices, I assign myself, like the wax, to be
          stamped with thy seal," -- when you do that, and open your heart to
          Scripture, Scripture will open its heart to you; for it has secrets
          which it does not tell to the casual reader, it has precious things of
          the everlasting hills which can only be discovered by miners who know
          how to dig and open the secret places, and penetrate great veins of
          everlasting riches. Give thyself up to the Bible, and the Bible will
          give itself up to thee. Be candid with it, and honest with thy soul,
          and the Scripture will take down its golden key, and open one door
          after another, and show to thy astonished gaze ingots of silver which
          thou couldst not weigh, and heaps of gold which thou couldst not
          measure. Happy is that man who, in talking with the Bible, tells it
          all his heart, and learns the secret of the Lord which is with them
          that fear Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And how, too, if you love the bible and talk out your love to it, the
          Bible will love you! Its wisdom says, "I love them that love me."
          Embrace the word of God, and the word of God embraces you at once.
          When you prize its every letter, then it smiles upon you graciously,
          greets you with many welcomes, and treats you as an honoured guest. I
          am always sorry to be on bad terms with the Bible, for then I must be
          on bad terms with God. Whenever my creed does not square with God's
          word, I think it is time to mould my creed into another form. As for
          God's words, they must not be touched with hammer or axe. Oh, the
          chiselling, and cutting, and hammering in certain commentaries to make
          God's Bible orthodox and systematic! How much better to leave it
          alone! The word is right, and we are wrong, wherein we agree not with
          it. The teachings of God's word are infallible, and must be reverenced
          as such. Now, when you love it so well that you would not touch a
          single line of it, and prize it so much that you would even die for
          the defence of one of its truths, then, as it is dear to you, you will
          be dear to it, and it will grasp you and unfold itself to you as it
          does not to the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear brethren and sisters, I must leave this point, but it shall be
          with this remark -- Do you talk to God? Does God talk to you? Does
          your heart go up to heaven, and does His Word come fresh from heaven
          to your soul? If not, you do not know the experience of the living
          child of God, and I can earnestly pray you may. May you this day be
          brought to see Christ Jesus in the word, to see a crucified Saviour
          there, and to put your trust in Him, and then, from this day forward,
          the word will echo to your heart -- it will respond to your emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Lastly, SCRIPTURE IS INFLUENTIAL. That I gather from the fact that
          Solomon says, "When thou wakest, it shall talk with thee"; and follows
          it up with the remark that it keeps man from the strange woman, and
          from other sins which he goes on to mention. When the word of God
          talks with us, it influences us. All talk influences more or less. I
          believe there more done in this world for good or bad by talk than
          there is by preaching; indeed, the preacher preaches best when he
          talks; there is no oratory in the world that is equal to simple talk;
          it is the model of eloquence; and all your rhetorician's action and
          verbiage are so much rubbish. The most efficient way of preaching is
          simply talking; the man permitting his heart to run over at his lips
          into other men's hearts. Now, this book, as it talks with us,
          influences us, and it does so in many ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          It soothes our sorrows, and encourages us. Many a warrior has been
          ready to steal away from God's battle, but the word has laid its hand
          on him, and said, "Stand on thy feet, be not discouraged, be of good
          cheer, I will strengthen thee, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold
          thee with the right hand of my righteousness." Brave saints we have
          read of, but we little know how often they would have been arrant
          cowards only the good word came and strengthened them, and they went
          back to be stronger than lions and swifter than eagles.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the book thus soothes and cheers, it has a wonderfully elevating
          power. How you never felt it put fresh life-blood into you? You have
          thought, "How can I continue to live at such a dying rate as I have
          lived, something nobler must I gain?" Read that part of the word which
          tells of the agonies of your Master, and you will feel --
        </p>
        <p>"Now for the love I bear His name,</p>
        <p>What was my gain I count my loss;</p>
        <p>My former pride I call my shame,</p>
        <p>And nail my glory to His cross."</p>
        <p>
          Read of the glories of heaven which this book reveals, and you will
          feel that you can run the race with quickened speed, because a crown
          so bright is glittering in your view. Nothing can so lift a man above
          the gross considerations of carnal gain or human applause as to have
          his soul saturated with the spirit of truth. It elevates as well as
          cheers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, too, how often it warns and restrains. I had gone to the right
          or to the left if the law of the Lord had not said, "Let thine eyes
          look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          This book's consecrated talk sanctifies and moulds the mind into the
          image of Christ. You cannot expect to grow in grace if you do not read
          the Scriptures. If you are not familiar with the word, you cannot
          expect to become like Him that spake it. Our experience is, as it
          were, the potter's wheel on which we revolve; and the hand of God is
          in the Scriptures to mould us after the fashion and image which He
          intends to bring us to. Oh, be much with the holy word of God, and you
          will be holy. Be much with the silly novels of the day, and the
          foolish trifles of the hour, and you will degenerate into vapid
          wasters of your time; but be much with the solid teaching of God's
          word, and you will become solid and substantial men and women: drink
          them in, and feed upon them, and they shall produce in you a
          Christ-likeness, at which the world shall stand astonished.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, let the Scripture talk with you, and it will confirm and
          settle you. We hear every now and then of apostates from the gospel.
          hey must have been little taught in the truth as it is in Jesus. A
          great outcry is made, every now and then, about our all being
          perverted to Rome. I was assured the other day by a good man with a
          great deal of alarm, that all England was going over to Popery. I told
          him I did not know what kind of God he worshipped, but my God was a
          good deal bigger than the devil, and did not intend to let the devil
          have his way after all, and that I was not half as much afraid of the
          Pope at Rome as of the Ritualists at home. But mark it, there is some
          truth in these fears. There will be a going over to one form of error
          or another unless there be in the Christian church a more honest,
          industrious, and general reading of Holy Scripture. What if I were to
          say most of you church members do not read your Bibles, should I be
          slandering you? You hear on Sabbath day a chapter read, and you
          perhaps read a passage at family prayer, but a very large number never
          read the Bible privately for themselves, they take their religion out
          of the monthly magazine, or accept it from the minister's lips. Oh,
          for the Berean spirit back again, to search the Scriptures whether
          these things be so. I would like to see a huge pile of all the book,
          good and bad that were ever written, prayer-books, and sermons, and
          hymn-books, and all, smoking like Sodom of old, if the reading of
          those books keeps you away from the reading of the Bible; for a ton
          weight of human literature is not worth an ounce of Scripture; one
          single drop of the essential tincture of the word of God is better
          than a sea full of our commenting and sermonisings, and the like. The
          word, the simple, pure, infallible word of God, we must live upon if
          we are to become strong against error, and tenacious of truth.
          Brethren, may you be estalished in the faith rooted, grounded, built
          up; but I know you cannot be except ye search the Scriptures
          continually.
        </p>
        <p>
          The time is coming when we shall all fall asleep in death. Oh, how
          blessed it will be to find when we awake that the word of God will
          talk with us then, and remember its ancient friendship. Then the
          promise which we loved before shall be fulfilled; the charming
          intimations of a blessed future shall be all realised, and the face of
          Christ, whom we saw as through a glass darkly, shall be all uncovered,
          and He shall shine upon us as the sun in its strength. God grant us to
          love the word, and feed thereon, and the Lord shall have the glory for
          ever and ever. Amen and amen.
