          1. We may subvert their doctrine as to transmigration from body to
          body by this fact, that souls remember nothing whatever of the events
          which took place in their previous states of existence. For if they
          were sent forth with this object, that they should have experience of
          every kind of action, they must of necessity retain a remembrance of
          those things which have been previously accomplished, that they might
          fill up those in which they were still deficient, and not by always
          hovering, without intermission, round the same pursuits, spend their
          labour wretchedly in vain (for the mere union of a body [with a soul]
          could not altogether extinguish the memory and contemplation of those
          things which had formerly been experienced ), and especially as they
          came [into the world] for this very purpose. For as, when the body is
          asleep and at rest, whatever things the soul sees by herself, and does
          in a vision, recollecting many of these, she also communicates them to
          the body; and as it happens that, when one awakes, perhaps after a
          long time, he relates what he saw in a dream, so also would he
          undoubtedly remember those things which he did before he came into
          this particular body. For if that which is seen only for a very brief
          space of time, or has been conceived of simply in a phantasm, and by
          the soul alone, through means of a dream, is remembered after she has
          mingled again with the body, and been dispersed through all the
          members, much more would she remember those things in connection with
          which she stayed during so long a time, even throughout the whole
          period of a bypast life.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. With reference to these objections, Plato, that ancient Athenian,
          who also was the first to introduce this opinion, when he could not
          set them aside, invented the [notion of] a cup of oblivion, imagining
          that in this way he would escape this sort of difficulty. He attempted
          no kind of proof [of his supposition], but simply replied dogmatically
          [to the objection in question], that when souls enter into this life,
          they are caused to drink of oblivion by that demon who watches their
          entrance [into the world], before they effect an entrance into the
          bodies [assigned them]. It escaped him, that [by speaking thus] he
          fell into another greater perplexity. For if the cup of oblivion,
          after it has been drunk, can obliterate the memory of all the deeds
          that have been done, how, O Plato, dost thou obtain the knowledge of
          this fact (since thy soul is now in the body), that, before it entered
          into the body, it was made to drink by the demon a drug which caused
          oblivion? For if thou hast a remembrance of the demon, and the cup,
          and the entrance [into life], thou oughtest also to be acquainted with
          other things; but if, on the other hand, thou art ignorant of them,
          then there is no truth in the story of the demon, nor in the cup of
          oblivion prepared with art.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In opposition, again, to those who affirm that the body itself is
          the drug of oblivion, this observation may be made: How, then, does it
          come to pass, that whatsoever the soul sees by her own
          instrumentality, both in dreams and by reflection or earnest mental
          exertion, while the body is passive, she remembers, and reports to her
          neighbours? But, again, if the body itself were [the cause of]
          oblivion, then the soul, as existing in the body, could not remember
          even those things which were perceived long ago either by means of the
          eyes or the ears; but, as soon as the eye was turned from the things
          looked at, the memory of them also would undoubtedly be destroyed. For
          the soul, as existing in the very [cause of] oblivion, could have no
          knowledge of anything else than that only which it saw at the present
          moment. How, too, could it become acquainted with divine things, and
          retain a remembrance of them while existing in the body, since, as
          they maintain, the body itself is [the cause of] oblivion? But the
          prophets also, when they were upon the earth, remembered likewise, on
          their returning to their ordinary state of mind, whatever things they
          spiritually saw or heard in visions of heavenly objects, and related
          them to others. The body, therefore, does not cause the soul to forget
          those things which have been spiritually witnessed; but the soul
          teaches the body, and shares with it the spiritual vision which it has
          enjoyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. For the body is not possessed of greater power than the soul, since
          indeed the former is inspired, and vivified, and increased, and held
          together by the latter; but the soul possesses and rules over the
          body. It is doubtless retarded in its velocity, just in the exact
          proportion in which the body shares in its motion; but it never loses
          the knowledge which properly belongs to it. For the body may be
          compared to an instrument; but the soul is possessed of the reason of
          an artist. As, therefore, the artist finds the idea of a work to
          spring up rapidly in his mind, but can only carry it out slowly by
          means of an instrument, owing to the want of perfect pliability in the
          matter acted upon, and thus the rapidity of his mental operation,
          being blended with the slow action of the instrument, gives rise to a
          moderate kind of movement [towards the end contemplated]; so also the
          soul, by being mixed up with the body belonging to it, is in a certain
          measure impeded, its rapidity being blended with the body's slowness.
          Yet it does not lose altogether its own peculiar powers; but while, as
          it were, sharing life with the body, it does not itself cease to live.
          Thus, too, while communicating other things to the body, it neither
          loses the knowledge of them, nor the memory of those things which have
          been witnessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. If, therefore, the soul remembers nothing of what took place in a
          former state of existence, but has a perception of those things which
          are here, it follows that she never existed in other bodies, nor did
          things of which she has no knowledge, nor [once] knew things which she
          cannot [now mentally] contemplate. But, as each one of us receives his
          body through the skilful working of God, so does he also possess his
          soul. For God is not so poor or destitute in resources, that He cannot
          confer its own proper soul on each individual body, even as He gives
          it also its special character. And therefore, when the number [fixed
          upon] is completed, [that number] which He had predetermined in His
          own counsel, all those who have been enrolled for life [eternal] shall
          rise again, having their own bodies, and having also their own souls,
          and their own spirits, in which they had pleased God. Those, on the
          other hand, who are worthy of punishment, shall go away into it, they
          too having their own souls and their own bodies, in which they stood
          apart from the grace of God. Both classes shall then cease from any
          longer begetting and being begotten, from marrying and being given in
          marriage; so that the number of mankind, corresponding to the
          fore-ordination of God, being completed, may fully realize the scheme
          formed by the Father. <br />
