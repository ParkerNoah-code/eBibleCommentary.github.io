          This psalm contains an exhortation to praise God, an exhortation which
          is directed not only to the Jews, but to all nations. We must infer
          from this, that it has reference to the kingdom of Christ. God's name
          could not be called upon in any other part of the world than Judea,
          until it had been revealed; and the heathen nations were at that time
          necessarily altogether incapacitated for any such exercise. Yet it is
          evident that the Holy Spirit stirred up the saints who were under the
          Law to celebrate the Divine praises, till the period should arrive
          when Christ, by the spread of the Gospel, should fill the whole earth
          with his glory.<br />
