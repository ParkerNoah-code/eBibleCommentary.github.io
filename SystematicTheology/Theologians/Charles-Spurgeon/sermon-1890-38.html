          Of the case of any one bringing forward a charge in passion, or
          failing to prove his allegations.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, then, any one in passion brings a charge rashly against any one,
          mere abuse is not to be taken for an accusation. But a certain time
          being allowed for dealing with the matter, the person should profess
          his ability in writing to prove what he has alleged in passion; so
          that, if he should happen to think better of the things he uttered in
          passion, and decline to repeat or write them, the person may not be
          held as charged with the crime. Every one, therefore, who adduces a
          charge, ought to state in writing his ability to prove it. And,
          indeed, a cause should always be dealt with in the place where the
          charge is admitted; and the man who fails to substantiate his
          allegation, should himself bear the penalty which he advanced.
