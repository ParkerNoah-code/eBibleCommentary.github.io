        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.111)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, January 4, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>"Mighty to save." -- Isaiah 63:1.</p>
        <p>
          THIS, of course, refers to our blessed Lord Jesus Christ, who is
          described as "coming from Edom with dyed garments from Bozrah," and
          who, when it is questioned who he is, replies, "I that speak in
          righteousness, mighty to save." It will be well, then, at the
          commencement of our discourse to make one or two remarks concerning
          the mysteriously complex person of the man and God whom we call our
          Redeemer, Jesus Christ our Saviour. It is one of the mysteries of the
          Christian religion, that we are taught to believe that Christ is God,
          and yet a man. According to Scripture, we hold that he is "very God,"
          equal and co-eternal with the Father, possessing, as his Father doth,
          all divine attributes in an infinite degree. He participated with his
          Father in all the acts of his divine might; he was concerned in the
          decree of election, in the fashioning of the covenant; in the creation
          of the angels, in the making of the world, when it was wheeled from
          nothing into space, and in the ordering of this fair frame of nature.
          Before any of these acts the divine Redeemer was the eternal Son of
          God. "From everlasting to everlasting he is God." Nor did he cease to
          be God when he became man. He was equally "God over all, blessed for
          evermore," when he was "the man of sorrows, acquainted with grief," as
          before his incarnation. We have abundant proof of that in the constant
          affirmations of Scripture, and, indeed, also in the miracles which he
          wrought. The raising of the dead, the treading of the billows of the
          ocean, the hushing of the winds and the rending of the rocks, with all
          those marvellous acts of his, which we have not time here to mention,
          were strong and potent proofs that he was God, most truly God, even
          when he condescended to be man. And Scripture, most certainly teaches
          us, that he is God now, that he shares the throne of his Father --
          that he sits "high above all principalities and powers, and every name
          that is named," and is the true and proper object of the veneration,
          the worship, and the homage of all worlds. We are equally taught to
          believe that he is man. Scripture informs us that, on a day appointed,
          he came from heaven and did become man as well as God, taking upon
          himself the nature of a babe in the manager in Bethlehem. From that
          babe, we are told, he did grow to the stature of manhood, and became
          "bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh," in everything except our
          sin. His sufferings, his hunger, above all, his death and burial, are
          strong proofs that he was man, most truly man; and yet it is demanded
          of us by the Christians religion, to believe, that while he was man he
          was most truly God. We are taught that he was a "child born, a son
          given," and yet, at the same time, the "Wonderful, the Counsellor, the
          mighty God, the everlasting Father." Whosoever would have clear and
          right view of Jesus, must not mingle his natures. We must not consider
          him as a God diluted into deified manhood, or as a mere man officially
          exalted to the Godhead, but as being two distinct natures in one
          person; not God melted into man, nor man made into God, but man and
          God taken into union together. Therefore, do we trust in him, as the
          Daysman, the Mediator, Son of God, and Son of Man. This is the person
          who is our Saviour. It is this glorious, yet mysterious being, of whom
          the text speaks, when it says, he is mighty -- "mighty to save."
        </p>
        <p>
          That he is mighty we need not inform you; for as readers of the
          Scriptures you all believe in the might and majesty of the Incarnate
          Son of God. You believe him to be the Regent of providence, the King
          of death, the Conqueror of hell, the Lord of angels, the Master of
          storms, and the God of battles, and, therefore, you can need no proof
          that he is mighty. The subject of this morning is one part of his
          mightiness. He is "mighty to save." May God the Holy Spirit help us in
          briefly entering upon this subject, and make use of it to the
          salvation of our souls!
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we shall consider what is meant by the words "to save;"
          secondly, how we prove the fact that he is "mighty to save;", thirdly,
          the reason why he is "mighty to save;" and then, fourthly, the
          inferences which are to be deduced from the doctrine that Jesus Christ
          is "mighty to save."
        </p>
        <p>I. First, then, WHAT ARE WE TO UNDERSTAND BY THE WORDS "TO SAVE?"</p>
        <p>
          Commonly, most men, when they read these words, consider them to mean
          salvation from hell. They are partially correct, but the notion is
          highly defective. It is true Christ does save men from the penalty of
          their guilt; he does take those to heaven who deserve the eternal
          wrath and displeasure of the Most High; it is true that he does blot
          out "iniquity, transgression, and sin," and that the iniquities of the
          remnant of his people are passed over for the sake of his blood and
          atonement. But that is not the whole meaning of the words "to save."
          This deficient explanation lies at the root of mistakes which many
          theologians have made, and by which they have surrounded their system
          of divinity with mist. They have said that to save is to pluck men as
          brands from the burning -- to save them from destruction if they
          repent. Now, it means vastly, I had almost said, infinitely more than
          this. "To save" means something more than just delivering penitents
          from going down to hell. By the words "to save," I understand the
          whole of the great work of salvation, from the first holy desire, the
          first spiritual conviction, onward to complete sanctification. All
          this done of God through Jesus Christ. Christ is not only mighty to
          save those who do repent, but he is able to make men repent; he is
          engaged not merely to carry those to heaven who believe, but he is
          mighty to give men new hearts and to work faith in them; he is mighty
          not merely to give heaven to one who wishes for it, but he is mighty
          to make the man who hates holiness love it, to constrain the despiser
          of his name to bend his knee before him, and to make the most
          abandoned reprobate turn from the error of his ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the words "to save," I do not understand what some men say they
          mean. They tell us in their divinity that Christ came into the world
          to put all men into a salvable state -- to make the salvation of all
          men possible by their own exertions. I believe that Christ came for no
          such thing -- that he came into the world not to put men into a
          salvable state, but into a saved state; not to put them where they
          could save themselves, but to do the work in them and for them, from
          the first even to the last. If I believe that Christ came only to put
          you, my hearers, and myself into a state where we might save
          ourselves, I should give up preaching henceforth and for ever; for
          knowing a little of the wickedness of men's hearts, because I know
          something of my own -- knowing how much men naturally hate the
          religion of Christ -- I should despair of any success in preaching a
          gospel which I had only to offer, its effects depending upon the
          voluntary acceptance of it by unrenewed and unregenerate men. If I did
          not believe that there was a might power, and which turns them from
          the error of their ways by the mighty, overwhelming, constraining
          force of a divine and mysterious influence, I should cease to glory in
          the cross of Christ. Christ, we repeat, is mighty, not merely to put
          men into a salvable condition, but mighty absolutely and entirely to
          save them. This fact I regard as one of the grandest proofs of the
          divine character of the Bible revelation. I have many a time had
          doubts and fears, as most of you have had; and where is the strong
          believer that he not sometimes wavered? I have said, within myself,
          "Is this religion true, which, day after day, I incessantly preach to
          the people? Is it the correct one? Is it true that this religion has
          an influence upon mankind?" And I will tell you how I have reassured
          myself. I have looked upon the hundreds, nay, upon the thousands whom
          I have around me, who were once the vilest of the vile -- drunkards,
          swearers, and such like -- and I now see then "clothed and in their
          right mind, "This must be the truth, then, because I see its
          marvellous effects. It is true, because it is efficient for purposes
          which error never could accomplish. It exerts an influence among the
          lowest order of mortals, and over the most abominable of our race. It
          is a power, an irresistible agent of good; who then shall deny its
          truth. I take it that the highest proof of Christ's power is not that
          he offers salvation, not that he bids you take it if you will, but
          that when you reject it, when you hate it, when you despise it, he has
          a power whereby he can change your mind, make you think differently
          from your former thoughts, and turn you from the error of your ways.
          This I conceive to be the meaning of the text: "mighty to save."
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is not all the meaning. Our Lord is not only mighty to make men
          repent, to quicken the dead in sin, to turn them from their follies
          and their iniquities. But he is exalted to do more than that: he is
          mighty to keep them Christians after he has made them so, and mighty
          to preserve them in his fear and love, until he consummates their
          spiritual existence in heaven. Christ's might doth not lie in making a
          believer, and then leaving him to shift for himself afterwards; but he
          who begins the good work carries it on; he who imparts the first germ
          of life which quickens the dead soul, gives afterwards the life which
          prolongs the divine existence, and bestows that mighty power which at
          last bursts asunder every bond of sin, and lands the soul perfected in
          glory. We hold and teach, and we believe upon Scriptural authority,
          that all men unto whom Christ has given repentance must infallibly
          hold on their way. We do believe that God never begins a good work in
          a man without finishing it; that he never makes a man truly alive to
          spiritual things without carrying on that work in his soul even to the
          end, by giving him a place amongst the choirs of the sanctified. We do
          not think that Christ's power dwells in merely bringing me one day
          into grace, and then telling me to keep myself there, but in so
          putting me into a gracious state, and giving me such an inward life
          and such a power within myself that I can no more turn back than the
          very sun in the heavens can stay itself in its course, or cease to
          shine. Beloved, we regard this as signified by the terms "mighty to
          save." This is commonly called Calvinistic doctrine; it is none other
          than Christian doctrine, the doctrine of the holy Bible; for despite
          that it is now called Calvinism, it could not be so called in
          Augustine's days; and yet in Augustine's works you find the very same
          things. And it is not to be called Augustinism; it is to be found in
          the writings of the apostle Paul. And yet it was not called Paulism,
          simple for this reason, that it is the expansion, the fulness of the
          gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. To repeat what we have before said,
          we hold and boldly teach that Jesus Christ is not merely able to save
          men who put themselves in his way and who are willing to be saved, but
          that he is able to make men willing -- that he is able to make the
          drunkard renounce his drunkenness and come to him -- that he is able
          to make the despiser bend his knee, and make hard hearts melt before
          his love. Now, it is ours to show that he is able to do so.
        </p>
        <p>II. HOW CAN WE PROVE THAT CHRIST IS "MIGHTY TO SAVE?"</p>
        <p>
          We will give you the strongest argument first; and we shall need but
          one. The argument is, that he has done it. We need no other; it were
          superfluous to add another. He has saved them, in the full extent and
          meaning of the word which we have endeavoured to explain. But in order
          to set this truth in a clear light, we will suppose the worst of
          cases. It is very easy to imagine, say some, that when Christ's gospel
          is preached to some here who are amiable and lovely, and have always
          been trained up in the fear of God, they will receive the gospel in
          the love of it. Very well, we will not take such a case. You see this
          South Sea Islander. He has just been eating a diabolical meal of human
          flesh; he is a cannibal; at his belt are slung the scalps of men whom
          he has murdered, and in whose blood he glories. If you land on the
          coast he will eat you, too, unless you mind what you are after. That
          man bows himself before a block of wood. He is a poor ignorant debased
          creature, but very little removed from the brute. Now, has Christ's
          gospel power to tame that man, to take the scalps from his girdle, to
          make him give up his bloody practices, renounce his gods, and become a
          civilised and Christian man? You know, my dear friends, you talk about
          the power of education in England; there may be a great deal in it;
          education may do very much for some who are here, not in a spiritual,
          but in a natural way; but what would education do with this savage: go
          and try. Send the best schoolmaster in England over to him: he will
          eat him before the day is up. That will be all the good of it. But if
          the missionary goes with Christ's gospel, what will become of him?
          Why, in multitudes of cases, he has been the pioneer of civilisation,
          and under the providence of God has escaped a cruel death. He goes
          with love in his hands and in his eyes; he speaks to the savage. And
          mark ye, we are telling facts now, not dreams. The savage drops his
          tomahawk. Says he, "It is marvellous; the things that this man tells
          me are wonderful, I will sit down and listen." He listens, and the
          tears roll down his cheeks; a feeling of humanity which never burned
          within his soul before is kindled in him. He says, "I believe in the
          Lord Jesus Christ;" and soon he is clothed and in his right mind, and
          becomes in every respect a man -- such a man as we could desire all
          men to be. Now, we say, that this is proof that Christ's gospel does
          not come to the mind that is prepared for it, but prepares the mind
          for itself; that Christ does not merely put the seed into the ground
          that has been prepared beforehand, but ploughs the ground too -- ay,
          and harrows it, and does the whole of the work. He is so able to do
          all this. Ask our missionaries who are in Africa, in the midst of the
          greatest barbarians in the world -- ask them whether Christ's gospel
          is able to save, and they will point to the kraal of the Hottentot,
          and then they will point to the houses of the Kuraman, and they will
          say, "What has made this difference, but the word of the gospel of
          Christ Jesus?" Yes, dear brethren, we have had proofs enough in
          heathen countries; and why need we say more, but merely to add this --
          we have had proofs enough at home. There are some who preach a gospel
          which is very well fitted to train man in morals, but utterly unfitted
          to save him, a gospel which does well enough to keep men sober when
          they have become drunkards. It is a good thing enough to supply them
          with a kind of life, when they have it already, but not to quicken the
          dead and save the soul, and it can give up to despair the very
          characters whom Christ's gospel was most of all intended to affect. I
          could a tale unfold, of some who have plunged head-first into the
          blackest gulfs of sin, which would horrify you and me, if we could
          allow them to recount their guilt. I could tell you how they have come
          into God's house with their teeth set against the minister, determined
          that say what he would they might listen, but it would be to scoff.
          They stayed a moment; some word arrested their attention; they thought
          within themselves, "I will hear that sentence." It was some pointed,
          terse saying, that entered into their souls. The knew not how it was,
          but they were spell-bound, and stood to listen a little longer; and
          by-and-bye, unconsciously to themselves, the tears began to fall, and
          when they went away, they had a strange, mysterious feeling about them
          that led them to their chambers. Down they fell on their knees; the
          story of their life was all told before God; he gave them peace
          through the blood of the Lamb, and they went to God's house, many of
          them to say, "Come and hear what God hath done for my soul," and to
        </p>
        <p>"Tell to sinners round</p>
        <p>What a dear Saviour they had found."</p>
        <p>
          Remember the case of John Newton, the great and mighty preacher of St.
          Mary, Woolnoth, -- an instance of the power of God to change the
          heart, as well as to give peace when the heart is changed. Ah! dear
          hearers, I often think within myself, "This is the greatest proof of
          the Saviour's power." Let another doctrine be preached: will it do the
          same? If it will, why not let every man gather a crowd round him and
          preach it. Will it really do it? If it will, then the blood of men's
          souls must rest upon the man who does not boldly proclaim it. If he
          believes his gospel does save souls, how does the account for it that
          he stands in his pulpit from the first of January till the last of
          December, and never hears of a harlot made honest, nor of a drunkard
          reclaimed? Why? For this reason, that it is a poor dilution of
          Christianity. It is something like it, but it is not the bold, broad
          Christianity of the Bible; it is not the full gospel of the blessed
          God, for that has power to save. But if they do believe that theirs is
          the gospel, let them come out to preach it, and let them strive with
          all their might to win souls from sin, which is rife enough, God
          knows. We say again, that we have proof positive in cases even here
          before us, that Christ is mighty to save even the worst of men -- to
          turn them from follies in which they have too long indulged, and we
          believe that the same gospel preached elsewhere would produce the same
          results.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best proof you can ever have of God's being mighty to save, dear
          hearers, is that he saved you. Ah! my dear hearer, it were a miracle
          if he should save thy fellow that stands by thy side; but it were more
          a miracle if he should save thee. What art thou this morning? Answer!
          "I am an infidel," says one; "I hate and despise Christ's religion."
          But suppose, sir, there should be such a power in that religion that
          one day thou shouldst be brought to believe it! What wouldst thou say
          then? Ah! I know thou wouldst be in love with that gospel for ever;
          for thou wouldst say, "I above al men was the last to receive it; and
          yet here am I, I know now how, brought to love it." Oh! such a man
          when constrained to believe makes the most eloquent preacher in the
          world. "Ah! but," says another, "I have been a Sabbath-breaker upon
          principle, I despise the Sabbath, I hate utterly and entirely
          everything religious." Well, I can never prove religion to you to be
          true, unless it should ever lay h old of you, and make you a new man.
          Then you will say there is something in it. "We speak that we do know,
          and testify that we have seen." When we have felt the change it works
          in ourselves, then we speak of facts, and not of fancies, and we speak
          very boldly too. We say again, then, he is "mighty to save."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But now it is asked, WHY IS CHRIST "MIGHTY TO SAVE?" To this
          there are sundry answers.

        <p>
          First, if we understand the word "save," in the popular acceptation of
          the word, which is not, after all, the full one, though a true one --
          if we understand salvation to mean the pardon of sin and salvation
          from hell, Christ is mighty to save, because of the infinite efficacy
          of his atoning blood. Sinner! black as thou art with sin, Christ this
          morning is able to make thee whiter than the driven snow. Thou askest
          why. I will tell thee. He is able to forgive, because he has been
          punished for thy sin. If thou dost know and feel thyself to be a
          sinner, if thou hast no hope or refuge before God but in Christ, then
          be it known that Christ is able to forgive, because he was once
          punished for the very sin which thou hast committed, and therefore he
          can freely remit, because the punishment has been entirely paid by
          himself. Whenever I get on this subject I am tempted to tell a story;
          and though I have told it times enough in the hearing of many of you,
          others of you have never heard it, and it is the simplest way I know
          of setting out the belief I have in the atonement of Christ. Once a
          poor Irishman came to me in my vestry. He announced himself something
          in this way: "Your reverence, I'm come to ax you a question." "In the
          first place," said I, "I am not a reverend, nor do I claim the title;
          and in the next place, why don't you go and ask your priest that
          question?" Said he "Well, your riv -- sir, I meant -- I did go to him
          but he did not answer me to my satisfaction, exactly; so I have come
          to ask you, and if you will answer this you will set my mind at peace,
          for I am much disturbed about it." "What is the question?" said I.
          "Why this. You say, and others say too, that God is able to forgive
          sin. Now, I can't see how he can be just, and yet forgive sin: for,"
          said this poor man, "I have been so greatly guilty that if God
          Almighty does not punish me he ought; I feel that he would not be just
          if he were to suffer me to go without punishment. How, then, sir, can
          it be true that he can forgive, and still retain the title of just?"
          "Well," said I, "it is through the blood and merits of Jesus Christ."
          "Ah!" said he, "but then I do not understand what you mean by that. It
          is the kind of answer I got from the priest, but I wanted him to
          explain it to me more fully, how it was that the blood of Christ could
          make God just. You say it does, but I want to know how." "Well, then,"
          said I, "I will tell you what I think to be the whole system of
          atonement, which I think is the sum and substance, the root, the
          marrow, and the essence of the gospel. This is the way Christ is able
          to forgive. Suppose," said I, "you had killed some one. You were a
          murderer; you were condemned to die, and you deserved it." "Faith,"
          said he, "Yes I should deserve it." "Well, her Majesty is very
          desirous of saving your life, and yet at the same time universal
          justice demands that some one should die on account of the deed that
          is done. Now, how is she to manage?" Said he, "That is the question. I
          cannot see how she can be inflexibly just, and yet suffer me to
          escape." "Well," said I, "suppose, Pat, I should go to her and say,
          Here is this poor Irishman, he deserved to be hanged, your Majesty; I
          don't want to quarrel with the sentence, because I think it just; but,
          if you please, I so love him that if you were to hang me instead of
          him I should be very willing.' Pat, suppose she should agree to it,
          and hang me instead of you; what then? would she be just in letting
          you go?" "Ay," said he, "I should think she would. Would she hang two
          for one thing? I should say not. I'd walk way, and there isn't a
          policeman that would touch me for it." "Ah!" said I, "that is how
          Jesus saves. Father,' he said, I love these poor sinners; let me
          suffer instead of them!' Yes,' said God, thou shalt;' and on the tree
          he died, and suffered the punishment which all his elect people ought
          to have suffered; so that now all who believe on him, thus proving
          themselves to be his chosen, may conclude that he was punished for
          them, and that therefore they never can be punished." "Well," said he,
          looking me in the face once more, "I understand what you mean; but how
          is it, if Christ died for all men, that notwithstanding, some men are
          punished again? For that is unjust." "Ah!" said I, "I never told you
          that. I say to you that he has died for all that believe on him, and
          all who repent, and that was punished for their sins so absolutely and
          so really, that none of them shall ever be punished again." "Faith,"
          said the man, clapping his hands, "that's the gospel; if it isn't,
          then I don't know anything, for no man could have made that up; it is
          so wonderful. Ah!" he said, as he went down the stairs, "Pat's safe
          now; with all his sins about him he'll trust in the man that died for
          him, and so he shall be saved." Dear hearer, Christ is mighty to save,
          because God did not turn away the sword, but he sheathed it in his own
          Son's heart; he did not remit the debt, for it was paid in drops of
          precious blood; and now the great receipt is nailed to the cross, and
          our sins with it, so that we may go free if we are believers in him.
          For this reason he is "mighty to save," in the true sense of the word.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in the large sense of the word, understanding it to mean all that
          I have said it does mean, He is "mighty to save." How is it that
          Christ is able to make men repent, to make men believe, and to make
          them turn to God? One answers, "Why by the eloquence of preachers."
          God forbid we should ever say that! It is "not by might nor by power."
          Other replying, "It is by the force of moral suasion." God forbid we
          should say "ay" to that; for moral suasion has been tried long enough
          on man, and yet it has failed of success. How does he do it? We
          answer, by something which some of you despise, but which,
          nevertheless, is a fact. he does it by the Omnipotent influence of his
          Divine Spirit. Whilst men are hearing the word (in those whom God will
          save) the Holy Spirit works repentance; he changes the heart and
          renews the soul. True, the preaching is the instrument, but the Holy
          Spirit is the great agent. It is certain that the truth is the means
          of saving, but it is the Holy Ghost applying the truth which saves
          souls. Ah! and with this power of the Holy Ghost e may go to the most
          debased and degraded of men, and we need not be afraid but that God
          can save them. If God should be please, the Holy Spirit could at this
          moment make every one of you fall on your knees, confess your sins,
          and turn to God. He is an Almighty Spirit, able to do wonders. In the
          life of Whitfield, we read that sometimes under one of his sermons two
          thousand persons would at once profess to be saved, and were really
          so, many of them. We ask why it was. At other times he preached just
          as powerfully, and not one soul was saved. Why? Because in the one
          case the Holy Spirit went with the Word, and in the other case it did
          not. All the heavenly result of preaching is owing to the Divine
          Spirit sent from above. I am nothing; my brethren in the ministry
          around are all nothing; it is God that doeth everything. "Who is Paul,
          who is Apollos, and who is Cephas, but ministers by whom ye believed,
          even as God gave to every man." It must be "not by might, nor by
          power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord." Go forth, poor minister!
          Thou has no power to preach with polished diction and elegant
          refinement; go and preach as thou canst. The Spirit can make thy
          feeble words more mighty than the most ravishing eloquence. Alas!
          alas! for oratory! Alas! for eloquence! It hath long enough been
          tried. We have had polished periods, and finely turned sentences; but
          in what place have the people been saved by them? We have had grand
          and gaudy language; but where have hearts been renewed! But now, "by
          the foolishness of preaching," by the simple utterance by a child of
          God's Word, he is pleased to save them that believe and to save
          sinners from the error of their ways. May God prove his Word again
          this morning!
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The fourth point was, WHAT ARE THE INFERENCES TO BE DERIVED FROM
          THE FACT THAT JESUS CHRIST IS MIGHTY TO SAVE?
        </p>
        <p>
          Why, first, there is a fact for ministers to learn -- that they should
          endeavour to preach in faith, nothing wavering. "O God," cries the
          minister at times, when he is on his knees, "I am weak; I have
          preached to my hearers, and have wept over them; I have groaned for
          them; but they will not turn to thee. Their hearts are like the nether
          mill-stone; they will not weep for sin, nor will they love the
          Saviour." Then I think I see the angel standing at his elbow, and
          whispering in his ear, "Thou art weak, but he is strong; thou canst do
          nothing, but he is mighty to save.'" Bethink thyself of this. It is
          not the instrument, but the God. It is not the pen wherewith the
          author writes which is to have the praise of his wisdom or the making
          of the volume, but it is the brain that thinks it, and the hand that
          moves the pen. So in salvation. It is not the minister, it is not the
          preacher, but the God who first designs the salvation, and afterwards
          uses the preacher to work it out. Ah! poor disconsolate preacher, if
          thou hast had but little fruit of thy ministry, go on still in faith,
          remembering it is written, "My word shall not return unto me void, but
          it shall accomplish that which I please, and prosper in the thing
          whereto I sent it." Go on; be of good courage; God shall help thee; he
          shall help thee, and that right early.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, here is another encouragement for praying men and women, who
          are praying to God for their friends. Mother, you have been groaning
          for your son for many a year; he is now grown up and has left your
          roof, but your prayers have not been heard. So you think. He is as gay
          as ever; not yet has he made your breast rejoice. Sometimes you think
          he will bring your grey hairs with sorrow to the grave. It was but
          yesterday you said, "I will give him up, I will never pray for him
          again." Stop, mother, stop! By all that is holy and that is heavenly,
          stop! Utter not that resolution again; begin once more! Thou hast
          prayed over him; thou didst weep over his infant forehead, when he lay
          in his cradle; thou didst teach him when he came to years of
          understanding and thou hast often warned him since; but all of no
          avail. Oh! give not up thy prayers; for remember, Christ is "mighty to
          save." It may be that he waits to be gracious, and he keeps thee
          waiting, that thou mayest know more of his graciousness when the mercy
          comes. But pray on. I have heard of mothers who have prayed for their
          children twenty years; ay, and some who have died without seeing them
          converted, and then their very death has been the means of saving
          their children, by leading them to think. A father once had been a
          pious man for many years, yet never had he the happiness of seeing one
          of his sons converted. He had his children round his bed, and he said
          to them when dying, "My sons, I could die in peace, if I could but
          believe you would follow me to heaven; but this is the most sorrowful
          thing of all -- not that I am dying, but that I am leaving you to meet
          you no more." They looked at him, but they would not think on their
          ways. They went away. Their father was suddenly overtaken with great
          clouds and darkness of mind; instead of dying peacefully and happily,
          he died in great misery of soul, but still trusting in Christ. He
          said, when he died, "Oh! that I had died a happy death, for that would
          have been a testimony to my sons; but now, O God, this darkness and
          these clouds have in some degree taken away my power to witness to the
          truth of thy religion." Well, he died, and was buried. The sons cam to
          the funeral. The day after, one of them said to his brother, "Brother,
          I have been thinking, father was always a pious man, and if his death
          was yet such a gloomy one, how gloomy must ours be, without God and
          without Christ!" "Ah!" said the other, "that thought struck me too."
          They went up to God's house, heard God's Word, they came home and bent
          their knee in prayer, and to their surprise they found that the rest
          of the family had done the same, and that the God who had never
          answered their father's prayer in his life had answered it after his
          death, and by his death too, and by such a death as would appear to be
          most unlikely to have wrought the conversion of any. Pray on, then, my
          sister; pray on, my brother! God shall yet bring thy sons and
          daughters to his love and fear, and thou shalt rejoice over them in
          heaven, if thou never dost on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          And finally, my dear hearers, there are many of you here this morning
          who have no love to God, no love to Christ; but you have a desire in
          your hearts to love him. You are saying, "Oh! can he save me? Can such
          a wretch as I be saved?" In the thick of the crowd there you are
          standing, and you are now saying within yourself, "May I one day sing
          among the saints above? May I have all my sins blotted out by blood
          divine?" "Yes, sinner, he is mighty to save;' and this is comfort for
          thee." Dost thou think thyself the worst of men? Does conscience smite
          thee as with a mailed fist, and does he say it is all over with thee;
          thou wilt be lost; thy repentance will be of no avail; thy prayers
          never will be heard; thou art lost to all intents and purposes? My
          hearer, think not so. He is "mighty to save." If thou canst not pray,
          he can help thee to do it; if thou canst not repent, he can give thee
          repentance; if thou feelest it hard to believe, he can help thee to
          believe, for he is exalted on high to give repentance, as well as to
          give remission of sins. O poor sinner, trust in Jesus; cast thyself on
          him. Cry, and may God help thee to do it now, the first Sabbath of the
          year; may he help thee this very day to cast thy soul on Jesus; and
          this will be one of the best years of all thy life. "Turn ye, turn ye;
          why will ye die, O house of Israel?" Turn unto Jesus, ye wearied
          souls; come unto him, for lo, he bids you come. "The Spirit and the
          bride say come; and let him that heareth say come; and whosoever will
          let him come and take of the water of life," and have Christ's grace
          freely. It is preached to you, and to all of you who are willing to
          receive it, it has been already given.
        </p>
        <p>
          May God of his grace make you willing, and so save your souls, through
          Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour. Amen.<br />
