        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.311)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, April 29th, 1860, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>
          "Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly
          increase." -- Job 8:7.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS WAS the reasoning of Bildad the Shuhite. He wished to prove that
          Job could not possibly be an upright man, for if he were so, he here
          affirms that his prosperity would increase continually, or that if he
          fell into any trouble, God would awake for him, and make the
          habitation of his righteousness prosperous; and though his family were
          now all destroyed, and his wealth scattered to the winds, yet if he
          were an upright man, God would surely appear for him, and his latter
          end would greatly increase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the utterances of Bildad, and of the other two men who came to
          comfort Job, but who made his wounds tingle, are not to be accepted as
          being inspired. They spake as men -- as mere men. They reasoned no
          doubt in their own esteem logically enough; but the Spirit of God was
          not with hem in their speech, therefore with regard to any sentiment
          which we find uttered by these men, we must use our own judgment; and
          if it be not in consonance with the rest of Holy Scriptures, it will
          be our bounden duty to reject it as being but the word of man -- of a
          wise and ancient man it is true, but still of a man only.
        </p>
        <p>
          With regard to the passage which I have selected as a text, it is rue
          -- altogether apart from its being said by Bildad, or being found in
          the Bible at all; it is true, as indeed the facts of the book of Job
          prove: for Job did greatly increase in his latter end. His beginning
          was small: he was brought down to poverty, to the potsherd and to the
          dunghill; he had many graves, but no children; he had had many losses,
          he had now nothing left to lose; and yet God did awake for him; his
          righteousness came out from he darkness which had eclipsed it; he
          shone in sevenfold prosperity; s that the words of Bildad were
          prophetic, though he knew it not; God put into his mouth language
          which did come true, after all. Indeed, we have here a great principle
          -- a principle against which none can ever contend. The beginning of
          the godly and the upright man may be but very small, but his latter
          end shall greatly increase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evil things may seem to begin well, but they end badly; there is the
          flash and the glare, but afterwards the darkness and the black ash.
          They promise fairly: their sun rises in the zenith, and then speedily
          sets, never to rise again. Evil things begin as mountains; they end as
          mole-hills. You sail upon their ocean at first, and as you sail onward
          it shrinks into a river, and afterwards into a dry bed, if not into
          burning sands. Behold Satan in the garden of Eden. Sin begins with the
          promise, "Ye shall be as gods!" How grand is its beginning! Where ends
          it? Shivering beneath the trees of the garden, complaining of
          nakedness, sin comes to its end. Or see it in Satan himself. He
          stretches out his right hand to snatch the diadem of heaven; he would
          be Lord paramount. He cannot bear to serve, he longs to reign. Oh!
          Glittering vision, that enchants the eye of an arch-angelic spirit!
          But where ends it? The vision is all gone, and is succeeded by "the
          blackness of darkness for ever;" and the chains reserved in fire for
          those that kept not their first estate. So will it be with you, too,
          my friend, if you have chosen the path of evil. To-day your mirth is
          as the crackling of thorns under a pot; it blazes, it crackles with
          excess of joy; to-morrow thou shalt find nothing there but a handful
          of ashes, and darkness, and cold. Ay, the path of evil is down hill,
          from its sunny summits, to its dark ravines -- from the loftiness,
          which it assumes when it professes to be a cherub, to that lowliness
          in which it finds itself to be a fiend. Evil goeth downward; it hath
          its great things first, and then its terrible things last. No so,
          however, with good. With good the beginning is even small; but its
          latter end doth greatly increase. "The path of the just is as the
          shining light," which sheds a few flickering rays at first, which
          exercises a combat with the darkness, but it "shineth more and more
          unto the perfect day." As the coming forth of stars at even-tide, when
          first one, and then another, and yet another struggles through the
          darkness, till at last the whole starry host are marshalled on the
          heavenly plains -- so it is with good -- it beginneth with grains of
          sand, it goeth on to hills, and anon it swelleth up to mountains; it
          beginneth with the rippling rill -- the little cascade that leapeth
          from its secret birth-place, and down the mountain it dasheth, it
          swelleth to a joyous stream, wherein the fish do leap; anon it becomes
          a river, which bears upon the surface the navigation of nations, and
          then it rolls at last an ocean that belts the globe. Good things
          progress. They are like Jacob's ladder -- they ascend round by round.
          We begin as men, we end as angels; we climb until the promise of Satan
          is fulfilled in a sense in which he never understood it; we become as
          gods, and are made partakers of the Divine, being reconciled unto God,
          and then having God's grace infused into us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The principle, then, upon which I have to speak this morning, is this,
          -- that though the beginnings of good things are small, yet their
          latter end shall greatly increase. Instead, however, of dealing with
          this as a mere doctrine, I propose to use it practically; assume the
          fact, and then make a practical use of it. Three ends shall I hope to
          serve -- first, to quiet the fears of those who are but beginners in
          grace; secondly, to confirm their faith; and, thirdly, to quicken
          their diligence. May I ask the prayers of God's people here that I may
          be strengthened in this preaching? I cannot tell how it is, -- the
          cold clammy sweat comes over me now I am about to address you, and I
          feel almost quivering with weakness; nevertheless, this is a subject
          which may strengthen me as well as you, and therefore let us go to it
          at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, for THE QUIETING OF YOUR FEARS. Thou sayest, my
          hearer, "I am but a beginner in grace, and therefore I am vexed with
          anxiety, and full of timorousness." Yes, and it shall be my business
          if God the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, shall enable me, to give thee
          some few sweet words which, like wafers made with honey, thou mayest
          roll under thy tongue, and find them satisfactory and pleasant, even
          as that manna which came down from heaven, and fed the Israelites in
          the wilderness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps thy first fear, if I put it into words, is this: -- "My
          beginning is so small that I cannot tell when it did begin, and
          therefore, methinks I cannot have been converted, but am still in the
          gall of bitterness." O beloved! How many thousands like thyself have
          been exercised with doubts upon this point! They were not converted in
          an instant; they were not stricken down as in the Revivals; they were
          not nerved with terrible alarms, such as John Bunyan describeth in his
          "Grace Abounding;" but they were called of God, as was Lydia, by a
          still small voice. Their hearts were gradually and happily opened to
          receive the truth; it was not as if a tornado or a hurricane rushed
          through their spirits; but a soft zephr below, and they lived and came
          to God. And you doubt, do you, because from this very reason you
          cannot tell when you were generated; it is but necessary for you to
          know that you are so. If thou canst set no date to the beginning of
          thy faith, yet if thou dost believe now, thou art saved. If in thy
          diary there stands no red-letter day in which thy sins were pardoned,
          and thy soul accepted, yet if thy trust be in Jesus only, this very
          day thou art pardoned, and thou art accepted, despite thy ignorance of
          the time when. God's promises bear no date; our notes are dated
          because there is a time when they run due, and we are apt to forget
          them; God's promises bear none, and his gifts sometimes do not bear
          any. If thou art saved -- though the date be erased -- yet do thou
          rejoice and triumph evermore in the Lord thy God. True, there are some
          of us who can remember the precise spot where we first found the
          Saviour. The day will never be forgotten when these eyes looked to he
          cross of Christ and found their tears all wiped away. But thousands in
          the fold of Jesus know not when hey were brought in; be it enough for
          hem to know they are there. Let them feed upon the pasture, let them
          lie down beside the still waters for whether they came by night or by
          day they did not come at a forbidden hour. Whether they came in youth
          or in old age, it matters not; all times are acceptable with God, "and
          whosoever cometh," come he when he may, "he will in no wise cast out."
        </p>
        <p>
          Does it not strike you as being very foolish reasoning if you should
          say in your heart, "I am not converted because I do not know when?"
          Nay, with such reasoning as that, I could prove that old Rome was
          never built, because the precise date of her building is unknown; nay,
          we might declare that the world was never made, for its exact age even
          the geologist cannot tell us. We might prove that Jesus Christ himself
          never died, for the precise date on which he expired on the tree is
          lost beyond recovery; nor doth it signify much to us. We know the
          world was made, we know that Christ did die, and so you -- if you are
          onw reconciled to God, if now your trembling arms are cast around that
          cross, you too are saved -- though the beginning was so small that you
          cannot tell when it was. Indeed, in living things, it is hard to put
          the finger upon the beginning. Here is a fruit-will you tell me when
          it began to be? Was it at the time when first the tree sent forth its
          fruit-bud? Did this fruit begin when first the flower shed its
          exhalations of perfume upon the air? Indeed, you could not have seen
          it if you had looked. When was it? Was it when the full-ripe flower
          was blown away, and its leaves were scattered to the wind, and a
          little embryo of fruit was left? Twere hard to say it did not begin
          before that, and equally hard to say at what precise instant that
          fruit began to be formed. Ay, and so is it with divine grace; the
          desires are so faint at the beginning, the convictions are but the
          etchings upon the plate, which afterwards must be engraven with a
          harder instrument; and they are such flimsy things, such transient
          impressions of divine truth, that twere difficult to say what is
          transient and what permanent, what is really of the Spirit of God, and
          what is not; what hath saved the soul, or what only brought it to the
          verge of salvation; what made it really live, or what was really the
          calling together of the dry bones before the breath came, and the
          bones began to live. Quite your fears, my hearers, upon this point,
          for if ye are saved, no matter when, ye never shall be unsaved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another doubt also arises from this point. "Ah! sir," saith a timid
          Christian, "it is not merely the absence of all date to my conversion,
          but the extreme weakness of the grace I have." "Ah," saith one, "I
          sometimes think I have a little faith, but it is so mingled with
          unbelief, distrust, and incredulity, that I can hardly think it is
          God's gift, the faith of God's elect. I hope sometimes I have a little
          love, but it is such a beginning, such a mere spark, that I cannot
          think it is the love which God the Holy Spirit breathes into the soul;
          my beginning is so exceeding small, that I have to look, and look, and
          look again, at times, before I can discern it for myself. If I have
          faith, it is but as a rain of mustard seed, and I fear it will never
          be that goodly tree, in the midst of whose branches the birds of the
          air might rest." Courage, my brother, courage; however small the
          beginnings of grace, hey are such beginnings that they shall have a
          glorious end. When God begins to build, if he lay but one single stone
          he will finish the structure; when Christ sits down to weave, though
          he casts the shuttle but once, and that time the thread was so filmy
          as scarcely to be discernable, he will nevertheless continue ill the
          piece is finished, and the whole is wrought. If thy faith be never so
          little, yet it is immortal, and that immortality may well compensate
          for its littleness. A spark of grace is a spark of Deity -- as soon
          may Deity be quenched as to quench grace -- that grace within thy soul
          given thee of the Spirit shall continue to burn, and he who gave it
          shall fan it with his own soft breath, for "he will not quench the
          smoking flax;" he will bring it to a fire, and afterwards to a
          furnace, till thy faith shall attain to the full assurance of
          understanding. Oh! Let not the littleness of God's beginnings stagger
          you. Who would think, if he stood at the source of the Thames, that it
          would ever be such a river as it is -- making this city rich? So
          little is it that a child might stop it with his hand, and but a
          handful of miry clay might dam its course, but there it rolls a mighty
          river that man cannot stop. And so shall it be with thee; thy faith is
          so little that it seems not to exist at all, and thy love so faint
          that it can scarcely be called love, but thy latter end shall greatly
          increase, till thou shalt become strong and do exploits; the babe
          shall become a giant; and he that stumbled at every straw shall move
          mountains, and make the very hills to shake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having thus spoken upon two fears, which are the result of these small
          beginnings, let me now try to quiet another. "Ah!" saith the heir of
          heaven, "I do hope that in me grace hath commenced its work, but my
          fear is, that such frail faith as mine will never stand the test of
          years. I am," saith he, "so weak, that one temptation would be too
          much for me; how then can I hope to pass through yonder forest of
          spears held in the hands of valiant enemies? A drop makes me tremble,
          how shall I stem the roaring flood of life and death? Let but one
          arrow fly from hell it penetrates my tender flesh; what hen if Satan
          shall empty his quiver? I shall surely fall by the hand of the enemy.
          My beginnings are so small that I am certain they will soon come to
          their end, and that end must be black despair." Be of good courage,
          brother, have done with that fear one for all; it is rue, as thou
          sayest, the temptation will be too much for thee, but what hast thou
          to do with it? Heaven is not to be won by thy might, but by the might
          of him who has promised heaven to thee; thy crown of life is to be
          obtained, not by thy arm, but by that arm which now holds it out, and
          bids thee run towards it. If thy perseverance rested upon thyself thou
          couldst not persevere an hour; if spiritual life depended on itself it
          would be like the shooting-star, which makes a shining trail for a
          moment and then is gone; but thanks be unto God, it is written --
          "Because I live, ye shall live also." "For ye are dead, and your life
          is hid with Christ in God."
        </p>
        <p>"The feeblest saint shall win the day,</p>
        <p>Though death and hell obstruct the way,"</p>
        <p>
          because that feeble sain is girded with Jehovah's strength. If I had
          to fight in another man's strength, and I knew that he had gigantic
          force, I should not estimate the power of my own limits and muscles,
          but of his limbs and muscles; and so if I have to fight in the
          strength of God, I am not to reckon by what I can do, but what he can
          do; not what I am able, but what he is able to accomplish. I am not to
          go forth bound and limited, and cramped, and bandaged by my own
          infirmity, but make free, and valorous, and unconquerable through that
          Divine omnipotence, which first spake all things into existence, and
          now maintaineth all things by the word of his power. Stand up, poor
          brother, full of fears though you be, and for once glory in your
          infirmities, and boast in your Master. I say it in thy behalf, and on
          my own -- ye principalities and powers of darkness, ye leaguered hosts
          of hell, ye enemies in human form, or in form demoniac, I challenge ye
          all; more than a match for ever one of you am I if God be with me;
          less than nothing were I, if left alone; but were I weaker than I am I
          would defy you all, for God is my strength; Jehovah is become my
          strength and my song; he also has become my salvation, therefore will
          we tread down our enemies, and Moab shall become as straw that is
          trodden down for the dunghill; in God will be rejoice, yea in God will
          we greatly rejoice, and in him will we rejoice all the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus have I dealth with a third fear. Let me seek to quiet and pacify
          one other fear. "Nay, but," say you, "I never can be saved; for when I
          look at other people, at God's own true children, -- I am ashamed to
          say it, -- I am but a miserable copy of them. So far from attaining to
          he image of my Master, I fear I am not even like my Master's servants.
          Look at such-an-one, how he preaches the truth with power, what
          fluency he has in prayer, what service he undertakes! But I -- I am
          such a beginner in grace, that
        </p>
        <p>'Hosannas languish on my tongue,</p>
        <p>And my devotion dies.'</p>
        <p>
          I live at a poor dying rate. I sometimes run, but oftener creep, and
          seldom or ever fly. Where others are shaking mountains, I am stumbling
          over mole-hills. The saints seem to bestride this narrow world like
          some great colossus, but I walk under their huge legs, and peep about,
          to find myself a poor dishonoured slave. I have no power, no strength,
          no might." Pause, brother, pause; stop thy murmuring for a moment. If
          some little star in the sky should declare it was not a star, because
          it did not shine as brightly as Sirius or Arcturus, how foolish would
          be its argument! If the moon should insist upon it that she was never
          made by God, because she could not shine as brightly as the sun, fie
          on her pale face, that she cannot be content to be what her Lord hath
          made her! If the nettle would not bloom, because it was not a pine,
          and if the hyssop on the wall refused to row, because it was not a
          cedar, oh! What dislocation would there be in the noble frame of this
          universe! If these murmurings that vex us vexed the whole of God's
          creatures, then were this earth a howling wilderness indeed. Now, let
          me talk to thee a moment, to calm thy fears. Hast thou, my brother,
          ever learned to distinguish between grace and gifts? For know that
          they are marvellously dissimilar. A man may be saved who has not a
          grain of gifts; but no man can be saved who hath no grace. Yonder
          brother who prayed, yonder friend who preaches, yonder sister who
          spoke -- all these perhaps acted so well, because God had given hem
          excellent gifts. It might not be that it was because of grace. When
          you are in the prayer-meeting, and hear a brother extremely fluent,
          remember that there are men quite as fluent about their daily
          business, and that fluency is not fervency, and that even the
          appearance of fervency is not absolutely an evidence that there is
          fervency in the soul. If thou art so mean a thing that thou canst not
          spell a word in any book, or put six words together grammatically, if
          thou canst offer no prayer in public, if thou art so poor a scholar
          that every fool is wiser than thou art, yet if thou hast grace in thy
          heart, thou art saved, and that is the matter in point just now,
          whether thou art saved or not. "Covet earnestly the best gifts;" but
          still, sit not down and murmur because thou hast them not, for one
          grain of grace outweighs a pound of gifts; one particle of grace is
          far more precious than all the gifts that Byron ever had, or that
          Shakespeare ever possessed within his soul, vast and almost infinite
          though the gifts of those men certainly were.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet another question would I put to you. My dear brother, have you
          ever learned to distinguish between grace that saves, and the grace
          which develops itself afterwards? Remember, there are some races that
          are absolutely necessary to the saving of the soul; there are some
          others that are only necessary to its comfort. Faith, for instance, is
          absolutely necessary for salvation; but assurance is not. Love is
          indispensible; but that high degree of love which induces the martyr's
          spirit, does not reign in the breast of ever one, even of those who
          are saved. The possession of grace in some degree is needful to
          salvation; but the possession of grace in the highest degree, though
          it be extremely desirable, is not absolutely necessary for an entrance
          into heaven. Bethink thee, then, thus to thyself, if I be the meanest
          lamb in Jesus' fold, I would be happy to think that I am in the flock;
          if I be the smallest babe in Jesus' family, I will bless his name to
          think that I have a portion among the sanctified. If I be the smallest
          jewel in the Saviour's crown, I will glisten and shine as best I can,
          to the praise of him that bought me with his blood. If I cannot make
          such swelling music in the orchestra of heaven as the pealing organ
          may, then will I be but as a bruised reed, which may emit some faint
          melody. If I cannot be the beacon fire that scares a continent, and
          throws its light across the deep, I will seek to be the glow-worm that
          may at least let the weary traveller know something of its
          whereabouts. O Christians! Ye that have but little beginnings, quiet
          your fears; for these little beginnings, if they be of God, will save
          your soul, and you may in this rejoice, yes, rejoice exceedingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I must ask your patience now while I turn to the second head, and I
          shall dwell upon that very briefly indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Upon this head I wish to say a word or two for THE CONFIRMATION OF
          YOUR FAITH. I am sure you will give me your prayerful attention while
          I speak for the confirmation of my own faith as well as yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, brothers and sisters, the first confirmation I would offer you
          is this: -- Our beginnings are very, ver small, but we have a joyous
          prospect in our text. Our later end shall greatly increase; we shall
          not always be so distrustful as we are now. Thank God, we look for
          days when our faith shall be unshaken, and firm as mountains be. I
          shall not for ever have to mourn before my God that I cannot love him
          as I would. I trust that he in my latter end will give me more of his
          Spirit, that I shall love him with all my heart, and soul, and
          strength. We have entered into the gospel school; we are ignorant now,
          but we shall one day understand with all saints what are the heights,
          and depths, and lengths, and breadths, and know the love of Christ
          which passeth knowledge. We have hope that, as these hairs grow grey,
          we shall "grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour
          Jesus Christ." Time, that ploughs its furrow in the brow, we hope will
          sow the seeds of wisdom there. Experience, which shall furrow our back
          with many a sorrow and a wound, shall nevertheless, we trust, work
          patience, and nearer and sweeter fellowship than as yet we have come
          to know. Think not, Mr. Ready-to-halt, that thou shalt always need thy
          crutches; there may come days of leaping and of dancing even for thee.
          Oh, Mistress Despondency, the dungeons of Giant Despair's castle are
          not to be thy perpetual abode; thou, too, shall stand upon the top of
          Mount Clear, and thou shalt see the Celestial City, and the land that
          is very far off. We are growing things. Methinks I hear the green
          blade say this morning, "I shall not for ever be trodden under foot as
          if I were but grass; I shall grow; I shall blossom; I shall row ripe
          and mellow; and many a man shall sharpen his sickle for me." I hear
          the little sapling say, "I shall not for ever be shaken to and fro by
          winds; I shall grow into an old stalwart oak; gnarled though the roots
          may be, and twisted though my branches are, I shall one day stand and
          outlaugh the tempest, while all its waves of wind break harmlessly
          over me." I shall be strong through him that strengthened me, for I
          feel a growth within me that can never stop till I have grown to be
          next to a God -- a son of God, a partaker of the Divine nature.
          Courage then, courage, I say, brothers and sisters! These weak days
          are not always to last; we are not to be shorn lambs always, not
          always the weaklings of his cattle. We shall one day be as the
          firstlings of his bullocks, and we shall push our enemies to he ends
          of the earth, and tread upon them and destroy them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, further, this cheering prospect upon earth is quite eclipsed by a
          more cheering prospect beyond the river Death. "Our latter end shall
          greatly increase." Faith shall give place to fruition; hope shall be
          occupied with enjoyment; love itself shall be swallowed up in ecstacy.
          Mine eyes, ye shall not for ever weep; there are sights of transport
          for you. Tongue, thou shalt not for ever have to mourn, and be the
          instrument of confession; there are songs and hallelujahs for thee.
          Feet, yet shall not always be weary with this rough road; there are
          celestial leapings for you. O my poor heart, oft cowed and broken,
          often disappointed and trodden down, there waiteth for thee the
          palm-branch and the robe of victory, and the immortal crown.
        </p>
        <p>"My spirit leaps across the flood,</p>
        <p>And antedates the hour,"</p>
        <p>
          when I shall come into possession of these joys which could not belong
          to my childhood here, but which await me in my manhood up there, when
          the spirit shall be perfected, and made meet to be a partaker of the
          inheritance of the saints in light. Courage, Christian!
        </p>
        <p>"The way may be rough, but it cannot be long;"</p>
        <p>
          and the end will make amends for all the toil that you can endure when
          on the road. Oh! Quicken thy footsteps, sit not down in despair. Thy
          latter end shall greatly increase, though thy beginnings be but small.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps some one may say, "How is it that we are so sure that our
          latter end will increase?" I give you just these reasons: -- we are
          quite sure of it because there is a vitality in our piety. The
          sculptor may have oftentimes cut in marble some exquisite statue of a
          babe. That has come to its full size; it will never grow any greater.
          When I see a wise man in the world, I look at him as being just such
          an infant. He will never grow any greater. He has come to his full. He
          is but chiselled out by human power; there is no vitality in him. The
          Christian here one earth is a babe, but not a babe in stone -- a babe
          instinct with life. It is a happy thought sometimes to have of
          one's-self as sitting down here, compressed, small, insignificant; and
          one day Death shall come and say, "Rise to thy proper altitude," and
          we shall begin to grow and expand; and bursting all our cerements and
          every limit of humanity, we shall become greater than the angels are.
          I think it is Milton who pictures the spirits in Pandemonium as
          condensing themselves, so that multitudes of hem could sit in a little
          space, and then at their own volition mounting up till they attained a
          prodigious height. So is it now. We are little spirits, but we shall
          grow and increase, and we know this because there is life in us --
          eternal life. Now, the life of twenty years develops itself into
          something vastly superior to what it was in childhood; and what will
          the eternal life be when that vitality within us shall make the
          littleness of our beginning seem as nothing at all, when our latter
          end shall have greatly increased?
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides this, we feel hat we must come to something better, because
          God is with us. We are quite certain that what we are, cannot be the
          end of God's design. When I see a block of marble half chiselled, with
          just perhaps a hand peeping out from the rock, no man can make me
          believe that that is what the artist means it should be. And I know I
          am not what God would have me to be, because I feel yearnings and
          longings within myself to be infinitely better, infinitely holier and
          purer than I am now. And so is it with you; you are not what God means
          you to be; you have only just begun to be what he wants you to be. He
          will go on with his chisel of affliction, using wisdom and the
          graving-tool together, till by-and-bye it shall appear what you shall
          be for, you shall be like him, and you shall see him as he is. Oh!
          What comfort this is for our faith, that from he fact of our vitality
          and the fact that God is at work with us, it is clear, and true, and
          certain, that our latter end shall be increased. I do not think that
          any man yet has ever got an idea of what a man is to be. We are only
          the chalk crayon, rough drawings of men, yet when we come to filled up
          in eternity, we shall be marvellous pictures, and our latter end
          indeed shall be greatly increased.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, one other thought and I will turn to the last point.
          Christian! Remember, for the encouragement of thy poor soul, that what
          thou art now is not the measure of thy safety; thy safety depends not
          upon what thou art, but on what Christ is. If the Rock of our
          salvation ere within us, indeed the house would soon be over-turned;
          but we live by what Christ is.
        </p>
        <p>"What Adam had, and forfeited for all,</p>
        <p>That Jesus is, who cannot fail or fall."</p>
        <p>
          Till he can falter, my spirit need not tremble; till Jesus sins, till
          Jesus dies, till Jesus is overcome, till he is powerless with his God,
          till he ceases to be Divine, the soul that trusts him must be secure.
          Look not within thee for consolation, but look above, where Jesus
          pleads before the throne of the efficacy of his once-offered blood,
          and if thou wilt look at thy own state, and then judge thine eternal
          standing by thine own feelings, or willings, or doings, thou wilt be
          an undone and miserable wretch. Measure thyself by Jesus' doings, by
          Jesus' standing, by Jesus' acceptance, by the love of his heart, by
          the power of his arm, by the Divinity of his nature, by the constancy
          of his faithfulness, by the acceptance of his blood, by the prevalence
          of his plea; and so measuring, thy faith need never, never fear --
        </p>
        <p>"For should the earth's old pillar's shake,</p>
        <p>And all the walls of nature break,</p>
        <p>Our steadfast souls need fear no more</p>
        <p>Than solid rocks when billows roar."</p>
        <p>
          III. Now for our last point, namely, FOR THE QUICKENING OF OUR
          DILIGENCE.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was never intended that the promises of God should make men idle;
          and when we tell hem that their small beginnings shall doubtless come
          to glorious endings, we tell hem this for their encouragement -- not
          that they may sit still and do nothing, but that they may gird up the
          loins of their mind, confident of their success, to do all that lieth
          in them, God helping them. Men and brethren, there are many of you
          here, who, like myself, have to mourn over little beginnings. Let me
          say to you, be ver diligent in the use of those means which God has
          appointed for your spiritual growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, take heed to yourself that you obey the commandments which
          relate to the ordinances of Christ. Neglect not baptism. True, there
          is nothing saving in it, nothing meritorious; but baptism is a means
          of grace. There have been many, who have found, like the eunuch, that
          when they have been baptised they have gone on their way rejoicing --
          rejoicing as the effect of grace given when they have obeyed their
          Master.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be careful, too, not to neglect that most blessed Supper of our Lord
          Jesus Christ. Forsake not the assembling of yourselves together, as
          the manner of some is, but let him be known to you in the breaking of
          bread, and in pouring forth of wine. Do this often in remembrance of
          him. Ah! I am speaking to some here to-day who love Jesus, but who
          have neglected his last dying injunction, "This do in remembrance of
          me;" and you have not grown in grace, and are still little in Israel,
          as you used to be. Do you wonder at it? You have neglected God's
          appointed means. "Oh," saith one, "but I am a spiritual man; I do not
          need these carnal ordinances." There is no man so carnal as he who
          calls God's ordinances carnal, and no man more spiritual than he who
          finds spiritual things best brought home to him by what others have
          ventured to call "beggarly elements." We do not know ourselves if we
          think we can dispense with these divine signs. Christ knew what was
          best for us. He has said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and be
          baptized." He would not have appended the last command if it were not
          important. He has bidden us also, as oft as we drink the cup, to do it
          in remembrance of him. He would not have commanded us that, if it were
          not for our benefit and for his glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          But further, if thou wouldst get out of the littleness of thy
          beginnings, wait much upon the means of grace. Read much the Word of
          God alone. Seek out one who understandeth it well -- a man whom God
          hath taught in it -- and listen hou with reverence to the Word as it
          is preached. Frequent sermons, but prayers most. Praying is the end of
          preaching. Make use of ever means that lieth before thee. Be not like
          the fool, who calls the books of the old father "dead men's brains."
          What God spake to seers of old, what he spoke to mighty men who
          preached, is not to be thus despised. Read thou as thou canst, and
          learn as thou canst. Take care, too, that thou art not content with
          skimming over a page of Scripture; but seek to get the ver marrow out
          of it. Be not as the butterfly, which flits from flower to flower, but
          rests nowhere; be thou as the bee, which enters the flower-bell, and
          sucks the honey and bears it off upon its heavily-laden thigh. Rest
          not till thou hast fed on the Word; and thus shall thy little
          beginnings come to great endings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be much also in prayer. God's plants grow fastest in the warm
          atmosphere of the closet. The closet is a forcing-place for spiritual
          vegetation. He who would be well fed and grow strong, must exercise
          himself upon his knees. Of all raining practice for spiritual battles,
          knee practice is the most healthy and strengthening. Note that, if
          thou forgettest aught besides.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, lastly, if thy beginning be but small, make the best use of the
          beginning that thou hast. Hast thou but one talent? Put it out at
          interest, and make two of it. Hast thou two? Seek to have them
          multiplied into four. Art thou a babe? If thou canst not walk, nor
          lift, nor carry, thou canst cry. Take care to cry right lustily. Art
          thou a child? Thou canst not climb; thou canst not as yet teach; but
          thou canst run. Take care to run in the ways of heavenly obedience.
          Art thou a young man? Thou canst not as yet give the reverend advice
          of hoary age; but be strong, and overcome the wicked one. Art thou an
          old man? Thou canst not now fight the battles of thy youth, nor lead
          the van in heroic deeds, but thou canst abide with the stuff, and
          guard those old doctrines which, like the heavy baggage of the army,
          must not be lost, lest the battle itself should go from us. Ever man
          to his place and to his post. By thus diligently using what we have,
          we shall gain more. Rivers increase by their onward flow, flames by
          burning; sunlight increases by the sun's sining, lights by kindling
          other lights. And so do thou. Do thou grow rich by enriching others --
          rich by spending. Lengthen out thyself by cutting off the ends that
          thou canst spare from all thou hast, for it is the way to grow; by
          giving up that which was an excresence thou shalt get that which shall
          be a real growth. Oh! Use thyself, and God shall make use of thee;
          come out, and God shall lead thee forth. Be a man, and God shall make
          thee more than an angel, and God shall make thee something more. He
          will make thee better, holier, happier, greater. Oh! Do this, and so
          shall hy latter end be joyous, thy peace shall be like a river, and
          thy righteousness like the waves of the sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, I have spoken this for the comfort of God's people -- would that
          I could hope that all I have said belonged to all of you! But, ah! if
          it does not, may God convert you, may the new life be given to you!
          Oh! Remember, if you are longing for it, the way of salvation is
          freely opened to you. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt
          be saved."
        </p>
        <p>God bless us now and ever, for Jesus' sake. Amen.<br /></p>
