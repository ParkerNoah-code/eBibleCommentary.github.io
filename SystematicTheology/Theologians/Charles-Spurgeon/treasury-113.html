<p align="center"><font size="4">PSALM 109</font><br/>
 </p>
</font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">To The Chief Musician.</p></font></b><font face="Verdana">

<p align="justify">Intended therefore to be sung, and sung in the temple 
    service! Yet is it by no means easy to imagine the whole nation singing such 
    dreadful imprecations. <i>We ourselves, at any rate, under the gospel 
    dispensation, find it very difficult to infuse into the Psalm a gospel 
    sense, or a sense at all compatible with the Christian spirit</i>. Therefore 
    one would think the Jews must have found it hard to chant such strong 
    language without feeling the spirit of revenge excited; and the arousal of 
    that spirit could never have been the object of divine worship in any period 
    of time—under law or under gospel. </p>
<p align="justify">At the very outset this title shows that the Psalm has a 
    meaning with which it is fitting for men of God to have fellowship before 
    the throne of the Most High—but what is that meaning? This is a question of 
    no small difficulty, and only a very childlike spirit will ever be able to 
    answer it.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">A Psalm of David. </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">Not therefore the ravings of a wicked misanthrope, or the 
    execrations of a hot, revengeful spirit</p></i>. David would not smite the man 
    who sought his blood, and he frequently forgave those who treated him 
    shamefully; and therefore these words cannot be read in a bitter, revengeful 
    sense, for that would be foreign to the character of the son of Jesse.
<p align="justify">The imprecatory sentences before us were penned by one 
    who with all his courage in battle was a man of music and of tender heart, 
    and they were meant to be addressed to God in the form of a Psalm, and 
    therefore they cannot possibly have been meant to be mere angry cursing.</p>
<p align="justify">Unless it can be proved that the religion of the old 
    dispensation was altogether hard, morose, and Draconian, and that David was 
    of a malicious, vindictive spirit, it cannot be conceived that this Psalm 
    contains what one author has ventured to call "a pitiless hate, a refined 
    and insatiable malignity." To such a suggestion we cannot give place, no, 
    not for an hour. </p>
<p align="justify">But what else can we make of such strong language? Truly 
    this is one of the hard places of Scripture, a passage which the soul 
    trembles to read; yet as it is a Psalm unto God, and given by inspiration, 
    it is not ours to sit in judgment upon it—but to bow our ear to what God the 
    Lord would speak to us therein.</p>
<p align="justify">This psalm refers to <i>Judas</i>, for so Peter quoted 
    it; but to ascribe its bitter denunciations to our Lord in the hour of his 
    sufferings is more than we dare to do. These are not consistent with the 
    silent Lamb of God, who opened not his mouth when led to the slaughter. It 
    may seem very pious to put such words into his mouth; we hope it is our 
    piety which prevents our doing so.</p>
<p align="justify">DIVISION. </p>
<p align="justify">In the first five verses David humbly pleads with God 
    that he may be delivered from his remorseless and false hearted enemies. </p>
<p align="justify">From Verses 6-20, filled with a prophetic fervor, which 
    carries him entirely beyond himself, he denounces judgment upon his foes.</p>
<p align="justify">And then from Verses 21-31 he returns to his communion 
    with God in prayer and praise. </p>
<p align="justify">The central portion of the Psalm in which the difficulty 
    lies must be regarded not as the personal wish of the psalmist in cool 
    blood—but as <i>his prophetic denunciation of such persons as he describes, 
    and emphatically of one special "son of perdition" whom he sees with 
    prescient eye. </i>We would all pray for the conversion of our worst enemy, 
    and David would have done the same; but viewing the adversaries of the Lord, 
    and doers of iniquity, as such, and as incorrigible we cannot wish them 
    well; on the contrary, we desire their overthrow, and destruction. The 
    gentlest hearts burn with indignation when they hear of barbarities to women 
    and children, of crafty plots for ruining the innocent, of cruel oppression 
    of helpless orphans, and gratuitous ingratitude to the good and gentle. </p>
<p align="justify">A curse upon the perpetrators of the atrocities in Turkey 
    may not be less virtuous than a blessing upon the righteous. We wish well to 
    all mankind, and for that very reason we sometimes blaze with indignation 
    against the inhuman wretches by whom every law which protects our fellow 
    creatures is trampled down, and every dictate of humanity is set at nothing.</p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. Hold not your peace. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">My enemies speak—may you be pleased to speak too. Break 
    your solemn silence, and silence those who slander me. It is the cry of a 
    man whose confidence in God is deep, and whose communion with him is very 
    close and bold. Note, that he only asks the Lord to speak—a word from God is 
    all a believer needs. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">O God of my praise. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">You whom my whole soul praises, be pleased to protect my 
    honor and guard my praise. </p>
<p align="justify">"My heart is fixed", said he in the former psalm, "I will 
    sing and give praise", and now he appeals to the God whom he had praised. If 
    we take care of God's honor he will take care of ours. We may look to him as 
    the guardian of our character if we truly seek his glory. If we live to 
    God's praise, he will in the long run give us praise among men.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the 
    deceitful are opened against me. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Wicked men must needs say wicked things, and these we 
    have reason to dread; but in addition they utter false and deceitful things, 
    and these are worst of all. <i>There is no knowing what may come out of 
    mouths which are at once lewd and lying. </i>The misery caused to a good man 
    by slanderous reports no heart can imagine but that which is wounded by 
    them. In all Satan's armory there are no worse weapons than deceitful 
    tongues. To have a reputation, over which we have watched with daily care, 
    suddenly bespattered with the foulest aspersions, is painful beyond 
    description; but when wicked and deceitful men get their mouths fully opened 
    we can hardly expect to escape anymore than others. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">They have spoken against me with a lying tongue. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Lying tongues cannot lie still. Bad tongues are not 
    content to vilify bad men—but choose the most gracious of saints to be the 
    objects of their attacks. Here is reason enough for prayer. The heart sinks 
    when assailed with slander, for we know not what may be said next, what 
    friend may be alienated, what evil may be threatened, or what misery may be 
    caused to us and others. The air is full of rumors, and shadows impalpable 
    flit around. The mind is confused with dread of unseen foes, and invisible 
    arrows. What ill can be worse than to be assailed with slander,</p>
<p align="justify">"Whose edge is sharper than the sword, <br/>
 whose tongue out-venoms all the worms of Nile"?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. They compassed me about also with words of 
    hatred. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Turn which way he would they hedged him in with 
    falsehood, misrepresentation, accusation, and scorn. Whispers, sneers, 
    insinuations, satires, and open charges filled his ear with a perpetual 
    buzz, and all for no reason—but sheer hate. <i>Each word was as full of 
    venom as an egg is full of meat—they could not speak without showing their 
    teeth. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And fought against me without a cause. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He had not provoked the quarrel or contributed to it—yet 
    in a thousand ways they labored to "corrode his comfort, and destroy his 
    ease." All this tended to make the suppliant feel the more acutely the 
    wrongs which were done to him.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. For my love they are my adversaries. </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">They hate me because I love them.</p></i> One of our poets 
    says of the Lord Jesus, "Found guilty of excess of love." Surely it was his 
    only fault. Our Lord might have used all the language of this complaint most 
    emphatically—they hated him without a cause and returned him hatred for 
    love. What a smart this is to the soul,<i> to be hated in proportion to the 
    gratitude which it deserved, hated by those it loved, and hated because of 
    its love. </i>This was a cruel case, and the sensitive mind of the psalmist 
    writhed under it. 
<b>
<p align="justify">But I give myself unto prayer. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He did nothing else but pray. He became prayer as they 
    became malice. This was his answer to his enemies, he appealed from men and 
    their injustice, to the Judge of all the earth, who must do right. True 
    bravery alone can teach a man to leave his traducers unanswered, and carry 
    the case unto the Lord.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. And they have rewarded me evil for good, and 
    hatred for my love. </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">Evil for good is devil like.</p></i> This is Satan's line of 
    action, and his children upon earth follow it greedily; it is cruel, and 
    wounds to the core. The revenge which pays a man back in his own coin has a 
    kind of natural justice in it; but what shall be said of that baseness which 
    returns to goodness the very opposite of what it has a right to expect? 
<p align="justify">Our Lord endured such base treatment all his days, and, 
    alas, in his members, endures it still. </p>
<p align="justify">Thus we see the harmless and innocent man upon his knees 
    pouring out his lamentation. We are now to observe him rising from the mercy 
    seat, inspired with prophetic energy, and pouring forth upon his foes the 
    forewarning of their doom. We shall hear him speak like a judge clothed with 
    stern severity, or like the angel of doom robed in vengeance, or as the 
    naked sword of justice when she bares her arm for execution.</p>
<p align="justify">It is not for himself that he speaks so much as for all 
    the slandered and the down trodden, of whom he feels himself to be the 
    representative and mouthpiece. He asks for justice, and as his soul is stung 
    with cruel wrongs he asks with solemn deliberation, making no stint in his 
    demands. </p>
<p align="justify">To pity malice would be malice to mankind. To screen the 
    crafty seekers of human blood would be cruelty to the oppressed. Nay, love, 
    and truth, and pity lift their wounds to Heaven, and implore vengeance on 
    the enemies of the innocent and oppressed. Those who render goodness itself 
    a crime, and make innocence a motive for hate, deserve to find no mercy from 
    the great Preserver of men. </p>
<p align="justify">Vengeance is the prerogative of God, and as it would be a 
    boundless calamity if evil were forever to go unpunished, so it is an 
    unspeakable blessing that the Lord will recompense the wicked and cruel man, 
    and there are times and seasons when a good man ought to pray for that 
    blessing. When the Judge of all threatens to punish tyrannical cruelty and 
    false hearted treachery, virtue gives her assent and consent. Amen, so let 
    it be, says every just man in his inmost soul.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. Set a wicked man over him. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">What worse punishment could a man have? The proud man 
    cannot endure the proud, nor the oppressor brook the rule of another like 
    himself. The righteous in their patience find the rule of the wicked a sore 
    bondage; but those who are full of resentful passions, and haughty 
    aspirations, are slaves indeed when men of their own class have the whip 
    hand of them. </p>
<p align="justify">For Herod to be ruled by another Herod would be 
    wretchedness enough, and yet what retribution could be more just? </p>
<p align="justify">What unrighteous man can complain if he finds himself 
    governed by one of like character? What can the wicked expect but that their 
    rulers should be like themselves? Who does not admire the justice of God 
    when he sees fierce Romans ruled by Tiberius and Nero.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And let Satan stand at his right hand. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Should not like come to like? Should not the father of 
    lies stand near his children? Who is a better right hand friend for an 
    adversary of the righteous than the great adversary himself? The curse is an 
    awful one—but it is most natural that it should come to pass. Those who 
    serve Satan may expect to have his company, his assistance, his temptations, 
    and at last his doom.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. When he shall be judged, let him be condemned.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He judged and condemned others in the vilest manner, he 
    suffered not the innocent to escape. It would be a great shame if in his 
    time of trial, being really guilty, he should be allowed to go free. Who 
    would wish Judge Jeffries to be acquitted if he were tried for perverting 
    justice? Who would desire Nero or Caligula to be cleared if set at the bar 
    for cruelty? When Shylock goes into court, who wishes him to win his suit?
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And let his prayer become sin. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It is sin already, let it be so treated. To the injured 
    it must seem terrible that the black-hearted villain should nevertheless 
    pretend to pray, and very naturally do they beg that he may not be heard—but 
    that his pleadings may be regarded as an addition to his guilt. He has 
    devoured the widow's house—and yet he prays. He has put Naboth to death by 
    false accusation and taken possession of his vineyard—and then he presents 
    prayers to the Almighty. He has given up villages to slaughter, and his 
    hands are red with the blood of babes and maidens—and then he pays his vows 
    unto Allah!</p>
<p align="justify">He must surely be accursed himself, who does not wish 
    that such abominable prayers may be loathed of Heaven and written down as 
    new sins. He who makes it a sin for others to pray will find his own praying 
    become sin. When he at last sees his need of mercy, mercy herself shall 
    resent his appeal as an insult. "Because he forgot to show mercy", he shall 
    himself be forgotten by the God of grace, and his bitter cries for 
    deliverance shall be regarded as mockeries of Heaven.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. Let his days be few.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Who would desire a persecuting tyrant to live long? As 
    well might we wish length of days to a mad dog. If he will do nothing but 
    mischief the shortening of his life will be the lengthening of the world's 
    tranquility. "Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their 
    days"—this is bare justice to them, and great mercy to the poor and needy.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And let another take his office.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Perhaps a better man may come, at any rate it is time a 
    change were tried. So used were the Jews to look upon these verses as the 
    doom of traitors, of cruel and deceitful mind—that Peter saw at once in the 
    speedy death of Judas a fulfillment of this sentence, and a reason for the 
    appointment of a successor who should take his place of oversight. A bad man 
    does not make an office bad—another may use with benefit, that which he 
    perverted to ill uses.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a 
    widow.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">This would inevitably be the case when the man died—but 
    the psalmist uses the words in an emphatic sense, he would have his widow "a 
    widow indeed", and his children so friendless as to be orphaned in the 
    bitterest sense. He sees the result of the evil man's decease, and includes 
    it in the punishment. <i>The tyrant's sword makes many children fatherless, 
    and who can lament when his barbarities come home to his own family, and 
    they too, weep and lament.</i></p>

<p align="justify">Pity is due to all orphans and widows as such—but a 
    father's atrocious actions may dry up the springs of pity. Who mourns that 
    Pharaoh's children lost their father, or that Sennacherib's wife became a 
    widow? <i>As Agag's sword had made women childless—none wept when Samuel's 
    weapon made his mother childless among women. </i>If Herod had been slain 
    when he had just murdered the children at Bethlehem—no man would have 
    lamented it even though Herod's wife would have become a widow. </p>
<p align="justify">These awful maledictions are not for common men to 
    use—but for judges, such as David was, to pronounce over the enemies of God 
    and man. <i>A judge may sentence a man to death whatever the consequences 
    may be to the criminal's family, and in this there will be no feeling of 
    private revenge—but simply the doing of justice because evil must be 
    punished. </i></p>

<p align="justify">We are aware that this may not appear to justify the full 
    force of these expressions—but it should never be forgotten that the case 
    supposed is a very execrable one, and the character of the culprit is beyond 
    measure loathsome and not to be met by any common abhorrence. </p>
<p align="justify">Those who regard a sort of effeminate benevolence to all 
    creatures alike as the acme of virtue, are very much in favor with this 
    degenerate age; these look for the salvation of the damned, and even pray 
    for the restoration of the devil. It is very possible that if they were less 
    in sympathy with evil, and more in harmony with the thoughts of God—they 
    would be of a far sterner and also of a far better mind. To us it seems 
    better to agree with God's curses, than with the devil's blessings. When at 
    any time our heart kicks against the terrors of the Lord, we take it as a 
    proof of our need of greater humbling, and confess our sin before our God.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. Let his children be continually vagabonds, and 
    beg. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">May they have neither house nor home, settlement nor 
    substance; and while they thus wander and beg may it ever be on their memory 
    that their father's house lies in ruins.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Let them seek their bread also out of their desolate 
    places.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It has often been so—a race of tyrants has become a 
    generation of beggars. Misused power and abused wealth have earned the 
    family name universal detestation, and secured to the family character an 
    entail of baseness. Justice herself would award no such doom except upon the 
    supposition that the sin descended with the blood; but supreme providence 
    which in the end is pure justice, has written many a page of history in 
    which the imprecation of this verse has been literally verified. </p>
<p align="justify">We confess that as we read some of these verses we have 
    need of all our faith and reverence to accept them as the voice of 
    inspiration; but the exercise is good for the soul, for it educates our 
    sense of ignorance, and tests our teachability. Yes, Divine Spirit, we can 
    and do believe that even these dread words from which we shrink have a 
    meaning consistent with the attributes of the Judge of all the earth, though 
    his name is LOVE. How this may be we shall know hereafter.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. Let the extortioner catch all that he has.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">A doom indeed. Those who have once fallen into the hands 
    of the usurer, can tell you what this means: it were better to be a fly in 
    the web of a spider. In the most subtle, worrying, and sweeping manner the 
    extortioner takes away, piece by piece, his victim's estate, until not a 
    fraction remains to form a pittance for old age. Baiting his trap, watching 
    it carefully, and dexterously driving his victim into it, the extortioner by 
    legal means performs unlawful deeds, catches his bird, strips him of every 
    feather, and cares not if he dies of starvation. He robs with law to protect 
    him, and steals with the magistrate at his back! To fall into his clutches 
    is worse than to be beset by professed thieves. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And let the strangers plunder the fruits of his labor.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">So that his kindred may have none of it. What with hard 
    creditors and pilfering strangers, the estate must soon vanish! Extortion 
    drawing one way, and thievery the other, a known moneylender and an unknown 
    robber both at work—the man's substance would soon disappear, and rightly 
    so, for it was gathered by shameless means. </p>
<p align="justify">This too has been frequently seen. Wealth amassed by 
    oppression has seldom lasted to the third generation. It was gathered by 
    wrong and by wrong it is scattered, and who would desire that it should be 
    otherwise? Certainly those who suffer beneath high-handed fraud will not 
    wish to stay the retribution of the Almighty. Nor would those who see the 
    poor robbed and trampled on, desire to alter the divine arrangements by 
    which such evils are recompensed even in this life.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. Let there be none to extend mercy unto him. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He had no mercy—but on the contrary, he crushed down all 
    who appealed to him. Loath to smite him with his own weapon, stern justice 
    can do no otherwise—she lifts her scales and sees that this, too, must be in 
    the sentence. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Neither let there be any to favor his fatherless 
    children.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">We are staggered to find the children included in the 
    father's sentence, and yet <i>as a matter of fact children do suffer for 
    their father's sins</i>, and, as long as the affairs of this life are 
    ordered as they are, it must be so.</p>
<p align="justify">So involved are the interests of the race, that <i>it is 
    quite impossible in all respects to view the father and the child apart</i>. 
    No man among us could desire to see the fatherless suffer for their deceased 
    father's fault—yet so it happens, and there is no injustice in the fact. 
    They share the parent's ill-gotten gain or rank, and their aggrandizement is 
    a part of the object at which he aimed in the perpetration of his crimes. To 
    allow them to prosper would be an encouragement and reward of his iniquity. 
    Therefore, for these and other reasons, a man perishes not alone in his 
    iniquity. </p>
<p align="justify">If the man were innocent this would be a crime; if he 
    were but commonly guilty it would be excessive retribution; but when the 
    offence reeks before high Heaven in unutterable abomination, it is little 
    marvel that men devote the man's whole house to perpetual infamy, and that 
    so it happens.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. Let his posterity be cut off; and in the 
    generation following let their name be blotted out. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Both from existence and from memory, let them pass away 
    until none shall know that such a vile brood ever existed. Who wishes to see 
    the family of Domitian or Julian continued upon earth? Who would mourn if 
    the race of Thomas Paine or of Voltaire should come to an utter end? It 
    would be undesirable that the sons of the utterly villainous and 
    blood-thirsty should rise to honor; and if they did, they would only revive 
    the memory of their father's sins.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14. Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered 
    before the LORD, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This verse is, perhaps, the most terrible of all—but yet 
    as a matter of fact, children do procure punishment upon their parents' 
    sins, and are often themselves the means of such punishment. </p>
<p align="justify">A bad son brings to mind his father's bad points of 
    character; people say, "Ah, he is like the old man. He takes after his 
    father." A mother's sins also will be sure to be called to mind, if her 
    daughter becomes grossly wicked. "Ah", they will say, "there is little 
    wonder, when you consider what her mother was." </p>
<p align="justify">These are matters of everyday occurrence. We cannot, 
    however, pretend to explain the righteousness of this malediction, though we 
    fully believe in it. We leave it until our heavenly Father is pleased to 
    give us further instruction. <i>Yet, as a man's faults are often learned 
    from his parents, it is not unjust that his consequent crimes should recoil 
    upon him.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 15. Let them be continually before the LORD, that 
    He may cut off the memory of them from the earth</p></b>. 
<p align="justify">Again, he wishes that his father's sins may follow up the 
    transgressor and assist to fill the measure of his own iniquities, so <i>
    that for the whole accumulated load the family may be smitten with utter 
    extinction</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">A king might justly wish for such an end to fall upon an 
    incorrigible brood of rebels. And of persecutors, continuing in the same 
    mind, the saints might well pray for their extinction.</p>
<p align="justify">But the passage is dark; and we must leave it so. It must 
    be right or it would not be here—but how we cannot see. Why should we expect 
    to understand all things? <i>Perhaps it is more for our benefit to exercise 
    humility, and reverently worship God over a hard text, than it would be to 
    comprehend all mysteries.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 16. Because he forgot to show mercy. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Because he had no memory to show mercy—the Judge of all 
    will have a strong memory of his sins. So little mercy had he ever shown 
    that he had forgotten how to do it—he was without common humanity, devoid of 
    compassion, and therefore only worthy to be dealt with after the bare rule 
    of justice. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">But he persecuted the poor and needy man. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He looked on poor men as a nuisance upon the earth, he 
    ground their faces, oppressed them in their wages, and treated them as the 
    mire of the streets. Should he not be punished, and in his turn laid low? 
    All who know him are indignant at his brutalities, and are delighted to see 
    him overthrown. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">That he might even slay the broken in heart. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He had malice in his heart towards one who was already 
    sufficiently sorrowful, whom it was a gross malignity to attack. Yet no 
    grief excited sympathy in him, and no poverty ever moved him to relent. No, 
    he would kill the heart broken and rob their orphans of their patrimony. To 
    him <i>groans </i>were music, and <i>tears </i>were wine, and drops of <i>
    blood </i>were precious rubies! <i>Would any man spare such a monster? </i>
    Will it not be serving the ends of humanity if we wish him gone, gone to the 
    throne of God to receive his recompense? If he will turn and repent, 
    well—but if not, such a poisonous tree ought to be felled and cast into the 
    fire. As men kill mad dogs if they can, and justly too—so may we lawfully 
    wish that cruel oppressors of the poor were removed from their place and 
    office, and, as an example to others, made to smart for their barbarities.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 17. As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Deep down in every man's soul the justice of <i>the law 
    of retaliation </i>is established. Retaliation, not for private revenge—but 
    as a measure of public justice, is demanded by the psalmist and deserved by 
    the crime. Surely the malicious man cannot complain if he is judged by his 
    own rule, and has his grain measured with his own bushel. Let him have what 
    he loved. They are his own chickens, and they ought to come home to roost. 
    He made the bed—let him lie on it himself. As he brewed—so let him drink.
    </p>
<p align="justify">So all men say as a matter of justice, and though the 
    higher law of love overrides all personal anger—yet as against the base 
    characters here described even Christian love would not wish to see the 
    sentence mitigated. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">As he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from 
    him. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He felt no joy in any man's good, nor would he lift a 
    hand to do another a service, rather did he frown and fret when another 
    prospered or mirth was heard under his window; what, then, can we wish him? 
    Blessing was wasted on him, he hated those who gently sought to lead him to 
    a better mind. Even the blessings of providence he received with murmurs and 
    repinings. He wished for famine to raise the price of his corn, and for war 
    to increase his trade.<i> Evil was good to him, and good he counted evil.
    </i>If he could have blasted every field of grain in the world, he would 
    have done so if he could have turned a penny by it, or if he could thereby 
    have injured the godly man whom he hated from his very soul. </p>
<p align="justify">What can we wish for him? He hunts after evil, he hates 
    good; he lays himself out to ruin the godly whom God has blessed, he is the 
    devil's friend, and as fiendish as his patron. Should things go well with 
    such a being? Shall we "wish him good luck in the name of the Lord?" To 
    invoke blessings on such a man would be to participate in his wickedness, 
    therefore let blessing be far from him, so long as he continues what he now 
    is.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verses 18-19. As he clothed himself with cursing as with 
    his garment—so let it enter his body like water, and like oil into his 
    bones. Let it be to him like the garment which covers him, and for a belt 
    with which he girds himself continually. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He was so openly in the habit of wishing ill to others, 
    that he seemed to wear robes of cursing. Therefore let it be as his clothing 
    girded and belted about him, yes, let it enter as water into his body, and 
    search the very marrow of his bones like a penetrating oil. <i>It is but 
    common justice that he should receive a return for his malice, and receive 
    it in kind, too.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 20. Let this be the LORD'S recompense to my 
    accusers, and to those who speak evil against my person. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This is the summing up of the entire imprecation, and 
    fixes it upon the persons who had so maliciously assailed the inoffensive 
    man of God.</p>
<p align="justify">David was a man of gentle mold, and remarkably free from 
    the spirit of revenge, and therefore <i>we may here conceive him to be 
    speaking as a judge or as a representative man, in whose person great 
    principles needed to be vindicated and great injuries redressed</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">Thousands of God's people are perplexed with this psalm, 
    and we fear we have contributed very little towards their enlightenment. 
    What then? <i>Is it not good for us sometimes to be made to feel that we are 
    not yet able to understand all the word and mind of God? A thorough 
    bewilderment, so long as it does not stagger our faith, may be useful to us 
    by confounding our pride</i>, arousing our faculties, and leading us to cry, 
    "What I know not teach me."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 21. But you do for me, O God the Lord, for your 
    name's sake. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">How eagerly he turns from his enemies, to his God! He 
    sets the great YOU in opposition to all his adversaries, and you see at once 
    that his heart is at rest. The words are very indistinct and though our 
    version may not precisely translate them—yet it in a remarkable manner hits 
    upon the sense and upon the obscurity which hangs over it. </p>
<p align="justify">"You do for me"—what shall he do? Why, do whatever he 
    thinks fit. He leaves himself in the Lord's hands, dictating nothing—but 
    quite content so long as his God will but undertake for him. His plea is not 
    his own merit—but God's name. The saints have always felt this to be their 
    most mighty plea. God himself has performed his grandest deeds of grace for 
    the honor of his name, and his people know that this is the most potent 
    argument with him. What the Lord himself has guarded with sacred jealousy—we 
    should reverence with our whole hearts and rely upon without distrust.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Because your mercy is good, deliver me.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Not because <i>I </i>am good—but because<i> your mercy
    </i>is good. See how the saints fetch their pleadings in prayer, from the 
    Lord himself. God's mercy is the star to which the Lord's people turn their 
    eye when they are tempest-tossed and not comforted—for the peculiar bounty 
    and goodness of that mercy have a charm for weary hearts. When man has no 
    mercy, we shall still find it in God. When man would devour, we may look to 
    God to deliver. His <i>name </i>and his <i>mercy </i>are two firm grounds 
    for hope, and happy are those who know how to rest upon them.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 22. For I am poor and needy.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">When he does plead anything about himself, he urges not 
    his riches or his merits—but his poverty and his necessities. This is gospel 
    supplication, such as only the Spirit of God can indite upon the heart. This 
    lowliness does not comport with the supposed vengeful spirit of the 
    preceding verses—there must therefore be some interpretation of them which 
    would make them suitable in the lips of a lowly-minded man of God. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And my heart is wounded within me. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The Lord has always a tender regard to broken hearted 
    ones, and such the psalmist had become. The undeserved cruelty, the 
    baseness, the slander of his remorseless enemies had pierced him to the 
    soul, and this sad condition he pleads as a reason for speedy help. It is 
    time for a friend to step in when the adversary cuts so deep. The case has 
    become desperate without divine aid; now, therefore, is the Lord's time.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 23. I am gone like the shadow when it declines. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">I am a mere shadow, a shadow at the vanishing point, when 
    it stretches far—but is almost lost in the universal gloom of evening which 
    settles over all, and so obliterates the shadows cast by the setting sun. 
    Lord, there is next to nothing left of me—will you not come in before I am 
    quite gone? </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">I am tossed up and down as the locust.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Which is the sport of the winds, and must go up or down 
    as the breeze carries it. <i>The psalmist felt as powerless in his distress 
    as a poor insect, which a child may toss up and down at its pleasure.</i> He 
    entreats the divine pity, because he had been brought to this forlorn and 
    feeble condition by the long persecution which his tender heart had endured. 
    Slander and malice are apt to produce nervous disorders and to lead on to 
    pining diseases. Those who use these poisoned arrows, are not always aware 
    of the consequences; they scatter fire brands and death and say it is sport.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 24. My knees are weak through fasting.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Either religious fasting, to which he resorted in the 
    dire extremity of his grief, or else through loss of appetite occasioned by 
    distress of mind. Who can eat when every morsel is soured by envy? This is 
    the advantage of the slanderer, that he feels nothing himself, while his 
    sensitive victim can scarcely eat a morsel of bread because of his 
    sensitiveness. However, the good God knows all this, and will support his 
    afflicted. The Lord who bids us confirm the feeble knees, will assuredly do 
    it himself. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And my flesh fails of fatness.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He was wasted to a skeleton, and as his body was 
    emaciated, so was his soul bereft of comfort. He was pining away, and all 
    the while his enemies saw it and laughed at his distress. How pathetically 
    he states his case. This is one of the truest forms of prayer, the setting 
    forth of our sorrow before the Lord. Weak knees are strong with God, and 
    failing flesh has great power in pleading.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 25. I became also a reproach unto them. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They made him the theme of ridicule, the butt of their 
    ribald jests. His emaciation by fasting made him a tempting subject for 
    their caricatures and lampoons. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">When they looked upon me they shook their heads. </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">Words </p></i>were not a sufficient expression of their 
    scorn, they resorted to <i>gestures </i>which were meant both to show their 
    derision and to irritate his mind. <i>Though these things break no bones—yet 
    they do worse, for they break and bruise far tenderer parts of us. </i>Many 
    a man who could have answered a malicious speech, and so have relieved his 
    mind—has felt keenly a sneer, a sticking out of the tongue, or some other 
    sign of contempt. Those, too, who are exhausted by such fasting and wasting, 
    as the last verse describes are generally in a state of morbid sensibility, 
    and therefore feel more acutely the unkindness of others. What they would 
    smile at during happier seasons, becomes intolerable when they are in a 
    highly nervous condition.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 26. Help me, O LORD my God. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Laying hold of Jehovah by the appropriating word <i>my</i>, 
    he implores his aid both to help him to bear his heavy load and to enable 
    him to rise superior to it. He has described his own weakness, and the 
    strength and fury of his foes—and by these two arguments he urges his appeal 
    with double force. <i>This is a very rich, short, and suitable prayer for 
    believers in any situation of peril, difficulty, or sorrow. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">O save me according to your mercy. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">As your mercy is, so let your salvation be. The measure 
    is a great one, for the mercy of God is without bound. When man has no 
    mercy, it is comforting to fall back upon God's mercy. Justice to the wicked 
    is often mercy to the righteous, and because God is merciful he will save 
    his people by overthrowing their adversaries.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 27. That they may know that this is <i>your </i>
    hand. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Dolts as they are, let the mercy shown to me be so 
    conspicuous that they shall be forced to see the Lord's agency in it. 
    Ungodly men will not see God's hand in anything if they can help it, and 
    when they see godly men delivered into their power they become more 
    confirmed than ever in their atheism. But in good time God will arise and so 
    effectually punish their malice and rescue the object of their spite that 
    they will be compelled to say like the Egyptian magicians, "This is the 
    finger of God!" </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">That you, LORD, have done it.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">There will be no mistaking the author of so thorough a 
    vindication, so complete a turning of the tables.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 28. Let them curse—but may you bless.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Or, "they will curse—and you will bless." Their cursing 
    will then be of such little consequence, that it will not matter a straw. 
    One blessing from the Lord will take the poison out of ten thousand curses 
    of men.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">When they arise, let them be ashamed. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They lift up themselves to deal out another blow, to 
    utter another falsehood, and to watch for its injurious effects upon their 
    victim—but they see their own defeat and are filled with shame. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">But let your servant rejoice. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Not merely as a man protected and rescued—but as God's 
    servant in whom his master's goodness and glory are displayed when he is 
    saved from his foes. It ought to be our greatest joy that the Lord is 
    honored in our experience. The <i>mercy </i>itself ought not so much to 
    rejoice us, as the <i>glory </i>which is thereby brought to him who so 
    graciously bestows it.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 29. Let my adversaries be clothed with shame.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It is a prophecy as well as a wish, and may be read both 
    in the indicative and the imperative.<i> Where sin is the 
    underclothing—shame will soon be the outer vesture</i>. He who would clothe 
    godly men with contempt shall himself be clothed with dishonor. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And let them cover themselves with their own confusion, 
    as with a mantle. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Let their confusion be broad enough to wrap them all over 
    from head to foot, let them bind it about them and hide themselves in it, as 
    being utterly afraid to be seen. </p>
<p align="justify">Now they walk abroad unblushingly and reveal their own 
    wickedness, acting as if they either had nothing to conceal or did not care 
    whether it was seen or not. But they will be of another mind when the great 
    Judge deals with them, then will they entreat mountains to hide them and 
    hills to fall upon them, that they may not be seen. But all in vain, they 
    must be dragged to the bar with no other covering but their own confusion.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 30. I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Enthusiastically, abundantly, and loudly will he extol 
    the righteous Lord, who redeemed him from all evil; and that not only in his 
    own chamber or among his own family—but in the most public manner.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Yes, I will praise him among the multitude. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Remarkable and public providence demand public 
    recognition, for otherwise men of the world will judge us to be ungrateful. 
    We do not praise God to be heard of men—but as a natural sense of justice 
    leads every one to expect to hear a befriended person speak well of his 
    benefactor, we therefore have regard to such natural and just expectations, 
    and endeavor to make our praises as public as the benefit we have received.
    </p>
<p align="justify">The singer in the present case is the man whose heart was 
    wounded within him because he was the laughing stock of remorseless enemies. 
    Yet now he praises, praises greatly, praises aloud, praises in the teeth of 
    all gainsayers, and praises with a right joyous spirit. Never let us 
    despair, yes, never let us cease to praise.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 31. For he shall stand at the right hand of the 
    poor. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">God will not be absent when his people are on their 
    trial; he will hold a brief for them and stand in court as their advocate, 
    prepared to plead on their behalf. How different is this from the doom of 
    the ungodly who has Satan at his right hand (Verse 6). </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">To save him from those that condemn his soul. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The court only met as a matter of form, the malicious had 
    made up their minds to the verdict. They judged him guilty, for their hate 
    condemned him—yes, they pronounced sentence of damnation upon the very soul 
    of their victim. But what did this matter? The great King was in court, and 
    their sentence was turned against themselves. <i>Nothing can more sweetly 
    sustain the heart of a slandered believer than the firm conviction that God 
    is near to all who are wronged, and is sure to work out their salvation. </i>
    O Lord, save us from the severe trial of slander. Deal in your righteousness 
    with all those who spitefully assail the characters of holy men, and cause 
    all who are smarting under calumny and reproach to come forth unsullied from 
    the affliction, even as did your only begotten Son. Amen.</p>
