Â </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">TITLE. This Psalm is headed "To the Chief Musician upon 
    Sheminith, a Psalm of David," which title is identical with that of the 
    sixth Psalm, therefore refer the reader to our remarks on the dedication of 
    Psalm 6. We may read this song of complaining faith in the light of His 
    coming who shall break in pieces the oppressor. The subject will be the 
    better before the mind's eye if we entitle this Psalm: "GOOD THOUGHTS IN BAD 
    TIMES." It is supposed to have been written while Saul was persecuting 
    David, and those who favored his cause.</p>
<p align="justify">DIVISION. In the first and second verses David spreads 
    his plaint before the Lord concerning the treachery of his age.</p>
<p align="justify">Verses 3 and 4 denounce judgments upon proud traitors.</p>
<p align="justify">In verse 5, Jehovah himself thunders out his wrath 
    against oppressors.</p>
<p align="justify">Hearing this, the Chief Musician sings sweetly of the 
    faithfulness of God and his care of his people, in verses 6 and 7; but 
    closes on the old key of lament in verse 8, as he observes the abounding 
    wickedness of his times. Those holy souls who dwell in Mesech, and sojourn 
    in the tents of Kedar, may read and sing these sacred stanzas with hearts in 
    full accord with their mingled melody of lowly mourning and lofty 
    confidence.</p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. "Help, Lord." </p></b>A short but sweet, suggestive, 
    seasonable, and serviceable prayer; a kind of angel's sword, to be turned 
    every way, and to be used on all occasions. Ainsworth says the word rendered 
    "help," is largely used for all manner of saving, helping, delivering, 
    preserving, etc. Thus it seems that the prayer is very full and instructive.
    
<p align="justify">The Psalmist sees the extreme danger of his position, for 
    a man had better be among <i>lions </i>than among <i>liars</i>; he feels his 
    own inability to deal with such sons of Belial, for "he who shall touch them 
    must be fenced with iron;" he therefore turns himself to his all-sufficient 
    Helper, the Lord, whose help is never denied to his servants, and whose aid 
    is enough for all their needs. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"Help, Lord," </p></b>is a very useful ejaculation which we 
    may dart up to Heaven on occasions of emergency, whether in labor, learning, 
    suffering, fighting, living, or dying. As small ships can sail into harbors 
    which larger vessels, drawing more water, cannot enter, so our brief cries 
    and short petitions may trade with Heaven when our soul is wind-bound, and 
    business-bound, as to longer exercises of devotion, and when the stream of 
    grace seems at too low an ebb to float a more laborious supplication.
<b>
<p align="justify">"For the godly man ceases;"</p></b> the death, departure, or 
    decline of godly men should be a trumpet-call for more prayer. They say that 
    fish smell first at the head, and when godly men decay, the whole 
    commonwealth will soon go rotten.
<p align="justify">We must not, however, be rash in our judgment on this 
    point, for Elijah erred in counting himself the only servant of God alive, 
    when there were thousands whom the Lord held in reserve. </p>
<p align="justify">The present times always appear to be peculiarly 
    dangerous, because they are nearest to our anxious gaze, and whatever evils 
    are rife are sure to be observed, while the faults of past ages are further 
    off, and are more easily overlooked. </p>
<p align="justify">Yet we expect that in the latter days, "because iniquity 
    shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold," and then we must the more 
    thoroughly turn from man, and address ourselves to the Churches' Lord, by 
    whose help the gates of Hell shall be kept from prevailing against us.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"The faithful fail from among the children of men;"</p></b> 
    when godliness goes, faithfulness inevitably follows; without fear of God, 
    men have no love of truth. <i>Common honesty is no longer common, when 
    common irreligion leads to universal godlessness</i>. David had his eye on 
    Doeg, and the men of Ziph and Keilah, and perhaps remembered the murdered 
    priests of Nob, and the many banished ones who consorted with him in the 
    cave of Adullam, and wondered where the state would drift without the 
    anchors of its godly and faithful men. 
<p align="justify">David, amid the general misrule, did not betake himself 
    to seditious plottings, but to <i>solemn petitionings</i>; nor did he join 
    with the multitude to do evil, but took up the arms of prayer to withstand 
    their attacks upon virtue.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. "They speak vanity every one with his neighbor."
    </p></b>They utter that which is vain to hear, because of its frivolous, 
    foolish, lack of worth; vain to believe, because it was false and lying; 
    vain to trust to, since it was deceitful and flattering; vain to regard, for 
    it lifted up the hearer, filling him with proud conceit of himself. It is a 
    sad thing when it is the fashion to talk vanity. Compliments and fawning 
    congratulations are hateful to honest men; they know that if they take they 
    must give them, and they scorn to do either. These accommodation-bills are 
    most admired by those who are bankrupt in character. <i>Bad are the times 
    when every man thus cajoles and cozens his neighbor. 
</i><b>
<p align="justify">"With flattering lips and with a double heart do they 
    speak." </p></b><i>He who puffs up another's heart, has nothing better than wind 
    in his own</i>. If a man extols me to my face, he only shows me one side of 
    his heart, and the other is black with contempt for me, or foul with intent 
    to cheat me. Flattery is the sign of the tavern where duplicity is the host. 
    The Chinese consider a man of two hearts to be a very base man, and we shall 
    be safe in reckoning all flatteries to be such.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verses 3-4. May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, and 
    the tongue that speaks proud things; Who have said, "With our tongue we will 
    prevail; our lips are our own; who is lord over us?" </p></b>Total destruction 
    shall overwhelm the lovers of flattery and pride, but meanwhile how they 
    hector and fume! Well did the apostle call them "raging waves of the sea, 
    foaming out their own shame." Free-thinkers are generally very free-talkers, 
    and they are never more at ease than when railing at God's dominion, and 
    arrogating to themselves unbounded license. 
<p align="justify">Strange is it that the easy yoke of the Lord should so 
    gall the shoulders of the proud, while the iron bands of Satan they bind 
    about themselves as chains of honor. They boastfully cry unto God, "Who is 
    lord over us?" and hear not the hollow voice of the evil one, who cries from 
    the infernal lake, "I am your lord, and right faithfully do you serve me."
    </p>
<p align="justify">Alas, poor fools, their pride and glory shall be cut off 
    like a fading flower! May God grant that our soul may not be gathered with 
    them. </p>
<p align="justify">It is worthy of observation that flattering lips, and 
    tongues speaking proud things, are classed together. The fitness of this is 
    clear, for they are guilty of the same vice, the first flatters another, and 
    the second flatters himself, in both cases a lie is in their right hands.
    </p>
<p align="justify">One generally imagines that flatterers are such base 
    parasites, so cringing and fawning, that they cannot be proud; but the wise 
    man will tell you that while all pride is truly baseness, there is in the 
    very lowest baseness no small degree of pride. </p>
<p align="justify">Caesar's horse is even more proud of carrying Caesar, 
    than Caesar is of riding him. The mat on which the emperor wiped his shoes, 
    boasts vaingloriously, crying out, "I cleaned the imperial boots!" None are 
    so detestably domineering as the little creatures who creep into office by 
    cringing to the great. Those are bad times, indeed, in which these obnoxious 
    beings are numerous and powerful. No wonder that the justice of God in 
    cutting off such injurious people is matter for a psalm, for both earth and 
    Heaven are weary of such provoking offenders, whose presence is a very 
    plague to the people afflicted thereby. Men cannot tame the tongues of such 
    boastful flatterers; but the Lord's remedy if sharp is sure, and is an 
    unanswerable answer to their swelling words of vanity.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5.</p></b> <b>For the oppression of the poor, for the 
    sighing of the needy, now I will arise," says the LORD; "I will set him in 
    the safety from him who puffs at him." </b>In due season the Lord will hear 
    his elect ones, who cry day and night unto him, and though he bear long with 
    their oppressorsâyet will he avenge them speedily. 
<p align="justify">Observe that the mere oppression of saints, however 
    silently they bear it, is in itself a cry to God. Moses was heard at the Red 
    Sea, though he said nothing; and Hagar's affliction was heard despite her 
    silence. Jesus feels with his people, and their smarts are mighty orators 
    with him. </p>
<p align="justify">By-and-by, however, they begin to sigh and express their 
    misery, and then relief comes post-haste. Nothing moves a father like the 
    cries of his children; he bestirs himself, wakes up his manhood, overthrows 
    the enemy, and sets his beloved in safety. </p>
<p align="justify">A puff is too much for the child to bear, and the foe is 
    so haughty, that he laughs the little one to scorn; but the Father comes, 
    and then it is the child's turn to laugh, when he is set above the rage of 
    his tormentor.</p>
<p align="justify">What virtue is there in a poor man's sighs, that they 
    should move the Almighty God to arise from his throne. The needy did not 
    dare to speak, and could only sigh in secret, but the Lord heard, and could 
    rest no longer, but girded on his sword for the battle. </p>
<p align="justify">It is a blessed day when our soul brings God into her 
    quarrel, for when his bare arm is seen, Philistia shall rue the day. </p>
<p align="justify">The darkest hours of the Church's night are those which 
    precede the break of day. <i>Man's extremity is God's opportunity. </i>Jesus 
    will come to deliver just when his needy ones shall sigh, as if all hope had 
    gone forever. </p>
<p align="justify">O Lord, set your <i>now </i>near at hand, and rise up 
    speedily to our help. Should the afflicted reader be able to lay hold upon 
    the promise of this verse, let him gratefully fetch a fullness of comfort 
    from it. </p>
<p align="justify">Gurnall says, "As one may draw out the wine of a whole 
    hogshead at one tap, so may a poor soul derive the comfort of the whole 
    covenant to himself through one promise, if he be able to apply it." </p>
<p align="justify">He who promises to set us in safety, means thereby 
    preservation on earth, and eternal salvation in Heaven.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver 
    tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.</p></b> What a contrast 
    between the vain words of man, and the pure words of Jehovah. Man's words 
    are yes and nay, but the Lord's promises are yes and amen. For truth, 
    certainty, holiness, faithfulnessâthe words of the Lord are pure as 
    well-refined silver. 
<p align="justify">In the original there is an allusion to the most 
    severely-purifying process known to the ancients, through which silver was 
    passed when the greatest possible purity was desired; the dross was all 
    consumed, and only the bright and precious metal remained. </p>
<p align="justify">So clear and free from all alloy of error or 
    unfaithfulness is the book of the words of the Lord. The Bible has passed 
    through the furnace of persecution, literary criticism, philosophic doubt, 
    and scientific discovery, and has lost nothing but those human 
    interpretations which clung to it as <i>base alloy </i>to precious ore. </p>
<p align="justify">The experience of saints has tried it in every 
    conceivable manner, but not a single doctrine or promise has been consumed 
    in the most excessive heat. </p>
<p align="justify">What God's words are, the words of his children should 
    be. If we would be Godlike in conversation, we must watch our language, and 
    maintain the strictest purity of integrity and holiness in all our 
    communications.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. You shall keep them, O LORD, you shall preserve 
    them from this generation forever.</p></b> To fall into the hands of an evil 
    generation, so as to be baited by their cruelty, or polluted by their 
    influence, is an evil to be dreaded beyond measure; but it is an evil 
    foreseen and provided for in the text. 
<p align="justify">In life many a saint has lived a hundred years before his 
    age, as though he had darted his soul into the brighter future, and escaped 
    the mists of the beclouded present. He has gone to his grave unreverenced 
    and misunderstood, and lo! as generations come and go, suddenly the hero is 
    unearthed, and lives in the admiration and love of the excellent of the 
    earth; preserved forever from the generation which stigmatized him as a 
    sower of sedition, or burned him as a heretic.</p>
<p align="justify">It should be our daily prayer that we may rise above our 
    age as the mountain-tops above the clouds, and may stand out as a 
    heaven-pointing pinnacle high above the mists of ignorance and sin which 
    roll around us. </p>
<p align="justify">O Eternal Spirit, fulfill in us the faithful saying of 
    this verse! Our faith believes those two assuring words, and cries, "You 
    shall," "you shall."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. The wicked prowl on every side, when vileness is 
    exalted among the sons of men.</p></b> Here we return to the fountain of 
    bitterness, which first made the psalmist run to the wells of salvation, 
    namely, the prevalence of wickedness. When those in power are vile, their 
    underlings will be no better. 
<p align="justify">As a warm sun brings out noxious flies, so does a sinner 
    in honor foster vice everywhere. Our turf would not so swarm with 
    abominables if those who are styled honorables did not give their 
    countenance to the craft. Would to God that the glory and triumph of our 
    Lord Jesus would encourage us to walk and work on every side. As like acts 
    upon like, since an exalted sinner encourages sinners, our exalted Redeemer 
    must surely excite, cheer, and stimulate his saints. Nerved by a sight of 
    his reigning power we shall meet the evils of the times in the spirit of 
    holy resolution, and shall the more hopefully pray,<i> "Help, Lord."</i></p>
