          "For who hath despised the day of small things?" -- Zechariah 4:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          ZECHARIAH WAS ENGAGED in the building of the temple. When its
          foundations were laid, it struck everybody as being a very small
          edifice compared with the former glorious structure of Solomon. The
          friends of the enterprise lamented that it should be so small; the
          foes of it rejoiced and uttered strong expressions of contempt. Both
          friends and foes doubted whether, even on that small scale, the
          structure would ever be completed. They might lay the foundations, and
          they might rear the walls a little way, but they were too feeble a
          folk, possessed of too little riches and too little strength, to carry
          out the enterprise. It was the day of small things. Friends trembled;
          foes jeered. But the prophet rebuked them both -- rebuked the unbelief
          of friends, and the contempt of enemies, by this question, "Who hath
          despised the day of small things?" and by a subsequent prophecy which
          removed the fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we shall use this question at this time for the comfort of two
          sorts of people -- first, for weak believers, and secondly, for feeble
          workers. Our object shall be the strengthening of the hands that hang
          down, and the confirming of the feeble knees. We will begin, first of
          all, with: --
        </p>
        <p>I. WEAK BELIEVERS</p>
        <p>
          Let us describe them. It is with them a day of small things. Probably
          you have only been lately brought into the family of God. A few months
          ago you were a stranger to the divine life, and to the things of God.
          You have been born again, and you have the weakness of the infant. You
          are not strong yet, as you will be when you have grown in grace and in
          the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. It is the early
          day with you, and it is also the day of small things. Now your
          knowledge is small. My dear brother, you have not been a Bible student
          long: thank God that you know yourself a sinner, and Christ your
          Saviour. That is precious knowledge; but you feel now what you once
          would not have confessed -- your own ignorance of the things of God.
          Especially do the deep things of God trouble you. There are some
          doctrines that are very simple to other believers that appear to be
          mysterious, and even to be depressing to you. They are high -- you
          cannot attain to them. They are to you what hard nuts would be to
          children, whose teeth have not yet appeared. Well, be not at all
          alarmed about this. All the men in God's family have once been
          children too. There are some that seem to be born with knowledge --
          Christians that come to a height in Christ very rapidly. But these are
          only here and there. Israel did not produce a Samson every day. Most
          have to go through a long period of spiritual infancy and youth. And,
          alas! There are but few in the Church, even now, who might be called
          fathers there. Do not marvel, therefore, if you are somewhat small in
          your knowledge. Your discernment, too, is small. It is possible that
          anybody with a fluent tongue would lead you into error. You have,
          however, discernment, if you are a child of God, sufficient to be kept
          from deadly errors, for though there are some who would, if it were
          possible, deceive even the very elect, yet the elect cannot be
          deceived, for, the life of God being in them, they discern between the
          precious and the vile -- they choose not the things of the world, but
          they follow after the things of God. Your discernment, however,
          seeming so small, need not afflict you. It is by reason of use, when
          the senses are exercised, that we fully discern between all that is
          good and all that is evil. Thank God for a little discernment --
          though you see men as trees walking, and your eyes are only half
          opened. A little light is better than none at all. Not long since you
          were in total darkness. Now if there be a glimmer, be thankful, for
          remember where a glimmer can enter the full noontide can come, yea,
          and shall come in due season. Therefore, despise not the time of small
          discernment. Of course, you, my dear brother or sister, have small
          experience. I trust you will not ape experience, and try to talk as if
          you had the experience of the veteran saints when you are as yet only
          a raw recruit. You have not yet done business on the great waters. The
          more fierce temptations of Satan have not assailed you -- the wind has
          been tempered as yet to the shorn lamb; God has not hung heavy weights
          on slender threads, but hath put a small burden on a weak back. Be
          thankful that it is so. Thank him for the experience that you have,
          and do not be desponding because you have not more. It will all come
          in due time. "Despise not the day of small things." It is always
          unwise to get down a biography and say, "Oh! I cannot be right,
          because I have not felt all this good man did." If a child of ten
          years of age were to take down the diary of his grandfather and were
          to say, "Because I do not feel my grandfather's weakness, do not
          require to use his spectacles, or lean upon his staff, therefore I am
          not one of the same family," it would be very foolish reasoning. Your
          experience will ripen. As yet it is but natural that it should be
          green. Wait a while and bless God for what you have.
        </p>
        <p>
          Probably this, however, does not trouble you so much as one other
          thing, you have but small faith, and, that faith being small, your
          feelings are very variable. I often hear this from young beginners in
          the divine life, "I was so happy a month ago, but I have lost that
          happiness now." Perhaps tomorrow, after they have been at the house of
          God, they will be as cheerful as possible, but the next day their joy
          is gone. Beware, my dear Christian friends, of living by feeling. John
          Bunyan puts down Mr. Live-by-feeling as one of the worst enemies of
          the town of Mansoul. I think he said he was hanged. I am afraid he,
          somehow or other, escaped from the executioner, for I very commonly
          meet him; and there is no villain that hates the souls of men and
          causes more sorrow to the people of God than this Mr. Live-by-feeling.
          He that lives by feeling will be happy today, and unhappy tomorrow;
          and if our salvation depended upon our feelings, we should be lost one
          day and saved another, for they are as fickle as the weather, and go
          up and down like a barometer. We live by faith, and if that faith be
          weak, bless God that weak faith is faith, and that weak faith is true
          faith. If thou believest in Christ Jesus, though thy faith be as a
          grain of mustard seed, it will save thee, and it will, by-and-bye,
          grow into something stronger. A diamond is a diamond, and the smallest
          scrap of it is of the same nature as the Koh-i-noor, and he that hath
          but little faith hath faith for all that; and it is not great faith
          that is essential to salvation, but faith that links the soul to
          Christ; and that soul is, therefore, saved. Instead of mourning so
          much that thy faith is not strong, bless God that thou hast any faith
          at all, for if he sees that thou despisest the faith he has given
          thee, it may be long before he gives thee more. Prize that little, and
          when he sees that thou art so glad and thankful for that little, then
          will he multiply it and increase it, and thy faith shall mount even to
          the full assurance of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I hear you also add to all this the complaint that your other
          graces seem to be small too. "Oh," say you, "my patience is so little.
          If I have a little pain I begin to cry out. I was in hopes I should be
          able to bear it without murmuring. My courage is so little: the blush
          is on my cheek if anybody asks me about Christ -- I think I could
          hardly confess him before half a dozen, much less before the world. I
          am very weak indeed." Ah! I don't wonder. I have known some who have
          been strong by reason of years, and have still been lacking in that
          virtue. But where faith is weak, of course, the rest will be weak. A
          plant that has a weak root will naturally have a weak stem and then
          will have but weak fruit. Your weakness of faith sends a weakness
          through the whole. But for all this, though you are to seek for more
          faith, and consequently for more grace -- for stronger graces, yet do
          not despise what graces you have. Thank God for them, and pray that
          the few clusters that are now upon you, may be multiplied a
          thousand-fold to the praise of the glory of his grace. Thus I have
          tried to describe those who are passing through the day of small
          things.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the text says, "Who hath despised the day of small things?" Well,
          some have, but there is a great comfort in this -- God the Father has
          not. He has looked upon you -- you with little grace, and little love,
          and little faith, and he has not despised you. No, God is always near
          the feeble saint. If I saw a young man crossing a common alone, I
          should not be at all astonished, and I should not look round for his
          father. But I saw today, as I went home, a very tiny little tot right
          out on the Common -- a pretty little girl, and I thought, "The father
          or mother are near somewhere." And truly there was the father behind a
          tree, whom I had not seen. I was as good as sure that the little thing
          was not there all alone. And when I see a little weak child of God, I
          feel sure that God the Father is near, watching with wakeful eye, and
          tending with gracious care the feebleness of his new-born child. He
          does not despise you if you are resting on his promise. The humble and
          contrite have a word all to themselves in Scripture, that these he
          will not despise.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is another sweet and consoling thought that God the Son does not
          despise the day of small things. Jesus Christ does not, for you
          remember this word, "He shall carry the lambs in his bosom." We put
          that which we most prize nearest our heart, and this is what Jesus
          does. Some of us, perhaps, have outgrown the state in which we were
          lambs, but to ride in that heavenly carriage of the Saviour's bosom --
          we might well be content to go back and be lambs again. He does not
          despise the day of small things.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it is equally consolatory to reflect that the Holy Spirit does not
          despise the day of small things, for he it is who, having planted in
          the heart the grain of mustard seed, watches over it till it becomes a
          tree. He it is who, having seen the new-born child of grace, doth
          nurse, and feed, and tend it until it comes to the stature of a
          perfect man in Christ Jesus. The blessed Godhead despises not the weak
          believer. O weak believer, be consoled by this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who is it, then, that may despise the day of small things? Perhaps
          Satan has told you and whispered in your ear that such little grace as
          yours is not worth having, that such an insignificant plant as you are
          will surely be rooted up. Now let me tell you that Satan is a liar,
          for he himself does not despise the day of small things; and I am sure
          of that, because he always makes a dead set upon those who are just
          coming to Christ. As soon as ever he sees that the soul is a little
          wounded by conviction, as soon as ever he discovers that a heart
          begins to pray, he will assault it with fiercer temptations than ever.
          I have known him try to drive such a one to suicide, or to lead him
          into worse sin than he has ever committed before. He: --
        </p>
        <p>"Trembles when he sees</p>
        <p>The weakest saint upon his knees."</p>
        <p>
          He may tell you that the little grace in you is of no account, but he
          knows right well that it is the handful of corn on the top of the
          mountain, the fruit whereof shall shake like Lebanon. He knows it is
          the little grace in the heart that overthrows his kingdom there. "Ah!"
          say you, "but I have been greatly troubled lately because I have many
          friends that despise me, because though I can hardly say I am a
          believer, yet I have some desire towards God." What sort of friends
          are these? Are they worldly friends? Oh! Do not fret about what they
          say. It would never trouble me if I were an artist, if a blind man
          were to utter the sharpest criticism on my works. What does he know
          about it? And when an ungodly person begins to say about your piety
          that it is deficient and faulty, poor soul, let him say what he will
          -- it need not affect you. "Ah!" say you, "the persons that seem to
          despise me, and to put me out, and tell me that I am no child of God,
          are, I believe, Christians." Well then, do two things: first, lay what
          they say to you in a measure to heart, because it may be if God's
          children do not see in you the mark of a child, perhaps you are not a
          child. Let it lead you to examination. Oh! Dear friends, it is very
          easy to be self-deceived, and God may employ, perhaps, one of his
          servants to enlighten you upon this, and deliver you from a strong
          delusion. But, on the other hand, if you really do trust in your
          Saviour, if you have begun to pray, if you have some love to God, and
          any Christian treats you harshly as if he thought you a hypocrite,
          forgive him -- bear it. He has made a mistake. He would not do so if
          he knew you better. Say within yourself, "After all, if my brother
          does not know me, it is enough if my Father does. If my Father loves
          me, though my brother gives me the cold shoulder, I will be sorry for
          it, but it shall not break my heart. I will cling the closer to my
          Lord because his servants seem shy of me." Why, it is not much wonder,
          is it, that some Christians should be afraid of some of you converts,
          for think what you used to be a little while ago? Why, a mother hears
          her son say he is converted. A month or two ago she knew where he
          spent his evenings, and what were his habits of sin, and though she
          hopes it is so, she is afraid lest she should lead him to presumption,
          and she rejoices with trembling, and, perhaps, tells him more about
          her trembling than she does about her rejoicing. Why, the saints of
          old could not think Saul was converted at first. He was to be brought
          into the church meeting and received -- I will suppose the case. I
          should not wonder before he came, when he saw the elders, one of them
          would say, "Well, the young man seems to know something of the grace
          of God: there is certainly a change in him, but it is a remarkable
          thing that he should wish to join the very people he was persecuting;
          but, perhaps, it is a mere impulse. It may be, after all, that he will
          go back to his old companions." Do you wonder they should say so?
          Because I don't. I am not at all surprised. I am sorry when there are
          unjust suspicions, I am sorry when a genuine child of God is
          questioned; but I would not have you lay it much to heart. As I have
          said before, if your Father knows you, you need not be so broken in
          heart because your brother does not. Be glad that God does not despise
          the day of small things. And now let me say to you who are in this
          state of small things, that I earnestly trust that you will not
          yourselves despise the day of small things. "How can we do that?" say
          you. Why, you can do it by desponding. Why, I think there was a time
          when you would have been ready to leap for joy, if you had been told
          that you would have given you a little faith, and now you have got a
          little faith, instead of rejoicing, you are sighing, and moaning, and
          mourning. Do not do so. Be thankful for moonlight, and you shall get
          sunlight: be thankful for sunlight, and you shall get that light of
          heaven which is as the light of seven days. Do not despond lest you
          seem to despise the mercy which God has given you. A poor patient that
          has been very, very lame and weak, and could not rise from his bed, is
          at last able to walk with a stick. "Well," he says to himself, "I wish
          I could walk, and run, and leap as other men." Suppose he sits down
          and frets because he cannot. His physician might put his hand on his
          shoulder and say, "My good fellow, why, you ought to be thankful you
          can stand at all. A little while ago you know you could not stand
          upright. Be glad for what you have got: don't seem to despise what has
          been done for you." I say to every Christian here, while you long
          after strength, don't seem to despise the grace that God has bestowed,
          but rejoice and bless his name.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can despise the day of small things, again, by not seeking after
          more. "That is strange," say you. Well, a man who has got a little,
          and does not want more -- it looks as if he despised the little. He
          who has a little light, and does not ask for more light, does not care
          for light at all. You that have a little faith, and do not want more
          faith, do not value faith at all -- you are despising it. On the one
          hand, do not despond because you have the day of small things, but in
          the next place, do not stand still and be satisfied with what you
          have; but prove your value of the little by earnestly seeking after
          more grace. Do not despise the grace that God has given you, but bless
          God for it: and do this in the presence of his people. If you hold
          your tongue about your grace, and never let anyone know, surely it
          must be because you do not think it is worth saying anything about.
          Tell your brethren, tell your sisters, and they of the Lord's
          household, that the Lord hath done gracious things for you; and then
          it will be seen that you do not despise his grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now let us run over a thought or two about these small things in
          weak believers. Be it remembered that little faith is saving faith,
          and that the day of small things is a day of safe things. Be it
          remembered that it is natural that living things should begin small.
          The man is first a babe. The daylight is first of all twilight. It is
          by little and by little that we come unto the stature of men in Christ
          Jesus. The day of small things is not only natural, but promising.
          Small things are living things. Let them alone, and they grow. The day
          of small things has its beauty and its excellence. I have known some
          who in after years would have liked to have gone back to their first
          days. Oh! well do some of us remember when we would have gone over
          hedge and ditch to hear a sermon. We had not much knowledge, but oh!
          how we longed to know. We stood in the aisles then, and we never got
          tired. Now soft seats we need, and very comfortable places, and the
          atmosphere must neither be too hot nor too cold. We are getting dainty
          now perhaps; but in those first young days of spiritual life, what
          appetites we had for divine truth, and what zeal, what sacred fire was
          in our heart! True, some of it was wild fire, and, perhaps, the energy
          of the flesh mingled with the power of the spirit, but, for all that,
          God remembers the love of our espousals, and so do we remember it too.
          The mother loves her grown-up son, but sometimes she thinks she does
          not love him as she did when she could cuddle him in her arms. Oh! the
          beauty of a little child! Oh! the beauty of a lamb in the faith! I
          daresay, the farmer and the butcher like the sheep better than the
          lambs, but the lambs are best to look at, at any rate; and the rosebud
          -- there is a charm about it that there is not in the full-blown rose.
          And so in the day of small things there is a special excellence that
          we ought not to despise. Besides, small as grace may be in the heart,
          it is divine -- it is a spark from the ever-blazing sun. He is a
          partaker of the divine nature who has even a little living faith in
          Christ. And being divine, it is immortal. Not all the devils in hell
          could quench the feeblest spark of grace that ever dropped into the
          heart of man. If God has given thee faith as a grain of mustard seed,
          it will defy all earth and hell, all time and eternity, ever to
          destroy it. So there is much reason why we should not despise the day
          of small things.
        </p>
        <p>
          One word and I leave this point. You Christians, don't despise
          anybody, but specially do not despise any in whom you see even a
          little love to Christ. But do more -- look after them, look after the
          little ones. I think I have heard of a shepherd who had a remarkably
          fine flock of sheep, and he had a secret about them. He was often
          asked how it was that his flocks seemed so much to excel all others.
          At last he told the secret -- "I give my principal attention to the
          lambs." Now you elders of the church, and you my matronly sisters, you
          that know the Lord, and have known him for years, look up the lambs,
          search them out, and take a special care of them; and if they are well
          nurtured in their early days they will get a strength of spiritual
          constitution that will make them the joy of the Good Shepherd during
          the rest of their days. Now I leave that point. In the second place, I
          said that I would address a word or two to: --
        </p>
        <p>II. FEEBLE WORKERS</p>
        <p>
          Thank God, there are many workers here tonight, and maybe they will
          put themselves down as feeble. May the words I utter be an
          encouragement to them, and to feeble workers collectively. When a
          church begins, it is usually small; and the day of small things is a
          time of considerable anxiety and fear. I may be addressing some who
          are members of a newly-organised church. Dear brethren, do not despise
          the day of small things. Rest assured that God does not save by
          numbers, and that results are not in the spiritual kingdom in
          proportion to numbers. I have been reading lately with considerable
          care the life of John Wesley by two or three different authors in
          order to get as well as I could a fair idea of the good man; but one
          thing I have noticed -- that the beginnings of the work which has
          become so wonderfully large were very small indeed. Mr. Wesley and his
          first brethren were not rich people. Nearly all that joined him were
          poor. Here and there, there was a person of some standing, but the
          Methodists were the poor of the land. And his first preachers were not
          men of education. One or two were so, but the most were good outdoor
          preachers -- head preachers, magnificent preachers as God made them by
          his Spirit; but they were not men who had had the benefit of college
          training, or who were remarkable for ability. The Methodists had
          neither money nor eminent men at first, and their numbers were very
          few. During the whole life of that good man, which was protracted for
          so many years, the denomination did not attain any very remarkable
          size. They were few, and apparently feeble; but Methodism was never so
          glorious as it was at first, and there never were so many conversions,
          I believe, as in those early days. Now I speak sorrowfully. It is a
          great denomination. It abounds in wealth: I am glad it does. It has
          mighty orators: I rejoice it has. But it has no increase, no
          conversion. This year and other years it remains stationary. I do not
          say this because that is an exceptional denomination, for almost all
          others have the same tale. Year by year as the statistics come in, it
          is just this. "No increase -- hardly hold our ground." I use that as
          an illustration here. This church will get in precisely the same
          condition if we do not look out -- just the same state. When we have
          not the means we get the blessing, and when we seem to have the might
          and power, then the blessing does not come. Oh! may God send us
          poverty; may God send us lack of means, and take away our power of
          speech if it must be, and help us only to stammer, if we may only thus
          get the blessing. Oh! I crave to be useful to souls, and all the rest
          may go where it will. And each church must crave the same. "Not by
          might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord." Instead of
          despising the day of small things, we ought to be encouraged. It is by
          the small things that God seems to work, but the great things he does
          not often use. He won't have Gideon's great host -- let them go to
          their homes -- let the mass of them go. Bring them down to the water:
          pick out only the men that lap, and then there is a very few. You can
          tell them almost on your fingers' ends -- just two or three hundred
          men. Then Gideon shall go forth against the Midianites; and as the
          cake of barley bread smote the tent, and it lay along, so the sound of
          the sword of the Lord and of Gideon at the dead of night shall make
          the host to tremble, and the Lord God shall get to himself the
          victory. Never mind your feebleness, brethren, your fewness, your
          poverty, your want of ability. Throw your souls into God's cause, pray
          mightily, lay hold on the gates of heaven, stir heaven and earth,
          rather than be defeated in winning souls, and you will see results
          that will astonish you yet. "Who hath despised the day of small
          things?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Now take the case of each Christian individually. Every one of us
          ought to be at work for Christ, but the great mass of us cannot do
          great things. Don't despise, then, the day of little things. You can
          only give a penny. Now then, he that sat over by the treasury did not
          despise the widow's two mites that made a farthing. Your little
          thank-offering, if given from your heart, is as acceptable as if it
          had been a hundred times as much. Don't, therefore, neglect to do the
          little. Don't despise the day of small things. You can only give away
          a tract in the street. Don't say, "I won't do that." Souls have been
          saved by the distribution of tracts and sermons. Scatter them, scatter
          them -- they will be good seed. You know not where they may fall. You
          can only write a letter to a friend sometimes about Christ. Don't
          neglect to do it: write one tomorrow. Remember a playmate of yours;
          you may take liberties with him about his soul from your intimacy with
          him. Write to him about his state before God, and urge him to seek the
          Saviour. Who knows? -- a sermon may miss him, but a letter from the
          well-known school companion will reach his heart. Mother, it is only
          two or three little children at home that you have an influence over.
          Despise not the day of small things. Take them tomorrow; put your arms
          around their necks as they kneel by you -- pray, "God bless my boys
          and girls, and save them" -- tell them of Christ now. Oh! How well can
          mothers preach to children! I can never forget my mother's teaching.
          On the Sunday night, when we were at home, she would have us round the
          table and explain the Scriptures as we read, and then pray; and one
          night she left an impression upon my mind that never will be erased,
          when she said, "I have told you, my dear children, the way of
          salvation, and if you perish you will perish justly. I shall have to
          say 'Amen' to your condemnation if you are condemned"; and I could not
          bear that. Anybody else might say "Amen," but not my mother. Oh! You
          don't know -- you that have to deal with children -- what you may do.
          Despise not these little opportunities. Put a word in edgeways for
          Christ -- you that go about in trains, you that go into workshops and
          factories. If Christians were men who were all true to their colours,
          I think we should soon see a great change come over our great
          establishments. Speak up for Jesus -- be not ashamed of him, and
          because you can say but little, don't refuse, therefore, to say that,
          but rather say it over twenty times, and so make the little into much.
          Again, and again, and again, repeat the feeble stroke, and there shall
          come to be as much result from it as from one tremendous blow. God
          accepts your little works if they are done in faith in his dear Son.
          God will give success to your little works: God will educate you by
          your little works to do greater works; and your little works may call
          out others who shall do greater works by far than ever you shall be
          able to accomplish. Evangelists, go on preaching at the street corner
          -- you that visit the low lodging-houses, go on. Get into the room and
          talk of Jesus Christ there as you have done. You that go into the
          country towns on the Sabbath and speak on the village-greens of
          Christ, go on with it. I am glad to see you, but I am glad to miss you
          when I know you are about the Master's work. We don't want to keep the
          salt in the box: let it be rubbed into the putrid mass to stay the
          putrification. We don't want the seed forever in the corn-bin: let it
          be scattered and it will give us more. Oh! brethren and sisters, wake
          up if any of you are asleep. Don't let an ounce of strength in this
          church be wasted -- not a single grain of ability, either in the way
          of doing, or praying, or giving, or holy living. Spend and be spent,
          for who hath despised the day of small things? The Lord encourage weak
          believers, and the Lord accept the efforts of feeble workers, and send
          to both his richest benediction for Christ's sake. Amen.
