        </p>
        <p>
          WHEN first it was my duty to occupy this pulpit, and preach in this
          hall, my congregation assumed the appearance of an irregular mass of
          persons collected from all the streets of this city to listen to the
          Word. Twas then simply an evangelist, preaching to many who had not
          heard the Gospel before. By the grace of God, the most blessed change
          has taken place; and now, instead of having an irregular multitude
          gathered together, my congregation is as fixed as that of any minister
          in the whole city of London. I can from this pulpit observe the
          countenance of my friends, who have occupied the same places, as
          nearly as possible, for these many months; and I have the privilege
          and the pleasure of knowing that a very large proportion, certainly
          three-fourths of the persons who meet together here, are not persons
          who stray hither from curiosity, but are my regular and constant
          hearers. And observe, that my character also has been changed. From
          being an evangelist, it is now my business to become your pastor. You
          were once a motley group assembled to listen to me, but now we are
          bound together by the ties of love; through association we have grown
          to love and respect each other, and now you have become the sheep of
          my pasture, and members of my flock; and I have now the privilege of
          assuming the position of a pastor in this place, as well as in the
          chapel where I labour in the evening. I think, then, it will strike
          the judgment of every person, that as both the congregation and office
          have now changed, the teaching itself should in some measure suffer a
          difference. It has been my wont to address you from the simple truths
          of the Gospel; I have very seldom, in this place, attempted to dive
          into the deep things of God. A text which I have thought suitable for
          my congregation in the evening, I should not have made the subject of
          discussion in this place in the morning. There are many high and
          mysterious doctrines which I have often taken the opportunity of
          handling in my own place, that I have not taken the liberty of
          introducing here, regarding you as a company of people casually
          gathered together to hear the Word. But now, since the circumstances
          are changed, the teaching will be changed also. I shall not now simply
          confine myself to the doctrine of faith, or the teaching of believer's
          baptism; I shall not stay upon the surface of matters, but shall
          venture, as God shall guide me, to enter into those things that lie at
          the basis of the religion that we hold so dear. I shall not blush to
          preach before you the doctrine of God's Divine Sovereignty; I shall
          not stagger to preach in the most unreserved and unguarded manner the
          doctrine of election. I shall not be afraid to propound the great
          truth of the final perseverance of the saints; I shall not withhold
          that undoubted truth of Scripture, the effectual calling of God's
          elect; I shall endeavour, as God shall help me, to keep back nothing
          from you who have become my flock. Seeing that many of you have now
          |tasted that the Lord is gracious,| we will endeavour to go through
          the whole system of the doctrines of grace, that saints may be edified
          and built up in their most holy faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          I begin this morning with the doctrine of Redemption. |He gave his
          life a ransom for many.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of Redemption is one of the most important doctrines of
          the system of faith. A mistake on this point will inevitably lead to a
          mistake through the entire system of our belief.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, you are aware that there are different theories of Redemption.
          All Christians hold that Christ died to redeem, but all Christians do
          not teach the same redemption. We differ as to the nature of
          atonement, and as to the design of redemption. For instance, the
          Arminian holds that Christ, when He died, did not die with an intent
          to save any particular person; and they teach that Christ's death does
          not in itself secure, beyond doubt, the salvation of any one man
          living. They believe that Christ died to make the salvation of all men
          possible, or that by the doing of something else, any man who pleases
          may attain unto eternal life; consequently, they are obliged to hold
          that if man's will would not give way and voluntarily surrender to
          grace, then Christ's atonement would be unavailing. They hold that
          there was no particularity and speciality in the death of Christ.
          Christ died, according to them, as much for Judas in Hell as for Peter
          who mounted to Heaven. They believe that for those who are consigned
          to eternal fire, there was a true and real a redemption made as for
          those who now stand before the throne of the Most High. Now, we
          believe no such thing. We hold that Christ, when He died, had an
          object in view, and that object will most assuredly, and beyond a
          doubt, be accomplished. We measure the design of Christ's death by the
          effect of it. If any one asks us, |What did Christ design to do by His
          death?| we answer that question by asking him another -- |What has
          Christ done, or what will Christ do by His death?| For we declare that
          the measure of the effect of Christ's love, is the measure of the
          design of it. We cannot so belie our reason as to think that the
          intention of Almighty God could be frustrated, or that the design of
          so great a thing as the atonement, can by any way whatever, be missed
          of. We hold -- we are not afraid to say that we believe -- that Christ
          came into this world with the intention of saving |a multitude which
          no man can number;| and we believe that as the result of this, every
          person for whom He died must, beyond the shadow of a doubt, be
          cleansed from sin, and stand, washed in blood, before the Father's
          throne. We do not believe that Christ made any effectual atonement for
          those who are for ever damned; we dare not think that the blood of
          Christ was ever shed with the intention of saving those whom God
          foreknew never could be saved, and some of whom were even in Hell when
          Christ, according to some men's account, died to save them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have thus just stated our theory of redemption, and hinted at the
          differences which exist between two great parties in the professing
          church. It shall be now my endeavour to show the greatness of the
          redemption of Christ Jesus; and by so doing, I hope to be enabled by
          God's Spirit, to bring out the whole of the great system of
          redemption, so that it may be understood by us all, even if all of us
          cannot receive it. For you must bear this in mind, that some of you,
          perhaps, may be ready to dispute things which I assert; but you will
          remember that this is nothing to me; I shall at all times teach those
          things which I hold to be true, without let or hindrance from any man
          breathing. You have the like liberty to do the same in your own
          places, and to preach your own views in your own assemblies, as I
          claim the right to preach mine, fully, and without hesitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ Jesus |gave his life a ransom for many;| and by that ransom He
          wrought out for us a great redemption. I shall endeavour to show the
          greatness of this redemption, measuring it in five ways. We shall note
          its greatness, first of all from the heinousness of our own guilt,
          from which He has delivered us; secondly, we shall measure His
          redemption by the sternness of divine justice; thirdly, we shall
          measure it by the price which He paid, the pangs which He endured;
          then we shall endeavour to magnify it, by noting the deliverance which
          He actually wrought out; and we shall close by noticing the vast
          number for whom this redemption is made, who in our text are described
          as |many.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then we shall see that the redemption of Christ was no
          little thing, if we do but measure it, first by OUR OWN SINS. My
          brethren, for a moment look at the hole of the pit whence ye were
          digged, and the quarry whence you were hewn. Ye, who have been washed,
          and cleansed, and sanctified, pause for a moment, and look back at the
          former state of your ignorance; the sins in which you indulged, the
          crimes into which you were hurried, the continual rebellion against
          God in which it was your habit to live. One sin can ruin a soul for
          ever; it is not in the power of the human mind to grasp the infinity
          of evil that slumbereth in the bowels of one solitary sin. There is a
          very infinity of guilt couched in one transgression against the
          majesty of Heaven. If, then, you and I had sinned but once, nothing
          but an atonement infinite in value could ever have washed away the sin
          and made satisfaction for it. But has it been once that you and I have
          transgressed? Nay, my brethren, our iniquities are more in number than
          the hairs of our head; they have mightily prevailed against us. We
          might as well attempt to number the sands upon the sea-shore, or count
          the drops which in their aggregate do make the ocean, as attempt to
          count the transgressions which have marked our lives. Let us go back
          to our childhood. How early we began to sin! How we disobeyed our
          parents, and even then learned to make our mouth the house of lies! In
          our childhood, how full of wantonness and waywardness we were!
          Headstrong and giddy, we preferred our own way, and burst through all
          restraint which godly parents put upon us. Nor did our youth sober us.
          Wildly we dashed, many of us, into the very midst of the dance of sin.
          We became leaders in iniquity; we not only sinned ourselves, but we
          taught others to sin. And as for your manhood, ye that have entered
          upon the prime of life, ye may be more outwardly sober, ye may be
          somewhat free from the dissipation of your youth; but how little has
          the man become bettered! Unless the sovereign grace of God hath
          renewed us, we are now no better than we were when we began; and even
          if it has operated, we have still sins to repent of, for we all lay
          our mouths in the dust, and cast ashes on our head, and cry, |Unclean!
          Unclean!| And oh! ye that lean wearily on your staff, the support of
          your old age, have ye not sins still clinging to your garments? Are
          your lives as white as the snowy hairs that crown your head? Do you
          not still feel that transgression besmears the skirts of your robe,
          and mars its spotlessness? How often are you now plunged into the
          ditch, till your own clothes do abhor you! Cast your eyes over the
          sixty, the seventy, the eighty years, during which God hath spared
          your lives; and can ye for a moment think it possible, that ye can
          number up your innumerable transgressions, or compute the weight of
          the crimes which you have committed? O ye stars of Heaven! the
          astronomers may measure your distance and tell your height, but O ye
          sins of mankind! ye surpass all thought. O ye lofty mountains! the
          home of the tempest, the birthplace of the storm! man may climb your
          summits and stand wonderingly upon your snows; but ye hills of sin! ye
          tower higher than our thoughts; ye chasms of transgressions! ye are
          deeper than our imagination dares to dive. Do you accuse me of
          slandering human nature? It is because you know it not. If God had
          once manifested your heart to yourself, you would bear me witness,
          that so far from exaggerating, my poor words fail to describe the
          desperateness of our evil. Oh! if we could each of us look into our
          hearts today -- if our eyes could be turned within, so as to see the
          iniquity that is graven as with the point of the diamond upon our
          stony hearts, we should then say to the minister, that however he may
          depict the desperateness of guilt, yet can he not by any means surpass
          it. How great then, beloved, must be the ransom of Christ, when He
          saved us from all these sins! The men for whom Jesus died, however
          great their sin, when they believe, are justified from all their
          transgressions. Though they may have indulged in every vice and every
          lust which Satan could suggest, and which human nature could perform,
          yet once believing, all their guilt is washed away. Year after year
          may have coated them with blackness, till their sin hath become of
          double dye; but in one moment of faith, one triumphant moment of
          confidence in Christ, the great redemption takes away the guilt of
          numerous years. Nay, more, if it were possible for all the sins that
          men have done, in thought, or word, or deed, since worlds were made,
          or time began, to meet on one poor head -- the great redemption is
          all-sufficient to take all these sins away, and wash the sinner whiter
          than the driven snow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! who shall measure the heights of the Saviour's all-sufficiency?
          First, tell how high is sin, and, then, remember that as Noah's flood
          prevailed over the tops of earth's mountains, so the flood of Christ's
          redemption prevails over the tops of the mountains of our sins. In
          Heaven's courts there are today men that once were murderers, and
          thieves, and drunkards, and whoremongers, and blasphemers, and
          persecutors; but they have been washed -- they have been sanctified.
          Ask them whence the brightness of their robes hath come, and where
          their purity hath been achieved, and they, with united breath, tell
          you that they have washed their robes, and made them white in the
          blood of the Lamb. O ye troubled consciences! O ye weary and
          heavy-laden ones! O ye that are groaning on account of sin! the great
          redemption now proclaimed to you is all-sufficient for your wants; and
          though your numerous sins exceed the stars that deck the sky, here is
          an atonement made for them all -- a river which can overflow the whole
          of them, and carry them away from you for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, then, is the first measure of the atonement -- the greatness of
          our guilt.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, secondly, we must measure the great redemption BY THE
          STERNNESS OF DIVINE JUSTICE. |God is love,| always loving; but my next
          proposition does not at all interfere with this assertion. God is
          sternly just, inflexibly severe in His dealings with mankind. The God
          of the Bible is not the God of some men's imagination, Who thinks so
          little of sin that He passes it by without demanding any punishment
          for it. He is not the God of the men who imagine that our
          transgressions are such little things, such mere peccadilloes that the
          God of Heaven winks at them, and suffers them to die forgotten. No;
          Jehovah, Israel's God, hath declared concerning Himself, |The Lord thy
          God is a jealous God.| It is His own declaration, |I will by no means
          clear the guilty.| |The soul that sinneth, it shall die.| Learn ye, my
          friends, to look upon God as being as severe in His justice as if He
          were not loving, and yet as loving as if He were not severe. His love
          does not diminish His justice, nor does His justice, in the least
          degree, make warfare upon His love. The two things are sweetly linked
          together in the atonement of Christ. But, mark, we can never
          understand the fullness of the atonement till we have first grasped
          the Scriptural truth of God's immense justice. There was never an ill
          word spoken, nor an ill thought conceived, nor an evil deed done, for
          which God will not have punishment from some one or another. He will
          either have satisfaction from you, or else from Christ. If you have no
          atonement to bring through Christ, you must for ever lie paying the
          debt which you never can pay, in eternal misery; for as surely as God
          is God, He will sooner lose His Godhead than suffer one sin to go
          unpunished, or one particle of rebellion unrevenged. You may say that
          this character of God is cold, and stern, and severe. I cannot help
          what you say of it; it is nevertheless true. Such is the God of the
          Bible; and though we repeat it is true that He is love, it is no more
          true that He is love than that He is full of justice, for every good
          thing meets in God, and is carried to perfection, whilst love reaches
          to consummate loveliness, justice reaches to the sternness of
          inflexibility in Him. He has no bend, no warp in His character; no
          attribute so predominates as to cast a shadow upon the other. Love
          hath its full sway, and justice hath no narrower limit than His love.
          Oh! then, beloved, think how great must have been the substitution of
          Christ, when it satisfied God for all the sins of His people. For
          man's sin God demands eternal punishment; and God hath prepared a Hell
          into which He casts those who die impenitent. Oh! my brethren, can ye
          think what must have been the greatness of the atonement which was the
          substitution for all this agony which God would have cast upon us, if
          He had not poured it upon Christ. Look! look! look with solemn eye
          through the shades that part us from the world of spirits, and see
          that house of misery which men call Hell! Ye cannot endure the
          spectacle. Remember that in that place there are spirits for ever
          paying their debt to divine justice; but though some of them have been
          for these four thousand years sweltering in the flame, they are no
          nearer a discharge than when they began; and when ten thousand times
          ten thousand years shall have rolled away, they will no more have made
          satisfaction to God for their guilt than they have done up till now.
          And now can you grasp the thought of the greatness of your Saviour's
          mediation when He paid your debt, and paid it all at once; so that
          there now remaineth not one farthing of debt owing from Christ's
          people to their God, except a debt of love. To justice the believer
          oweth nothing; though he owed originally so much that eternity would
          not have been long enough to suffice for the paying of it, yet, in one
          moment Christ did pay it all, so that the man who believeth is
          entirely justified from all guilt, and set free from all punishment,
          through what Jesus hath done. Think ye, then, how great His atonement
          if He hath done all this.
        </p>
        <p>
          I must just pause here, and utter another sentence. There are times
          when God the Holy Spirit shows to men the sternness of justice in
          their own consciences. There is a man here today who has just been cut
          to the heart with a sense of sin. He was once a free man, a libertine,
          in bondage to none; but now the arrow of the Lord sticks fast in his
          heart, and he has come under a bondage worse than that of Egypt. I see
          him today, he tells me that his guilt haunts him everywhere. The Negro
          slave, guided by the pole star, may escape the cruel ties of his
          master and reach another land where he may be free; but this man feels
          that if he were to wander the wide world over he could not escape from
          guilt. He that hath been bound by many irons, can yet find a file that
          can unbind him and set him at liberty; but this man tells you that he
          has tried prayers and tears and good works, but cannot escape the
          gyves from his wrist; he feels as a lost sinner still, and
          emancipation, do what he may, seems to him impossible. The captive in
          the dungeon is sometimes free in thought, though not in body; through
          his dungeon walls his spirit leaps, and flies to the stars, free as
          the eagle that is no man's slave. But this man is a slave in his
          thoughts; he cannot think one bright, one happy thought. His soul is
          cast down within him; the iron has entered into his spirit, and he is
          sorely afflicted. The captive sometimes forgets his slavery in sleep,
          but this man cannot sleep; by night he dreams of hell, by day he seems
          to feel it; he bears a burning furnace of flame within his heart, and
          do what he may he cannot quench it. He has been confirmed, he has been
          baptized, he takes the sacrament, he attends a church or he frequents
          a chapel, he regards every rubric and obeys every canon, but the fire
          burns still. He gives his money to the poor, he is ready to give his
          body to be burned, he feeds the hungry, he visits the sick, he clothes
          the naked, but the fire burns still, and do what he may he cannot
          quench it. O, ye sons of weariness and woe, this that you feel is
          God's justice in full pursuit of you, and happy are you that you feel
          this, for now to you I preach this glorious Gospel of the blessed God.
          You are the man for whom Jesus Christ has died; for you He has
          satisfied stern justice; and now all you have to do to obtain peace of
          conscience, is just to say to your adversary who pursues you, |Look
          you there! Christ died for me; my good works would not stop you, my
          tears would not appease you: look you there! There stands the cross;
          there hangs the bleeding God! Hark to His death-shriek! See Him die!
          Art thou not satisfied now?| And when thou hast done that, thou shalt
          have the peace of God which passeth all understanding, which shall
          keep thy heart and mind through Jesus Christ thy Lord; and then shalt
          thou know the greatness of His atonement.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. In the third place, we may measure the greatness of Christ's
          Redemption by THE PRICE HE PAID. It is impossible for us to know how
          great were the pangs of our Saviour; but yet some glimpse of them will
          afford us a little idea of the greatness of the price He paid for us.
          O Jesus, who shall describe thine agony?
        </p>
        <p>|Come, all ye springs,</p>
        <p>Dwell in my head and eyes; come, clouds and rain!</p>
        <p>My grief hath need of all the wat'ry things,</p>
        <p>That nature hath produc'd. Let ev'ry vein</p>
        <p>Suck up a river to supply mine eyes,</p>
        <p>My weary weeping eyes; too dry for me,</p>
        <p>Unless they get new conduits, new supplies,</p>
        <p>To bear them out, and with my state agree.|</p>
        <p>
          O Jesus! thou wast a sufferer from thy birth, a man of sorrows and
          grief's acquaintance. Thy sufferings fell on thee in one perpetual
          shower, until the last dread hour of darkness. Then not in a shower,
          but in a cloud, a torrent, a cataract of grief, thine agonies did dash
          upon thee. See Him yonder! It is a night of frost and cold; but He is
          all abroad. It is night; He sleeps not, but He is in prayer. Hark to
          His groans! Did ever man wrestle as He wrestles? Go and look in His
          face! Was ever such suffering depicted upon mortal countenance as you
          can there behold? Hear His own words: |My soul is exceeding sorrowful,
          even unto death.| He rises: He is seized by traitors and is dragged
          away. Let us step to the place when just now He was engaged in agony.
          O God! and what is this we see? What is this that stains the ground?
          It is blood! Whence came it? Had He some wound which oozed afresh
          through His dire struggle? Ah! no. |He sweat, as it were, great drops
          of blood, falling down to the ground.| O agonies that surpass the word
          by which we name you! O sufferings that cannot be compassed in
          language! What could ye be that thus could work upon the Saviour's
          blessed frame, and force a bloody sweat to fall from His entire body?
          This is the beginning; this is the opening of the tragedy. Follow Him
          mournfully, thou sorrowing church, to witness the consummation of it.
          He is hurried through the streets; He is dragged first to one bar and
          then to another; He is cast and condemned before the Sanhedrin; He is
          mocked by Herod; He is tried by Pilate. His sentence is pronounced --
          |Let Him be crucified!| And now the tragedy cometh to its height. His
          back is bared; He is tied to the low Roman column; the bloody scourge
          ploughs furrows on His back, and with one stream of blood His back is
          red -- a crimson robe that proclaims Him emperor of misery. He is
          taken into the guard room; His eyes are bound, and then they buffet
          Him, and say, |Prophesy who it was that smote thee?| They spit into
          His face; they plait a crown of thorns, and press His temples with it;
          they array Him in a purple robe; they bow their knees, and mock Him.
          All silently He sits; He answers not a word. |When He was reviled, He
          reviled not again,| but committed Himself unto Him whom He came to
          serve. And now they take Him, and with many a jeer and jibe they drive
          Him from the place, and hurry Him through the streets. Emaciated by
          continual fastings, and depressed with agony of spirit He stumbles
          beneath His cross. Daughters of Jerusalem! He faints in your streets.
          They raise Him up; they put His cross upon another's shoulders, and
          they urge Him on, perhaps with many a spear-prick, till at last He
          reaches the mount of doom. Rough soldiers seize Him, and hurl Him on
          His back; the transverse wood is laid beneath Him; His arms are
          stretched to reach the necessary distance; the nails are grasped; four
          hammers at one moment drive four nails through the tenderest parts of
          His body; and there He lies upon His own place of execution dying on
          His cross. It is not done yet. The cross is lifted by the rough
          soldiers. There is the socket prepared for it. It is dashed into its
          place: they fill up the place with earth; and there it stands.
        </p>
        <p>
          But see the Saviour's limbs, how they quiver! Every bone has been put
          out of joint by the dashing of the cross in that socket! How He weeps!
          How He sighs! How He sobs! Nay, more hark how at last He shrieks in
          agony, |My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?| O sun, no wonder
          thou didst shut thine eye, and look no longer upon a deed so cruel! O
          rocks! no wonder that ye did melt and rend your hearts with sympathy,
          when your Creator died! Never man suffered as this man suffered, Even
          death itself relented, and many of those who had been in their graves
          arose and came into the city. This, however, is but the outward.
          Believe me, brethren, the inward was far worse. What our Saviour
          suffered in His body was nothing compared to what He endured in His
          soul. You cannot guess, and I cannot help you to guess, what He
          endured within. Suppose for one moment -- to repeat a sentence I have
          often used -- suppose a man who has passed into Hell -- suppose his
          eternal torment could all be brought into one hour; and then suppose
          it could be multiplied by the number of the saved, which is a number
          past all human enumeration. Can you now think what a vast aggregate of
          misery there would have been in the sufferings of all God's people, if
          they had been punished through all eternity? And recollect that Christ
          had to suffer an equivalent for all the hells of all His redeemed. I
          can never express that thought better than by using those oft-repeated
          words: it seemed as if Hell were put into His cup; He seized it, and,
          |At one tremendous draught of love, He drank damnation dry.| So that
          there was nothing left of all the pangs and miseries of Hell for His
          people ever to endure. I say not that He suffered the same, but He did
          endure an equivalent for all this, and gave God the satisfaction for
          all the sins of all His people, and consequently gave Him an
          equivalent for all their punishment. Now can ye dream, can ye guess
          the great redemption of our Lord Jesus Christ?
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. I shall be very brief upon the next head. The fourth way of
          measuring the Saviour's agonies is this: we must compute them by THE
          GLORIOUS DELIVERANCE WHICH HE HAS EFFECTED.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rise up, believer; stand up in thy place, and this day testify to the
          greatness of what the Lord hath done for thee! Let me tell it for
          thee. I will tell thy experience and mine in one breath. Once my soul
          was laden with sin; I had revolted against God, and grievously
          transgressed. The terrors of the law gat hold upon me; the pangs of
          conviction seized me. I saw myself guilty. I looked to Heaven, and I
          saw an angry God sworn to punish me; I looked beneath me and I saw a
          yawning Hell ready to devour me. I sought by good works to satisfy my
          conscience; but all in vain, I endeavoured by attending to the
          ceremonies of religion to appease the pangs that I felt within; but
          all without effect. My soul was exceeding sorrowful, almost unto
          death. I could have said with the ancient mourner, |My soul chooseth
          strangling and death rather than life.| This was the great question
          that always perplexed me: |I have sinned; God must punish me; how can
          He be just if He does not? Then, since He is just, what is to become
          of me?| At last mine eyes turned to that sweet word which says, |The
          blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth from all sin.| I took that
          text to my chamber; I sat there and meditated. I saw one hanging on a
          cross. It was my Lord Jesus. There was the thorn-crown, and there the
          emblems of unequalled and peerless misery. I looked upon Him, and my
          thoughts recalled that word which says, |This is a faithful saying,
          and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world
          to save sinners.| Then said I within myself, |Did this man die for
          sinners? I am a sinner; then He died for me. Those He died for He will
          save. He died for sinners; I am a sinner; He died for me; He will save
          me.| My soul relied upon that truth. I looked to Him, and as I |viewed
          the flowing of His soul-redeeming blood,| my spirit rejoiced, for I
          could say,
        </p>
        <p>|Nothing in my hands I bring,</p>
        <p>Simply to this cross I cling;</p>
        <p>Naked look to Him for dress;</p>
        <p>Helpless come to Him for grace!</p>
        <p>Black, I to this fountain fly;</p>
        <p>Wash me, Saviour, or I die!|</p>
        <p>
          And now, believer, you shall tell the rest. The moment that you
          believed, your burden rolled from your shoulder, and you became light
          as air. Instead of darkness you had light; for the garments of
          heaviness you had the robes of praise. Who shall tell your joy since
          then? You have sung on earth hymns of Heaven, and in your peaceful
          soul you have anticipated the eternal Sabbath of the redeemed. Because
          you have believed you have entered into rest. Yes, tell it the wide
          world over; they that believe, by Jesus' death are justified from all
          things from which they could not be freed by the works of the law.
          Tell it in Heaven, that none can lay anything to the charge of Gods'
          elect. Tell it upon earth, that God's redeemed are free from sin in
          Jehovah's sight. Tell it even in Hell, that God's elect can never come
          there; for Christ hath died for them, and who is he that shall condemn
          them?
        </p>
        <p>
          V. I have hurried over that, to come to the last point, which is the
          sweetest of all. Jesus Christ, we are told in our text, came into the
          world |to give his life a ransom for many.| The greatness of Christ's
          redemption may be measured by the EXTENT OF THE DESIGN OF IT. He gave
          His life |a ransom for many.| I must now return to that controverted
          point again. We are often told (I mean those of us who are commonly
          nicknamed by the title of Calvinists -- and we are not very much
          ashamed of that; we think that Calvin, after all, knew more about the
          Gospel than almost any man who has ever lived, uninspired), we are
          often told that we limit the atonement of Christ, because we say that
          Christ has not made a satisfaction for all men, or all men would be
          saved. Now, our reply to this is, that, on the other hand, our
          opponents limit it: we do not. The Arminians say, Christ died for all
          men. Ask them what they mean by it. Did Christ die so as to secure the
          salvation of all men? They say, |No, certainly not.| We ask them the
          next question -- Did Christ die so as to secure the salvation of any
          man in particular? They answer |No.| They are obliged to admit this,
          if they are consistent. They say, |No; Christ has died that any man
          may be saved if| -- and then follow certain conditions of salvation.
          We say, then, we will go back to the old statement -- Christ did not
          die so as beyond a doubt to secure the salvation of anybody, did He?
          You must say |No;| you are obliged to say so, for you believe that
          even after a man has been pardoned, he may yet fall from grace, and
          perish. Now, who is it that limits the death of Christ? Why, you. You
          say that Christ did not die so as to infallibly secure the salvation
          of anybody. We beg your pardon, when you say we limit Christ's death;
          we say, |No, my dear sir, it is you that do it.| We say Christ so died
          that He infallibly secured the salvation of a multitude that no man
          can number, who through Christ's death not only may be saved but are
          saved, must be saved, and cannot by any possibility run the hazard of
          being anything but saved. You are welcome to your atonement; you may
          keep it. We will never renounce ours for the sake of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, beloved, when you hear any one laughing or jeering at a limited
          atonement, you may tell him this. General atonement is like a great
          wide bridge with only half an arch; it does not go across the stream:
          it only professes to go half way; it does not secure the salvation of
          anybody. Now, I had rather put my foot upon a bridge as narrow as
          Hungerford, which went all the way across, than on a bridge that was
          as wide as the world, if it did not go all the way across the stream.
          I am told it is my duty to say that all men have been redeemed, and I
          am told that there is a Scriptural warrant for it -- |Who gave himself
          a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.| Now, that looks like a
          very, very great argument indeed on the other side of the question.
          For instance, look here. |The whole world is gone after Him.| Did all
          the world go after Christ? |Then went all Judea, and were baptized of
          him in Jordan.| Was all Judea, or all Jerusalem baptized in Jordan?
          |Ye are of God, little children,| and |the whole world lieth in the
          wicked one.| Does |the whole world| there mean everybody? If so, how
          was it, then, that there were some who were |of God?| The words
          |world| and |all| are used in seven or eight senses in Scripture; and
          it is very rarely that |all| means all persons, taken individually.
          The words are generally used to signify that Christ has redeemed some
          of all sorts -- some Jews, some Gentiles, some rich, some poor, and
          has not restricted His redemption to either Jew or Gentile.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leaving controversy, however, I will now answer a question. Tell me,
          then, sir, whom did Christ die for? Will you answer me a question or
          two, and I will tell you whether He died for you. Do you want a
          Saviour? Do you feel that you need a Saviour? Are you this morning
          conscious of sin? Has the Holy Spirit taught you that you are lost?
          Then Christ died for you and you will be saved. Are you this morning
          conscious that you have no hope in the world but Christ? Do you feel
          that you of yourself cannot offer an atonement that can satisfy God's
          justice? Have you given up all confidence in yourselves? And can you
          say upon your bended knees, |Lord, save, or I perish|? Christ died for
          you. If you are saying this morning, |I am as good as I ought to be; I
          can get to Heaven by my own good works,| then, remember, the Scripture
          says of Jesus, |I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to
          repentance.| So long as you are in that state I have no atonement to
          preach to you. But if this morning you feel guilty, wretched,
          conscious of your guilt, and are ready to take Christ to be your only
          Saviour, I can not only say to you that you may be saved, but what is
          better still, that you will be saved. When you are stripped of
          everything, but hope in Christ, when you are prepared to come
          empty-handed and take Christ to be your all, and to be yourself
          nothing at all, then you may look up to Christ, and you may say, |Thou
          dear, Thou bleeding Lamb of God! thy griefs were endured for me; by
          thy stripes I am healed, and by thy sufferings I am pardoned.| And
          then see what peace of mind you will have; for if Christ has died for
          you, you cannot be lost. God will not punish twice for one thing. If
          God punished Christ for your sin, He will never punish you. |Payment,
          God's justice cannot demand, first, at the bleeding surety's hand, and
          then again at mine.| We can today, if we believe in Christ, march to
          the very throne of God, stand there, and if it is said, |Art thou
          guilty?| we can say, |Yes, guilty.| But if the question is put, |What
          have you to say why you should not be punished for your guilt?| We can
          answer, |Great God, Thy justice and Thy love are both guarantees that
          Thou wilt not punish us for sin; for didst Thou not punish Christ for
          sin for us? How canst Thou, then, be just -- how canst Thou be God at
          all, if Thou dost punish Christ the substitute, and then punish man
          himself afterwards?| Your only question is, |Did Christ die for me?|
          And the only answer we can give is -- |This is a faithful saying, and
          worthy of all acceptation, that Christ came into the world to save
          sinners.| Can you write your name down among the sinners -- not among
          the complimentary sinners, but among those that feel it, bemoan it,
          lament it, seek mercy on account of it? Are you a sinner? That felt,
          that known, that professed, you are now invited to believe that Jesus
          Christ died for you, because you are a sinner; and you are bidden to
          cast yourself upon this great immovable rock, and find eternal
          security in the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
