          1. Moreover, the prophets indicate in the fullest manner that God
          stood in no need of their slavish obedience, but that it was upon
          their own account that He enjoined certain observances in the law. And
          again, that God needed not their oblation, but [merely demanded it],
          on account of man himself who offers it, the Lord taught distinctly,
          as I have pointed out. For when He perceived them neglecting
          righteousness, and abstaining from the love of God, and imagining that
          God was to be propitiated by sacrifices and the other typical
          observances, Samuel did even thus speak to them: "God does not desire
          whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices, but He will have His voice to be
          hearkened to. Behold, a ready obedience is better than sacrifice, and
          to hearken than the fat of rams." David also says: "Sacrifice and
          oblation Thou didst not desire, but mine ears hast Thou perfected;
          burnt-offerings also for sin Thou hast not required." He thus teaches
          them that God desires obedience, which renders them secure, rather
          than sacrifices and holocausts, which avail them nothing towards
          righteousness; and [by this declaration] he prophesies the new
          covenant at the same time. Still clearer, too, does he speak of these
          things in the fiftieth Psalm: "For if Thou hadst desired sacrifice,
          then would I have given it: Thou wilt not delight in burnt-offerings.
          The sacrifice of God is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart
          the Lord will not despise." Because, therefore, God stands in need of
          nothing, He declares in the preceding Psalm: "I will take no calves
          out of thine house, nor he-goats out of thy fold. For Mine are all the
          beasts of the earth, the herds and the oxen on the mountains: I know
          all the fowls of heaven, and the various tribes of the field are Mine.
          If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is Mine, and
          the fulness thereof. Shall I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the
          blood of goats?" Then, lest it might be supposed that He refused these
          things in His anger, He continues, giving him (man) counsel: "Offer
          unto God the sacrifice of praise, and pay thy vows to the Most High;
          and call upon Me in the day of thy trouble, and I will deliver thee,
          and thou shalt glorify Me;" rejecting, indeed, those things by which
          sinners imagined they could propitiate God, and showing that He does
          Himself stand in need of nothing; but He exhorts and advises them to
          those things by which man is justified and draws nigh to God. This
          same declaration does Esaias make: "To what purpose is the multitude
          of your sacrifices unto Me? saith the Lord. I am full." And when He
          had repudiated holocausts, and sacrifices, and oblations, as likewise
          the new moons, and the sabbaths, and the festivals, and all the rest
          of the services accompanying these, He continues, exhorting them to
          what pertained to salvation: "Wash you, make you clean, take away
          wickedness from your hearts from before mine eyes: cease from your
          evil ways, learn to do well, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed,
          judge the fatherless, plead for the widow; and come, let us reason
          together, saith the Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. For it was not because He was angry, like a man, as many venture to
          say, that He rejected their sacrifices; but out of compassion to their
          blindness, and with the view of suggesting to them the true sacrifice,
          by offering which they shall appease God, that they may receive life
          from Him. As He elsewhere declares: "The sacrifice to God is an
          afflicted heart: a sweet savour to God is a heart glorifying Him who
          formed it." For if, when angry, He had repudiated these sacrifices of
          theirs, as if they were persons unworthy to obtain His compassion, He
          would not certainly have urged these same things upon them as those by
          which they might be saved. But inasmuch as God is merciful, He did not
          cut them off from good counsel. For after He had said by Jeremiah, "To
          what purpose bring ye Me incense from Saba, and cinnamon from a far
          country? Your whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices are not acceptable
          to Me;" He proceeds: "Hear the word of the Lord, all Judah. These
          things saith the Lord, the God of Israel, Make straight your ways and
          your doings, and I will establish you in this place. Put not your
          trust in lying words, for they will not at all profit you, saying, The
          temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, it is [here]."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. And again, when He points out that it was not for this that He led
          them out of Egypt, that they might offer sacrifice to Him, but that,
          forgetting the idolatry of the Egyptians, they should be able to hear
          the voice of the Lord, which was to them salvation and glory, He
          declares by this same Jeremiah: "Thus saith the Lord; Collect together
          your burnt-offerings with your sacrifices and eat flesh. For I spake
          not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that I brought
          them out of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices: but this
          word I commanded them, saying, Hear My voice, and I will be your God,
          and ye shall be My people; and walk in all My ways whatsoever I have
          commanded you, that it may be well with you. But they obeyed not, nor
          hearkened; but walked in the imaginations of their own evil heart, and
          went backwards, and not forwards." And again, when He declares by the
          same man, "But let him that glorieth, glory in this, to understand and
          know that I am the Lord, who doth exercise loving-kindness, and
          righteousness, and judgment in the earth;" He adds, "For in these
          things I delight, says the Lord," but not in sacrifices, nor in
          holocausts, nor in oblations. For the people did not receive these
          precepts as of primary importance (principaliter), but as secondary,
          and for the reason already alleged, as Isaiah again says: "Thou hast
          not [brought to] Me the sheep of thy holocaust, nor in thy sacrifices
          hast thou glorified Me: thou hast not served Me in sacrifices, nor in
          [the matter of] frankincense hast thou done anything laboriously;
          neither hast thou bought for Me incense with money, nor have I desired
          the fat of thy sacrifices; but thou hast stood before Me in thy sins
          and in thine iniquities." He says, therefore, "Upon this man will I
          look, even upon him that is humble, and meek, and who trembles at My
          words." "For the fat and the fat flesh shall not take away from thee
          thine unrighteousness." "This is the fast which I have chosen, saith
          the Lord. Loose every band of wickedness, dissolve the connections of
          violent agreements, give rest to those that are shaken, and cancel
          every unjust document. Deal thy bread to the hungry willingly, and
          lead into thy house the roofless stranger. If thou hast seen the
          naked, cover him, and thou shalt not despise those of thine own flesh
          and blood (domesticos seminis tui). Then shall thy morning light break
          forth, and thy health shall spring forth more speedily; and
          righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of the Lord shall
          surround thee: and whilst thou art yet speaking, I will say, Behold,
          here I am." And Zechariah also, among the twelve prophets, pointing
          out to the people the will of God, says: "These things does the Lord
          Omnipotent declare: Execute true judgment, and show mercy and
          compassion each one to his brother. And oppress not the widow, and the
          orphan, and the proselyte, and the poor; and let none imagine evil
          against your brother in his heart." And again, he says: "These are the
          words which ye shall utter. Speak ye the truth every man to his
          neighbour, and execute peaceful judgment in your gates, and let none
          of you imagine evil in his heart against his brother, and ye shall not
          love false swearing: for all these things I hate, saith the Lord
          Almighty." Moreover, David also says in like manner: "What man is
          there who desireth life, and would fain see good days? Keep thy tongue
          from evil, and thy lips that they speak no guile. Shun evil, and do
          good: seek peace, and pursue it."
        </p>
        <p>
          4. From all these it is evident that God did not seek sacrifices and
          holocausts from them, but faith, and obedience, and righteousness,
          because of their salvation. As God, when teaching them His will in
          Hosea the prophet, said, "I desire mercy rather than sacrifice, and
          the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings." Besides, our Lord
          also exhorted them to the same effect, when He said, "But if ye had
          known what [this] meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye
          would not have condemned the guiltless." Thus does He bear witness to
          the prophets, that they preached the truth; but accuses these men (His
          hearers) of being foolish through their own fault.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Again, giving directions to His disciples to offer to God the
          first-fruits of His own, created things -- not as if He stood in need
          of them, but that they might be themselves neither unfruitful nor
          ungrateful -- He took that created thing, bread, and gave thanks, and
          said, "This is My body." And the cup likewise, which is part of that
          creation to which we belong, He confessed to be His blood, and taught
          the new oblation of the new covenant; which the Church receiving from
          the apostles, offers to God throughout all the world, to Him who gives
          us as the means of subsistence the first-fruits of His own gifts in
          the New Testament, concerning which Malachi, among the twelve
          prophets, thus spoke beforehand: "I have no pleasure in you, saith the
          Lord Omnipotent, and I will not accept sacrifice at your hands. For
          from the rising of the sun, unto the going down [of the same], My name
          is glorified among the Gentiles, and in every place incense is offered
          to My name, and a pure sacrifice; for great is My name among the
          Gentiles, saith the Lord Omnipotent;" -- indicating in the plainest
          manner, by these words, that the former people [the Jews] shall indeed
          cease to make offerings to God, but that in every place sacrifice
          shall be offered to Him, and that a pure one; and His name is
          glorified among the Gentiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. But what other name is there which is glorified among the Gentiles
          than that of our Lord, by whom the Father is glorified, and man also?
          And because it is [the name] of His own Son, who was made man by Him,
          He calls it His own. Just as a king, if he himself paints a likeness
          of his son, is right in calling this likeness his own, for both these
          reasons, because it is [the likeness] of his son, and because it is
          his own production; so also does the Father confess the name of Jesus
          Christ, which is throughout all the world glorified in the Church, to
          be His own, both because it is that of His Son, and because He who
          thus describes it gave Him for the salvation of men. Since, therefore,
          the name of the Son belongs to the Father, and since in the omnipotent
          God the Church makes offerings through Jesus Christ, He says well on
          both these grounds, "And in every place incense is offered to My name,
          and a pure sacrifice." Now John, in the Apocalypse, declares that the
          "incense" is "the prayers of the saints." <br />
