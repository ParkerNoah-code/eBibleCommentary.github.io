<p align="justify">SUBJECT. We have before us a National Anthem, fitted to 
    be sung at the outbreak of war, when the monarch was girding on his sword 
    for the fight. If David had not been vexed with wars, we might never have 
    been favored with such psalms as this. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">There is a needs be for the trials of one saint, that he 
    may yield consolation to others</p></i>. 
<p align="justify">A happy people here plead for a beloved sovereign, and 
    with loving hearts cry to Jehovah, "God save the King." We gather that this 
    song was intended to be sung in public, not only from the matter of the 
    song, but also from its dedication "To the Chief Musician." We know its 
    author to have been Israel's sweet singer, from the short title, "A Psalm of 
    David." </p>
<p align="justify">The particular occasion which suggested it, it would be 
    mere folly to conjecture, for Israel was almost always at war in David's 
    day. His sword may have been hacked, but it was never rusted. </p>
<p align="justify">It needs but a moment's reflection to perceive that this 
    hymn of prayer is prophetic of our Lord Jesus, and is the cry of the ancient 
    church on behalf of her Lord, as she sees him in vision enduring a great 
    fight of afflictions on her behalf. The militant people of God, with the 
    great Captain of salvation at their head, may still in earnest plead that 
    the pleasure of the Lord may prosper in his hand. We shall endeavor to keep 
    to this view of the subject in our brief exposition, but we cannot entirely 
    restrict out remarks to it.</p>
<p align="justify">DIVISION. The first four verses are a prayer for the 
    success of the king.</p>
<p align="justify">Verses 5, 6, and 7 express unwavering confidence in God 
    and his Anointed.<br/>
    Verse 8 declares the defeat of the foe.<br/>
    Verse 9 is a concluding appeal to Jehovah.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. "May the Lord hear you in the day of trouble."
    </p></b>All loyal subjects pray for their king, and most certainly citizens of 
    Zion have good cause to pray for the Prince of Peace. In times of conflict 
    loving subjects redouble their pleas, and surely in the sorrows of our Lord 
    his church could not but be in earnest. 
<p align="justify">All the Savior's days were days of trouble, and he also 
    made them days of prayer. The church joins her intercession with her Lord's, 
    and pleads that he may be heard in his cries and tears. The agony in the 
    garden was especially a gloomy hour, but he was heard in that he feared. He 
    knew that his Father heard him always—yet in that troublous hour no reply 
    came until thrice he had fallen on his face in the garden; then sufficient 
    strength was given in answer to prayer, and he rose a victor from the 
    conflict. </p>
<p align="justify">In this he is our example, teaching us that if we are to 
    receive any advantage from the prayers of others, we must first pray for 
    ourselves. What a mercy that we may pray in the day of trouble, and what a 
    still more blessed privilege that no trouble can prevent the Lord from 
    hearing us! Troubles roar like thunder, but the believer's voice will be 
    heard above the storm. O Jesus, when you plead for us in our hour of 
    trouble, the Lord Jehovah will hear you. This is a most refreshing 
    confidence, and it may be indulged in without fear.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"May the name of the God of Jacob defend you;" </p></b>or, as 
    some read it, "set you in a high place." By "the name" is meant the revealed 
    character of God. We are not to worship "the unknown God," but we should 
    seek to know the covenant God of Jacob, who has been pleased to reveal his 
    name and attributes to his people. There may be much in a royal name, or a 
    learned name, or a venerable name, but it will be a theme for heavenly 
    scholarship to discover all that is contained in the divine name. 
<p align="justify">The glorious power of God defended and preserved the Lord 
    Jesus through the battle of his life and death, and exalted him above all 
    his enemies. His warfare is now accomplished in his own proper person—but in 
    his mystical body, the church, he is still beset with dangers, and only the 
    eternal arm of our God in covenant can defend the soldiers of the cross, and 
    set them on high out of the reach of their foes. The day of trouble is not 
    over, the pleading Savior is not silent, and the name of the God of Israel 
    is still the defense of the faithful. </p>
<p align="justify">The name, "God of Jacob," is suggestive; Jacob had his 
    day of trouble, he wrestled, was heard, was defended, and in due time was 
    set on high, and his God is our God still, the same God to all his <i>
    wrestling Jacobs</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">The whole verse is a very fitting blessing to be 
    pronounced by a gracious heart over a child, a friend, or a minister, in 
    prospect of trial. It includes both temporal and spiritual protection, and 
    directs the mind to the great source of all good. How delightful to believe 
    that our heavenly Father has pronounced it upon our favored heads!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. "May he send you help from the sanctuary." </p></b>
    Out of Heaven's sanctuary came the angel to strengthen our Lord, and from 
    the precious remembrance of God's doings in his sanctuary our Lord refreshed 
    himself when on the tree. 
<p align="justify">There is no help like that which is of God's sending, and 
    no deliverance like that which comes out of his sanctuary. The <i>sanctuary 
    to us is the person of our blessed Lord</i>, who was typified by the temple, 
    and is the true sanctuary which God has pitched, and not man. Let us fly to 
    the cross for shelter in all times of need and help will be sent to us. Men 
    of the world despise sanctuary help, but our hearts have learned to prize it 
    beyond all material aid. They seek help out of the armory, or the 
    treasury—but we turn to the sanctuary. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"And strengthen you out of Zion."</p></b> Out of the 
    assemblies of the pleading saints who had for ages prayed for their Lord, 
    help might well result to the despised sufferer, for <i>praying breath is 
    never spent in vain</i>. 
<p align="justify">To the Lord's mystical body the richest comes in answer 
    to the pleadings of his saints assembled for holy worship as his Zion. 
    Certain advertisers recommend a strengthening plaster, but nothing can give 
    such strength to the loins of a saint as waiting upon God in the assemblies 
    of his people.</p>
<p align="justify">This verse is a blessing befitting a Sabbath morning, and 
    may be the salutation either of a pastor to his people, or of a church to 
    its minister. God in the sanctuary of his dear Son's person, and in the city 
    of his chosen church is the proper object of his people's prayers, and under 
    such a character may they confidently look to him for his promised aid.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. "Remember all your offerings, and accept your 
    burnt sacrifice. Selah."</p></b> Before war kings offered sacrifice, upon the 
    acceptance of which the depended for success. 
<p align="justify">Our blessed Lord presented himself as a victim, and was a 
    sweet savor unto the Most High, and then he met and routed the embattled 
    legions of Hell. Still does his burnt sacrifice perfume the courts of 
    Heaven, and through him the offerings of his people are received as his 
    sacrifices and oblations. We ought in our spiritual conflicts to have an eye 
    to the sacrifice of Jesus, and never venture to war until first the Lord has 
    given us a token for good at the altar of the cross, where faith beholds her 
    bleeding Lord. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"Selah."</p></b> It is well to pause at the cross before we 
    march onward to battle, and with the psalmist cry "Selah." We are too much 
    in a hurry to make good progress. A little pausing might greatly help our 
    speed. Stay, good man, there is a haste which hinders; rest awhile, meditate 
    on the burnt sacrifice, and put your heart right for the stern work which 
    lies before you.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. "Grant according to your own heart, and fulfill 
    all your counsel."</p></b> Christ's desire and counsel were both set upon the 
    salvation of his people. The church of old desired for him good speed in his 
    design, and the church in these latter days, with all her heart desires the 
    complete fulfillment of his purpose. In Christ Jesus sanctified souls may 
    appropriate this verse as a promise; they shall have their desire, and their 
    plans to glorify their Master shall succeed.<i> We may have our own 
    will—when our will is God's will. </i>This was always the case with our 
    Lord, and yet he said, "not as I will, but as you will." What need for 
    submission in our case; if it was necessary to <i>him</i>, then how much 
    more for us?
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. "We will rejoice in your salvation." </p></b>In 
    Jesus there is salvation; it is his own, and hence it is called <i>your </i>
    salvation; but it is ours to receive and ours to rejoice in. We should 
    fixedly resolve that come what may, we will rejoice in the saving arm of the 
    Lord Jesus. The people in this psalm, before their king went to battle, felt 
    sure of victory, and therefore began to rejoice beforehand; how much more 
    ought we to do this who have seen the victory completely won! 
<p align="justify">Unbelief begins weeping for the funeral before the man is 
    dead; why should not faith commence singing before the dance of victory 
    begins? Buds are beautiful, and promises not yet fulfilled are worthy to be 
    admired. If joy were more general among the Lord's people, God would be more 
    glorified among men;<i> the happiness of the subjects is the honor of the 
    sovereign. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"And in the name of our God we will set up our banners."</p></b> 
    We lift the standard of defiance in the face of the foe, and wave the flag 
    of victory over the fallen adversary. Some proclaim war in the name of one 
    king, and some of another—but the faithful go to war in Jesus' name, the 
    name of the incarnate God, Immanuel, God with us. The times are evil at 
    present, but so long as Jesus lives and reigns in his church we need not 
    furl our banners in fear, but advance them with sacred courage.
<p align="justify">"Jesus' tremendous name<br/>
    Puts all our foes to flight;<br/>
    Jesus, the meek, the angry Lamb<br/>
    A lion is in fight."</p>
<p align="justify">The church cannot forget that Jesus is her advocate 
    before the throne, and therefore she sums up the desires already expressed 
    in the short sentence, <b>"The Lord fulfill all your petitions."</b> </p>
<p align="justify">Be it never forgotten that among those petitions is that 
    choice one, "Father, I will that they also whom you have given me be with me 
    where I am."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. "Now I know that the Lord saves his anointed."
    </p></b>We live and learn, and what we learn we are not ashamed to acknowledge. 
    He who thinks he knows everything will miss the joy of finding out new 
    truth; he will never be able to cry, "now I know," for he is so wise in his 
    own conceit that he knows all that can be revealed and more. Souls conscious 
    of ignorance shall be taught of the Lord, and rejoice as they learn. 
<p align="justify">Earnest prayer frequently leads to assured confidence. 
    The church pleaded that the Lord Jesus might win the victory in his great 
    struggle, and now by faith she sees him saved by the omnipotent arm. She 
    evidently finds a sweet relish in the fragrant title of "anointed;" she 
    thinks of him as ordained before all worlds to his great work, and then 
    endowed with the needful qualifications by being anointed of the Spirit of 
    the Lord. This is evermore the choicest solace of the believer, that Jehovah 
    himself has anointed Jesus to be a Prince and a Savior, and that our shield 
    is thus the Lord's own anointed. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"He will hear him from his holy Heaven with the saving 
    strength of his right hand."</p></b> It is here asserted confidently that God's 
    holiness and power would both come to the rescue of the Savior in his 
    conflict, and surely these two glorious attributes found congenial work in 
    answering the sufferer's cries. Since Jesus was heard—we shall be also. God 
    is in Heaven, but our prayers can scale those glorious heights. Those 
    heavens are holy, but Jesus purifies our prayers, and so they gain 
    admittance. Our need is great, but the divine arm is strong, and all its 
    strength is "saving strength;" that strength, moreover, is in the hand which 
    is most used and which is used most readily—the right hand. What 
    encouragements are these for pleading saints!
<p align="justify">Contrasts frequently bring out the truth vividly, and 
    here the church sets forth the creature confidences of carnal men in 
    contrast with her reliance upon the Prince Immanuel and the invisible 
    Jehovah. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. "Some trust in chariots, and some in horses."
    </p></b>Chariots and horses make an imposing show, and with their rattling, and 
    dust, and fine caparisons, make so great a figure that vain man is much 
    taken with them; yet the discerning eye of faith sees more in an invisible 
    God than in all these. The most dreaded war-engine of David's day was the 
    war-chariot, armed with scythes, which mowed down men like grass. This was 
    the boast and glory of the neighboring nations; but the saints considered 
    the name of Jehovah to be a far better defense. As the Israelites might not 
    keep horses, it was natural for them to regard the enemy's calvary with more 
    than usual dread. It is, therefore, all the greater evidence of faith that 
    the bold songster can here disdain even the horse of Egypt in comparison 
    with the Lord Almighty. 
<p align="justify">Alas, how many in our day who profess to be the Lord's 
    are as abjectly dependent upon their fellow-men or upon an arm of flesh in 
    some shape or other, as if they had never known the name of Jehovah at all. 
    Jesus, be alone our rock and refuge, and never may we mar the simplicity of 
    our faith. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"We will remember the name of the Lord our God."</p></b> "Our 
    God" in covenant, who has chosen us and whom we have chosen; this God is our 
    God. The name of our God is JEHOVAH, and this should never be forgotten. He 
    is the self-existent, independent, immutable, ever-present, all-filling <i>I 
    AM. </i>Let us adore that matchless name, and never dishonor it by distrust 
    or creature confidence. Reader, you must know it before you can remember it. 
    May the blessed Spirit reveal it graciously to your soul!
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. They have bowed down and fallen; but we have 
    risen and stand upright.</p></b> How different the end of those whose trusts are 
    different! The enemies of God are uppermost at first, but they before long 
    are brought down by force, or else fall of their own accord. Their 
    foundation is rotten, and therefore when the time comes it gives way under 
    them. Their chariots are burned in the fire, and their horses die of 
    pestilence, and where is their boasted strength? 
<p align="justify">As for those who rest on Jehovah, they are often cast 
    down at the first onset, but an Almighty arm uplifts them, and they joyfully 
    stand upright. The victory of Jesus is the inheritance of his people. The 
    world, death, Satan, and sin, shall all be trampled beneath the feet of the 
    champions of faith; while those who rely upon an arm of flesh shall be 
    ashamed and confounded forever.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. Save, LORD! May the King answer us when we call.
    </p></b>The Psalm is here recapitulated. That Jesus might himself be delivered, 
    and might then, as our King, hear us—is the two-fold desire of the Psalm. 
    The first request is granted, and the second is sure to all the chosen seed; 
    and therefore we may close the Psalm with the hearty shout, "God save the 
    King." "God save King Jesus, and may he soon come to reign."
