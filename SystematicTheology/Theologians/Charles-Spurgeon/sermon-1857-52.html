        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.160)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, October 25, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>

          "It shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light." --
          Zechariah 14:7.
        </p>
        <p>
          I SHALL NOT stay to notice the particular occasion upon which these
          words were uttered, or to discover the time to which they more
          especially refer; I shall rather take the sentence as a rule of the
          kingdom, as one of the great laws of God's dispensation of grace,
          "that at evening time it shall be light." Whenever philosophers wish
          to establish a general law, they think it necessary to collect a
          considerable number of individual instances; these being put together,
          they then infer from them a general rule. Happily, this need not be
          done with regard to God. We have no need, when we look abroad in
          providence, to collect a great number of incidents, and then from them
          infer the truth; for since God is immutable, one act of his grace is
          enough to teach us the rule of his conduct. Now, I find in this one
          place it is recorded that on a certain occasion, during a certain
          adverse condition of a nation, God promised that "at evening time it
          should be light." If I found that in any human writing, I should
          suppose that the thing might have occurred once, that a blessing was
          conferred in emergency on a certain occasion, but I could not from it
          deduce a rule; but when I find this written in the book of God, that
          on a certain occasion when it was evening time with his people God was
          pleased to give them light, I feel myself more than justified in
          deducing from it the rule, that always to his people at evening time
          there shall be light.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, then, shall be the subject of my present discourse. There are
          different evening times that happen to the church and to God's people,
          and as a rule we may rest quite certain that at evening time there
          shall be light.
        </p>
        <p>
          God very frequently acts in grace in such a manner that we can find a
          parallel in nature. For instance, God says, "As the rain cometh down
          and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, even so shall my
          word be, it shall not return unto me void, it shall accomplish that
          which I please, it shall prosper in the thing whereto I have sent it."
          We find him speaking concerning the coming of Christ, "He shall come
          down like rain upon the mown grass, as showers that water the earth."
          We find him liking the covenant of grace to the covenant which he made
          with Noah concerning the seasons, and with man concerning the
          different revolutions of the year -- "Seed-time and harvest, and cold
          and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."
          We find that the works of creation are very frequently the mirror of
          the works of grace, and that we can draw figures from the world of
          Nature to illustrate the great acts of God in the world of his grace
          toward his people. But sometimes God oversteps nature. In nature after
          evening time there cometh night. The sun hath had its hours of
          journeying; the fiery steeds are weary; they must rest. Lo, they
          descend the azure steeps and plunge their burning fetlocks in the
          western sea, while night in her ebon chariot follows at their heels
          God, however, oversteps the rule of nature. He is pleased to send to
          his people times when the eye of reason expects to see no more day,
          but fears that the glorious landscape of God's mercies will be
          shrouded in the darkness of his forgetfulness. But instead thereof God
          overleapeth nature, and declares that at evening time instead of
          darkness there shall be light.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is now my business to illustrate this general rule by different
          particulars. I shall dwell most largely upon the last, that being the
          principal object of my sermon this morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. To begin, then, "At evening time it shall be light." The first
          illustration we take from the history of the church at large. The
          church at large has had many evening-times. If I might derive a figure
          to describe her history from anything in this lower world, I should
          describe her as being like a sea. At times the abundance of grace has
          been gloriously manifest. Wave upon wave has triumphantly rolled in
          upon the land, covering the mire of sin, and claiming the earth for
          the Lord of Hosts. So rapid has been its progress that its course
          could scarce be obstructed by the rocks of sin and vice. Complete
          conquest seemed to be foretold by the continual spread of the truth.
          The happy church thought that the day of her ultimate triumph had
          certainly arrived, so potent was her word by her ministers, so
          glorious was the Lord in the midst of her armies, that nothing could
          stand against her. She was "fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and
          terrible as an army with banners." Heresies and schisms were swept
          away, false gods and idols lost their thrones; Jehovah Omnipotent was
          in the midst of his church, and he upon the white horse rode forth
          conquering and to conquer. Before long, however, if you read history,
          you find it always has happened that there came an ebb-tide. Again the
          stream of grace seemed to recede, the poor church was driven back
          either by persecution or by internal decay; instead of gaining upon
          man's corruptions it seemed as if man's corruptions gained on her; and
          where once there had been righteousness like the waves of the sea,
          there was the black mud and mire of the filthiness of mankind.
          Mournful tunes the church had to sing, when by the rivers of Babylon
          she sat down and wept, remembering her former glories, and weeping her
          present desolation. So has it always been -- progressing,
          retrograding, standing still awhile, and then progressing once more,
          and falling back again. The whole history of the church has been a
          history of onward marches, and then of quick retreats -- a history
          which I believe is, on the whole, a history of advance and growth, but
          which read chapter by chapter, is a mixture of success and repulse,
          conquest and discouragement. And so I think it will be even to the
          last. We shall have our sunrises, our meridian noon, and then the
          sinking in the west; we shall have out sweet dawnings of better days,
          our Reformations, our Luthers and our Calvins; we shall have our
          bright full noon-tide, when the gospel is fully preached, and the
          power of God is known; shall have our sunset of ecclesiastical
          weakness and decay. But just as sure as the evening-tide seems to be
          drawing over the church, "at evening time it shall be light." Mark
          well that truth all through the sacred history of the church. In the
          day when every lamp of prophesy seemed to have ceased, when he who
          once thundered in the streets of Rome was burned at the stake and
          strangled; when Savanarola had departed, and his followers had been
          put to confusion, and the black clouds of Popery seemed to have
          quenched the sunlight of God's love and grace upon the world; in those
          dark dim ages when the gospel seemed to have died out, no doubt Satan
          whispered in himself, "The church's sunset is now come." It is evening
          time with her. Only a few rays are struggling from the sun of
          righteousness to cheer the darkness. Satan thought mayhap the world
          should lie for ever beneath the darkness of his dragon wing. But lo!
          at evening time it was light. God brought forth the solitary monk that
          shook the world; he raised up men to be his coadjutors and helpers;
          the sun rose in Germany; it shone in every land, nor have we ever had
          an even-tide so near to darkness since that auspicious time. Yet there
          have been other seasons of dark foreboding. There was a time when the
          church of England was sound asleep, when the various bodies of
          Dissenters were quite as bad, when religion degenerated into a dead
          formality, when no life and no power could be found in any pulpit
          throughout the land, but when an earnest man was so rare that he was
          almost a miracle. Good men stood over the ruins of our Zion, and said,
          "Alas, alas, for the slain of the daughter of my people! Where, where
          are the days of the mighty puritans who with the banner of the truth
          in their hand crushed a lie beneath their feet? O truth! thou hast
          departed; thou hast died." "No," says God, "it is evening time; and
          now it shall be light." There were six young men at Oxford who met
          together to pray those six young men were expelled for being too
          godly; they want abroad throughout our land, and the little leaven
          leavened the whole lump. Whitfield, Wesley, and their immediate
          successors flashed o'er the Land like lightning, in a dark night,
          making all men wonder whence they came and who they were; and working
          so great a work, that both in and out of the Establishment, the gospel
          came to be preached with power and vigor. At evening time God has
          always been pleased to send light to his church.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may expect to see darker evening times than have ever been beheld.
          Let us not imagine that our civilization shall be more enduring than
          any other that has gone before it, unless the Lord shall preserve it.
          It may be that the suggestion will be realized which has so often been
          laughed at as folly, that one day men should sit upon the broken
          arches of London Bridge, and marvel at the civilization that has
          departed, just as men walk over the mounds of Nimroud, and marvel at
          cities buried there. It is just possible that all the civilization of
          this country may die out in blackest night; it may be that God will
          repeat again the great story which has been so often told -- "I
          looked, and lo, in the vision I saw a great and terrible beast, and it
          ruled the nations, but lo, it passed away and was not." But if ever
          such things should be -- if the world ever should have to return to
          barbarism and darkness -- if instead of what we sometimes hope for, a
          constant progress to the brightest day, all our hopes should be
          blasted, let us rest quite satisfied that "at evening time there shall
          be light," that the ends of the worlds history shall be an end of
          glory. However red with blood, however black with sin the world may
          yet be, she shall one day be as pure and perfect as when she was
          created. The day shall come when this poor planet shall find herself
          unrobed of those swaddling bands of darkness that have kept her luster
          from breaking forth. God shall yet cause his name to be known from the
          rising of the sun to the going down thereof,
        </p>
        <p>"And the shouts of jubilee,</p>
        <p>Loud as mighty thunders roar,</p>
        <p>Or the fullness of the sea,</p>
        <p>When it breaks upon the shore,</p>
        <p>Shall yet be heard the wide World o'er."</p>
        <p>"At evening time it shall be light."</p>
        <p>
          II. This rule holds equally good in the little, as well as in the
          great. We know that in nature the very same law that rules the atom,
          governs also the starry orbs.
        </p>
        <p>"The very law that molds a tear,</p>
        <p>And bids it trickle from its source,</p>
        <p>That law preserves the earth a sphere,</p>
        <p>And guides the planets in their course."</p>
        <p>
          It is even so with the laws of grace. "At evening time it shall be
          light" to the church; "at evening time it shall be light" to every
          individual. Christian let us descend to lowly things. Thou hast had
          thy bright days in temporal matters: thou hast sometimes been greatly
          blessed: thou canst remember the day when the calf was in the stall,
          when the olive yielded its fruit, and the fig-tree did not deny its
          harvest; thou canst recollect the years when the barn was almost
          bursting with the corn, and when the vat overflowed with the oil; thou
          rememberest when the stream of thy life was deep, and thy ship floated
          softly on, without one disturbing billow of trouble to molest it. Thou
          saidst in those days, "I shall see no sorrow; God hath hedged me
          about; he hath preserved me; he hath kept me; I am the darling of his
          providence; I know that all things work together for my good, for I
          can see it is plainly so." Well, Christian, thou hast after that had a
          sunset; the sun which shone so brightly, began to cast his rays in a
          more oblique manner every moment, until at last the shadows were long,
          for the sun was setting, and the clouds began to gather; and though
          the light of God's countenance tinged those clouds with glory, yet it
          was waxing dark. Then troubles lowered o'er thee; thy family sickened,
          thy wife was dead, thy crops were meager, and thy daily income was
          diminished, thy cupboard was no more full, thou wast wondering for thy
          daily bread; thou didst not know what should become of thee, mayhap
          thou wast brought very low; the keel of thy vessel did grate upon the
          rocks; there was not enough of bounty to float thy ship above the
          rocks of poverty. "I sink in deep mire," thou saidst, "where there is
          no standing; all thy waves and thy billows have gone over me." What to
          do you could not tell; strive as you might, your strivings did but
          make you worse. "Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain
          that build it." You used both industry and economy, and you added
          "hereunto perseverance; but all in vain. It was in vain that you rose
          up early, and sat up late, and ate the bread of carefulness; nothing
          could you do to deliver yourself, for all attempts failed. You were
          ready to die in despair. You thought the night of your life had
          gathered with eternal blackness. You would not live always, but had
          rather depart from this vale of tears. Christian! bear witness to the
          truth of the maxim of the text! Was it not light with thee at evening
          time? The time of thine extremity was just the moment of Godly
          opportunity. When the tide had run out to its very furthest, then it
          began to turn; thine ebb had its flow; thy winter had its summer; thy
          sunset had its sunrise; "at evening time it was light." On a sudden by
          some strange work of God, as thou didst think it then, thou wast
          completely delivered. He brought out thy righteousness like the light,
          and thy glory as the noon-day. The Lord appeared for thee in the days
          of old: he stretched out his hand from above; he drew thee out of deep
          waters; he set thee upon a rock and established thy goings. Mark, thou
          then, O heir of heaven! what hath been true to thee in the years that
          are past, shall be true to thee even till the last. Art thou this day
          exercised with woe, and care, and misery? Be of good cheer! In thine
          "evening time it shall be light." If God chooseth to prolong thy
          sorrow, he shall multiply thy patience; but the rather, it may be, he
          will bring thee into the deeps, and thence will he lead thee up again.
          Remember thy Saviour descended that he might ascend: so must thou also
          stoop to conquer; and if God bids thee stoop, should it be to the very
          lowest hell, remember, if he bade thee stoop, he will bring thee up
          again. Remember what Jonah said -- "Out of the belly of hell cried I,
          and thou heardest me." Oh! exclaim with him of old, who trusted his
          God when he had nothing else to trust: "Although the fig-tree shall
          not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labor of the
          olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall
          be cut off from the fold and there shall be no herd in the stalls: Yet
          I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation." Do
          thou so, and be blessed; for "at evening time it shall be light."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But now we seek a third illustration from the spiritual sorrows
          of God's own people. Godly children have two kinds of trials, trials
          temporal and trials spiritual. I shall be brief on this point, and
          shall borrow an illustration from good John Bunyan. You remember John
          Bunyan's description of Apollyon meeting Christian. Bunyan tells it
          figuratively, but it is no figure: he that hath ever met Apollyon will
          tell you that there is no mistake about the matter, but that there is
          a dread reality in it. Our Christian met Apollyon when he was in the
          valley of humiliation, and the dragon did most fiercely beset him;
          with fiery darts he sought to destroy him, and take away his life. The
          brave Christian stood to him with all his might, and used his sword
          and shield right manfully, till his shield became studded with a
          forest of darts, and his hand did cleave unto his sword. You remember
          how for many an hour that man and that dragon fought together, till at
          last the dragon gave Christian a horrible fall, and down he went upon
          the ground; and woe worth the day! at the moment when he fell he
          dropped his sword! You have but to picture the scene: the dragon
          drawing up all his might, planting his foot upon Christians neck, and
          about to hurl the fiery dart into his heart. "Aha! I have thee now,"
          saith he, "thou art in my power." Strange to say, "at evening time it
          was light." At the very moment when the dragon's foot was enough to
          crush the very life out of poor Christian, it is said, he did stretch
          out his hand; he grasped his sword, and giving a desperate thrust at
          the dragon, he cried, "Rejoice not over me, O mine enemy; for when I
          fall I shall arise again;" and so desperately did he cut the dragon
          that he spread his wings and flew away and Christian went on his
          journey rejoicing in his victory. Now, the Christian understands all
          that! it is no dream to him. He has been under the dragon's foot many
          a time. Ah! and all the world put on a man's heart at once is not
          equal in weight to one foot of the devil. When Satan once gets the
          upper hand of the spirit, he neither wants strength, nor will, nor
          malice, to torment it. Hard is that man's lot, that has fallen beneath
          the hoof of the evil one in his fight with him. But blessed be God,
          the child of God is ever safe, as safe beneath the dragon's foot as he
          shall be before the throne of God in heaven. "At evening time it shall
          be light." And let all the powers of earth and hell, and all the
          doubts and fears that the Christian ever knew, conspire together to
          molest a saint, in that darkest moment, lo, God shall arise and his
          enemies shall be scattered, and he shall get unto himself the victory.
          O for faith to believe that. O! for confidence in God never to doubt
          him, but in the darkest moment of our sorrows, still to feel all is
          well with us. "At evening time it shall be light."
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Bear with me whilst I just hint at one more particular, and then I
          will come to that upon which I intend to dwell mainly at the last. To
          the sinner when coining to Christ this is also a truth. "At evening
          time it shall be light." Very often when I am sitting to see
          inquirers, persons have come to me to tell me the story of their
          spiritual history; and they tell me their little tale with an air of
          the greatest possible wonder, and ask me as soon as they have told it
          whether it is not extremely strange. "Do you know, sir, I used to be
          so happy in the things of the world, but conviction entered into my
          heart, and I began to seek the Saviour; and do you know that for a
          long time, sir, when I was seeking the Saviour I was so miserable that
          I could not bear myself? Surely sir, this is a strange thing." And
          when I have looked them in the face, and said, "No, it is not strange;
          do you know I have had a dozen to-night, and they have all told me the
          same; that is the way all God's people go to heaven," they have stared
          at me as if they did not think I would tell them an untruth, but as if
          they thought it the strangest thing in all the world that anybody else
          should have felt as they have felt. "Now, sit down," I say sometimes,
          "and I will tell you what were my feelings when I first sought the
          Saviour." "Why, sir," they say, "that is just how I felt; but I did
          not think any one ever went the same path that I have gone." Ah! well,
          it is no wonder that when we hold little acquaintance with each other
          in spiritual things our path should seem to be solitary; but he who
          knows much of the dealings of God with poor seeking sinners, will know
          that their experience is always very much alike, and you can generally
          tell one by another, while they are coming to Christ. Now, whenever
          the soul is truly seeking Christ it will have to seek him in the dark.
          When poor Lot ran out of Sodom, he had to run all the way in the
          twilight. The sun did not rise upon him until he got into Zoar. And so
          when sinners are running from their sins to the Saviour they have to
          run in the dark. They get no comfort and no peace, till they are
          enabled by simple faith to look for all to him who died upon the
          cross. I have in my presence this morning many poor souls under great
          distress. Poor heart! my text is a comfort to thee. "At evening time
          it shall be light." You had a little light once, the light of
          morality; you thought you could do something for yourself. That is all
          put out now. Then you had another light: you had the wax taper of
          ceremonies, and you thought full sure that it would light you; but
          that is all out now. Still you thought you could grope your way a
          little by the remaining twilight of your good works, but all that
          seems to have gone now. You think "God will utterly destroy such a
          wretch as I am! O sir! O sir!
        </p>
        <p>'I the chief of sinners am.'"</p>
        <p>
          There never lived a wretch so vile; or if there ever lived such an
          one, surely God must have cast him into hell at once; I am certain
          there is no hope for me. Why, sir, do what I may, I can not make
          myself any better. When I try to pray I find I can't pray as I should
          like; when I read the Bible it is all black against me; it is no use,
          when I go to the house of God the minister seems to be like Moses,
          only preaching the law to me -- he never seems to have a word of
          comfort to my soul. Well, I am glad of it, poor heart, I am glad of
          it; far be it from me to rejoice in thy miseries as such, but I am
          glad thou art where thou art. I remember what the Countess of
          Huntingdon once said to Mr. Whitfield's brother. Mr. Whitfield's
          brother was under great distress of mind, and one day when sitting at
          tea, talking of spiritual things, he said, "Your ladyship, I know I am
          lost, I am certain I am!" Well, they talked to him, and they tried to
          rally him; but he persisted in it, that he was absolutely undone, that
          he was a lost man. Her ladyship clapped her hands, and said, "I am
          glad of it, Mr. Whitfield, I'm glad of it." He thought it was a cruel
          thing for her to say. He knew better when she explained herself by
          saying, "For the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was
          lost; so then, he came to seek and to save you. Now, if there be any
          here who are lost, I can only say, I am glad of it too, for such the
          mighty Shepherd came to rescue. If there are any of you who feel that
          you are condemned by God's law, I thank God you are; for those who are
          condemned by the law in their consciences shall yet be pardoned by the
          gospel.
        </p>
        <p>"Come, guilty souls, and flee away</p>
        <p>To Christ, and heal your wounds;</p>
        <p>This is the glorious gospel day,</p>
        <p>Wherein free grace abounds."</p>
        <p>
          Nay, this very hour, when you have no day in your heart, when you
          think the evening time has come, and you must perish for ever -- now
          is the time when God will reveal himself to you. Whilst thou hast a
          rag of thine own thou shalt never have Christ; whilst thou hast a
          farthing of thine own righteousness, thou shalt never have him; but
          when thou art nothing, Christ is thine; when thou hast nothing of
          thyself to trust to, Jesus Christ in the gospel is thy complete
          saviour; he bids me tell thee he came to seek and to save such as thou
          art.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. And now I am about to close, dwelling rather more largely upon the
          last particular -- "At evening time it shall be light." If our sun do
          not go down ere it be noon, we may all of us expect to have an evening
          time of life. Either we shall be taken from this world by death, or
          else, if God should spare us, ere long we shall get to the evening of
          life. In a few more years, the sere and yellow leaf will be the fit
          companion of every man and every woman. Is there anything melancholy
          in that? I think not. The time of old age, with all its infirmities,
          seems to me to be a time of peculiar blessedness and privilege to the
          Christian. To the worldly sinner, whose zest for pleasure has been
          removed by the debility of his powers and the decay of his strength,
          old age must be a season on tedium and pain; but to the veteran
          soldier of the cross, old age must assuredly be a time of great joy
          and blessedness. I was thinking the other evening, whilst riding in a
          delightful country, how like to evening time old age is. The sun of
          hot care has gone down; that sun which shone upon that early piety of
          ours, which had not much depth of root, and which scorched it so that
          it died -- that sun which scorched our next true godliness, and often
          made it well nigh wither, and would have withered it had it not been
          planted by the rivers of water -- that sun is now set. The good old
          man has no particular care now in all the world. He says to business,
          to the hum and noise and strife of the age in which he lives, "Thou
          art nought to me; to make my calling and election sure, to hold firmly
          this my confidence, and wait until my change comes, this is all my
          employment; with all your worldly pleasures and cares I have no
          connection." The toil of his life is all done, he has no more now to
          be sweating and toiling, as he had in his youth and manhood; his
          family have grown up, and are now no more dependent upon him; it may
          be, God has blessed him, and he has sufficient for the wants of his
          old age, or it may be that in some rustic alms-house he breathes out
          the last few years of his existence. How calm and quiet! Like the
          laborer, who, when he returns from the field at evening time casts
          himself upon his couch, so does the old man rest from his labors. And
          at evening time we gather into families, the fire is kindled, the
          curtains are drawn, and we sit around the family fire, to think no
          more of the things of the great rumbling world; and even so in old
          age, the family and not the world are the engrossing topic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did you ever notice how venerable grandsires, when they write a
          letter, fill it full of intelligence concerning their children? "John
          is ill," "Mary is well," "all our family are in health." Very likely
          some business friend writes to say "Stocks are down," or, "the rate of
          interest is raised," but you never find that in any good old man's
          letters; he writes about his family, his lately married daughters, and
          all that. Just what we do at evening time; we only think of the family
          circle and forget the world. That is what the gray-headed old man
          does. He thinks of his children, and forgets all beside. Well, then,
          how sweet it is to think that for such an old man there is light in
          the darkness! "At evening time it shall be light." Dread not thy days
          of weariness, dread not thine hours of decay, O soldier of the cross;
          new lights shall burn when the old lights are quenched; new candles
          shall be lit when the lamps of life are dim. Fear not! The night of
          thy decay may be coming on, but "at evening time it shall be light."
          At evening time the Christian has many lights that he never had
          before; lit by the Holy Spirit and shining by his light. There is the
          light of bright experience. He can look back, and he can raise his
          Ebenezer, saying, "Hither, by thy help I've come." He can look back at
          his old Bible, the light of his youth, and he can say, "This promise
          has been proved to me, this covenant has been proved true. I have
          thumbed my Bible many a year; I have never yet thumbed a broken
          promise. The promises have all been kept to me; not one good thing has
          failed.'" And then, if he has served God he has another light to cheer
          him: he has the light of the remembrance of what good God has enabled
          him to do. Some of his spiritual children come in and talk of times
          when God blessed his conversation to their souls. He looks upon his
          children, and his children's children, rising up to call the Redeemer
          blessed; at evening time he has a light. But at the last the night
          comes in real earnest; he has lived long enough, and he must die. The
          old man is on his bed; the sun is going down, and he has no more
          light. "Throw up the windows, let me look for the last time into the
          open sky," says the old man. The sun has gone down; I can not see the
          mountains yonder; they are all a mass of mist; my eyes are dim, and
          the world is dim too. Suddenly a light shoots across his face, and he
          cries, "O daughter! daughter, here! I can see another sun rising. Did
          you not tell me that the sun went down just now? Lo, I see another;
          and where those hills used to be in the landscape, those hills that
          were lost in the darkness, daughter, I can see hills that seem like
          burning brass; and methinks upon that summit I can see a city bright
          as jasper. Yes, and I see a gate opening, and spirits coming forth.
          What is that they say? O they sing! they sing! Is this death?" And ere
          he has asked the question, he hath gone where he needs not to answer
          it, for death is all unknown. Yes, he has passed the gates of pearl;
          his feet are on the streets of gold; his head is bedecked with a crown
          of immortality; the palm-branch of eternal victory is in his hand. God
          hath accepted him in the beloved.
        </p>
        <p>"Far from the world of grief and sin,</p>
        <p>With God eternally shut in,"</p>
        <p>
          he is numbered with the saints in light, and the promise is fulfilled,
          "At evening time it shall be light."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, my gray-headed hearer, will it be so with thee? I remember
          the venerable Mr. Jay once in Cambridge, when preaching, reaching out
          his hand to an old man who sat just as some of you are sitting there,
          and saying, "I wonder whether those gray hairs are a crown of glory,
          or a fool's cap; they are one or else the other." For a man to be
          unconverted at the age to which some of you have attained is indeed to
          have a fool's cap made of gray hairs; but if you have a heart
          consecrated to Christ, to be his children now, with the full belief
          that you shall be his for ever, is to have a crown of glory upon your
          brows.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, young men and maidens, we shall soon be old. In a little time
          our youthful frame shall totter; we shall need a staff by-and-by.
          Years are short things; they seem to us to get shorter, as each one of
          them runs o'er our head. My brother, thou art young as I am; say, hast
          thou a hope that thine even-tide shall be light? No, thou hast begun
          in drunkenness; and the drunkard's eventide is darkness made more
          dark, and after it damnation. No, young man; thou hast begun thy life
          with profanity, and the swearer's even-tide hath no light, except the
          lurid flame of hell. Beware thou of such an even-tide as that! No;
          thou hast begun in gayety; take care lest that which begins in gayety
          ends in eternal sadness. Would God ye had all begun with Christ! Would
          that ye would choose wisdom; for "her ways are ways of pleasantness,
          and all her paths are peace." Some religious men are miserable; but
          religion does not make them so. True religion is a happy thing. I
          never knew what the hearty laugh and what the happy face meant, till I
          knew Christ; but knowing him I trust I can live in this world like one
          who is not of it, but who is happy in it. Keeping my eye upward to the
          Saviour, I can say with David, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all
          that is within me bless his holy name." and bless him most of all for
          this, that I know how to bless him. Ah! and if ye in your prime, in
          the days of your youth, have been enabled by the Holy Spirit to
          consecrate yourselves to God, you will, when you come to the end, look
          back with some degree of sorrow upon your infirmities, but with a far
          greater degree of joy upon the grace which began with you in
          childhood, which preserved you in manhood, which matured you for your
          old age, and which at last gathered you like a shock of corn fully
          ripe into the garner. May the great God and Master bless these words
          to us each, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
