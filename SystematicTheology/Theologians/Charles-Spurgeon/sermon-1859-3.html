        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.227)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, December 5th, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>"Compel them to come in." -- Luke 14:23.</p>
        <p>
          I FEEL in such a haste to go out and obey this commandment this
          morning, by compelling those to come in who are now tarrying in the
          highways and hedges, that I cannot wait for an introduction, but must
          at once set about my business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hear then, O ye that are strangers to the truth as it is in Jesus --
          hear then the message that I have to bring you. Ye have fallen, fallen
          in your father Adam; ye have fallen also in yourselves, by your daily
          sin and your constant iniquity; you have provoked the anger of the
          Most High; and as assuredly as you have sinned, so certainly must God
          punish you if you persevere in your iniquity, for the Lord is a God of
          justice, and will by no means spare the guilty. But have you not
          heard, hath it not long been spoken in your ears, that God, in his
          infinite mercy, has devised a way whereby, without any infringement
          upon his honour, he can have mercy upon you, the guilty and the
          undeserving? To you I speak; and my voice is unto you, O sons of men;
          Jesus Christ, very God of very God, hath descended from heaven, and
          was made in the likeness of sinful flesh. Begotten of the Holy Ghost,
          he was born of the Virgin Mary; he lived in this world a life of
          exemplary holiness, and of the deepest suffering, till at last he gave
          himself up to die for our sins, "the just for the unjust, to bring us
          to God." And now the plan of salvation is simply declared unto you --
          "Whosoever believeth in the Lord Jesus Christ shall be saved." For you
          who have violated all the precepts of God, and have disdained his
          mercy and dared his vengeance, there is yet mercy proclaimed, for
          "whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." "For
          this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
          Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief;"
          "whosoever cometh unto him he will in no wise cast out, for he is able
          also to save unto the uttermost them that come unto God by him, seeing
          he ever liveth to make intercession for us." Now all that God asks of
          you -- and this he gives you -- is that you will simply look at his
          bleeding dying son, and trust your souls in the hands of him whose
          name alone can save from death and hell. Is it not a marvelous thing,
          that the proclamation of this gospel does not receive the unanimous
          consent of men? One would think that as soon as ever this was
          preached, "That whosoever believeth shall have eternal life," every
          one of you, "casting away every man his sins and his iniquities,"
          would lay hold on Jesus Christ, and look alone to his cross. But alas!
          such is the desperate evil of our nature, such the pernicious
          depravity of our character, that this message is despised, the
          invitation to the gospel feast is rejected, and there are many of you
          who are this day enemies of God by wicked works, enemies to the God
          who preaches Christ to you to-day, enemies to him who sent his Son to
          give his life a ransom for many. Strange I say it is that it should be
          so, yet nevertheless it is the fact, and hence the necessity for the
          command of the text, -- "Compel them to come in."
        </p>
        <p>
          Children of God, ye who have believed, I shall have little or nothing
          to say to you this morning; I am going straight to my business -- I am
          going after those that will not come -- those that are in the byways
          and hedges, and God going with me, it is my duty now to fulfil this
          command, "Compel them to come in."
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I must, find you out; secondly, I will go to work to compel you
          to come in.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, I must FIND YOU OUT. If you read the verses that precede the
          text, you will find an amplification of this command: "Go out quickly
          into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor,
          the maimed, the halt, and the blind;" and then, afterwards, "Go out
          into the highways," bring in the vagrants, the highwaymen, "and into
          the hedges," bring in those that have no resting-place for their
          heads, and are lying under the hedges to rest, bring them in also, and
          "compel them to come in." Yes, I see you this morning, you that are
          poor. I am to compel you to come in. You are poor in circumstances,
          but this is no barrier to the kingdom of heaven, for God hath not
          exempted from his grace the man that shivers in rags, and who is
          destitute of bread. In fact, if there be any distinction made, the
          distinction is on your side, and for your benefit -- "Unto you is the
          word of salvation sent"; "For the poor have the gospel preached unto
          them." But especially I must speak to you who are poor, spiritually.
          You have no faith, you have no virtue, you have no good work, you have
          no grace, and what is poverty worse still, you have no hope. Ah, my
          Master has sent you a gracious invitation. Come and welcome to the
          marriage feast of his love. "Whosoever will, let him come and take of
          the waters of life freely." Come, I must lay hold upon you, though you
          be defiled with foulest filth, and though you have nought but rags
          upon your back, though your own righteousness has become as filthy
          clouts, yet must I lay hold upon you, and invite you first, and even
          compel you to come in.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I see you again. You are not only poor, but you are maimed.
          There was a time when you thought you could work out your own
          salvation without God's help, when you could perform good works,
          attend to ceremonies, and get to heaven by yourselves; but now you are
          maimed, the sword of the law has cut off your hands, and now you can
          work no longer; you say, with bitter sorrow --
        </p>
        <p>"The best performance of my hands,</p>
        <p>Dares not appear before thy throne."</p>
        <p>
          You have lost all power now to obey the law; you feel that when you
          would do good, evil is present with you. You are maimed; you have
          given up, as a forlorn hope, all attempt to save yourself, because you
          are maimed and your arms are gone. But you are worse off than that,
          for if you could not work your way to heaven, yet you could walk your
          way there along the road by faith; but you are maimed in the feet as
          well as in the hands; you feel that you cannot believe, that you
          cannot repent, that you cannot obey the stipulations of the gospel.
          You feel that you are utterly undone, powerless in every respect to do
          anything that can be pleasing to God. In fact, you are crying out --
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, could I but believe,</p>
        <p>Then all would easy be,</p>
        <p>I would, but cannot, Lord relieve,</p>
        <p>My help must come from thee."</p>
        <p>
          To you am I sent also. Before you am I to lift up the blood-stained
          banner of the cross, to you am I to preach this gospel, "Whoso calleth
          upon the name of the Lord shall be saved;" and unto you am I to cry,
          "Whosoever will, let him come and take of the water of life freely."
        </p>
        <p>
          There is yet another class. You are halt. You are halting between two
          opinions. You are sometimes seriously inclined, and at another time
          worldly gaiety calls you away. What little progress you do make in
          religion is but a limp. You have a little strength, but that is so
          little that you make but painful progress. Ah, limping brother, to you
          also is the word of this salvation sent. Though you halt between two
          opinions, the Master sends me to you with this message: "How long halt
          ye between two opinions? if God be God, serve him; if Baal be God,
          serve him." Consider thy ways; set thine house in order, for thou
          shalt die and not live. Because I will do this, prepare to meet thy
          God, O Israel! Halt no longer, but decide for God and his truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet I see another class, -- the blind. Yes, you that cannot see
          yourselves, that think yourselves good when you are full of evil, that
          put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter, darkness for light and
          light for darkness; to you am I sent. You, blind souls that cannot see
          your lost estate, that do not believe that sin is so exceedingly
          sinful as it is, and who will not be persuaded to think that God is a
          just and righteous God, to you am I sent. To you too that cannot see
          the Saviour, that see no beauty in him that you should desire him; who
          see no excellence in virtue, no glories in religion, no happiness in
          serving God, no delight in being his children; to you, also, am I
          sent. Ay, to whom am I not sent if I take my text? For it goes further
          than this -- it not only gives a particular description, so that each
          individual case may be met, but afterwards it makes a general sweep,
          and says, "Go into the highways and hedges." Here we bring in all
          ranks and conditions of men -- my lord upon his horse in the highway,
          and the woman trudging about her business, the thief waylaying the
          traveller -- all these are in the highway, and they are all to be
          compelled to come in, and there away in the hedges there lie some poor
          souls whose refuges of lies are swept away, and who are seeking not to
          find some little shelter for their weary heads, to you, also, are we
          sent this morning. This is the universal command -- compel them to
          come in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I pause after having described the character, I pause to look at
          the herculean labour that lies before me. Well did Melanchthon say,
          "Old Adam was too strong for young Melanchthon." As well might a
          little child seek to compel a Samson, as I seek to lead a sinner to
          the cross of Christ. And yet my Master sends me about the errand. Lo,
          I see the great mountain before me of human depravity and stolid
          indifference, but by faith I cry, "Who art thou, O great mountain?
          before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain." Does my Master say,
          compel them to come in? Then, though the sinner be like Samson and I a
          child, I shall lead him with a thread. If God saith do it, if I
          attempt it in faith it shall be done; and if with a groaning,
          struggling, and weeping heart, I so seek this day to compel sinners to
          come to Christ, the sweet compulsions of the Holy Spirit shall go with
          every word, and some indeed shall be compelled to come in.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now to the work -- directly to the work. Unconverted,
          unreconciled, unregenerate men and women, I am to COMPEL YOU TO COME
          IN. Permit me first of all to accost you in the highways of sin and
          tell you over again my errand. The King of heaven this morning sends a
          gracious invitation to you. He says, "As I live, saith the Lord, I
          have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, but had rather that
          he should turn unto me and live:" "Come now, and let us reason
          together, saith the Lord, though your sins be as scarlet they shall be
          as wool; though they be red like crimson they shall be whiter than
          snow." Dear brother, it makes my heart rejoice to think that I should
          have such good news to tell you, and yet I confess my soul is heavy
          because I see you do not think it good news, but turn away from it,
          and do not give it due regard. Permit me to tell you what the King has
          done for you. He knew your guilt, he foresaw that you would ruin
          yourself. He knew that his justice would demand your blood, and in
          order that this difficulty might be escaped, that his justice might
          have its full due, and that you might yet be saved, Jesus Christ hath
          died. Will you just for a moment glance at this picture. You see that
          man there on his knees in the garden of Gethsemane, sweating drops of
          blood. You see this next: you see that miserable sufferer tied to a
          pillar and lashed with terrible scourges, till the shoulder bones are
          seen like white islands in the midst of a sea of blood. Again you see
          this third picture; it is the same man hanging on the cross with hands
          extended, and with feet nailed fast, dying, groaning, bleeding;
          methought the picture spoke and said, "It is finished." Now all this
          hath Jesus Christ of Nazareth done, in order that God might
          consistently with his justice pardon sin; and the message to you this
          morning is this -- "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
          saved." That is trust him, renounce thy works, and thy ways, and set
          thine heart alone on this man, who gave himself for sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well brother, I have told you the message, what sayest thou unto it?
          Do you turn away? You tell me it is nothing to you; you cannot listen
          to it; that you will hear me by-and-by; but you will go your way this
          day and attend to your farm and merchandize. Stop brother, I was not
          told merely to tell you and then go about my business. No; I am told
          to compel you to come in; and permit me to observe to you before I
          further go, that there is one thing I can say -- and to which God is
          my witness this morning, that I am in earnest with you in my desire
          that you should comply with this command of God. You may despise your
          own salvation, but I do not despise it; you may go away and forget
          what you shall hear, but you will please to remember that the things I
          now say cost me many a groan ere I came here to utter them. My inmost
          soul is speaking out to you, my poor brother, when I beseech you by
          him that liveth and was dead, and is alive for evermore, consider my
          master's message which he bids me now address to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          But do you spurn it? Do you still refuse it? Then I must change my
          tone a minute. I will not merely tell you the message, and invite you
          as I do with all earnestness, and sincere affection -- I will go
          further. Sinner, in God's name I command you to repent and believe. Do
          you ask me whence my authority? I am an ambassador of heaven. My
          credentials, some of them secret, and in my own heart; and others of
          them open before you this day in the seals of my ministry, sitting and
          standing in this hall, where God has given me many souls for my hire.
          As God the everlasting one hath given me a commission to preach his
          gospel, I command you to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ; not on my
          own authority, but on the authority of him who said, "Go ye into all
          the world and preach the gospel to every creature;" and then annexed
          this solemn sanction, "He that believeth and is baptized shall be
          saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned." Reject my message,
          and remember "He that despised Moses's law, died without mercy under
          two or three witnesses: of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye,
          shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of
          God." An ambassador is not to stand below the man with whom he deals,
          for we stand higher. If the minister chooses to take his proper rank,
          girded with the omnipotence of God, and anointed with his holy
          unction, he is to command men, and speak with all authority compelling
          them to come in: "command, exhort, rebuke with all long-suffering."
        </p>
        <p>
          But do you turn away and say you will not be commanded? Then again
          will I change my note. If that avails not, all other means shall be
          tried. My brother, I come to you simple of speech, and I exhort you to
          flee to Christ. O my brother, dost thou know what a loving Christ he
          is? Let me tell thee from my own soul what I know of him. I, too, once
          despised him. He knocked at the door of my heart and I refused to open
          it. He came to me, times without number, morning by morning, and night
          by night; he checked me in my conscience and spoke to me by his
          Spirit, and when, at last, the thunders of the law prevailed in my
          conscience, I thought that Christ was cruel and unkind. O I can never
          forgive myself that I should have thought so ill of him. But what a
          loving reception did I have when I went to him. I thought he would
          smite me, but his hand was not clenched in anger but opened wide in
          mercy. I thought full sure that his eyes would dart lightning-flashes
          of wrath upon me; but, instead thereof, they were full of tears. He
          fell upon my neck and kissed me; he took off my rags and did clothe me
          with his righteousness, and caused my soul to sing aloud for joy;
          while in the house of my heart and in the house of his church there
          was music and dancing, because his son that he had lost was found, and
          he that was dead was made alive. I exhort you, then, to look to Jesus
          Christ and to be lightened. Sinner, you will never regret, -- I will
          be bondsman for my Master that you will never regret it, -- you will
          have no sigh to go back to your state of condemnation; you shall go
          out of Egypt and shall go into the promised land and shall find it
          flowing with milk and honey. The trials of Christian life you shall
          find heavy, but you will find grace will make them light. And as for
          the joys and delights of being a child of God, if I lie this day you
          shall charge me with it in days to come. If you will taste and see
          that the Lord is good, I am not afraid but that you shall find that he
          is not only good, but better than human lips ever can describe.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know not what arguments to use with you. I appeal to your own
          self-interests. Oh my poor friend, would it not be better for you to
          be reconciled to the God of heaven, than to be his enemy? What are you
          getting by opposing God? Are you the happier for being his enemy?
          Answer, pleasure-seeker; hast thou found delights in that cup? Answer
          me, self-righteous man: hast thou found rest for the sole of thy foot
          in all thy works? Oh thou that goest about to establish thine own
          righteousness, I charge thee let conscience speak. Hast thou found it
          to be a happy path? Ah, my friend, "Wherefore dost thou spend thy
          money for that which is not bread, and thy labour for that which
          satisfieth not; hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is
          good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness." I exhort you by
          everything that is sacred and solemn, everything that is important and
          eternal, flee for your lives, look not behind you, stay not in all the
          plain, stay not until you have proved, and found an interest in the
          blood of Jesus Christ, that blood which cleanseth us from all sin. Are
          you still cold and indifferent? Will not the blind man permit me to
          lead him to the feast? Will not my maimed brother put his hand upon my
          shoulder and permit me to assist him to the banquet? Will not the poor
          man allow me to walk side-by-side with him? Must I use some stronger
          words. Must I use some other compulsion to compel you to come in?
          Sinners, this one thing I am resolved upon this morning, if you be not
          saved ye shall be without excuse. Ye, from the grey-headed down to the
          tender age of childhood, if ye this day lay not hold on Christ, your
          blood shall be on your own head. If there be power in man to bring his
          fellow, (as there is when man is helped by the Holy Spirit) that power
          shall be exercised this morning, God helping me. Come, I am not to be
          put off by your rebuffs; if my exhortation fails, I must come to
          something else. My brother, I entreat you, I entreat you stop and
          consider. Do you know what it is you are rejecting this morning? You
          are rejecting Christ, your only Saviour. "Other foundation can no man
          lay;" "there is none other name given among men whereby we must be
          saved." My brother, I cannot bear that ye should do this, for I
          remember what you are forgetting: the day is coming when you will want
          a Saviour. It is not long ere weary months shall have ended, and your
          strength begin to decline; your pulse shall fail you, your strength
          shall depart, and you and the grim monster -- death, must face each
          other. What will you do in the swellings of Jordan without a Saviour?
          Death-beds are stony things without the Lord Jesus Christ. It is an
          awful thing to die anyhow; he that hath the best hope, and the most
          triumphant faith, finds that death is not a thing to laugh at. It is a
          terrible thing to pass from the seen to the unseen, from the mortal to
          the immortal, from time to eternity, and you will find it hard to go
          through the iron gates of death without the sweet wings of angels to
          conduct you to the portals of the skies. It will be a hard thing to
          die without Christ. I cannot help thinking of you. I see you acting
          the suicide this morning, and I picture myself standing at your
          bedside and hearing your cries, and knowing that you are dying without
          hope. I cannot bear that. I think I am standing by your coffin now,
          and looking into your clay-cold face, and saying. "This man despised
          Christ and neglected the great salvation." I think what bitter tears I
          shall weep then, if I think that I have been unfaithful to you, and
          how those eyes fast closed in death, shall seem to chide me and say,
          "Minister, I attended the music hall, but you were not in earnest with
          me; you amused me, you preached to me, but you did not plead with me.
          You did not know what Paul meant when he said, As though God did
          beseech you by us we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to
          God.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          I entreat you let this message enter your heart for another reason. I
          picture myself standing at the bar of God. As the Lord liveth, the day
          of judgment is coming. You believe that? You are not an infidel; your
          conscience would not permit you to doubt the Scripture. Perhaps you
          may have pretended to do so, but you cannot. You feel there must be a
          day when God shall judge the world in righteousness. I see you
          standing in the midst of that throng, and the eye of God is fixed on
          you. It seems to you that he is not looking anywhere else, but only
          upon you, and he summons you before him; and he reads your sins, and
          he cries, "Depart ye cursed into everlasting fire in hell!" My hearer,
          I cannot bear to think of you in that position; it seems as if every
          hair on my head must stand on end to think of any hearer of mine being
          damned. Will you picture yourselves in that position? The word has
          gone forth, "Depart, ye cursed." Do you see the pit as it opens to
          swallow you up? Do you listen to the shrieks and the yells of those
          who have preceded you to that eternal lake of torment? Instead of
          picturing the scene, I turn to you with the words of the inspired
          prophet, and I say, "Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire?
          Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?" Oh! my brother, I
          cannot let you put away religion thus; no, I think of what is to come
          after death. I should be destitute of all humanity if I should see a
          person about to poison himself, and did not dash away the cup; or if I
          saw another about to plunge from London Bridge, if I did not assist in
          preventing him from doing so; and I should be worse than a fiend if I
          did not now, with all love, and kindness, and earnestness, beseech you
          to "lay hold on eternal life," "to labour not for the meat that
          perisheth, but for the meat that endureth unto everlasting life."
        </p>
        <p>
          Some hyper-calvinist would tell me I am wrong in so doing. I cannot
          help it. I must do it. As I must stand before my Judge at last, I feel
          that I shall not make full proof of my ministry unless I entreat with
          many tears that ye would be saved, that ye would look unto Jesus
          Christ and receive his glorious salvation. But does not this avail?
          are all our entreaties lost upon you; do you turn a deaf ear? Then
          again I change my note. Sinner, I have pleaded with you as a man
          pleadeth with his friend, and were it for my own life I could not
          speak more earnestly this morning than I do speak concerning yours. I
          did feel earnest about my own soul, but not a whit more than I do
          about the souls of my congregation this morning; and therefore, if ye
          put away these entreaties I have something else: -- I must threaten
          you. You shall not always have such warnings as these. A day is
          coming, when hushed shall be the voice of every gospel minister, at
          least for you; for your ear shall be cold in death. It shall not be
          any more threatening; it shall be the fulfillment of the threatening.
          There shall be no promise, no proclamations of pardon and of mercy; no
          peace-speaking blood, but you shall be in the land where the Sabbath
          is all swallowed up in everlasting nights of misery, and where the
          preachings of the gospel are forbidden because they would be
          unavailing. I charge you then, listen to this voice that now addresses
          your conscience; for if not, God shall speak to you in his wrath, and
          say unto you in his hot displeasure, "I called and ye refused; I
          stretched out my hand and no man regarded; therefore will I mock at
          your calamity; I will laugh when your fear cometh." Sinner, I threaten
          you again. Remember, it is but a short time you may have to hear these
          warnings. You imagine that your life will be long, but do you know how
          short it is? Have you ever tried to think how frail you are? Did you
          ever see a body when it has been cut in pieces by the anatomist? Did
          you ever see such a marvelous thing as the human frame?
        </p>
        <p>"Strange, a harp of a thousand strings,</p>
        <p>Should keep in tune so long."</p>
        <p>
          Let but one of those cords be twisted, let but a mouthful of food go
          in the wrong direction, and you may die. The slightest chance, as we
          have it, may send you swift to death, when God wills it. Strong men
          have been killed by the smallest and slightest accident, and so may
          you. In the chapel, in the house of God, men have dropped down dead.
          How often do we hear of men falling in our streets -- rolling out of
          time into eternity, by some sudden stroke. And are you sure that heart
          of your's is quite sound? Is the blood circulating with all accuracy?
          Are you quite sure of that? And if it be so, how long shall it be? O,
          perhaps there are some of you here that shall never see Christmas-day;
          it may be the mandate has gone forth already, "Set thine house in
          order, for thou shalt die and not live." Out of this vast
          congregation, I might with accuracy tell how many will be dead in a
          year; but certain it is that the whole of us shall never meet together
          again in any one assembly. Some out of this vast crowd, perhaps some
          two or three, shall depart ere the new year shall be ushered in. I
          remind you, then, my brother, that either the gate of salvation may be
          shut, or else you may be out of the place where the gate of mercy
          stands. Come, then, let the threatening have power with you. I do not
          threaten because I would alarm without cause, but in hopes that a
          brother's threatening may drive you to the place where God hath
          prepared the feast of the gospel. And now, must I turn hopelessly
          away? Have I exhausted all that I can say? No, I will come to you
          again. Tell me what it is, my brother, that keeps you from Christ. I
          hear one say, "Oh, sir, it is because I feel myself too guilty." That
          cannot be, my friend, that cannot be. "But, sir, I am the chief of
          sinners." Friend, you are not. The chief of sinners died and went to
          heaven many years ago; his name was Saul of Tarsus, afterwards called
          Paul the apostle. He was the chief of sinners, I know he spoke the
          truth. "No," but you say still, "I am too vile." You cannot be viler
          than the chief of sinners. You must, at least, be second worst. Even
          supposing you are the worst now alive, you are second worst, for he
          was chief. But suppose you are the worst, is not that the very reason
          why you should come to Christ. The worse a man is, the more reason he
          should go to the hospital or physician. The more poor you are, the
          more reason you should accept the charity of another. Now, Christ does
          not want any merits of your's. He gives freely. The worse you are, the
          more welcome you are. But let me ask you a question: Do you think you
          will ever get better by stopping away from Christ? If so, you know
          very little as yet of the way of salvation at all. No, sir, the longer
          you stay, the worse you will grow; your hope will grow weaker, your
          despair will become stronger; the nail with which Satan has fastened
          you down will be more firmly clenched, and you will be less hopeful
          than ever. Come, I beseech you, recollect there is nothing to be
          gained by delay, but by delay everything may be lost. "But," cries
          another, "I feel I cannot believe." No, my friend, and you never will
          believe if you look first at your believing. Remember, I am not come
          to invite you to faith, but am come to invite you to Christ. But you
          say, "What is the difference?" Why, just this, if you first of all
          say, "I want to believe a thing," you never do it. But your first
          inquiry must be, "What is this thing that I am to believe?" Then will
          faith come as the consequence of that search. Our first business has
          not to do with faith, but with Christ. Come, I beseech you, on
          Calvary's mount, and see the cross. Behold the Son of God, he who made
          the heavens and the earth, dying for your sins. Look to him, is there
          not power in him to save? Look at his face so full of pity. Is there
          not love in his heart to prove him willing to save? Sure sinner, the
          sight of Christ will help thee to believe. Do not believe first, and
          then go to Christ, or else thy faith will be a worthless thing; go to
          Christ without any faith, and cast thyself upon him, sink or swim. But
          I hear another cry, "Oh sir, you do not know how often I have been
          invited, how long I have rejected the Lord." I do not know, and I do
          not want to know; all I know is that my Master has sent me, to compel
          you to come in; so come along with you now. You may have rejected a
          thousand invitations; don't make this the thousandth-and-one. You have
          been up to the house of God, and you have only been gospel hardened.
          But do I not see a tear in your eye; come, my brother, don't be
          hardened by this morning's sermon. O, Spirit of the living God, come
          and melt this heart for it has never been melted, and compel him to
          come in! I cannot let you go on such idle excuses as that; if you have
          lived so many years slighting Christ, there are so many reasons why
          now you should not slight him. But did I hear you whisper that this
          was not a convenient time? Then what must I say to you? When will that
          convenient time come? Shall it come when you are in hell? Will that
          time be convenient? Shall it come when you are on your dying bed, and
          the death throttle is in your throat -- shall it come then? Or when
          the burning sweat is scalding your brow; and then again, when the cold
          clammy sweat is there, shall those be convenient times? When pains are
          racking you, and you are on the borders of the tomb? No, sir, this
          morning is the convenient time. May God make it so. Remember, I have
          no authority to ask you to come to Christ to-morrow. The Master has
          given you no invitation to come to him next Tuesday. The invitation
          is, "To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts as in
          the provocation," for the Spirit saith "to-day." "Come now and let us
          reason together;" why should you put it off? It may be the last
          warning you shall ever have. Put it off, and you may never weep again
          in chapel. You may never have so earnest a discourse addressed to you.
          You may not be pleaded with as I would plead with you now. You may go
          away, and God may say, "He is given unto idols, let him alone." He
          shall throw the reins upon your neck; and then, mark -- your course is
          sure, but it is sure damnation and swift destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now again, is it all in vain? Will you not now come to Christ?
          Then what more can I do? I have but one more resort, and that shall be
          tried. I can be permitted to weep for you; I can be allowed to pray
          for you. You shall scorn the address if you like; you shall laugh at
          the preacher; you shall call him fanatic if you will; he will not
          chide you, he will bring no accusation against you to the great Judge.
          Your offence, so far as he is concerned, is forgiven before it is
          committed; but you will remember that the message that you are
          rejecting this morning is a message from one who loves you, and it is
          given to you also by the lips of one who loves you. You will recollect
          that you may play your soul away with the devil, that you may
          listlessly think it a matter of no importance; but there lives at
          least one who is in earnest about your soul, and one who before he
          came here wrestled with his God for strength to preach to you, and who
          when he has gone from this place will not forget his hearers of this
          morning. I say again, when words fail us we can give tears -- for
          words and tears are the arms with which gospel ministers compel men to
          come in. You do not know, and I suppose could not believe, how anxious
          a man whom God has called to the ministry feels about his
          congregation, and especially about some of them. I heard but the other
          day of a young man who attended here a long time, and his father's
          hope was that he would be brought to Christ. He became acquainted,
          however, with an infidel; and now he neglects his business, and lives
          in a daily course of sin. I saw his father's poor wan face; I did not
          ask him to tell me the story himself, for I felt it was raking up a
          trouble and opening a sore; I fear, sometimes, that good man's grey
          hairs may be brought with sorrow to the grave. Young men, you do not
          pray for yourselves, but your mothers wrestle for you. You will not
          think of your own souls, but your fathers anxiety is exercised for
          you. I have been at prayer meetings, when I have heard children of God
          pray there, and they could not have prayed with more earnestness and
          more intensity of anguish if they had been each of them seeking their
          own soul's salvation. And is it not strange that we should be ready to
          move heaven and earth for your salvation, and that still you should
          have no thought for yourselves, no regard to eternal things?
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I turn for one moment to some here. There are some of you here
          members of Christian churches, who make a profession of religion, but
          unless I be mistaken in you -- and I shall be happy if I am -- your
          profession is a lie. You do not live up to it, you dishonour it; you
          can live in the perpetual practice of absenting yourselves from God's
          house, if not in sins worse than that. Now I ask such of you who do
          not adorn the doctrine of God your Saviour, do you imagine that you
          can call me your pastor, and yet that my soul cannot tremble over you
          and in secret weep for you? Again, I say it may be but little concern
          to you how you defile the garments of your Christianity, but it is a
          great concern to God's hidden ones, who sigh and cry, and groan for
          the iniquities of the professors of Zion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now does anything else remain to the minister besides weeping and
          prayer? Yes, there is one thing else. God has given to his servants
          not the power of regeneration, but he has given them something akin to
          it. It is impossible for any man to regenerate his neighbour; and yet
          how are men born to God? Does not the apostle say of such an one that
          he was begotten by him in his bonds. Now the minister has a power
          given him of God, to be considered both the father and the mother of
          those born to God, for the apostle said he travailed in birth for
          souls till Christ was formed in them. What can we do then? We can now
          appeal to the Spirit. I know I have preached the gospel, that I have
          preached it earnestly; I challenge my Master to honour his own
          promise. He has said it shall not return unto me void, and it shall
          not. It is in his hands, not mine. I cannot compel you, but thou O
          Spirit of God who hast the key of the heart, thou canst compel. Did
          you ever notice in that chapter of the Revelation, where it says,
          "Behold I stand at the door and knock," a few verses before, the same
          person is described, as he who hath the key of David. So that if
          knocking will not avail, he has the key and can and will come in. Now
          if the knocking of an earnest minister prevail not with you this
          morning, there remains still that secret opening of the heart by the
          Spirit, so that you shall be compelled.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought it my duty to labour with you as though I must do it; now I
          throw it into my Master's hands. It cannot be his will that we should
          travail in birth, and yet not bring forth spiritual children. It is
          with him; he is master of the heart, and the day shall declare it,
          that some of you constrained by sovereign grace have become the
          willing captives of the all-conquering Jesus, and have bowed your
          hearts to him through the sermon of this morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          [Mr. Spurgeon concluded with a very interesting anecdote, but as its
          insertion would make the sermon too long for a penny number, the
          publishers have decided to print it as one of the "New Park Street
          Tracts."]<br />
