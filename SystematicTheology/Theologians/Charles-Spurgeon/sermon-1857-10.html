        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.116)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, February 8, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>"Cleanse thou me from secret faults. -- Psalm 19:12.</p>
        <p>
          SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS arises partly from pride but mainly from ignorance
          of God's law. It is because men know little or nothing concerning the
          terrible character of the divine law, that they foolishly imagine
          themselves to be righteous. They are not aware of the deep
          spirituality, and the stern severity of the law, or they would have
          other and wiser notions. Once let them know how strictly the law deals
          with the thoughts, how it brings itself to bear upon every emotion of
          the inner man, and there is not one creature beneath God's heaven who
          would dare to think himself righteous in God's sight in virtue of his
          own deeds and thoughts. Only let the law be revealed to a man; let him
          know how strict the law is, and how infinitely just, and his
          self-righteousness will shrivel into nothing -- it will become a
          filthy rag in his sight, whereas before he thought it to be a goodly
          garment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, David, having seen God's law, and having praised it in this
          Psalm, which I have read in your hearing, he is brought, by reflecting
          on its excellency, to utter this thought, "Who can understand his
          errors?" and then to offer this prayer, "Cleanse thou me from secret
          faults."
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Lateran Council of the Church of Rome, a decree was passed that
          every true believer must confess his sins, all of them, once a year to
          the priest, and they affixed to it this declaration, that there is no
          hope of pardon but in complying with that decree. What can equal the
          absurdity of such a decree as that? Do they suppose that they can tell
          their sins as easily as they can count their fingers? Why, if we could
          receive pardon for all our sins by telling every sin we have committed
          in one hour, there is not one of us who would be able to enter heaven,
          since, besides the sins that are known to us and that we may be able
          to confess, there are a vast mass of sins, which are as truly sins as
          those which we do observe, but which are secret, and come not beneath
          our eye. Oh! if we had eyes like those of God, we should think very
          differently of ourselves. The sins that we see and confess are but
          like the farmer's small samples which he brings to market, when he has
          left his granary full at home. We have but a very few sins which we
          can observe and detect, compared with those which are hidden to
          ourselves and unseen by our fellow creatures. I doubt not it is true
          of all of us who are here, that in every hour of our existence in
          which we are active, we commit tens of thousands of unholinesses for
          which conscience has never reproved us, because we have never seen
          them to be wrong, seeing we have not studied God's laws as we ought to
          have done. Now, be it known to us all that sin is sin, whether we see
          it or not -- that a sin secret to us is a sin as truly as if we knew
          it to be a sin, though not so great a sin in the sight of God as if it
          had been committed presumptuously, seeing that it lacks the
          aggravation of willfulness. Let all of us who know our sins, offer
          this prayer after all our confessions: "Lord, I have confessed as many
          as I know, but I must add an etcetera after them, and say, Cleanse
          thou me from secret faults.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          That, however, will not be the pith of my sermon this morning. I am
          going after a certain class of men who have sins not unknown to
          themselves, but secret to their fellow creatures. Every now and then
          we turn up a fair stone which lies upon the green sward of the
          professing church, surrounded with the verdure of apparent goodness,
          and to our astonishment we find beneath it all kinds of filthy insects
          and loathsome reptiles, and in our disgust as such hypocrisy, we are
          driven to exclaim, "All men are liars; there are none in whom we can
          put any trust at all." It is not fair to say so of all; but really,
          the discoveries which are made of the insincerity of our
          fellow-creatures are enough to make us despise our kind, because they
          can go so far in appearances, and yet have so little soundness of
          heart. To you, sirs, who sin secretly, and yet make a profession; you
          break God's covenants in the dark and wear a mask of goodness in the
          light -- to you, sirs, who shut the doors and commit wickedness in
          secret -- to you I shall speak this morning. O may God also be pleased
          to speak to you, and make you pray this prayer: "Cleanse thou me from
          secret faults."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall endeavour to urge upon all pretenders present to give up, to
          renounce, to detest, to hate, to abhor all their secret sins. And,
          first, I shall endeavour to show the folly of secret sins; secondly,
          the misery of secret sins; thirdly, the guilt of secret sins;
          fourthly, the danger of secret sins; and then I shall try to apply
          some words by way of remedy, that we may all of us be enabled to avoid
          secret sins.
        </p>
        <p>I. First, then, THE FOLLY OF SECRET SINS.</p>
        <p>
          Pretender, thou art fair to look upon; thy conduct outwardly upright,
          amiable, liberal, generous and Christian; but thou dost indulge in
          some sin which the eye of man has not yet detected. Perhaps it is
          private drunkenness. Thou dost revile the drunkard when he staggers
          through the street; but thou canst thyself indulge in the same habit
          in private. It may be some other lust or vice; it is not for me just
          now to mention what it is. But, pretender, we say unto thee, thou art
          a fool to think of harbouring a secret sin; and thou art a fool for
          this one reason, that thy sin is not a secret sin; it is known, and
          shall one day be revealed; perhaps very soon. Thy sin is not a secret;
          the eye of God hath seen it; thou hast sinned before his face. Thou
          hast shut-to the door, and drawn the curtains, and kept out the eye of
          the sun, but God's eye pierceth through the darkness; the brick walls
          which surrounded thee were as transparent as glass to the eye of the
          Almighty; the darkness which did gird thee was as bright as the
          summer's noon to the eye of him who beholdeth all things. Knowest thou
          not, O man, that "all things are naked and open to the eyes of him
          with whom we have to do?" As the priest ran his knife into the
          entrails of his victim, discovered the heart and liver, and what else
          did lie within, so art thou, O man, seen by God, cut open by the
          Almighty; thou hast no secret chamber where thou canst hide thyself;
          thou hast no dark cellar where thou canst conceal thy soul. Dig deep,
          ay, deep as hell, but thou canst not find earth enough upon the globe
          to cover thy sin; if thou shouldst heap the mountains on its grave,
          those mountains would tell the tale of what was buried in their
          bowels. If thou couldst cast thy sin into the sea, a thousand babbling
          waves would tell the secret out. There is no hiding it from God. Thy
          sin is photographed in high heaven; the deed when it was done was
          photographed upon the sky, and there it shall remain, and thou shalt
          see thyself one day revealed to the gazing eyes of all men, a
          hypocrite, a pretender, who didst sin in fancied secret, observed in
          all thine acts by the all-seeing Jehovah. O what fools men are, to
          think they can do anything in secret. This world is like the glass
          hives wherein bees sometimes work: we look down upon them, and we see
          all the operations of the little creatures. So God looketh down and
          seeth all. Our eyes are weak; we cannot look through the darkness; but
          his eye, like an orb of fire, penetrateth the blackness; and readeth
          the thoughts of man, and seeth his acts when he thinks himself most
          concealed. Oh; it were a thought enough to curb us from all sin, if it
          were truly applied to us -- "Thou, God, seest me!" Stop thief! Drop
          thou that which thou hast taken to thyself. God seeth thee! No eye of
          detection on earth hath discovered thee, but God's eyes are now
          looking through the clouds upon thee. Swearer! scarce any for whom
          thou carest heard thy oath; but God heard it; it entered into the ears
          of the Lord God of Sabbaoth. Ah! thou who leadest a filthy life, and
          yet art a respectable merchant bearing among men a fair and goodly
          character; thy vices are all known; written in God's book. He keepeth
          a diary of all thine acts; and what wilt thou think on that day when a
          crowd shall be assembled, compared with which this immense multitude
          is but a drop of a bucket, and God shall read out the story of thy
          secret life, and men and angels shall hear it. Certain I am there are
          none of us who would like to have all our secrets read, especially our
          secret thoughts. If I should select out of this congregation the most
          holy man, should bring him forward and say, "Now, sir, I know all your
          thoughts, and am about to tell them," I am sure he would offer me the
          largest bribe that he could gather if I would be pleased to conceal at
          least some of them. "Tell," He would say, "of my acts; of them I am
          not ashamed; but do not tell my thoughts and imaginations -- of them I
          must ever stand ashamed before God." What, then, sinner, will be thy
          shame when thy privy lusts, thy closet transgressions, thy secret
          crimes shall be gazetted from God's throne, published by his own
          mouth, and with a voice louder than a thousand thunders preached in
          the ears of an assembled world? What will be thy terror and confusion
          then, when all the deeds thou hast done shall be published in the face
          of the sun, in the ears of all mankind. O renounce the foolish hope of
          secresy, for thy sin is this day recorded, and shall one day be
          advertised upon the walls of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>II. In the next place, let us notice THE MISERY OF SECRET SINS.</p>
        <p>
          Of all sinners the man who makes a profession of religion, and yet
          lives in iniquity, is the most miserable. A downright wicked man, who
          takes a glass in his hand, and says, "I am a drunkard, I am not
          ashamed of it," he shall be unutterably miserable in worlds to come,
          but brief though it be, he has his hour of pleasure. A man who curses
          and swears, and says, "That is my habit, I am a profane man," and
          makes a profession of it, he has, at least, some peace in his soul;
          but the man who walks with God's minister, who is united with God's
          Church, who comes out before God's people, and unites with them, and
          then lives in sin, what a miserable existence he must have of it! Why,
          he has a worse existence than the mouse that is in the parlour,
          running out now and then to pick up the crumbs, and then back again to
          his hole. Such men must run out now and then to sin; and oh! how
          fearful they are to be discovered! One day, perhaps, their character
          turns up; with wonderful cunning they manage to conceal and gloss it
          over; but the next day something else comes, and they live in constant
          fear, telling lie after lie, to make the last lie appear truthful,
          adding deception to deception, in order that they may not be
          discovered.
        </p>
        <p>"Oh! tis a tangled web we weave,</p>
        <p>When once we venture to deceive."</p>
        <p>
          If I must be a wicked man, give me the life of a roystering sinner,
          who sins before the face of day; but, if I must sin, let me not act as
          a hypocrite and a coward; let me not profess to be God's, and spend my
          life for the devil. That way of cheating the devil is a thing which
          every honest sinner will be ashamed of. He will say, "Now, if I do
          serve my master I will serve him out and out, I will have no sham
          about it; if I make a profession, I will carry it out; but if I do
          not, if I live in sin, I am not going to gloss it over by cant and
          hypocrisy." One thing which has hamstringed the church, and cut her
          very sinews in twain, has been this most damnable hypocrisy. Oh! in
          how many places have we men whom you might praise to the very skies,
          if you could believe their words, but whom you might cast into the
          nethermost pit if you could see their secret actions. God forgive any
          of you who are so acting! I had almost said, I can scarce forgive you.
          I can forgive the man who riots openly, and makes no profession of
          being better, but the man who fawns, and cants, and pretends, and
          prays, and then lives in sin, that man I hate, I cannot bear him, I
          abhor him from my very soul. If he will turn from his ways, I will
          love him, but in his hypocrisy he is to me the most loathsome of all
          creatures. Tis said the toad doth wear a jewel in her head, but this
          man hath none, but beareth filthiness about him, while he pretends to
          be in love with righteousness. A mere profession, my hearers, is but
          painted pageantry to go to hell in; it is like the plumes upon the
          hearse and the trappings upon the black horses which drag men to their
          graves, the funeral array of dead souls. Take heed above everything of
          a waxen profession that will not stand the sun; take care of a life
          that needs to have two faces to carry it out; be one thing, or else
          the other. If you make up your mind to serve Satan, do not pretend to
          serve God; and if you serve God, serve him with all your heart. "No
          man can serve two masters;" do not try it, do not endeavour to do it,
          for no life will be more miserable than that. Above all, beware of
          committing acts which it will be necessary to conceal. There is a
          singular poem by Hood, called "The Dream of Eugene Aram" -- a most
          remarkable piece it is indeed, illustrating the point on which I am
          now dwelling. Aram has murdered a man and cast his body into the river
          -- "a sluggish water, black as ink, the depth was so extreme." The
          next morning he visited the scene of his guilt:
        </p>
        <p>"And sought the black accursed pool,</p>
        <p>With a wild misgiving eye;</p>
        <p>And he saw the dead in the river bed,</p>
        <p>For the faithless stream was dry."</p>
        <p>
          Next he covered the corpse with heaps of leaves, but a mighty wind
          swept through the wood and left the secret bare before the sun:
        </p>
        <p>"Then down I cast me on my face,</p>
        <p>And first began to weep,</p>
        <p>For I knew my secret then was one</p>
        <p>The earth refused to keep;</p>
        <p>On land or sea though it should be</p>
        <p>Ten thousand fathoms deep."</p>
        <p>
          In plaintive notes he prophesies his own discovery. He buried his
          victim in a cave, and trod him down with stones, but when years had
          run their weary round the foul deed was discovered and the murderer
          put to death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Guilt is a "grim chamberlain," even when his fingers are not bloody
          red. Secret sins bring fevered eyes and sleepless nights, until men
          burn out their consciences, and become in very deed ripe for the pit.
          Hypocrisy is a hard game to play at, for it is one deceiver against
          many observers; and for certain it is a miserable trade, which will
          earn at last, as its certain climax, a tremendous bankruptcy. Ah! ye
          who have sinned without discovery, "Be sure your sin will find you
          out;" and bethink you, it may find you out ere long. Sin, like murder,
          will come out; men will even tell tales about themselves in their
          dreams. God has sometimes made men so pricked in their consciences
          that they have been obliged to stand forth and confess the story.
          Secret sinner! If thou wantest the foretaste of damnation upon earth,
          continue in thy secret sins; for no man is more miserable than he who
          sinneth secretly, and yet trieth to preserve a character. Yon stag,
          followed by the hungry hounds, with open mouths, is far more happy
          than the man who is followed by his sins. Yon bird, taken in the
          fowler's net, and labouring to escape, is far more happy than he who
          hath weaved around himself a web of deception, and labours to escape
          from it day by day by making the toils more thick and the web more
          strong. Oh! the misery of secret sins! Truly, one may pray, "Cleanse
          thou me from secret faults."
        </p>
        <p>III. But now, next, the guilt THE SOLEMN GUILT OF SECRET SIN.</p>
        <p>
          Now, John, you do not think there is any evil in a thing unless
          somebody sees it, do you? You feel that it is a very great sin if your
          master finds you out in robbing the till -- but there is no sin if he
          should not discover it -- none at all. And you, sir, you fancy it to
          be very great sin to play a trick in trade, in case you should be
          discovered and brought before the court; but to play a trick and never
          be discovered, that is all fair -- do not say a word about it Mr.
          Spurgeon, it is all business; you must not touch business; tricks that
          are not discovered, of course you are not to find fault with them. The
          common measure of sin is the notoriety of it. But I do not believe in
          that. A sin is a sin, whether done in private or before the wide
          world. It is singular how men will measure guilt. A railway servant
          puts up a wrong signal, there is an accident; the man is tried, and
          severely reprimanded. The day before he put up the wrong signal, but
          there was no accident, and therefore no one accused him for his
          neglect. But it was just the same, accident or no accident, the
          accident did not make the guilt, it was the deed which made the guilt,
          not the notoriety nor yet the consequence of it. It was his business
          to have taken care; and he was as guilty the first time as he was the
          second, for he negligently exposed the lives of men. Do not measure
          sin by what other people say of it; but measure sin by what God says
          of it, and what your own conscience says of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I hold that secret sin, if anything, is the worst of sin; because
          secret sin implies that the man who commits it has Atheism in his
          heart. You will ask how that can be. I reply, he may be a professing
          Christian, but I shall tell him to his face that he is a practical
          Atheist, if he labours to keep up a respectable profession before man,
          and then secretly transgresses. Why, is he not an Atheist, who will
          say there is a God, yet at the same time thinks more of man than he
          does of God? Is it not the very essence of Atheism -- is it not a
          denial of the divinity of the Most High when men lightly esteem him
          and think more of the eye of a creature than of the observation of
          their Creator? There are some who would not for the life of them say a
          wicked word in the presence of their minister, but they can do it,
          knowing God is looking at them. They are Atheists. There are some who
          would not trick in trade for all the world if they thought they would
          be discovered, but they can do it while God is with them; that is,
          they think more of the eye of man than of the eye of God; and they
          think it worse to be condemned by man than to be condemned by God.
          Call it by what name you will, the proper name of that is practical
          Atheism. It is dishonoring God; it is dethroning him; putting him down
          below his own creatures; and what is that, but to take away his
          divinity? Brethren, do not, I beseech you, incur the fearful guilt of
          secret sins. No man can sin a little in secret, it will certainly
          engender more sin; no man can be a hypocrite and yet be moderate in
          guilt; he will go from bad to worse, and still proceed, until when his
          guilt shall be published, he shall be found to be the very worst and
          most hardened of men. Take heed of the guilt of secret sin. AH, now if
          could I preach as Rowland Hill did, I would make some people look to
          themselves at home, and tremble too! It is said that when he preached,
          there was not a man in the window, or standing in the crowd, or
          perched up anywhere, but said, "There, he is preaching at me; he is
          telling me about my secret sins." And when he proclaimed God's
          omniscience, it is said men would almost think they saw God bodily
          present in the midst of them looking at them. And when he had done his
          sermon, they would hear a voice in their ears, "Can any hide himself
          in secret places that I cannot see him? saith the Lord. Do not I fill
          heaven and earth? saith the Lord." I would I could do that; that I
          could make every man look to himself, and find out his secret sin.
          Come my hearer, what is it? Bring it forth to the daylight; perhaps it
          will die in the light of the sun. These things love not to be
          discovered. Tell thine own conscience, now, what it is. Look it in the
          face; confess it before God, and may he give thee grace to remove that
          sin and every other, and turn to him with full purpose of heart! But
          this know -- that thy guilt is guilt discovered or undiscovered, and
          that if there be any difference it is worse, because it has been
          secret. God save us from the guilt of secret sin! "Cleanse thou me
          from secret faults."
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And note, next, THE DANGER OF SECRET SIN. One danger is, that a
          man cannot commit a little sin in secret, without being by-and-by
          betrayed into a public sin. You cannot, sir, though you may think you
          can preserve a moderation in sin. If you commit one sin, it is like
          the melting of the lower glacier upon the Alps; the others must follow
          in time. As certainly as you heap one stone upon the cairn to-day, the
          next day you will cast another, until the heap, reared stone by stone,
          shall become a very pyramid. See the coral insect at work, you cannot
          decree where it shall stay its work. It will not build its rock just
          as high as you please, it will not stay until it shall be covered with
          weeds, until the weeds shall decay; and there shall be soil upon it,
          and an island shall be created by tiny creatures. Sin cannot be held
          in with bit and bridle. "But I am going to have a little drink now and
          then, I am only going to be intoxicated once a week or so. Nobody will
          see it; I shall be in bed directly." You will be drunk in the streets
          soon. "I am only just going to read one lascivious book; I will put it
          under the sofa-cover when any one comes in." You will keep it in your
          library yet, sir. "I am only going into that company now and then."
          You will go there every day, such is the bewitching character of it;
          you cannot help it. You may as well ask the lion to let you put your
          head into his mouth. You cannot regulate his jaws: neither can you
          regulate sin. Once go into it, you cannot tell when you will be
          destroyed. You may be such a fortunate individual, that like Van
          Amburgh you may put your head in and out a great many times; reset
          assured that one of these days it will be a costly venture. Again, you
          may labour to conceal your vicious habit, but it will come out, you
          cannot help it. You keep your little pet sin at home; but mark this,
          when the door is ajar the dog will be out in the street. Wrap him up
          in your bosom, put over him fold after fold of hypocrisy to keep him
          secret, the wretch will be singing some day when you are in company;
          you cannot keep the evil bird still. Your sin will gad abroad; and
          what is more, you will not mind it some of these days. A man who
          indulges in sin privately, by degrees gets his forehead as hard as
          brass. The first time he sinned, the drops of sweat stood on his brow
          at the recollection of what he had done; the second time, no hot sweat
          on his brow, only an agitation of the muscle; the third time there was
          the sly, sneaky look, but no agitation; the next time, he sinned a
          little further; and by degrees he became the bold blasphemer of his
          God, who exclaimed, "Who am I that I should fear Jehovah, and who is
          he that I should serve him?" Men go from bad to worse. Launch your
          boat in the current -- it must go where the current takes it. Put
          yourself in the whirlwind -- you are but a straw in the wind: you must
          go which way the wind carries you -- you cannot control yourself. The
          balloon can mount, but it cannot direct its course; it must go
          whichever way the wind blows. If you once mount into sin there is no
          stopping. Take heed if you would not become the worst of characters,
          take heed of the little sins, they, mounting one upon another, may at
          last heave you from the summit and destroy your soul for ever. There
          is a great danger in secret sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I have here some true Christians who indulge in secret sins. They
          say it is but a little one, and therefore do they spare it. Dear
          brethren, I speak to you, and I speak to myself, when I say this --
          let us destroy all our little secret sins. They are called little and
          if they be, let us remember that it is the foxes, even the little
          foxes, that spoil our vines; for our vines have tender shoots. Let us
          take heed of our little sins. A little sin, like a little pebble in
          the shoe, will make a traveller to heaven walk very wearily. Little
          sins, like little thieves, may open the door to greater ones outside.
          Christians, recollect that little sins will spoil your communion with
          Christ. Little sins, like little stains in silk, may damage the fine
          texture of fellowship; little sins, like little irregularities in the
          machinery, may spoil the whole fabric of your religion. The one dead
          fly spoileth the whole pot of ointment. That one thistle may seed a
          continent with noxious weeds. Let us, brethren, kill our sins as often
          as we can find them. One said -- "The heart is full of unclean birds;
          it is a cage of them." "Ah, but," said another divine, "you must not
          make that an apology, for a Christian's business is to wring their
          necks." And so it is; if there be evil things, it is our business to
          kill them. Christians must not tolerate secret sins. We must not
          harbour traitors; it is high treason against the King of Heaven. Let
          us drag them out to light, and offer them upon the altar, giving up
          the dearest of our secret sins at the will and bidding of God. There
          is a great danger in a little secret sin; therefore avoid it, pass not
          by it, turn from it and shun it; and God give thee grace to overcome
          it!
        </p>
        <p>
          V. And now I come, in finishing up, to plead with all my might with
          some of you whom God has pricked in your consciences. I have come to
          intreat you, if it be possible, even to tears, that you will give up
          your secret sins. I have one here for whom I bless God; I love him,
          though I know him not. He is almost persuaded to be a Christian; he
          halteth between two opinions; he intendeth to serve God, he striveth
          to give up sin, but he findeth it a hard struggle, and as yet he
          knoweth not what shall become of him. I speak to him with all love: my
          friend, will you have your sin and go to hell, or leave your sin and
          go to heaven? This is the solemn alternative: to all awakened sinners
          I put it; may God choose for you, otherwise I tremble as to which you
          may choose. The pleasures of this life are so intoxicating, the joys
          of it so ensnaring, that did I not believe that God worketh in us to
          will and to do, I should despair of you. But I have confidence that
          God will decide the matter. Let me lay the alternative before you: --
          on the one hand there is a hour's merriment, a short life of bliss,
          and that a poor, poor bliss; on the other hand, there is everlasting
          life and eternal glory. On the one hand, there is a transient
          happiness, and afterwards overwhelming woe; in this case there is a
          solid peace and everlasting joy, and after it overflowing bliss. I
          shall not fear to be called an Arminian, when I say, as Elijah did,
          "Choose you this day whom you will serve. If God be God, serve him; if
          Baal be God serve him." But, now, make your choice deliberately; and
          may God help you to do it! Do not say you will take up with religion,
          without first counting the cost of it; remember, there is your lust to
          be given up, your pleasure to be renounced; can you do it for Christ's
          sake? Can you? I know you cannot, unless God's grace shall assist you
          in making such a choice. But can you say, "Yes, by the help of God,
          earth's gaudy toys, its pomps, pageantries, gewgaws, all these I
          renounce? --
        </p>
        <p>"These can never satisfy,</p>
        <p>Give me Christ or else I die."</p>
        <p>
          Sinner, thou wilt never regret that choice, if God help thee to make
          it; thou wilt find thyself a happy man here, and thrice happy
          throughout eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But," says one, "Sir, I intend to be religious, but I do not hold
          with your strictness." I do not ask you to do so; I hope, however, you
          will hold with God's strictness, and God's strictness is ten thousand
          times greater than mine. You may say that I am puritanical in my
          preaching; God will be puritanical in judging in that great day. I may
          appear severe, but I can never be so severe as God will be. I may draw
          the harrow with sharp teeth across your conscience, but God shall drag
          harrows of eternal fire across you one day. I may speak thundering
          things! God will not speak them, but hurl them from his hands.
          Remember, men may laugh at hell, and say there is none; but they must
          reject their Bibles before they can believe the lie. Men's consciences
          tell them that
        </p>
        <p>"There is a dreadful hell,</p>
        <p>And everlasting pains;</p>
        <p>Where sinners must with devils dwell,</p>
        <p>In darkness, fire and chains."</p>
        <p>
          Sirs, will ye keep your secret sins, and have eternal fire for them?
          Remember it is of no use, they must all be given up, or else you
          cannot be God's child. You cannot by any means have both; it cannot be
          God and the world, it cannot be Christ and the devil; it must be one
          or the other. Oh! that God would give you grace to resign all; for
          what are they worth? They are your deceivers now, and will be your
          tormentors for ever. Oh! that your eyes were open to see the
          rottenness, the emptiness and trickery of iniquity. Oh! that God would
          turn you to himself. Oh! may God give you grace to cross the Rubicon
          of repentance at this very hour; to say, "Henceforth it is war to the
          knife with my sins; not one of them will I willingly keep, but down
          with them, down with them; Canaanite, Hittite, Jebusite, they shall
          all be driven out."
        </p>
        <p>"The dearest idol I have known,</p>
        <p>Whate'er that idol be;</p>
        <p>Help me to tear it from its throne,</p>
        <p>And worship only thee."</p>
        <p>
          "But oh! sir, I cannot do it; it would be like pulling my eyes out."
          Ay, but hear what Christ says: "It were better for thee to enter into
          life with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire."
          "But it would be like cutting my arms off." Ay, and it would be better
          for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, than to be cast into hell
          fire for ever. Oh! when the sinner comes before God at last, do you
          think he will speak as he does now? God will reveal his secret sins:
          the sinner will not then say, "Lord, I thought my secret sins so
          sweet, I could not give them up." I think I see how changed it will be
          then. "Sir" you say now, "you are too strict;" will you say that when
          the eyes of the Almighty are glowering on you? You say now, "Sir, you
          are too precise;" will you say that to God Almighty's face? "Sir, I
          mean to keep such-and-such a sin." Can you say it at God's bar at
          last? You will not dare to do it then. Ah! when Christ comes a second
          time, there will be a marvellous change in the way men talk. Methinks
          I see him; there he sits upon his throne. Now, Caiaphas, come and
          condemn him now! Judas! comes and kiss him now! What do you stick at,
          man? Are you afraid of him? Now, Barrabbas! go; see whether they will
          prefer you to Christ now. Swearer, now is your time; you have been a
          bold man; curse him to his face now. Now drunkard; stagger up to him
          now. Now infidel; tell him there is no Christ now -- now that the
          world is lit with lightning and the earth is shaken with thunder till
          the solid pillars thereof do bow themselves -- tell God there is no
          God now; now laugh at the Bible; now scoff at the minister. Why men,
          what is the matter with you? Why, can't you do it? Ah! there you are;
          you have fled to the hills and to the rocks -- "Rocks hide us!
          mountains fall on us; hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the
          throne." Ah! where are now your boasts, your vauntings, and your
          glories? Alas! alas! for you, in that dread day of wonders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secret sinner, what will then become of thee? Go out of this place
          unmasked; go out to examine thyself, go out to bend thy knee, go out
          to weep, go out to pray. God give thee grace to believe! And oh, how
          sweet and pleasant the thought, that this day sinners have fled to
          Christ, and men have been born again to Jesus! Brethren, ere I finish,
          I repeat the words at which so many have cavilled -- it is now, or
          never, it is turn or burn. Solemnly in God's sight I say it; if it be
          not God's truth I must answer for it in the great day of account. Your
          consciences tell you it is true. Take it home, and mock me if you
          will; this morning I am clear of your blood: if any seek not God, but
          live in sin, I shall be clear of your blood in that day when the
          watchman shall have your souls demanded of him; oh, may God grant that
          you may be cleared in a blessed manner! When I went down those pulpit
          stairs a Sabbath or two ago, a friend said to me words which have been
          in my mind ever since -- "Sir, there are nine thousand people this day
          without excuse in the day of judgment." It is true of you this
          morning. If you are damned, it will be not for want of preaching to
          you, and it shall not be for want of praying for you. God knoweth that
          if my heart could break of itself, it would, for your souls, for God
          is my witness, how earnestly I long for you in the bowels of Christ
          Jesus. Oh, that he might touch your hearts and bring you to him! For
          death is a solemn thing, damnation is a horrible thing, to be out of
          Christ is a dreadful thing, to be dead in sin is a terrific thing. May
          God lead you to view these things as they are, and save you, for his
          mercy's sake! "He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved."
        </p>
        <p>"Lord, search my soul, try every thought;</p>
        <p>Though my own heart accuse me not</p>
        <p>Of walking in a false disguise,</p>
        <p>I beg the trial of thine eyes.</p>
        <p>Doth secret mischief lurk within?</p>
        <p>Do I indulge some unknown sin?</p>
        <p>O turn my feet whene'er I stray,</p>
        <p>And lead me in thy perfect way."<br /></p>
