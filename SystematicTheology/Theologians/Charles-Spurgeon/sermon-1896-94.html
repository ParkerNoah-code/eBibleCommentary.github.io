          21. And thou, O Jehovah my Lord! undertake for me, for thy name's
          sake; deliver me, because thy mercy is good; 22. Because I am poor and
          needy, and my heart is wounded within me.23. I walk about as a shadow
          when it declineth. I am tossed as the locust. 24. My knees are become
          feeble through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.25. But I
          became a reproach to them; when they see me they shake their head.26.
          Help me, O Jehovah my God! save me according to thy mercy: 27. And
          they shall know that this is thy hand, and that thou, O Jehovah! hast
          done it.

          21 And thou, O Jehovah my Lord! From the pouring out of complaints and
          imprecations against his enemies, the Psalmist passes to prayers; or
          rather, after having betaken himself to God as his guardian and
          deliverer, he appears to take occasion, from this circumstance, to
          encourage himself in prayer; even as all the pious reflections by
          which the faithful exercise and strengthen their faith, stimulate them
          to call upon the name of God. At the same time, he does not pique
          himself upon any service which he has rendered to God, as deserving of
          his help, nor does he rely upon his own worthiness, but he places all
          his confidence in the free grace and mercy of God. That integrity of
          which he was conscious, he placed in opposition to his enemies, for
          the purpose of making their iniquity more manifest; but he does not
          aspire after any recompense from God, because he adopts the nobler
          principle, that of owing every thing to God's voluntary choice, upon
          which also he acknowledges his safety depends. Were it lawful for any
          one to boast of his virtues and merits, certainly David was not the
          man who was least entitled to do so; and, moreover, he was the
          representative of Christ, and of the whole Church. Hence it follows,
          that all our prayers will vanish in smoke, unless they are grounded
          upon the mercy of God. The case of Christ was indeed a peculiar one,
          inasmuch as it was by his own righteousness that he appeased the wrath
          of his Father towards us. As, however, his human nature was entirely
          dependant on the good pleasure of God, so it was his will, by his own
          example, to direct us to the same source. What can we do, seeing that
          the most upright among us is constrained to acknowledge that he is
          chargeable with the commission of much sin; surely we never can make
          God our debtor? It follows, therefore, that God, on account of the
          benignity of his nature, takes us under his protection; and that,
          because of the goodness of his mercy, he desires his grace may shine
          forth in us. In coming to God, we must always remember that we must
          possess the testimony of a good conscience, and must beware of
          harbouring the thought that we have any inherent righteousness which
          would render God our debtor, or that we deserve any recompense at his
          hands. For if, in the preservation of this short and frail life, God
          manifests the glory of his name and of his goodness, how much more
          ought all confidence in good works to be laid aside, when the
          subject-matter referred to is life heavenly and eternal? If, in the
          prolonging of my life for a short time on earth, his name is thereby
          glorified, by manifesting of his own accord towards me his benignity
          and liberality; when, therefore, having delivered me from the tyranny
          of Satan, he adopts me into his family, washes away my impurity in the
          blood of Christ, regenerates me by his Holy Spirit, unites me to his
          Son, and conducts me to the life of heaven, -- then, assuredly, the
          more bountifully he treats me, the less should I be disposed to
          arrogate to myself any portion of the praise. How different a part
          does David act, who, in order to procure favor for himself, publishes
          his own poverty and misery? And as outward affliction is of no avail,
          unless a man, at the same time, be humbled, and his proud and
          rebellious spirit be subdued, the Psalmist here repeats, that his
          heart was wounded within him. From which we may learn, that God will
          be a physician to none, except to such as in the spirit of genuine
          humility send up their sighs and groans to him, and do not become
          hardened under their afflictions.

          23 I walk about as a shadow. These are two very appropriate
          similitudes: to the first of them I formerly adverted in Psalm 102:12;
          namely, that the afflicted person, and he who is almost lifeless, is
          very fitly compared to the shadow of the evening. At sunrise, or when
          he is shining in noon-day brightness, the constant shifting of the
          shadow is not so perceptible; but, towards sunset, the shadow flits
          before us during every moment that passes. By the other similitude,
          the transitory nature of all sublunary things is pointed out. For as
          the locusts are constantly skipping from one place to another, so
          David complains of his life being ever rendered uneasy by incessant
          persecution, so that no space was allowed him for repose; and this is
          similar to what he says in Psalm 11:1, that he was compelled to flee
          like a sparrow, for which the fowler lays snares in all directions. In
          short, he mourns over his forlorn situation, that he could find no
          place of safety, and that, even among men, he could get no habitation.
          And, as in this psalm, he presents us with a picture of the whole
          Church, we need not be surprised if God try us, and arouse us from our
          lethargy, by an innumerable variety of events. Accordingly, Paul, 1
          Corinthians 4:11, speaking of himself and others, says, that they have
          no certain dwelling-place; a description which is more or less
          applicable to all the children of God.

          24 My knees are become feeble. Though David had the necessaries of
          life, yet he emaciated himself by voluntary abstinence, to which, as
          well as to prayer, he gave himself, and therefore we may regard this
          verse as expressive of his sorrow and sadness. We may also understand
          it as expressive of his having no relish for meat or drink, knowing,
          as we do, that persons who are in sorrow and sadness have no appetite
          for food; even life itself is burdensome to them. Should any one
          prefer restricting the interpretation to David's being in want of the
          necessaries of life, when he hid himself in the dens of wild beasts,
          to escape the fury of his enemies, and was then subjected to hunger
          and thirst, he may do so. It appears to me, however, that by this
          language he intends to point out the extreme anguish which he felt,
          because, with death staring him in the face, he loathed all food; and
          this is in accordance with the next clause, in which he says, my flesh
          faileth of fatness; because "a sorrowful spirit drieth up the bones,"
          (Proverbs 17:22) By the term, fatness, some understand delicacies;
          meaning that he was deprived of all that food which is pleasing to the
          palate. The more natural way is to consider it as denoting his
          becoming emaciated by reason of grief and fasting, inasmuch as the
          natural moisture was wasted. Another proof of his sad situation arises
          from this, that, according to what he states in Psalm 22:7, he was
          held in scorn by all. It is, indeed, a sad and bitter thing which
          God's children endure, when they are made to feel that the curse which
          he denounces against the transgressors of his law is directed against
          themselves; for the law says to the despisers of it,
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and laughing-stock,"
          (Deuteronomy 28:37)
        </p>
        <p>
          With this species of temptation David was assailed; and he declares
          that he was not only regarded as a condemned person, but also cruelly
          derided; God at the same time coming in for a share of it; for it is
          usual with the ungodly to conduct themselves with insolence and pride
          towards us when they see us oppressed under afflictions, and, at the
          same time, to rail at our faith and piety, because God renders us no
          help in our miseries.
        </p>
        <p>
          26 Help me, O Jehovah! The prophet repeats his prayer, because the
          more we are assailed by the subtilty and deceit of Satan, the more
          necessary is it for us to strive more ardently, and display the
          greater boldness. We may, indeed, have the full assurance of God being
          propitious towards us, yet when he delays to manifest it, and when the
          ungodly slander us, it must be that various doubts which keep
          intruding themselves upon us arise in our minds. Hence, it is not
          without reason that David, in order that he might withstand such
          attacks, places himself under the protection of that God who,
          according to his mercy and goodness, helps his people in their time of
          need. He implores that deliverance may be extended to him, not by
          ordinary means, but by the peculiar and special display of God's
          power, so that his enemies may stand abashed, and not dare to open
          their mouths; and we know that God sometimes secretly grants succor to
          his servants, while, at other times, he stretches out his hand in such
          a visible manner, that the ungodly, though they shut their eyes, are
          constrained to acknowledge that there is divine agency connected with
          their deliverance. For as his enemies had exalted themselves against
          God, so it was his desire, after they shall have been subdued, to
          exult over them in the name of God. In cherishing this desire, he has
          no wish to procure for himself the renown of being valiant in war, but
          that God's power may be displayed, that no flesh may glory in his
          sight. The words may also be viewed as referring both to his
          deliverance from his enemies, and to his affliction; his desire being
          to attribute his deliverance mainly to the grace of God; because, in
          opposing the hand of God to fortune and to all human means of
          deliverance, it is plainly his intention that God should be recognised
          as the alone author of it. This deserves to be carefully considered by
          us, for however anxious we are to be delivered by the hand of God, yet
          there is scarcely one among a hundred who makes the manifestation of
          God's glory his chief end; that glory for which we ought to have a
          greater regard than for our own safety, because it is far more
          excellent. Whosoever then is desirous that the ungodly may be
          constrained to acknowledge the power of God, ought the more carefully
          to take heed to the help of God which in his own case he experiences;
          for it would be most absurd to point out the hand of God to others, if
          our minds have not recognised it.<br />
