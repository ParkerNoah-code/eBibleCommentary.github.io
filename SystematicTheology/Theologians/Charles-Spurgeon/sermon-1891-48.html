          1. Much more like the truth, and more pleasing, is the account which
          Antiphanes, one of the ancient comic poets, gives in his Theogony as
          to the origin of all things. For he speaks Chaos as being produced
          from Night and Silence; relates that then Love sprang from Chaos and
          Night; from this again, Light; and that from this, in his opinion,
          were derived all the rest of the first generation of the gods. After
          these he next introduces a second generation of gods, and the creation
          of the world; then he narrates the formation of mankind by the second
          order of the gods. These men (the heretics), adopting this fable as
          their own, have ranged their opinions round it, as if by a sort of
          natural process, changing only the names of the things referred to,
          and setting forth the very same beginning of the generation of all
          things, and their production. In place of Night and Silence they
          substitute Bythus and Sige; instead of Chaos, they put Nous; and for
          Love (by whom, says the comic poet, all other things were set in
          order) they have brought forward the Word; while for the primary and
          greatest gods they have formed the Æons; and in place of the secondary
          gods, they tell us of that creation by their mother which is outside
          of the Pleroma, calling it the second Ogdoad. They proclaim to us,
          like the writer referred to, that from this (Ogdoad) came the creation
          of the world and the formation of man, maintaining that they alone are
          acquainted with these ineffable and unknown mysteries. Those things
          which are everywhere acted in the theatres by comedians with the
          clearest voices they transfer to their own system, teaching them
          undoubtedly through means of the same arguments, and merely changing
          the names.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. And not only are they convicted of bringing forward, as if their
          own [original ideas], those things which are to be found among the
          comic poets, but they also bring together the things which have been
          said by all those who were ignorant of God, and who are termed
          philosophers; and sewing together, as it were, a motley garment out of
          a heap of miserable rags, they have, by their subtle manner of
          expression, furnished themselves with a cloak which is really not
          their own. They do, it is true, introduce a new kind of doctrine,
          inasmuch as by a new sort of art it has been substituted [for the
          old]. Yet it is in reality both old and useless, since these very
          opinions have been sewed together out of ancient dogmas redolent of
          ignorance and irreligion. For instance, Thales of Miletus affirmed
          that water was the generative and initial principle of all things. Now
          it is just the same thing whether we say water or Bythus. The poet
          Homer, again, held the opinion that Oceanus, along with mother Tethys,
          was the origin of the gods: this idea these men have transferred to
          Bythus and Sige. Anaximander laid it down that infinitude is the first
          principle of all things, having seminally in itself the generation of
          them all, and from this he declares the immense worlds [which exist]
          were formed: this, too, they have dressed up anew, and referred to
          Bythus and their Æons. Anaxagoras, again, who has also been surnamed
          |Atheist,| gave it as his opinion that animals were formed from seeds
          falling down from heaven upon earth. This thought, too, these men have
          transferred to |the seed| of their Mother, which they maintain to be
          themselves; thus acknowledging at once, in the judgment of such as are
          possessed of sense, that they themselves are the offspring of the
          irreligious Anaxagoras.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Again, adopting the [ideas of] shade and vacuity from Democritus
          and Epicurus, they have fitted these to their own views, following
          upon those [teachers] who had already talked a great deal about a
          vacuum and atoms, the one of which they called that which is, and the
          other that which is not. In like manner, these men call those things
          which are within the Pleroma real existences, just as those
          philosophers did the atoms; while they maintain that those which are
          without the Pleroma have no true existence, even as those did
          respecting the vacuum. They have thus banished themselves in this
          world (since they are here outside of the Pleroma) into a place which
          has no existence. Again, when they maintain that these things [below]
          are images of those which have a true existence [above], they again
          most manifestly rehearse the doctrine of Democritus and Plato. For
          Democritus was the first who maintained that numerous and diverse
          figures were stamped, as it were, with the forms [of things above],
          and descended from universal space into this world. But Plato, for his
          part, speaks of matter, and exemplar, and God. These men, following
          those distinctions, have styled what he calls ideas, and exemplar, the
          images of those things which are above; while, through a mere change
          of name, they boast themselves as being discoverers and contrivers of
          this kind of imaginary fiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This opinion, too, that they hold the Creator formed the world out
          of previously existing matter, both Anaxagoras, Empedocles, and Plato
          expressed before them; as, forsooth, we learn they also do under the
          inspiration of their Mother. Then again, as to the opinion that
          everything of necessity passes away to those things out of which they
          maintain it was also formed, and that God is the slave of this
          necessity, so that He cannot impart immortality to what is mortal, or
          bestow incorruption on what is corruptible, but every one passes into
          a substance similar in nature to itself, both those who are named
          Stoics from the portico (stoa), and indeed all that are ignorant of
          God, poets and historians alike, make the same affirmation. Those
          [heretics] who hold the same [system of] infidelity have ascribed, no
          doubt, their own proper region to spiritual beings, -- that, namely,
          which is within the Pleroma, but to animal beings the intermediate
          space, while to corporeal they assign that which is material. And they
          assert that God Himself can do no otherwise, but that every one of the
          [different kinds of substance] mentioned passes away to those things
          which are of the same nature [with itself].
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Moreover, as to their saying that the Saviour was formed out of all
          the Æons, by every one of them depositing, so to speak, in Him his own
          special flower, they bring forward nothing new that may not be found
          in the Pandora of Hesiod. For what he says respecting her, these men
          insinuate concerning the Saviour, bringing Him before us as Pandoros
          (All-gifted), as if each of the Æons had bestowed on Him what He
          possessed in the greatest perfection. Again, their opinion as to the
          indifference of [eating of] meats and other actions, and as to their
          thinking that, from the nobility of their nature, they can in no
          degree at all contract pollution, whatever they eat or perform, they
          have derived it from the Cynics, since they do in fact belong to the
          same society as do these [philosophers]. They also strive to transfer
          to [the treatment of matters of] faith that hairsplitting and subtle
          mode of handling questions which is, in fact, a copying of Aristotle.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Again, as to the desire they exhibit to refer this whole universe
          to numbers, they have learned it from the Pythagoreans. For these were
          the first who set forth numbers as the initial principle of all
          things, and [described] that initial principle of theirs as being both
          equal and unequal, out of which [two properties] they conceived that
          both things sensible and immaterial derived their origin. And [they
          held] that one set of first principles gave rise to the matter [of
          things], and another to their form. They affirm that from these first
          principles all things have been made, just as a statue is of its metal
          and its special form. Now, the heretics have adapted this to the
          things which are outside of the Pleroma. The [Pythagoreans] maintained
          that the principle of intellect is proportionate to the energy
          wherewith mind, as a recipient of the comprehensible, pursues its
          inquiries, until, worn out, it is resolved at length in the
          Indivisible and One. They further affirm that Hen -- that is, One --
          is the first principle of all things, and the substance of all that
          has been formed. From this again proceeded the Dyad, the Tetrad, the
          Pentad, and the manifold generation of the others. These things the
          heretics repeat, word for word, with a reference to their Pleroma and
          Bythus. From the same source, too, they strive to bring into vogue
          those conjunctions which proceed from unity. Marcus boasts of such
          views as if they were his own, and as if he were seen to have
          discovered something more novel than others, while he simply sets
          forth the Tetrad of Pythagoras as the originating principle and mother
          of all things.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. But I will merely say, in opposition to these men -- Did all those
          who have been mentioned, with whom you have been proved to coincide in
          expression, know, or not know, the truth? If they knew it, then the
          descent of the Saviour into this world was superfluous. For why [in
          that case] did He descend? Was it that He might bring that truth which
          was [already] known to the knowledge of those who knew it? If, on the
          other hand, these men did not know it, then how is it that, while you
          express yourselves in the same terms as do those who knew not the
          truth, ye boast that yourselves alone possess that knowledge which is
          above all things, although they who are ignorant of God [likewise]
          possess it? Thus, then, by a complete perversion of language, they
          style ignorance of the truth knowledge: and Paul well says [of them,]
          that [they make use of] |novelties of words of false knowledge.| For
          that knowledge of theirs is truly found to be false. If, however,
          taking an impudent course with respect to these points, they declare
          that men indeed did not know the truth, but that their Mother, the
          seed of the Father, proclaimed the mysteries of truth through such
          men, even as also through the prophets, while the Demiurge was
          ignorant [of the proceeding], then I answer, in the first place, that
          the things which were predicted were not of such a nature as to be
          intelligible to no one; for the men themselves knew what they were
          saying, as did also their disciples, and those again succeeded these.
          And, in the next place, if either the Mother or her seed knew and
          proclaimed those things which were of the truth (and the Father is
          truth), then on their theory the Saviour spoke falsely when He said,
          |No one knoweth the Father but the Son,| unless indeed they maintain
          that their seed or Mother is No-one.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Thus far, then, by means of [ascribing to their Æons] human
          feelings, and by the fact that they largely coincide in their language
          with many of those who are ignorant of God, they have been seen
          plausibly drawing a certain number away [from the truth]. They lead
          them on by the use of those [expressions] with which they have been
          familiar, to that sort of discourse which treats of all things,
          setting forth the production of the Word of God, and of Zoe, and of
          Nous, and bringing into the world, as it were, the [successive]
          emanations of the Deity. The views, again, which they propound,
          without either plausibility or parade, are simply lies from beginning
          to end. Just as those who, in order to lure and capture any kind of
          animals, place their accustomed food before them, gradually drawing
          them on by means of the familiar aliment, until at length they seize
          it, but, when they have taken them captive, they subject them to the
          bitterest of bondage, and drag them along with violence whithersoever
          they please; so also do these men gradually and gently persuading
          [others], by means of their plausible speeches, to accept of the
          emission which has been mentioned, then bring forward things which are
          not consistent, and forms of the remaining emissions which are not
          such as might have been expected. They declare, for instance, that
          [ten] Æons were sent forth by Logos and Zoe, while from Anthropos and
          Ecclesia there proceeded twelve, although they have neither proof, nor
          testimony, nor probability, nor anything whatever of such a nature [to
          support these assertions]; and with equal folly and audacity do they
          wish it to be believed that from Logos and Zoe, being Æons, were sent
          forth Bythus and Mixis, Ageratos and Henosis, Autophyes and Hedone,
          Acinetos and Syncrasis, Monogenes and Macaria. Moreover, [as they
          affirm,] there were sent forth, in a similar way, from Anthropos and
          Ecclesia, being Æons, Paracletus and Pistis, Patricos and Elpis,
          Metricos and Agape, Ainos and Synesis, Ecclesiasticus and Macariotes,
          Theletos and Sophia.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. The passions and error of this Sophia, and how she ran the risk of
          perishing through her investigation [of the nature] of the Father, as
          they relate, and what took place outside of the Pleroma, and from what
          sort of a defect they teach that the Maker of the world was produced,
          I have set forth in the preceding book, describing in it, with all
          diligence, the opinions of these heretics. [I have also detailed their
          views] respecting Christ, whom they describe as having been produced
          subsequently to all these, and also regarding Soter, who, [according
          to them,] derived his being from those Æons who were formed within the
          Pleroma. But I have of necessity mentioned their names at present,
          that from these the absurdity of their falsehood may be made manifest,
          and also the confused nature of the nomenclature they have devised.
          For they themselves detract from [the dignity of] their Æons by a
          multitude of names of this sort. They give out names plausible and
          credible to the heathen, [as being similar] to those who are called
          their twelve gods, and even these they will have to be images of their
          twelve Æons. But the images [so called] can produce names [of their
          own] much more seemly, and more powerful through their etymology to
          indicate divinity [than are those of their fancied prototypes].
