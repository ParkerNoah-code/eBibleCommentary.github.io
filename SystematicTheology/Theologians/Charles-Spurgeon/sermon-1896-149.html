        <p>
          113. I have hated crooked thoughts. Those who are of opinion that the
          word sphvm seaphim, the first in the verse, and which is rendered
          crooked thoughts, is an appellate noun, translate it, those who think
          evil; but it is more correct to understand it of the thoughts
          themselves, and this interpretation is very generally adopted. The
          noun sph, saeph, properly signifies a branch, but it is applied
          metaphorically to the thoughts, which, growing out of the heart, as
          branches from the trunk of a tree, spread themselves in every
          direction. As there is no doubt that in this passage the term is taken
          in a bad sense, I have added the epithet, crooked, which the etymology
          of the word requires. As the branches of a tree shoot out
          transversely, entangled and intertwined, so the thoughts of the human
          mind are, in like manner, confusedly mingled together, turning and
          twisting about in all directions. Some Jewish interpreters understand
          it of the laws of the heathen, which, they say, were cut off from the
          law of God, as branches from a tree; but although this is ingenious,
          it has no solidity. I therefore keep by the more simple explanation,
          That the crooked inventions of the human heart, and whatever the
          wicked devise, according to their own perverse understandings, are set
          in opposition to the law of God, which alone is right. And, assuredly,
          whoever would truly embrace the law of God, must, necessarily, as his
          first business, divest himself of all unhallowed and sinful thoughts,
          or rather go out of his own nature. Such is the meaning, unless,
          perhaps, preferring another metaphor, we understand sphvm, seaphim, to
          signify high thoughts, since the verb sph, saaph, is taken for to lift
          up. Now we know that no sacrifice is more acceptable to God than
          obedience, when we entertain low thoughts of ourselves; and thus our
          docility begins with humility. But as this exposition may seem also
          far-fetched, I pass from it. Let what I have: said suffice us, That
          since God acknowledges as the disciples of his law those only who are
          well purified from all contrary imaginations, which corrupt our
          understanding, the prophet here protests that he is an enemy to all
          crooked thoughts, which are wont to draw men hither and thither.
        </p>
        <p>
          114. Thou art my hiding place and my shield. The meaning is, that the
          prophet, persuaded that the only way in which he could be safe, was by
          lying hid under the wings of God, confided in his promises, and,
          therefore, feared nothing. And, assuredly, the first point is, that
          the faithful should hold it as a settled principle, that amidst the
          many dangers to which they are exposed, the preservation of their life
          is entirely owing to the protection of God; in order that they may be
          excited to flee to him, and leaning upon his word, may confidently
          wait for the deliverance which he has promised. This confidence, That
          God is our refuge and our shield, is, no doubt, derived from the word;
          but we must remember that there is here a mutual relation -- that,
          when we have learned from the word of God that we have in him a safe
          hiding-place, this truth is to be cherished and confirmed in our
          hearts, under a consciousness of our absolute need of the divine
          protection. Besides, although his power ought abundantly to suffice in
          inspiring us with the hope of salvation, yet we should always set the
          word before us, that our faith may not fail when his aid is slow in
          coming.
        </p>
        <p>
          115. Depart from me, ye wicked! Some explain this verse as if David
          declared that he would devote himself with more alacrity and greater
          earnestness to the keeping of the law, when the wicked should have
          desisted from assaulting him. And, unquestionably, when we feel that
          God has delivered us, we are more than stupid if this experience does
          not stir up within us an earnest desire to serve him. If godliness
          does not increase in us in proportion to the sense and experience we
          have of God's grace, we betray base ingratitude. This, then, is a true
          and useful doctrine; but the prophet meant to convey a different
          sentiment in this place. As he saw how great a hindrance the ungodly
          are to us, he banishes them to a distance from him; or rather, he
          testifies that he will beware of entangling himself in their society.
          Nor has he said this so much for his own sake as to teach us by his
          example, that if we would hold on in the way of the Lord without
          stumbling, we must endeavor, above all things, to keep at the greatest
          possible distance from worldly and wicked men, not in regard to
          distance of place, but in respect of intercourse and conversation.
          Provided we contract an intimate acquaintance with them, it is
          scarcely possible for us to avoid being speedily corrupted by the
          contagion of their example. The dangerous influence of fellowship with
          wicked men is but too evident from observation; and to this it is
          owing, that few continue in their integrity to the close of life, the
          world being fraught with corruption's. From the extreme infirmity of
          our nature, it is the easiest thing in the world to catch infection,
          and to contract pollution even from the slightest touch. The prophet,
          then, with good reason, bids the wicked depart from him, that he may
          advance in the fear of God without obstruction. Whoever entangles
          himself in their companionship will, in process of time, proceed the
          length of abandoning himself to a contempt, of God, and of leading a
          dissolute life. With this statement agrees the admonition of Paul, in
          2 Corinthians 6:14, "Be ye not unequally yoked together with
          unbelievers." It was, indeed, beyond the prophet's power to chase the
          wicked to a distance from him; but by these words he intimates, that
          from henceforth he will have no intercourse with them. He emphatically
          designates God as his God, to testify that he makes more account of
          him alone than of all mankind. Finding extreme wickedness universally
          prevailing on the earth, he separated himself from men, that he might
          join himself wholly to God. At the present day, that bad examples may
          not carry us away to evil, it greatly concerns us to put God on our
          side, and to abide constantly in him, because he is ours.
        </p>
        <p>
          116. Sustain me by thy word, and I shall live. Many read, According to
          thy word, so that the letter v, beth, which signifies in, is taken for
          the letter k, caph, which signifies as; and thus the sense would be,
          Sustain me according to the promise which thou hast made to me, or, as
          thou hast promised to me. And, undoubtedly, whenever God stretches out
          his hand to us to raise us up when we are fallen, or supports us with
          his hand, he fulfills his promises. The prophet, however, seems to
          pray, that constancy of faith may be given him, to enable him to
          continue steadfast in the divine word. We are said to fall from God's
          word when we fall from the faith of it; and in like manner, so long as
          we repose upon the truth and certainty of it, he is our sustainer.
          But, as the prophet well knew that there is not strength in man
          adequate to this, he asks from God ability to persevere as the
          singular gift of the Holy Spirit. It follows, then, that true
          stability is to be found no where else but in the word of God; and
          that no man can steadfastly lean upon it but he who is strengthened by
          the power of the Holy Spirit. We must therefore always beseech God,
          who alone is the author and finisher of faith, to maintain in us this
          grace. Farther, when the Psalmist places life in faith, he teaches,
          that all that men promise themselves without the word is mere
          falsehood. It is therefore the Lord alone who quickens us by his word,
          even as it is said in Habakkuk, (Habakkuk 2:4,) "The just shall live
          by faith." Both passages have the same meaning. After Habakkuk has
          derided the foolish confidence of the flesh, with which men are
          generally inflated, and as manifested in their raising themselves on
          high that they may fall with the greater violence, he shows, that the
          faithful alone, whom the word of God sustains, stand upon safe and
          sure ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the first interpretation is adopted, the second clause, make me not
          ashamed of my expectation, will be added by way of exposition; for
          these two things -- the prayer that the prophet maybe preserved by
          God's grace according to his word, and the prayer that he may reap the
          fruit of his hope -- would amount to nearly the same thing. Yet, after
          having beseeched God to grant him constancy to persevere, he seems now
          to proceed farther, praying that God would, in very deed, show the
          thing which he had promised. Every man's own infirmity bears witness
          to the many doubts which intrude into our minds, when, after long
          endurance, the issue is not answerable to our expectation; for God, in
          that case:. seems to disappoint us.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the same effect is the next verse, except that no express mention
          is made of the word; and safety is put for life. The prophet means to
          say, that whenever God withdrew his word, it would be all over with
          his safety; but that, if he were established by the Divine power,
          there was nothing of which he would have reason to be afraid. The verb
          sh shaah, which we have translated I will consider, is rendered by
          many, I will delight, and this sense is not unsuitable; for although
          God may give a very desirable taste of his goodness in his bare word,
          yet the savor of it is not a little increased when to the word the
          effect is added, provided we do not perversely separate God's benefits
          from his promises. It is the true wisdom of faith to consider all his
          benefits as the result or fruit of his promises, of which, if we make
          no account, the enjoyment of all his good things will be of little
          advantage to us, or rather will often prove hurtful and deadly. Yet it
          appears to me preferable to render the verb by consider; for the more
          experience any man has of God's help, the more ought he to awaken
          himself to consider heavenly doctrine. The Psalmist adds, that he will
          continue to persevere in this meditation during the whole of his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          118. Thou hast trodden under foot all those who wander from thy
          statutes. By treading under foot he means, that God overthrows all the
          despisers of his law, and casts them down from that loftiness which
          they assume to themselves. The phrase is directed against the foolish,
          or rather frantic, confidence with which the wicked are inflated, when
          they recklessly deride the judgments of God; and, what is more,
          scruple not to magnify themselves against him, as if they were not
          subject to his power. The last clause is to be particularly noticed:
          for their deceit is falsehood By these words the prophet teaches, that
          the wicked gain nothing by their wiles, but that they are rather
          entangled in them, or at length discover that they were mere sleight
          of hand. Those ignorantly mar the sense who interpose the copula and,
          as if it had been said, that deceit and falsehood were in them The
          word rmvh, remyah, signifies a subtle and crafty device. Interpreters,
          indeed, often translate it thought; but this term does not
          sufficiently express the propriety and force of the Hebrew word. The
          prophet means, that, however well pleased the wicked are with their
          own cunning, they yet do nothing else than deceive themselves with
          falsehood. And it was needful to add this clause; for we see how the
          great bulk of mankind are fatally intoxicated with their own vain
          imaginations, and how difficult it is to believe what is here
          asserted, -- that the more shrewd they are in their own estimation,
          the more do they deceive themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          119. Thou hast made all the wicked of the earth to cease as dross. The
          meaning of this verse is similar to that of the preceding. By the
          similitude employed, there is described a sudden and an unexpected
          change, when their imaginative glory and happiness become dissipated
          in smoke. It is to be observed, that the vengeance of God against the
          wicked is not all at once manifested, so that they completely perish,
          or are exterminated from the earth; but as God, in rooting them out
          one after another, shows himself to be the judge of the world, and
          that he is purging the earth of them, it is not wonderful to find the
          prophet speaking of their destruction in this manner; for the Hebrew
          verbs often denote a continued act. As God, then, executes his
          judgments by little and little, and often suspends punishment until he
          see that the wicked abuse his long-suffering; it becomes us, on our
          part, to continue patiently waiting until, as a heathen writer
          observes, he compensate the delay of the punishment, by its severity
          when inflicted. It is abundantly evident, that the particle of
          similitude, as, is to be supplied before the word dross Nor do I
          reject the opinion of those who assert, that the wicked are compared
          to dross, because, so long as they are mingled among the faithful as
          dregs, they infect and contaminate them; but when they are removed as
          scum, the purity of the godly shines forth with improved lustre. In
          the second place, the prophet adds, that the judgments of God were not
          without fruit in him, since they led him to love the doctrine of the
          law the more. Those who are not induced to commit themselves to the
          protection of God, whenever, by lifting up his hand, he shows that the
          world is governed by his power, must certainly be very perverse; but
          when, of his own good pleasure, he offers himself to us by his word,
          those who do not make haste to embrace so great a boon are stupid
          indeed. On the other hand, when he connives for a long time at the
          wickedness of men, devout affection, which should ravish us with the
          love of God's word, languishes.
        </p>
        <p>
          120. My flesh hath trembled for fear of thee. At first sight the
          prophet seems to contradict himself. He had just now said, that, by
          God's severity, he was gently drawn to love his testimonies; now he
          declares, that he was seized with terror. But although these two
          effects differ widely from each other, yet, if we consider by what
          kind of discipline God forms us to reverence his law, we will perceive
          that they entirely harmonize. We require to be subdued by fear that we
          may desire and seek after the favor of God. Since fear, then, is the
          beginning of love, the prophet testifies, that he was awakened by a
          heart-felt fear of God to look well to himself. Nor is the
          mortification of the flesh so easy a matter, as that every one should
          consent to enter upon it, without the constraint of violent means;
          and, therefore, it is not wonderful if God struck his servant with
          terror, that, in this way, he might bend his mind to a holy fear of
          him. It is an evidence of no common wisdom to tremble before God when
          he executes his judgments, of which the majority of mankind take no
          notice. We are then taught by these words of the prophet, that we
          ought to consider attentively the judgments of God, that they may not
          only gently instruct us, but that they may also strike us with such
          terror as will lead us to true repentance.<br />
