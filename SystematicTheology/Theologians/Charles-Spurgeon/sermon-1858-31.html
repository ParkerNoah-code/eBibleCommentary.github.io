        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.195)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, May 23, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens</p>
        <p>
          "They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not
          ashamed." -- Psalm 34:5.
        </p>
        <p>
          FROM THE CONNECTION we are to understand the pronoun "him" as
          referring to the word "Lord" in the preceding verse. "They looked unto
          the Lord Jehovah, and were lightened." But no man ever yet looked to
          Jehovah God, as he is in himself, and found any comfort in him, for
          "our God is a consuming fire." An absolute God, apart from the Lord
          Jesus Christ, can afford no comfort whatever to a troubled heart. We
          may look to him, and we shall be blinded, for the light of Godhead is
          insufferable, and as mortal eye cannot fix its gaze upon the sun, no
          human intellect could ever look unto God, and find light, for the
          brightness of God would strike the eye of the mind with eternal
          blindness. The only way in which are can see God is through the
          Mediator Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>"Till God in human flesh I see,</p>
        <p>My thoughts no comfort find, -- "</p>
        <p>
          God shrouded and veiled in the manhood, -- there we can with steady
          gaze behold him, for so he cometh down to us, and our poor finite
          intelligence can understand and lay hold upon him. I shall therefore
          use my text this morning, and I think very legitimately, in reference
          to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ -- "They looked unto him, and
          were lightened;" for when we look at God, as revealed in Jesus Christ
          our Lord, and behold the Godhead as it is apparent in the Incarnate
          Man, who was born of the Virgin Mary, and was crucified by Pontius
          Pilate, we do see that which enlightens the mind, and casts rays of
          comfort into our awakened heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now this morning, I shall first invite you, in order to illustrate
          my text, to look to Jesus Christ in his life on earth, and I hope
          there are some of you who will be lightened by that. We shall then
          look to him on his cross. Afterwards we shall look to him in his
          resurrection. We shall look to him in his intercession; and lastly, we
          shall look to him in his second coming; and it may be, as with
          faithful eye we look upon him, the verse shall be fulfilled in our
          experience, which is the best proof of a truth, when we prove it to be
          true in our own hearts, We shall "look unto him" and we shall "be
          lightened."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, we shall LOOK TO THE LORD JESUS CHRIST IN HIS LIFE.
          And here the troubled saint will find the most to enlighten him. In
          the example, in the patience, in the sufferings of Jesus Christ, there
          are stars of glory to cheer the midnight darkness of the sky of your
          tribulation. Come hither, ye children of God and whatever now are your
          distresses, whether they be temporal or spiritual, you shall, in the
          life of Jesus Christ and his sufferings, find sufficient to cheer and
          comfort you, if the Holy Spirit shall now open your eyes to look unto
          him. Perhaps I have among my congregation, indeed I am sure I have,
          some who are plunged in the depths of poverty. You are the children of
          toil; with much sweat of your brow you eat your bread; the heavy yoke
          of oppression galls your neck; perhaps at this time you are suffering
          the very extremity of hunger; you are pinched with famine, and though
          in the house of God, your body complains, for you feel that you are
          brought very low. Look unto Him, thou poor distressed brother in
          Jesus; look unto Him, and be lightened.
        </p>
        <p>"Why dost thou complain of want or distress,</p>
        <p>Temptation or pain? -- he told thee no less;</p>
        <p>The heirs of salvation, we know from his word,</p>
        <p>Through much tribulation must follow their Lord."</p>
        <p>
          See him there! Forty days he fasts and he hungers. See him again, he
          treads the weary way, and at last all athirst he sits upon the curb of
          the well of Sychar and he the Lord of glory, he who holds the clouds
          in the hollow of his hand, said to a woman, "Give me to drink." And
          shall the servant be above his master, and the disciple above his
          Lord? If he suffered hunger, and thirst, and nakedness, O heir of
          poverty, be of good cheer; in all these thou hast fellowship with
          Jesus; therefore be comforted, and look unto him and be lightened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps your trouble is of another caste. You have come here to-day
          smarting from the forked tongue of that adder -- slander. Your
          character, though pure and spotless before God, seems to be lost
          before man; for that foul slanderous thing hath sought to take away
          that which is dearer to you than life itself, your character, your
          good fame; and you are this day filled with bitterness and made
          drunken with wormwood, because you have been accused of crimes which
          your soul loathes. Come, thou child of mourning, this indeed is a
          heavy blow; poverty is like Solomon's whip, but slander is like the
          scorpion of Rehoboam, to fall into the depths of poverty is to have it
          on thy little finger, but to be slandered is to have it on thy loins.
          But in all this thou mayest have comfort from Christ. Come and look
          unto him and be lightened. The King of kings was called a Samaritan;
          they said of him that he had a devil and was mad; and yet infinite
          wisdom dwelt in him, though he was charged with madness. And was he
          not ever pure and holy? And did they not call him a drunken man and a
          wine-bibber? He was his father's glorious Son and yet they said he did
          cast out devils through Beelzebub the prince of the devils. Come! poor
          slandered one; wipe that tear away! "If they have called the Master of
          the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call they of his
          household?" If they had honored him, then might you have expected that
          they would honor you, but inasmuch as they mocked him and took away
          his glory and his character blush not to bear the reproach and the
          shame, for he is with you, carrying his cross before you, and that
          cross was heavier than yours. Look, then, unto him and be lightened.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I hear another say, "Ah! but my trouble is worse than either of
          those. I am not to-day smarting from slander, nor am I burdened with
          penury; but, sir, the hand of God lies heavy upon me, he hath brought
          my sins to my remembrance; he hath taken away the bright shining of
          his countenance; once I did believe in him, and could read my title
          clear to mansions in the skies,' but to-day I am brought very low; he
          hath lifted me up and cast me down; like a wrestler, he has elevated
          me that he might dash me to the ground with the greater force, my
          bones are sore vexed, and my spirit within me is melted with anguish."
          Come, my tried brother, "look unto him and be lightened." No longer
          groan over thine own miseries, but come thou with me and look unto
          him, if thou canst. Seest thou the garden of Olives? It is a cold
          night, and the ground is crisp beneath thy feet for the frost is hard;
          and there in the gloom of the olive garden, kneels thy Lord. Listen to
          him. Canst thou understand the music of his groans, the meaning of his
          sighs? Sure, thy griefs are not so heavy as his were, when drops of
          blood were forced through his skin, and a bloody sweat did stain the
          ground! Say, are thy wrestlings greater than his? If; then, he had to
          combat with the powers of darkness, expect to do so also; and look
          thou to him in the last solemn hour of his extremity, and hear him
          say, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" And when thou hast
          heard that, murmur not, as though some strange thing had happened to
          thee as if thou hast to join in his "lama subbacthani," and hast to
          sweat some few drops of his bloody sweat. "They looked unto him, and
          were lightened."
        </p>
        <p>
          But, possibly I may have here some one who is much persecuted by man.
          "Ah!" saith one, "I cannot practice my religion with comfort. My
          friends have turned against me; I am mocked, and jeered, and reviled,
          for Christ's sake." Come, Christian, be not afraid of all this, but,
          "look unto him, and be lightened." Remember how they persecuted him.
          Oh! think thou of the shame and spitting, the plucking off the hair,
          the reviling of the soldiers; think thou of that fearful march through
          the streets, when every man did hoot him, and when even they that were
          crucified with him did revile him. Hast thou been worse treated than
          he? Methinks this is enough to make you gird your armor on once more.
          Why need you blush to be as much dishonored as your Master? It was
          this thought that cheered the martyrs of old. They that fought the
          bloody fight, knew they should win the blood-red crown -- that ruby
          crown of martyrdom; therefore they did endure, as seeing him who is
          invisible; for this ever cheered and comforted them. They remembered
          him who had "endured such contradiction of sinners against himself,
          that they might not be weary or faint in their minds." They "resisted
          unto blood, striving against sin;" for they knew their Master had done
          the same, and his example did comfort them. I am persuaded beloved
          brothers and sisters, that if we looked more to Christ, our troubles
          would not become anything like so black. In the darkest night, looking
          to Christ will clear the ebony sky; when the darkness seems thick,
          like that of Egypt, darkness that might be felt, like solid pillars of
          ebony, even then, like a bright lightning flash, as bright but not as
          transient, will a look to Jesus prove. One glimpse at him, may well
          suffice for all our toils, while on the road. Cheered by his voice,
          nerved by his strength, we are prepared to do and suffer, even as he
          did, to the death, if he will be with us, even unto the end. This,
          then, is our first point. We trust that those of you, who are weary
          Christians, will not forget to "look unto him, and be lightened."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now I have to invite you to a more dreary sight; but, strange
          it is just as the sight becomes more black, so to us, does it grow
          more bright. The more deeply the Saviour dived into the depths of
          misery, the brighter were the pearls which he brought up -- the
          greater his griefs, the greater our joys, and the deeper his dishonor,
          the brighter our glories. Come, then -- and this time I shall ask
          poor, doubting, trembling sinners and saints, to come with me, -- come
          ye now to Calvary's cross. There, on the summit of that little hill,
          outside the gates of Jerusalem, where common criminals were ordinarily
          put to death -- the Tyburn of Jerusalem, the Old Bailey of that city,
          where criminals were executed -- there stand three crosses; the center
          one is reserved for one who is reputed to be the greatest of
          criminals. See there! They have nailed him to the cross. It is the
          Lord of life and glory, before whose feet angels delight to pour full
          vials of glory They have nailed him to the cross: he hangs there in
          mid-heaven, dying, bleeding; he is thirsty, and he cries. They bring
          him vinegar and thrust it into his mouth. He is in suffering, and he
          needs sympathy, but they mock at him, and they say, "He saved others;
          himself he cannot save." They misquote his words, they challenge him
          now to destroy the temple, and build it in three days; while the very
          thing was being fulfilled, they taunt him with his powerlessness to
          accomplish it. How see him, ere the veil is drawn over agonies too
          black for eye to behold. See him now! Was ever face marred like that
          face? Was ever heart so big with agony? And did eyes ever seem so
          pregnant with the fire of suffering, as those great wells of fiery
          agony? Come and behold him, come and look to him now. The sun is
          eclipsed, refusing to behold him! earth quakes; the dead rise; the
          horrors of his sufferings have startled earth itself,
        </p>
        <p>"He dies! the friend of sinners dies;"</p>
        <p>
          And we invite you to look to this scene that you may be lightened.
          What are your doubts this morning? Whatever they be, they can find a
          kind and fond solution here, by looking at Christ on the cross. You
          have come here, perhaps, doubting God's mercy; look to Christ upon the
          cross, and can you doubt it then? If God were not full of mercy, and
          plenteous in his compassion, would he have given his Son to bleed and
          die? Think you, that a Father would rend his darling from his heart
          and nail him to a tree, that he might suffer an ignominious death for
          our sakes, and yet be hard, merciless, and without pity? God forbid
          the impious thought! There must be mercy in the heart of God, or else
          there had never been a cross on Calvary.
        </p>
        <p>
          But do you doubt God's power to save! Are you saying in yourself this
          morning, "How can he forgive so great a sinner as I am?" Oh! look
          there, sinner, look there, to the great atonement made, to the utmost
          ransom paid. Dost thou think that that blood has not an efficacy to
          pardon and to justify. True, without that cross it had been an
          unanswerable question, -- "How can God be just, and yet the justifier
          of the ungodly?" But see there the bleeding substitute! and know that
          God has accepted his sufferings as an equivalent for the woes of all
          believers; and then thy spirit dare to think, if it can, that there is
          not sufficient in the blood of Christ, to enable God to vindicate his
          justice, and yet to have mercy upon sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I know you say, "My doubt is not of his general mercy, nor of his
          power to forgive, but of his willingness to forgive me." Now I beseech
          you, by him that liveth and was dead, do not this morning look into
          your own heart in order to find an answer to that difficulty; do not
          now sit down and look at your sins; they have brought you into the
          danger -- they cannot bring you out of it. The best answer you will
          ever get, is at the foot of the cross. Sit down, when you get home
          this morning, for half-an-hour, in quiet contemplation, sit at the
          foot of the cross, and contemplate the dying Saviour, and I will defy
          you then to say, "I doubt his love to me." Looking at Christ begets
          faith. You cannot believe on Christ except as you see him, and if you
          look to him you will learn that he is able to save; you will learn his
          loving-kindness; and you cannot doubt him after having once beheld
          him. Dr. Watts says,
        </p>
        <p>"His worth, if all the nations knew,</p>
        <p>Sure the whole world would love him too;"</p>
        <p>and I am sure it is quite true if I read it another way --</p>
        <p>"His worth, if all the nations knew</p>
        <p>Sure the whole world would trust him too."</p>
        <p>
          Oh, that you would look to him now, and your doubts would soon be
          removed; for there is nothing that so speedily kills all doubt and
          fear, as a look into the loving eye of the bleeding, dying Lord. "Ah,"
          says one, "but my doubts are concerning my own salvation in this
          respect; I cannot be so holy as I want to be." "I have tried very
          much," says one, "to get rid of all my sins, and I cannot; I have
          labored to live without wicked thoughts, and without unholy acts, and
          I still find that my heart is deceitful above all things;' and I
          wander from God. Surely I cannot be saved, while I am like this?"
          Stay! Look to him, and be lightened. What business have you to be
          looking to yourself? The first business of a sinner is not with
          himself, but with Christ. Your business is to come to Christ, sick,
          weary, and soul-diseased, and ask Christ to cure you. You are not to
          be your own physician, and then go to Christ, but just as you are; the
          only salvation for you is to trust implicitly, simply, nakedly, on
          Christ. As I sometimes put it -- make Christ the only pillar of your
          hope, and never seek to buttress or prop him up. "He is able, he is
          willing." All he asks of you is just to trust him. As for your good
          works, they shall come afterwards. They are after-fruits of the
          Spirit: but your first business is not to do, but to believe. Look to
          Jesus, and put your only trust in him. "Oh," another cries, "Sir, I am
          afraid I do not feel my need of a Saviour as I ought." Looking to
          yourselves again! all looking to yourselves you see! This is all
          wrong. Our doubts and fears all arise from this cause -- we will turn
          our eyes the wrong way just look to the cross again, just as the poor
          thief did when he was dying; he said, "Lord, remember me when thou
          comest into thy kingdom." Do the same. You may tell him if you please,
          that you do not feel your need of him as you ought; you may put this
          among your other sins, that you fear you have not a right sense of
          your great and enormous guilt. You may add to all your confessions,
          this cry "Lord help me to confess my sins better; help me to feel them
          more penitently." But recollect, it is not your repentance that saves
          you; it is just the blood of Christ, streaming from his hands, and
          feet, and side. Oh! I beseech you by him whose servant I am, this
          morning turn your eyes to the cross of Christ. There he hangs this
          day; he is lifted up in your midst. As Moses lifted up the serpent in
          the wilderness, even so is the Son of Man lifted up to-day in your
          eyes, that whosoever believeth in him may not perish, but have
          everlasting life.
        </p>
        <p>
          And you children of God, I turn to you, for you have your doubts too.
          Would you get rid of them? Would you rejoice in the Lord with faith
          unmoved and confidence unshaken? Then look to Jesus; look again to him
          and you shall be lightened. I know not how it is with you my beloved
          friends, but I very often find myself in a doubting frame of mind; and
          it seems to be a question whether I have any love to Christ or not.
          And despite the fact that some laugh at the hymn, It is a hymn that I
          am forced to sing: --
        </p>
        <p>"Tis a point I long to know,</p>
        <p>Oft it causes anxious thought!</p>
        <p>Do I love the Lord or not</p>
        <p>Am I his, or am I not?"</p>
        <p>
          And really I am convinced that every Christian has his doubts at
          times, and that the people who do not doubt are just the people that
          ought to doubt; for he who never doubts about his state perhaps may do
          so when it is too late. I knew a man who said he never had a doubt for
          thirty years. I told him that I knew a person who never had a doubt
          about him for thirty years. "How is that?" said he "that is strange."
          He thought it a compliment. I said, "I knew a man who never had a
          doubt about you for thirty years. He knew you were always the most
          confounded hypocrite he ever met; he had no doubt about you." But this
          man had no doubt about himself: he was a chosen child of God, a great
          favourite of the Most High; he loved the doctrine of Election, wrote
          it on his very brow; and yet he was the hardest driver and the most
          cruel oppressor to the poor I ever met with, and when brought to
          poverty himself, he might very frequently be seen rolling through the
          streets. And this man had not a doubt for thirty years; and yet the
          best people are always doubting. Some of those who are just living
          outside the gates of heaven, are afraid of being cast into hell after
          all; while those people who are on the high road to the pit are not
          the least afraid. However, if you would get rid of your doubts once
          more, turn to Christ. You know what Dr. Carey had put on his
          tomb-stone -- just these words, for they were his comfort; --
        </p>
        <p>"A guilty, weak, and helpless worm,</p>
        <p>Into Christ's arms I fall;</p>
        <p>He is my strength and righteousness,</p>
        <p>My Jesus and my all."</p>
        <p>
          Remember what that eminent Scotch divine said, when he was dying. Some
          one said to him, "What, are you dying now?" Said he, "I am just
          gathering all my good works up together, and I am throwing them all
          overboard; and I am lashing myself to the plank of free grace, and I
          hope to swim to glory on it." So do you do; every day keep your eye
          only on Christ; and so long as your eye is single, your whole body
          must and shall be full of light. But if you once look cross-eyed,
          first to yourself and then to Christ, your whole body shall be full of
          darkness. Remember, then, Christian, to hie away to the cross. When
          that great black dog of hell is after you, away to the cross! Go where
          the sheep goes when he is molested by the dog; go to the shepherd. The
          dog is afraid of the shepherd's crook; you need not be afraid of it,
          it is one of the things that shall comfort you. "Thy rod and thy staff
          they comfort me." Away to the cross, my brothers! away to the cross,
          if thou wouldest get rid of thy doubts. Certain I am, that if we lived
          more with Jesus, were more like Jesus, and trusted more to Jesus,
          doubts and fears would be very scarce and rare things, and we should
          have as little to complain of them as the first emigrants in Australia
          had to complain of thistles; for they found none there, and none would
          have been there if they had not been carried there. If we live simply
          by faith on the cross of Christ, we live in a land where there are no
          thistles, but if we will live on self, we shall have plenty of
          thistles and thorns, and briers, and nettles growing there. "They
          looked unto him, and were lightened."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now I invite you to a glorious scene -- CHRIST'S
          RESURRECTION. Come you here, and look at him, as the old serpent
          bruises his heel!
        </p>
        <p>"He dies! the friend of sinners dies,</p>
        <p>And Salem's daughters weep around."</p>
        <p>
          He was wrapped in his grave-clothes and put into his grave, and there
          he slept three days and nights. And on the first day of the week, he,
          who could not be holden by the bands of death, and whose flesh did not
          see corruption, neither did his soul abide in Hades -- he arose from
          the dead. In vain the bands that swaddled him; he unfolded them by
          himself, and by his ownliving power wrapped them in perfect order, and
          laid them in their place. In vain the stone and the seal; the angel
          appeared and rolled away the stone, and forth the Saviour came. In
          vain the guards and watchmen; for in terror they fled far away, and he
          rose the conqueror over death -- the firstfruits of them that slept.
          By his own power and might, he came again to life. I see among my
          congregation, not a few wearing the black weeds of sorrow. You have
          lost, some of you, the dearest of your earthly relatives There are
          others here, who, I doubt not, are under the constant fear of death.
          You are all your lifetime subject to bondage, because you are thinking
          upon the groans, and dying strife, which fall upon men, when they near
          the river Jordan. Come, come, I beseech you, ye weeping and timid
          spirits, behold Jesus Christ risen! For remember, this is a great
          truth -- "Now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the
          first-fruits of them that slept." And the verse of our song just
          embodies it: --
        </p>
        <p>"What though our inbred sins require</p>
        <p>Our flesh to see the dust,</p>
        <p>Yet as the Lord our Saviour rose,</p>
        <p>So all his followers must."</p>
        <p>
          There widow; weep no longer for your husband, if he died in Jesus. See
          the Master; he is risen from the dead; no spectre is he. In the
          presence of his disciples he eats a piece of broiled fish and part of
          an honeycomb. No spirit is he; for he saith, "Handle me and see; a
          spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have." That was a real
          resurrection. And learn then, beloved, when you weep, to restrain your
          sorrows; for thy loved ones shall live again. Not only shall their
          spirits live, but their bodies too.
        </p>
        <p>"Corruption, earth, and worms,</p>
        <p>Do but refine this flesh;</p>
        <p>At the archangel's sounding trump,</p>
        <p>We put it on afresh."</p>
        <p>
          Oh! think not that the worm has eaten up your children, your friends,
          your husband, your father, your aged parents -- true, the worms seem
          to have devoured them. Oh! what is the worm after all, but the filter
          through which our poor filthy flesh must go? For in the twinkling of
          an eye, at the last trump, we shall be raised incorruptible, and the
          living shall be changed, you shall see the eye that just now has been
          closed, and you shall look on it again, you shall again grasp the hand
          that just now fell motionless at the side. You shall kiss the lips
          that just now were clay-cold, and white, and you shall hear again the
          voice that is silent in the tomb. They shall live again. And you that
          fear death -- why fear to die? Jesus died before you, and he passed
          through the iron gates, and as he passed through them before you, he
          will come and meet you. Jesus who lives can
        </p>
        <p>"Make the dying bed</p>
        <p>Feel soft as downy pillows are."</p>
        <p>
          Why should you weep? for Jesus rose from the dead; so shall you. Be of
          good cheer and confidence. You are not lost when you are put into the
          tomb; you are but seed sown to ripen against the eternal harvest. Your
          spirit mounts to God; your body slumbers for awhile to be quickened
          into eternal life. It cannot be quickened except it die; but when it
          dies it shall receive a new life; it shall not be destroyed. "they
          looked to him, and were lightened." Oh! this is a precious thing to
          look to -- a risen Saviour. I know of nothing that can lift our
          spirits higher than a true view of the resurrection of Jesus Christ
          from the dead. We have not lost any friends then; they have gone
          before. We shall not die ourselves; we shall seem to die, but are
          shall begin to live; for it is written
        </p>
        <p>"He lives to die; he dies to live;</p>
        <p>He lives to die no more."</p>
        <p>May that be the lot of each one of us!</p>
        <p>
          IV. And with the greatest possible brevity, I invite you to LOOK AT
          JESUS CHRIST ASCENDING INTO HEAVEN. After forty days, he takes his
          disciples to the hill, and while he discourses with them, on a sudden
          he mounts upward; and he is separated from them, and a cloud receives
          him into glory. Perhaps I may be allowed a little poetical license if
          I try to picture that which occurred after he ascended into the
          clouds. The angels came from heaven --
        </p>
        <p>"They brought his chariot from on high,</p>
        <p>To bear him to his throne</p>
        <p>Clapped their triumphant wings and cried,</p>
        <p>The glorious work is done."</p>
        <p>
          I doubt not, that with matchless triumph he ascended the hill of light
          and went to the celestial city, and when he neared the portals of that
          great metropolis of the universe, the angels shouted, "Lift up your
          heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors," and the
          bright spirits from burning battlements, cried out, "Who is this King
          of Glory -- who?" And the answer came, "the Lord mighty in battle, and
          the Lord of Hosts; he is the King of Glory." And then both they upon
          the walls, and they who walk with the chariot join the song once more,
          and with one mighty sea of music, beating its melodious waves against
          the gates of heaven and forcing them open, the strain is heard, "Lift
          up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors,
          that the King of Glory may come in" -- and in he went. And at his feet
          the angelic hosts all cast their crowns, and forth came the
          blood-washed and met him, not casting roses at his feet, as are do at
          the feet of conquerors in our streets, but casting immortal flowers,
          imperishable wreaths of honor that never can decay; while again,
          again, again, the heavens did ring with this melody, "Unto him that
          hath loved us, and washed us from our sins in his blood, and hath made
          us kings and priests unto God and his Father -- unto him be glory
          forever and ever. And all the saints and all the angels said, "Amen."
          Now look here ye Christians, here is your comfort; Jesus Christ won
          wrestling with spiritual enemies, not with flesh and blood, but with
          principalities and powers; you are at war today, and mayhap the enemy
          has thrust sore at you, and you have been ready to fall; it is a
          marvel to you, that you have not turned your back in the day of
          battle, for you have often feared lest you should be made to fly like
          a coward from the field. But tremble not, your Master was more than
          conqueror, and so shall you be. The day is coming when with splendor
          less than his, but yet the same in its measure, you too shall pass the
          gates of bliss; when you are dying, angels shall meet you in the
          mid-stream, and when your blood is cooling with the cold current, then
          shall your heart be warming with another stream, a stream of light and
          heat from the great fountain of all joy, and you shall stand on the
          other side of Jordan, and angels shall meet you clothed in their
          immaculate garments, they shall attend you up the hill of light, and
          they shall chant the praise of Jesus, and hail you as another trophy
          of his power. And when you enter the gates of heaven, you shall be met
          with Christ your Master, who will say to you -- "Well done, good and
          faithful servant, enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord." Then will you
          feel that you are sharing in his victory, as once you shared in his
          struggles and his war. Fight on, Christian, your glorious Captain has
          won a great victory, and has secured for you in one and the same
          victory, a standard that never yet was stained with defeat, though
          often dipped in the blood of the slain.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. And now once more "Look unto him, and be lightened." See there he
          sits is, heaven, he has led captivity captive, and now sits at the
          right hand of God, for ever making intercession for us. Can your faith
          picture him to-day? Like a great high priest of old, he stands with
          outstretched arms: there is majesty in his mien, for he is no mean
          cringing suppliant. He does not beat his breast, nor cast his eyes
          upon the ground, but with authority he pleads enthroned in glory now.
          There on his head is the bright shining mitre of his priesthood, and
          look you, on his breast are glittering the precious stones whereon the
          names of his elect are everlastingly engraved; hear him as he pleads,
          hear you not what it is? -- is that your prayer that he is mentioning
          before the throne? The prayer that this morning you offered ere you
          came to the house of God, Christ is now offering before his Father's
          throne. The vow which just now you uttered when you said, "Have pity
          and have mercy," -- he is now uttering there. He is the Altar and the
          Priest, and with his own sacrifice he perfumes our prayers. And yet,
          mayhap, you have been at prayer many a day, and had no answer; poor
          weeping suppliant, thou hast sought the Lord and he hath not heard
          thee, or at least not answered thee to thy soul's delight; thou hast
          cried unto him, but the heavens have been as brass, and he hath shut
          out thy prayer, thou art full of darkness and heaviness on account of
          this," Look to him, and be lightened." If thou dost not succeed, he
          will; if thy intercession be unnoticed, his cannot be passed away; if
          thy prayers can be like water spilt on a rock which cannot be gathered
          up, yet his prayers are not like that, he is God's Son, he pleads and
          must prevail; God cannot refuse his own Son what he now asks, he who
          once bought mercies with his blood. Oh! be of good cheer, continue
          still thy supplication. "Look unto him, and be lightened."
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. In the last place, there are some of you here, weary with this
          world's din and clamor, and with this world's iniquity and vice. You
          have been striving all your life long, to put an end to the reign of
          sin, and it seems as if your efforts have been fruitless; the pillars
          of hell stand as fast as ever and the black palace of evil is not laid
          in ruins; you have brought against it all the battering-rams of
          prayer, and the might of God, you have thought, -- and yet the world
          still sins, its rivers still roll with blood, its plains are still
          defiled with the lascivious dance, and its ear is still polluted with
          the filthy song and profane oath. God is not honored; man is still
          vile; and perhaps you are saying, "It is vain for us to fight on, we
          have undertaken a task which cannot be accomplished. the kingdoms of
          this world never can become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his
          Christ." But, Christian, "Look unto him, and be lightened." Lo! he
          cometh, he cometh, he cometh quickly; and what we cannot do in six
          thousand years, he can do in an instant. Lo! he comes, he comes to
          reign; we may try to build his throne, but we shall not accomplish it.
          But when he comes, he shall build his throne himself, on solid pillars
          of light and sit and judge in Jerusalem, amidst his saints,
          gloriously. Perhaps to-day, the hour we are assembled, Christ may come
          -- "For of that day and hour knoweth no man; no, not the angels in
          heaven." Christ Jesus may, while I yet speak, appear in the clouds of
          glory. We have no reason to be guessing at the time of his appearing,
          he will come as a thief in the night; and whether it shall be at
          cock-crowing, or broadday, or at midnight, we are not allowed to
          guess; it is left entirely in the dark, and vain are the prophecies of
          men, vain your "Apocalyptic Sketches," or ought of that. No man
          knoweth anything of it, except that it is certain he will come; but
          when he comes, no spirit in heaven or on earth should pretend to know.
          Oh! it is my joyous hope, that he may come whilst yet I live. Perhaps
          there may be some of us here who shall be alive, and remain at the
          coming of the Son of Man. Oh, glorious hope! we shall have to sleep,
          but we shall all be changed. He may come now, and we that are alive
          and remain shall be caught up together with the Lord in the air, and
          so shall be for ever with him. But if you die, Christian, this is your
          hope. "I will come again, and receive you to myself, that where I am,
          there ye may be also." And this is to be your duty, "Watch, therefore,
          for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh." Oh, will
          I not work on, for Christ is at the door! Oh! I will not give up
          toiling never so hard, for my Master cometh, and his reward is with
          him, and his work before him, giving unto every man according as his
          work shall be. Oh, I will not lie down in despair, for the trump is
          sounding now. Methinks I hear the trampling of the conquering legion,
          the last of God's mighty heroes are even now, perhaps, born into the
          world. The hour of this revival is the hour of the turning of the
          battle; thick has been the fight. and hot and furious the struggle,
          but the trump of the Conqueror is beginning to sound, the angel is
          lifting it now to his lips. The first blast has been heard across the
          sea, and we shall hear it yet again; or if we hear it not in these our
          days, yet still it is our hope. He comes, he comes, and every eye
          shall see him, and they that have crucified him shall weep and wail
          before him, but the righteous shall rejoice, and shall magnify him
          exceedingly. "They looked unto him, and were lightened."
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember I concluded preaching at Exeter Hall with these three
          words, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!" and I think I will conclude my sermon of
          this morning with the same words, but not till I have spoken to one
          poor forlorn soul who is standing over there, wondering whether there
          is mercy for him. He says, "It is well enough, sir, to say, Look to
          Jesus,' but suppose you cannot look? If your eye is blind -- what
          then?" Oh I my poor brother, turn your restless eyeballs to the cross,
          and that light which gives light to them that see, shall give eyesight
          to them that are blind. Oh! if thou canst not believe this morning,
          look and consider, and weigh the matter, and in weighing and
          reflecting thou shalt be helped to believe. He asks nothing of thee;
          he bids thee now believe that he died for thee. If to-day thou feelest
          thyself a lost, guilty sinner, all he asks is that thou wouldest
          believe on him; that is to say, trust him, confide in him. Is it not
          little he asks? And yet it is more than any of us are prepared to
          give, except the Spirit hath made us willing. Come, cast yourselves
          upon him; fall flat on his promise; sink or swim, confide in him, and
          you cannot guess the joy that you shall feel in that one instant that
          you believe on him. Were there not some of you impressed last Sabbath
          day, and you have been anxious all the week? Oh! I hope I have brought
          a good message to you this morning for your comfort. "Look unto me and
          be ye saved, all the ends of the earth," saith Christ, "for I am God,
          and beside me there is none else." Look ye now, and looking ye shall
          live. May every blessing rest upon you, and may each go away to think
          of that one person whom we love, even Jesus -- Jesus -- Jesus!<br />
