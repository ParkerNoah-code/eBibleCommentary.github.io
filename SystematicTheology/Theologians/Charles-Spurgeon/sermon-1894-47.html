        <p>A Dramatic Morceau of Micah</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>THE LORD</p>
        <p>
          Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy
          voice. Hear, O ye mountains, the LORD'S controversy, and ye enduring
          foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his
          people, and he will plead with Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied
          thee? testify against me. For I brought thee up out of the land of
          Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage; and I sent
          before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. O my people, remember now what
          Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered
          him; remember from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteous
          acts of the LORD.
        </p>
        <p>THE PEOPLE</p>
        <p>
          Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high
          God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a
          year old? Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten
          thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my
          transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
        </p>
        <p>THE MOUNTAINS</p>
        <p>
          He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD
          require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk
          humbly with thy God?
