        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>No.98</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, November 2, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          NOTE: This sermon was Spurgeon's first message following the disaster
          at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens -- in which seven people lost
          their lives when some miscreants purposely started a panic while Mr.
          Spurgeon was preaching.

          |Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name
          which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should
          bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the
          earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
          to the glory of God the Father.| -- Philippians 2:9-11.
        </p>
        <p>
          I ALMOST regret this morning that I have ventured to occupy this
          pulpit, because I feel utterly unable to preach to you for your
          profit. I had thought that the quiet and repose of the last fortnight
          had removed the effects of that terrible catastrophe; but on coming
          back to the same spot again, and more especially, standing here to
          address you, I feel somewhat of those same painful emotions which
          well-nigh prostrated me before. You will therefore excuse me this
          morning, if I make no allusion to that solemn event, or scarcely any.
          I could not preach to you upon a subject that should be in the least
          allied to it. I should be obliged to be silent if I should bring to my
          remembrance that terrific scene in the midst of which it was my solemn
          lot to stand. God shall overrule it doubtless. It may not have been so
          much by the malice of men, as some have asserted; it was perhaps
          simple wickedness -- an intention to disturb a congregation; but
          certainly with no thought of committing so terrible a crime as that of
          the murder of those unhappy creatures. God forgive those who were the
          instigators of that horrid act! They have my forgiveness from the
          depths of my soul. It shall not stop us, however; we are not in the
          least degree daunted by it. I shall preach there again yet; ay, and
          God shall give us souls there, and Satan's empire shall tremble more
          than ever. |God is with us; who is he that shall be against us?| The
          text I have selected is one that has comforted me, and in a great
          measure, enabled me to come here to-day -- the single reflection upon
          it had such a power of comfort on my depressed spirit. It is this: --
          |Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name
          which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should
          bow, of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the
          earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
          to the glory of God the Father.| -- Philippians 2:9-11.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall not attempt to preach upon this text; I shall only make a few
          remarks that have occurred to my own mind; for I could not preach
          to-day; I have been utterly unable to study, but I thought that even a
          few words might be acceptable to you this morning, and I trust to your
          loving hearts to excuse them. Oh, Spirit of God, magnify thy strength
          in thy servant's weakness, and enable him to honour his Lord, even
          when his soul is cast down within him.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHEN the mind is intensely set upon one object, however much it may by
          divers calamities be tossed to and fro, it invariably returns to the
          place which it had chosen to be its dwelling place. Ye have noticed in
          the case of David. When the battle had been won by his warriors, they
          returned flushed with victory. David's mind had doubtless suffered
          much perturbation in the mean time; he had dreaded alike the effects
          of victory and defeat; but have you not noticed how his mind in one
          moment returned to the darling object of his affections? |Is the young
          man Absalom safe?| said he, as if it mattered not what else had
          occurred, it his beloved son were but secure! So, beloved, it is with
          the Christian. In the midst of calamities, whether they be the wreck
          of nations, the crash of empires, the heaving of revolutions, or the
          scourge of war, the great question which he asks himself, and asks of
          others too, is this -- Is Christ's kingdom safe? In his own personal
          afflictions his chief anxiety is, -- Will God be glorified, and will
          his honour be increased by it? If it be so, says he, although I be but
          as smoking flax, yet if the sun is not dimmed I will rejoice; and
          though I be a bruised reed, if the pillars of the temple are unbroken,
          what matters it that my reed is bruised? He finds it sufficient
          consolation, in the midst of all the breaking in pieces which he
          endures, to think that Christ's throne stands fast and firm, and that
          though the earth hath rocked beneath his feet, yet Christ standeth on
          a rock which never can be moved. Some of these feelings, I think, have
          crossed our minds. Amidst much tumult and divers rushings to and fro
          of troublous thoughts our souls have returned to the darling object of
          our desires, and we have found it no small consolation after all to
          say, |It matters not what shall become of us: God hath highly exalted
          him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name
          of Jesus every knee should bow.|
        </p>
        <p>
          This text has afforded sweet consolation to every heir of heaven.
          Allow me, very briefly, to give you the consolations of it. To the
          true Christian there is much comfort in the very fact of Christ's
          exaltation. In the second place, there is no small degree of
          consolation in the reason of it. |Wherefore, also, God hath highly
          exalted him;| that is because of his previous humiliation. And
          thirdly, there is no small amount of really divine solace in the
          thought of the person who has exalted Christ. Wherefore God also| --
          although men despise him and cast him down -- |God also hath highly
          exalted him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, IN THE VERY FACT OF CHRIST'S EXALTATION THERE IS TO
          EVERY TRUE CHRISTIAN A VERY LARGE DEGREE OF COMFORT. Many of you who
          have no part nor lot in spiritual things, not having love to Christ,
          nor any desire for his glory, will but laugh when I say that this is a
          very bottle of cordial to the lip of the weary Christian, that Christ,
          after all, is glorified. To you it is no consolation, because you lack
          that condition of heart which makes this text sweet to the soul. To
          you there is nothing of joy in it; it does not stir your bosom; it
          gives no sweetness to your life; for this very reason, that you are
          not joined to Christ's cause, nor do you devoutly seek to honour him.
          But the true Christian's heart leapeth for joy, even when cast down by
          divers sorrows and temptations, at the remembrance that Christ is
          exalted, for in that he finds enough to cheer his own heart. Note
          here, beloved, that the Christian has certain features in his
          character which make the exaltation of Christ a matter of great joy to
          him. First, he has in his own opinion, and not in his own opinion
          only, but in reality, a relationship to Christ, and therefore he feels
          an interest in the success of his kinsman. Ye have watched the
          father's joy, when step by step his boy has climbed to opulence or
          fame; ye have marked the mother's eye, as it sparkled with delight
          when her daughter grew up to womanhood, and burst forth in all the
          grandeur of beauty. Ye have asked why they should feel such interest;
          and ye have been told, because the boy was his, or the girl was hers.
          They delighted in the advancement of their little ones, because of
          their relationship. Had there been no relationship, they might have
          been advanced to kings, emperors, or queens, and they would have felt
          but little delight. But from the fact of kindred, each step was
          invested with a deep and stirring interest. Now, it is so with this
          Christian. He feels that Jesus Christ, the glorified |Prince of the
          kings of the earth.| is his brother. While he reverences him as God,
          he admires him as the man-Christ, bone of his bone, and flesh of his
          flesh, and he delights, in his calm and placid moments of communion
          with Jesus, to say to him, |O Lord, thou art my brother.| His song is,
          |My beloved is mine, and I am his.| It is his joy to sing --
        </p>
        <p>|In the blood with sinners one,|</p>
        <p>
          Christ Jesus is; for he is a man, even as we are: and he is no less
          and no more man than we are, save only sin. Surely, when we feel we
          are related to Christ, his exaltation is the source of the greatest
          joy to our spirits; we take a delight in it, seeing it is one of our
          family that is exalted. It is the Elder Brother of the great one
          family of God in heaven and earth; it is the Brother to whom all of us
          are related.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also in the Christian not only the feeling of relationship
          merely, but there is a feeling of unity in the cause. He feels that
          when Christ is exalted, it is himself exalted in some degree, seeing
          he has sympathy with his desire of promoting the great cause and
          honour of God in the world. I have no doubt that every common soldier
          who stood by the side of the Duke of Wellington felt honoured when the
          commander was applauded for the victory; for, said he, |I helped him,
          I assisted him; it was but a mean part that I played; I did but
          maintain my rank; I did but sustain the enemy's fire; but now the
          victory is gained. I feel an honour in it, for I helped, in some
          degree, to gain it.| So the Christian, when he sees his Lord exalted,
          says, |It is the Captain that is exalted, and in his exaltation all
          his soldiers share. Have I not stood by his side? Little was the work
          I did, and poor the strength which I possessed to serve him; but still
          I aided in the labour;| and the commonest soldier in the spiritual
          ranks feels that he himself is in some degree exalted when he reads
          this -- |Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a
          name which is above every name:| a renown above every name -- |that at
          the name of Jesus every knee should bow.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the Christian knows not only that there is this unity in
          design, but that there is a real union between Christ and all his
          people. It is a doctrine of revelation seldom descanted upon, but
          never too much thought of -- the doctrine that Christ and his members
          are all one. Know ye not, beloved, that every member of Christ's
          church is a member of Christ himself? We are |of his flesh and of his
          bones,| parts of his great mystical body; and when we read that our
          head is crowned, O rejoice, ye members of his, his feet or his hands,
          though the crown is not on you, yet being on your Head, you share the
          glory, for you are one with him. See Christ yonder, sitting at his
          Father's right hand! Believer! he is the pledge of thy glorification;
          he is the surety of thine acceptance; and, moreover, he is thy
          representative. The seat which Christ possesses in heaven he has not
          only by his own right, as a person of the Deity, but he has it also as
          the representative of the whole church, for he is their forerunner,
          and he sits in glory as the representative of every one of them. O
          rejoice, believer, when thou seest thy Master exalted from the tomb,
          when thou beholdest him exalted up to heaven. Then, when thou seest
          him climb the steps of light, and sit upon his lofty throne, where
          angels' ken can scarcely reach him -- when thou hearest the
          acclamations of a thousand seraphs -- when thou dost note the loud
          pealing choral symphony of millions of the redeemed; think, when thou
          seest him crowned with light -- think that thou art exalted too in
          him, seeing that thou art a part of himself. Happy art thou if thou
          knowest this, not only in doctrine, but in sweet experience too. Knit
          to Christ, wedded to him, grown into him, parts and portions of his
          very self, we throb with the heart of the body; when the head itself
          is glorified we share in the praise; we felt that his glorification
          bestows an honour upon us. Ah! beloved, have you ever felt that unity
          to Christ? Have you ever felt a unity of desire with him? If so, you
          will find this rich with comfort; but if not -- if you know not Christ
          -- it will be a source of grief rather than a pleasure to you that he
          is exalted, for you will have to reflect that he is exalted to crush
          you, exalted to judge you and condemn you, exalted to sweep this earth
          of its sins, and cut the curse up by the roots, and you with it,
          unless you repent and turn unto God with full purpose of heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is yet another feeling, which I think is extremely necessary to
          any very great enjoyment of this truth, that Christ is exalted. It is
          a feeling of entire surrender of one's whole being to the great work
          of seeking to honour him. Oh! I have striven for that: would to God I
          might attain unto it! I have now concentrated all my prayers into one,
          and that one prayer is this, that I may die to self, and live wholly
          to him. It seems to me to be the highest stage of man -- to have no
          wish, no thought, no desire but Christ -- to feel that to die were
          bliss, if it were for Christ -- that to live in penury and woe, and
          scorn, and contempt, and misery, were sweet for Christ -- to feel that
          it did not matter what became of one's self, so that one's Master was
          but exalted -- to feel that though, like a sear leaf, you are blown in
          the blast, you are quite careless whither you are going, so long as
          you feel that the Master's hand is guiding you according to his will.
          Or rather to feel that though like the diamond you must be cut, that
          you care not how sharply you may be cut, so that you may be made fit
          to be a brilliant in his crown; that you care little what may be done
          to you, if you may but honour him. If any of you have attained to that
          sweet feeling of self-annihilation, you will look up to Christ as if
          he were the sun, and you will say of yourself, |O Lord, I see thy
          beams; I feel myself to be not a beam from thee -- but darkness,
          swallowed up in thy light. The most I ask is, that thou wouldst live
          in me, that the life I live in the flesh may not be my life, but thy
          life in me, that I may say with emphasis, as Paul did, For me to live
          is Christ.'| A man that has attained to this, never need care what is
          the opinion of this world. He may say, |Do you praise me? Do you
          flatter me? Take back your flatteries: I ask them not at your hands; I
          sought to praise my Master; ye have laid the praises at my door; go,
          lay them at his, and not at mine. Do ye scorn me? Do ye despise me?
          Thrice happy am I to bear it. If ye will not scorn and despise him!|
          And if ye will, yet know this, that he is beyond your scorn; and,
          therefore, smite the soldier for his Captain's sake; ay, strike,
          strike; but the King ye cannot touch -- he is highly exalted -- and
          thou ye think ye have gotten the victory, ye may have routed one
          soldier of the army, but the main body is triumphant. One soldier
          seems to be smitten to the dust, but the Captain is coming on with his
          victorious cohorts, and shall trample you, flushed with your false
          victory, beneath his conquering feet. As long as there is a particle
          of selfishness remaining in us, it will mar our sweet rejoicing in
          Christ; till we get rid of it, we shall never feel constant joy. I do
          think that the root of sorrow is self. If we once got rid of that,
          sorrow would be sweet, sickness would be health, sadness would be joy,
          penury would be wealth, so far as our feelings with regard to them are
          concerned. They might not be changed, but our feelings under them
          would be vastly different. If you would seek happiness, seek it at the
          roots of your selfishness; cut up your selfishness, and you will be
          happy. I have found that whenever I have yielded to the least joy when
          I have been prepared to feel acutely the arrows of the enemy; but when
          I have said of the praises of men, |Yes, what are ye? worthless
          things!| -- then I could also say of their contempt -- |Come on! come
          on! I'll send you all where I sent the praises; you may go together,
          and fight your battles with one another; but as for me, let your
          arrows rattle on my mail -- they must not, and they shall not, reach
          my flesh.| But if you give way to one you will to another. You must
          seek and learn to live wholly in Christ -- to sorrow when you see
          Christ maligned and dishonoured, to rejoice when you see him exalted,
          and then you will have constant cause for joy. Sit down now, O reviled
          one, poor, despised, and tempted one; sit down, lift up thine eyes,
          see him on his throne, and say within thyself, |Little though I be, I
          know I am united to him; he is my love, my life, my joy; I care not
          what happens so long as it is written, The Lord reigneth.'|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, briefly upon the second point. Here also is the very fountain
          and well-spring of joy, in THE REASON OF CHRIST'S EXALTATION.
          |Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him.| Why? Because, |he being
          in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But
          made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a
          servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in
          fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and because obedient unto death,
          even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted
          him.| This of course relates to the manhood of our Lord Jesus Christ.
          As God, Christ needed no exaltation; he was higher than the highest,
          |God over all, blessed for ever.| But the symbols of his glory having
          been for a while obscured, having wrapped his Godhead in mortal flesh,
          his flesh with his Godhead ascended up on high, and the man-God,
          Christ Jesus, who had stooped to shame, and sorrow, and degradation,
          was highly exalted, |far above all principalities and powers,| that he
          might reign Prince-regent over all worlds, yea, over heaven itself.
          Let us consider, for a moment, that depth of degradation to which
          Christ descended; and then, my beloved, it will give you joy to think,
          that for that very reason his manhood was highly exalted. Do you see
          that man --
        </p>
        <p>|The humble Man before his foes,</p>
        <p>The weary Man and full of woes?|</p>
        <p>
          Do you mark him as he speaks? Note the marvellous eloquence which
          pours from his lips, and see how the crowds attend him? But do you
          hear, in the distance, the growling of the thunders of calumny and
          scorn? Listen to the words of his accusers. They say he is |a
          gluttonous man and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners;|
          |he has a devil, and is mad.| All the whole vocabulary of abuse is
          exhausted by vituperation upon him. He is slandered, abused,
          persecuted! Stop! Do you think that he is by this cast down, by this
          degraded? No, for this very reason: |God hath highly exalted him.|
          Mark the shame and spitting that have come upon the cheek of yonder
          man of sorrows! See his hair plucked with cruel hands; mark ye how
          they torture him and how they mock him. Do you think that this is all
          dishonourable to Christ? It is apparently so; but list to this: |He
          became obedient,| and therefore |God hath highly exalted him.| Ah!
          there is a marvellous connection between that shame, and spitting, and
          the bending of the knee of seraphs; there is a strange yet mystic link
          which unites the calumny and the slander with the choral sympathies of
          adoring angels. The one was, as it were, the seed of the other.
          Strange that it should be, but the black, the bitter seed brought
          forth a sweet and glorious flower which blooms for ever. He suffered
          and he reigned; he stopped to conquer, and he conquered for he
          stooped, and was exalted for he conquered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider him further still. Do you mark him in your imagination nailed
          to yonder cross! O eyes! ye are full of pity, with tears standing
          thick! Oh! how I mark the floods gushing down his checks! Do you see
          his hands bleeding, and his feet too, gushing gore? Behold him! The
          bulls of Bashan gird him round, and the dogs are hounding him to
          death! Hear him! |Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?| The earth startles
          with affright. A God is groaning on a cross! What! Does not this
          dishonour Christ? No; it honours him! Each of the thorns becomes a
          brilliant in his diadem of glory; the nails are forged into his
          sceptre, and his wounds do clothe him with the purple of empire. The
          treading of the wine-press hath stained his garments, but not with
          stains of scorn and dishonour. The stains are embroideries upon his
          royal robes for ever. The treading of that wine-press hath made his
          garments purple with the empire of a world; and he is the Master of a
          universe for ever. O Christian! sit down and consider that thy Master
          did not mount from earth's mountains into heaven, but from her
          valleys. It was not from heights of bliss on earth that he strode to
          bliss eternal, but from depths of woe he mounted up to glory. Oh! what
          a stride was that, when, at one mighty step from the grave to the
          throne of The Highest, the man Christ, the God, did gloriously ascend.
          And yet reflect! He in some way, mysterious yet true, was exalted
          because he suffered. |Being found in fashion as a man, he humbled
          himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
          Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which
          is above every name.| Believer, there is comfort for thee here, if
          thou wilt take it. If Christ was exalted through his degradation, so
          shalt thou be. Count not thy steps to triumph by thy steps upward, but
          by those which are seemingly downward. The way to heaven is down-hill.
          he who would be honoured for ever must sink in his own esteem, and
          often in that of his fellow-men. Oh! think not of yon fool who is
          mounting to heaven by his own light opinions of himself and by the
          flatteries of his fellows, that he shall safely reach Paradise; nay,
          that shall burst on which he rests, and he shall fall and be broken in
          pieces. But he who descends into the mines of suffering, shall find
          unbounded riches there; and he who dives into the depths of grief,
          shall find the pearl of everlasting life within tis caverns.
          Recollect, Christian, that thou art exalted when thou art disgraced;
          read the slanders of thine enemies as the plaudits of the just; count
          that the scoff and jeer of wicked men are equal to the praise and
          honour of the godly; their blame is censure, and their censure praise.
          Reckon too, if thy body should ever be exposed to persecution, that it
          is no shame to thee, but the reverse; and if thou shouldst be
          privileged, (and thou mayest) to wear the blood-red crown of
          martyrdom, count it no disgrace to die. Remember, the most honourable
          in the church are |the noble army of martyrs.| Reckon that the greater
          the sufferings they endured, so much the greater is their |eternal
          weight of glory;| and so do thou, if thou standest in the brunt and
          thick of the fight, remember that thou shalt stand in the midst of
          glory. If thou hast the hardest to bear, thou shalt have the sweetest
          to enjoy. On with thee, then -- through floods, through fire, through
          death, through hell, if it should lie in thy path. Fear not. He who
          glorified Christ because he stooped shall glorify thee; for after he
          has caused thee to endure awhile, he will give thee |a crown of life
          which fadeth now away.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, in the last place, beloved, here is yet another comfort
          for you. THE PERSON who exalted Christ is to be noticed. |GOD also
          hath highly exalted him.| The emperor of all the Russians crowns
          himself: he is an autocrat, and puts the crown upon his own head: but
          Christ hath no such foolish pride. Christ did not crown himself. |GOD
          also hath highly exalted him.| The crown was put upon the head of
          Christ by God; and there is to me a very sweet reflection in this, --
          that the hand that put the crown on Christ's head, will one day put
          the crown on ours; -- that the same Mighty One who crowned Christ,
          |King of kings, and Lord of lords,| will crown us, when he shall make
          us |Kings and priests unto him for ever.| |I know,| said Paul, |there
          is laid up for me a crown of glory which fadeth not away, which God,
          the righteous judge, shall give me in that day.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, just pause over this thought -- that Christ did not crown
          himself, but that his Father crowned him; that he did not elevate
          himself to the throne of majesty, but that his Father lifted him
          there, and placed him on his throne. Why, reflect thus: Man never
          highly exalted Christ. Put this then in opposition to it -- |God also
          hath highly exalted him.| Man hissed him, mocked him, hooted him.
          Words were not hard enough -- they would use stones. |They took up
          stones again to stone him.| And stones failed; nails must be used, and
          he must be crucified. And then there comes the taunt, the jeer, the
          mockery, whilst he hangs languishing on the death-cross. Man did not
          exalt him. Set the black picture there. Now put this, with this
          glorious, this bright scene, side by side with it, and one shall be a
          foil to the other. Man dishonoured him; |God also exalted him.|
          Believer, if all men speak ill of thee, lift up thy head, and say,
          |Man exalted not my Master; I thank him that he exalts not me. The
          servant should not be above his master, nor the servant above his
          lord, nor he that is sent greater than he that sent him.|
        </p>
        <p>|If on my face for his dear name,</p>
        <p>Shame and reproach shall be;</p>
        <p>I'll hail reproach and welcome shame,</p>
        <p>For he'll remember me.|</p>
        <p>
          God will remember me, and highly exalt me after all, though man casts
          me down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Put it, again, in opposition to the fact, that Christ did not exalt
          himself. Poor Christian! you feel that you cannot exalt yourself.
          Sometimes you cannot raise your poor depressed spirits. Some say to
          you, |Oh! you should not feel like this.| They tell you, |Oh! you
          should not speak such words, nor think such thoughts.| Ah! |the heart
          knoweth its own bitterness, and a stranger intermeddleth not
          therewith,| -- ay, and I will improve upon it, |nor a friend either.|
          It is not easy to tell how another ought to feel and how another ought
          to act. Our minds are differently made, each in its own mould, which
          mould is broken afterwards, and there shall never be another like it.
          We are all different, each one of us; but I am sure there is one thing
          in which we are all brought to unite in times of deep sorrow, namely,
          in a sense of helplessness. We feel that we cannot exalt ourselves.
          Now remember, our Master felt just like it. In the 22nd Psalm, which,
          if I read it rightly, is a beautiful soliloquy of Christ upon the
          cross, he says to himself, |I am a worm, and no man.| As if he felt
          himself so broken, so cast down, that instead of being more than a
          man, as he was, he felt for awhile less than man. And yet, when he
          could not lift finger to crown himself, when he could scarce heave a
          thought of victory, when his eye could not flash with even a distant
          glimpse of triumph, -- then his God was crowning him. Art thou so
          broken in pieces, Christian? Think not that thou art cast away for
          ever; for |God also hath highly exalted him| who did not exalt
          himself; and this is a picture and prophecy of what he will do for
          thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, beloved, I can say little more upon this text, save that I
          bid you now for a minutes meditate and think upon it. Oh! let your
          eyes be lifted up; bid heaven's blue veil divide; ask power of God --
          I mean spiritual power from on high, to look within the veil. I bid
          you not look to the streets of gold, nor to the walls of jasper, nor
          to the pearly-gated city. I do not ask you to turn your eyes to the
          white-robed hosts, who for ever sing loud hallelujahs; but yonder, my
          friends, turn your eyes,
        </p>
        <p>|There, like a man, the Saviour sits;</p>
        <p>The God, how bright he shines;</p>
        <p>And scatters infinite delight</p>
        <p>On all the happy minds.|</p>
        <p>Do you see him?</p>
        <p>|The head that once was crowned with thorns,</p>
        <p>Is crowned with glory now;</p>
        <p>A royal diadem adorns</p>
        <p>That mighty Victor's brow.</p>
        <p>No more the bloody crown,</p>
        <p>The cross and nails no more:</p>
        <p>For hell itself shakes at his frown,</p>
        <p>And all the heavens adore.|</p>
        <p>
          Look at him! Can your imagination picture him? Behold his transcendent
          glory! The majesty of kings is swallowed up; the pomp of empires
          dissolves like the white mist of the morning before the sun; the
          brightness of assembled armies is eclipsed. He in himself is brighter
          than the sun, more terrible than armies with banners. See him! See
          him! O! hide your heads, ye monarchs; put away your gaudy pageantry,
          ye lords of this poor narrow earth! His kingdom knows no bounds;
          without a limit his vast empire stretches out itself. Above him all is
          his; beneath him many a step are angels, and they are his; and they
          cast their crowns before his feet. With them stand his elect and
          ransomed, and their crowns too are his. And here upon this lower earth
          stand his saints, and they are his, and they adore him; and under the
          earth, among the infernals, where devils growl their malice, even
          there is trembling and adoration; and where lost spirits, with wailing
          and gnashing of teeth for ever lament their being, even there, there
          is the acknowledgment of his Godhead, even though the confession helps
          to make the fire of their torments. In heaven, in earth, in hell, all
          knees bend before him, and every tongue confesses that he is God. If
          not now, yet in the time that is to come this shall be carried out,
          that ever creature of God's making shall acknowledge his Son to be
          |God over all, blessed for ever. Amen.| Oh! my soul anticipates that
          blessed day, when this whole earth shall bend its knee before its God
          willingly! I do believe there is a happy era coming, when there shall
          not be one knee unbent before my Lord and Master. I look for that
          time, that latter-day glory, when kings shall bring presents, when
          queens shall be the nursing mothers of the church, when the gold of
          Sheba and the ships of Tarshish, and the dromedaries of Arabia shall
          alike be his, when nations and tribes of every tongue shall
        </p>
        <p>|Dwell on his name with sweetest song,</p>
        <p>And infant voices shall proclaim</p>
        <p>Their early blessings on his name.|</p>
        <p>
          Sometimes I hope to live to see that all-auspicious era -- that
          halcyon age of this world, so much oppressed with grief and sorrow by
          the tyranny of its own habitants. I hope to see the time, when it
          shall be said, |Shout, for the great Shepherd reigns, and his
          unsuffering kingdom now is come| -- when earth shall be one great
          orchestra of praise, and every man shall sing the glorious hallelujah
          anthem of the King of kings. But even now, while waiting for that era,
          my soul rejoices in the fact, that every knee does virtually bow,
          though not willingly, yet really. Does the scoffer, when he mouths
          high heaven, think that he insults God? He thinks so, but his insult
          dies long ere it reaches half-way to the stars. Does he conceive, when
          in his malice he forges a sword against Christ, that his weapon shall
          prosper? If he does, I can well conceive the derision of God, when he
          sees the wildest rebel, the most abandoned despiser, still working out
          his great decrees, still doing that which God hath eternally ordained,
          and in the midst of his wild rebellion still running in the very track
          which in some mysterious way before all eternity had been marked as
          the track in which that being should certainly move. |The wild steeds
          of earth have broken their bridles, the reins are out of the hands of
          the charioteer| -- so some say; but they are not, or if they are, the
          steeds run the same round as they would have done had the Almighty
          grasped the reins still. The world has not gone to confusion; chance
          is not God; God is still Master, and let men do what they will, and
          hate the truth we now prize, they shall after all do what God wills,
          and their direst rebellion shall prove but a species of obedience,
          though they know it not.
        </p>
        <p>
          But thou wilt say, |Why dost thou yet find fault; for who hath
          resisted such a will as that?| |Nay, but O man, who art thou that
          repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed
          it, why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the
          clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another
          unto dishonour? What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make
          his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath
          fitted to destruction: and that he might make known the riches of his
          glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto
          glory.| Who is he that shall blame him? Woe unto him that striveth
          with his Maker! He is God -- know that, ye inhabitants of the land;
          and all things, after all, shall serve his will. I like what Luther
          says in his bold hymn, where, notwithstanding all that those who are
          haters of predestination choose to affirm, he knew and boldly
          declared, |He everywhere hath sway, and all things serve his might.|
          Notwithstanding all they do, there is God's sway, after all. Go on,
          reviler! God knoweth how to make all thy revilings into songs! Go on,
          thou warrior against God, if thou wilt; know this, thy sword shall
          help to magnify God, and carve out glory for Christ, when thou
          thoughtest the slaughter of his church. It shall come to pass that all
          thou dost shall be frustrated; for God maketh the diviners mad, and
          saith, |Where is the wisdom of the scribe? Where is the wisdom of the
          wise?| Surely, |Him hath God exalted, and given him a name which is
          above every name.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, lastly, beloved, if it be true, as it is, that Christ is so
          exalted that he is to have a name above every name, and every knee is
          to bow to him, will we not bow our knees this morning before his
          Majesty? You must, whether you will or no, one day bow your knee. O
          iron-sinewed sinner, bow thy knee now! Thou wilt have to bow it, man,
          in that day when the lightnings shall be loosed, and the thunders
          shall roll in wild fury: thou wilt have to bow thy knee then. Oh! bow
          it now! |Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way,
          when his wrath is kindled but a little.| O Lord of hosts! bend the
          knees of men! Make us all the willing subjects of thy grace, lest
          afterward, we should be the unwilling slaves of thy terror; dragged
          with chains of vengeance down to hell. O that now those that are on
          earth might willingly bend their knees lest in hell it should be
          fulfilled, |Things under the earth shall bow the knee before him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          God bless you, my friends, I can say no more but that. God bless you,
          for Jesus' sake! Amen.<br />
