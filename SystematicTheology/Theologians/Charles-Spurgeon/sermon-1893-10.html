          Therefore, when in these days a certain woman removed her marriage
          from the pale of the Church, and united herself to a Gentile, and when
          I remembered that this had in days gone by been done by others:
          wondering at either their own waywardness or else the double-dealing
          of their advisers, in that there is no scripture which holds forth a
          licence of this deed, -- "I wonder," said I, "whether they flatter
          themselves on the ground of that passage of the first (Epistle) to the
          Corinthians, where it is written: If any of the brethren has an
          unbelieving wife, and she consents to the matrimony, let him not
          dismiss her; similarly, let not a believing woman, married to an
          unbeliever, if she finds her husband agreeable (to their continued
          union), dismiss him: for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the
          believing wife, and the unbelieving wife by the believing husband;
          else were your children unclean." It may be that, by understanding
          generally this monition regarding married believers, they think that
          licence is granted (thereby) to marry even unbelievers. God forbid
          that he who thus interprets (the passage) be wittingly ensnaring
          himself! But it is manifest that this scripture points to those
          believers who may have been found by the grace of God in (the state
          of) Gentile matrimony; according to the words themselves: "If," it
          says, "any believer has an unbelieving wife;" it does not say, "takes
          an unbelieving wife." It shows that it is the duty of one who, already
          living in marriage with an unbelieving woman, has presently been by
          the grace of God converted, to continue with his wife; for this
          reason, to be sure, in order that no one, after attaining to faith,
          should think that he must turn away from a woman who is now in some
          sense an "alien" and "stranger." Accordingly he subjoins withal a
          reason, that "we are called in peace unto the Lord God;" and that "the
          unbeliever may, through the use of matrimony, be gained by the
          believer." The very closing sentence of the period confirms (the
          supposition) that this is thus to be understood. "As each," it says,
          "is called by the Lord, so let him persevere." But it is Gentiles who
          "are called," I take it, not believers. But if he had been pronouncing
          absolutely, (in the words under discussion,) touching the marriage of
          believers merely, (then) had he (virtually) given to saints a
          permission to marry promiscuously. If, however, he had given such a
          permission, he would never have subjoined a declaration so diverse
          from and contrary to his own permission, saying: "The woman, when her
          husband is dead, is free: let her marry whom she wishes, only in the
          Lord." Here, at all events, there is no need for reconsidering; for
          what there might have been reconsideration about, the Spirit has
          oracularly declared. For fear we should make an ill use of what he
          says, "Let her marry whom she wishes," he has added, "only in the
          Lord," that is, in the name of the Lord, which is, undoubtedly, "to a
          Christian." That "Holy Spirit," therefore, who prefers that widows and
          unmarried women should persevere in their integrity, who exhorts us to
          a copy of himself, prescribes no other manner of repeating marriage
          except "in the Lord:" to this condition alone does he concede the
          foregoing of continence. "Only," he says, "in the Lord:" he has added
          to his law a weight -- "only." Utter that word with what tone and
          manner you may, it is weighty: it both bids and advises; both enjoins
          and exhorts; both asks and threatens. It is a concise, brief sentence;
          and by its own very brevity, eloquent. Thus is the divine voice wont
          (to speak), that you may instantly understand, instantly observe. For
          who but could understand that the apostle foresaw many dangers and
          wounds to faith in marriages of this kind, which he prohibits? and
          that he took precaution, in the first place, against the defilement of
          holy flesh in Gentile flesh? At this point some one says, "What, then,
          is the difference between him who is chosen by the Lord to Himself in
          (the state of) Gentile marriage, and him who was of old (that is,
          before marriage) a believer, that they should not be equally cautious
          for their flesh? -- whereas the one is kept from marriage with an
          unbeliever, the other bidden to continue in it. Why, if we are defiled
          by a Gentile, is not the one disjoined, just as the other is not
          bound?" I will answer, if the Spirit give (me ability); alleging,
          before all (other arguments), that the Lord holds it more pleasing
          that matrimony should not be contracted, than that it should at all be
          dissolved: in short, divorce He prohibits, except for the cause of
          fornication; but continence He commends. Let the one, therefore, have
          the necessity of continuing; the other, further, even the power of not
          marrying. Secondly, if, according to the Scripture, they who shall be
          "apprehended" by the faith in (the state of) Gentile marriage are not
          defiled (thereby) for this reason, that, together with themselves,
          others also are sanctified: without doubt, they who have been
          sanctified before marriage, if they commingle themselves with "strange
          flesh," cannot sanctify that (flesh) in (union with) which they were
          not "apprehended." The grace of God, moreover, sanctifies that which
          it finds. Thus, what has not been able to be sanctified is unclean;
          what is unclean has no part with the holy, unless to defile and slay
          it by its own (nature).<br />
