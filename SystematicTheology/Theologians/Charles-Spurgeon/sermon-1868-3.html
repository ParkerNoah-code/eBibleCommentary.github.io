        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.804)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, April 5th, 1868, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, .</p>
        <p>
          |Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted
          out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the
          Lord.| -- Acts 3:19.
        </p>
        <p>
          AFTER the notable miracle of healing the lame man, when the wondering
          people clustered round about Peter and John, they were not at all at a
          loss for a subject upon which to address them. Those holy men were
          brimful of the gospel, and therefore they had but to run over
          spontaneously, speaking of that topic which laid nearest to their
          hearts. To the Christian minister it should never be difficult to
          speak of Christ; and in whatever position he may be placed, he should
          never have to ask himself, |What is an appropriate subject for this
          people?| for the gospel is always in season, always appropriate, and
          if it be but spoken from the heart, it will be sure to work its way.
          Turning to the assembled multitude, Peter began at once to preach to
          them the gospel without a single second's hesitation. Oh! blessed
          readiness of a soul on fire with the Spirit, Lord, grant it to us
          evermore. Observe how earnestly Peter turns aside their attention from
          himself and his brother John to the Lord Jesus Christ. |Why look ye so
          earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made
          this man to walk?| The object of the Christian minister should always
          be to withdraw attention from himself to his subject, so that it
          should not be said, |How well he spake!| but, |Upon what weighty
          matters he treated!| They are priests of Baal, who, with their gaudy
          dresses, and their pretensions to a mysterious power, would have you
          look to themselves as the channels of grace, as though by their
          priestcraft, if not by their holiness, they could work miracles; but
          they are true messengers of God who continually say, |Look not on us
          as though we could do anything: the whole power to bless you lies in
          Jesus Christ, and in the gospel of his salvation.|
        </p>
        <p>
          It is noteworthy that Peter, in addressing this crowd, came at once to
          the very essence and bowels of his message. He did not beat the bush;
          he did not shoot his arrow far afield, but he hit the very centre of
          the target. He preached not merely the gospel of good news, but
          Christ, the person of Christ; Christ crucified -- crucified by them,
          Christ risen, Christ glorified of his Father. Depend upon it, this is
          the very strength of the Christian ministry, when it is saturated with
          the name and person and glory of the Lord Jesus Christ. Take Christ
          away, and you ungospelise the gospel, you do but pour out husks such
          as swine do eat, while the precious kernel is removed, seeing you have
          taken away the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. If there was ever an
          occasion when a preacher of the gospel might have forgotten to speak
          of Christ, it was surely the occasion on which Peter spake so boldly
          of him. For, might it not have been said, |Talk not of Jesus; they
          have just now haled him to the death: the people are mad against him;
          preach the truth, but do not mention his name; deliver his doctrine,
          but withhold the mention of his person, for you will excite them to
          madness; you will put your own life in jeopardy; you will scarcely do
          good while they are so prejudiced, and you may do much mischief|? But,
          instead of this, let them rage as they would, Peter would tell them
          about Jesus Christ, and about nothing else but Jesus Christ. He knew
          this to be the power of God unto salvation, and he would not flinch
          from it; so to them, even to them, he delivered the gospel of our Lord
          Jesus Christ, with a pungency as well as a simplicity scarcely to be
          rivalled. Notice how he puts it: |Ye| have slain him; |ye| have
          crucified him; |ye| have preferred a murderer. He is not afraid of
          being personal; he does not shirk the touching of men's consciences;
          he rather thrusts his hand into their hearts and make them feel their
          sin; he labours to open a window into the darkness of their spirits,
          to let the light of the Holy Ghost shine into their soul. Even thus,
          my brethren, when we preach the gospel, must we do: affectionately but
          graciously must we deal with men. Far hence be all trimming and
          mincing of matters. Accursed let him be that takes away from the
          gospel of Jesus Christ that he may win popular applause, or who bates
          his breath and smoothes his tongue that he may please the unholy
          throng. Such a man may have for a moment the approbation of fools,
          but, as the Lord his God liveth, he shall be set as a target for the
          arrows of vengeance in the day when the Lord cometh to judge the
          nations. Peter, then, boldly and earnestly preached the gospel --
          preached the Christ of the gospel -- preached it personally and
          directly at the crowd who were gathered around him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor did Peter fail, when he had enunciated the gospel, to make the
          personal application by prescribing its peculiar commands. Grown up
          among us is a school of men who say that they rightly preach the
          gospel to sinners when they merely deliver statements of what the
          gospel is, and of the result of dying unsaved, but they grow furious
          and talk of unsoundness if any venture to say to the sinner,
          |Believe,| or |Repent.| To this school Peter did not belong -- into
          their secret he had never come, and with their assembly, were he alive
          now, he would not be joined. For, having first told his hearers of
          Christ, of his life and death and resurrection, he then proceeds to
          plunge the sword, as it were, up to the very hilt in their consciences
          by saying, |Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may
          be blotted out.| There, I say, in that promiscuous crowd, gathered
          together by curiosity, attracted by the miracle which he had wrought,
          Peter felt no hesitation, and asked no question; he preached the same
          gospel as he would have preached to us today if he were here, and
          preached it in the most fervent and earnest style, preached the angles
          and the corners of it, and then preached the practical part of it,
          addressing himself with heart, and soul, and energy, to every one in
          that crowd, and saying, |Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that
          your sins may be blotted out.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now there are four remarks which will make up the discourse of this
          morning, when they are enlarged.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. And the first is this, that THE APOSTLE BADE MEN REPENT AND BE
          CONVERTED. Of this our text is proof enough without our going afield
          for other instances. Repent signifies, in its literal meaning, to
          change one's mind. It has been translated, |after-wit,| or
          |after-wisdom;| it is the man's finding out that he was wrong, and
          rectifying his judgment. But although that be the meaning of the root,
          the word has come in scriptural use to mean a great deal more. Perhaps
          there is no better definition of repentance than that which is given
          in our little children's hymnbook --
        </p>
        <p>|Repentance is to leave</p>
        <p>The sins we loved before,</p>
        <p>And show that we in earnest grieve,</p>
        <p>By doing so no more.|</p>
        <p>
          Repentance is a discovery of the evil of sin, a mourning that we have
          committed it, a resolution to forsake it. It is, in fact, a change of
          mind of a very deep and practical character, which makes the man love
          what once he hated, and hate what once he loved. Conversion, if
          translated, means a turning round, a turning from, and a turning to --
          a turning from sin, a turning to holiness -- a turning from
          carelessness to thought, from the world to heaven, from self to Jesus
          -- a complete turning. The word here used, though translated in the
          English, |Repent and be converted,| is not so in the Greek; it is
          really, |Repent and convert,| or, rather, |Repent and turn.| It is an
          active verb, just as the other was. |Repent and turn.| When the
          demoniac had the devils cast out of him -- I may compare that to
          repentance; but when he put on his garments, and was no longer naked
          and filthy, but was said to be clothed and in his right mind, I may
          compare that to conversion. When the prodigal was feeding his swine,
          and on a sudden began to consider and to come to himself, that was
          repentance. When he set out and left the far country, and went to his
          father's house, that was conversion. Repentance is a part of
          conversion. It is, perhaps, I may say, the gate or door of it. It is
          that Jordan through which we pass when we turn from the desert of sin
          to seek the Canaan of conversion. Regeneration is the implanting of a
          new nature, and one of the earliest signs of that is, a faith in
          Christ, and a repentance of sin, and a consequent conversion from that
          which is evil to that which is good.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle Peter, addressing the crowd, said to them, |Change your
          minds; be sorry for what you have done; forsake your old ways; be
          turned; become new men.| That was his message as I have now put it
          into other words.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, brethren, it has been said, and said most truly, that repentance
          and conversion are the work of the Holy Spirit of God. You do not need
          that I should stop to prove that doctrine. We have preached it to you
          a thousand times, and we are prepared to prove that if anything be
          taught in Scripture, that is. There never was any genuine repentance
          in this world which was not the work of the Holy Spirit. For this
          purpose our Lord Jesus has gone on high: |He is exalted on high to
          give repentance and remission of sins.| All true conversion is the
          work of the Holy Ghost. You may rightly pray in the words of the
          prophet, |Turn thou us, and we shall be turned;| for until God turn
          us, turn we never shall; and unless he convert us, our conversion is
          but a mistake. Hear it as a gospel summons --
        </p>
        <p>|True belief and true repentance,</p>
        <p>Every grace which brings us nigh;</p>
        <p>Without money</p>
        <p>Come to Jesus Christ and buy.|</p>
        <p>
          |And yet,| say you, |and yet the apostle Peter actually says to us,
          Repent, and be converted!' That is, you tell us with one breath that
          these things are the gift of the Holy Spirit, and then with the next
          breath you read the text, Repent, and be converted.'| Ay, I do, I do,
          and thank God I have learned to do so. But you will say, |How
          reconcile you these two things?| I answer, it is no part of my
          commission to reconcile my Master's words: my commission is to preach
          the truth as I find it -- to deliver it to you fresh from his hand. I
          not only believe these things to be agreeable to one another, but I
          think I see wherein they do agree, but I utterly despair of making the
          most of what is written in Scripture, and to accept it all, whether we
          can see the agreement of the two sets of truths or no -- to accept
          them both because they are both revealed. With that hand I hold as
          firmly as any man living, that repentance and conversion are the work
          of the Holy Spirit, but I would sooner lose this hand, and both, than
          I would give up preaching that it is the duty of men to repent and to
          believe, and the duty of Christian ministers to say to them, |Repent
          and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out.| If men will not
          receive truth till they understand it, there are many things which
          they never will receive. Ay, there are many facts, common facts in
          nature, which nobody would deny but a fool, which yet must be denied
          if we will not believe them till we understand them. There is a fish
          fresh taken from the sea: you take it to the cook to serve it on the
          table. You eat salt with it, do you? What for? You will have it dried
          and salted, but what for? Did not it always live in the salt sea? Why
          then is it not salt? It is as fresh as though it had lived in the
          purling brooks of the upland country -- not a particle of salt about
          it -- yet it has lived wholly in the salt sea! Do you understand that?
          No, you cannot. But there it is, a fresh fish in a salt sea! And
          yonder are an ox and a sheep, and they are eating in the same meadow,
          feeding precisely on the same food, and the grass in one case turns to
          beef, in the other case to mutton, and on one animal there is hair and
          on the other wool. How is that? Do you understand it? So there may be
          two great truths in Scripture, which are both truths, and yet all the
          wise men in the world might be confounded to bring those two truths
          together. I do not understand, I must confess, why Moses was told to
          cut down a tree and put it in the bitter waters of Marah; I cannot see
          any connection between a tree and the water, so that the tree should
          make it sweet, but yet I do believe that when Moses put the tree into
          the water the bitterness of Marah departed, and the stream was sweet.
          I do not know why it is that Elisha, when he went to Jericho, and
          found the water nauseous, said |Bring me a cruse of salt;| I do not
          know why his putting the salt into the stream should make it sweet --
          it looks to me as if it would operate the other way; but I believe the
          miracle, namely, that the salt was put in, and that it was sweetened.
          So I do not understand how it is that my bidding impenitent sinners to
          repent should in any way be likely to make them do so, but I know it
          does -- I see it every day. I do not know why a poor weak creature
          saying to his fellow men, |Believe,| should lead them to believe, but
          it does so, and the Holy Spirit blesses it, and they do believe and
          are saved; and if we cannot see how, if we see the fact, we will be
          content and bless God for it. Perhaps you may be aware that an attempt
          has been made by ingenious expositors to get rid of the force of this
          text. Some of our Hyper-Calvinist friends, who are so earnest against
          anything like exhortations and invitations, have tried by some means
          to disembowel this text if they could, to take something out and put
          something else in; they have said that the repentance to which men are
          here exhorted is but an outward repentance. But how is it so, when it
          is added, |Repent and be converted, that your sins may be blotted
          out|? Does a merely outward repentance bring with it the blotting out
          of sin? Assuredly not. The repentance to which men are here exhorted
          is a repentance which brings with it complete pardon -- |that your
          sins may be blotted out.| And, moreover, it seems to me to be a
          shocking thing to suppose that Peter and John went about preaching up
          a hollow, outward repentance, which would not save men. My brethren
          who make that remark would themselves be ashamed to preach up outward
          repentance. I am sure they would think they were not ministers of God
          at all if they preached up any merely outward virtue. It shows to what
          shifts they must be driven when they twist the Scriptures so horribly
          with so little reason. Brethren, it was a soul-saving repentance, and
          nothing less than that, which Peter commanded of these men. Now, let
          us come to the point. We tell men to repent and believe, not because
          we rely on any power in them to do so, for we know them to be dead in
          trespasses and sins; not because we depend upon any power in our
          earnestness or in our speech to make them do so, for we understand
          that our preaching is less than nothing apart from God; but because
          the gospel is the mysterious engine by which God converts the hearts
          of men, and we find that, if we speak in faith, God the Holy Ghost
          operates with us, and while we bid the dry bones live, the Spirit
          makes them live -- while we tell the lame man to stand on his feet,
          the mysterious energy makes his ankle-bones to receive strength --
          while we tell the impotent man to stretch out his hand, a divine power
          goes with the command, and the hand is stretched out and the man is
          restored. The power lies not in the sinner, not in the preacher, but
          in the Holy Spirit, which works effectually with the gospel by divine
          decree, so that where the truth is preached the elect of God are
          quickened by it, souls are saved, and God is glorified. Go on, my dear
          brethren, preaching the gospel boldly, and be not afraid of the
          result, for, however little may be your strength, and though your
          eloquence may be as nought, yet God has promised to make his gospel
          the power to save, and so it shall be down to the world's end.
        </p>
        <p>
          See then, ye that are unsaved, before I leave this point, see what it
          is we are bound to require of you this morning. It is, that ye repent
          and be converted. We are not satisfied with having your ear, nor your
          eyes; we are not content with having you gathered in the house of
          worship -- it is all in vain that you have come here, except you
          repent and be converted. We are not come to tell you that you must
          reform a little, and mend your ways in some degree: except you put
          your trust in Christ, forsake your old way of life, and become new
          creatures in Christ Jesus, you must perish. This -- nothing short of
          this -- is the gospel requirement. No church-going, no chapel-going,
          will save you; no bowing of the knee, no outward form of worship, no
          pretensions and professions to godliness- ye must repent of your sins
          and forsake them, and if ye do not this, neither shall your sins be
          blotted out. Thus much, then, on the first point: the apostle
          commanded men to repent and be converted.
        </p>
        <p>II. In the second place, THERE WAS GOOD REASON FOR THIS COMMAND.</p>
        <p>
          The text says, |Repent ye therefore.| The apostle was logical: he had
          a reason for his exhortation. It was not mere declamation, but sound
          reasoning. |Repent ye therefore.| What, then, was the argument? Why,
          first, because you, like the Jews, have put Jesus Christ to death.
          This was literally true of the people to whom he spake: they had had a
          share in Christ's execution. And this is spiritually true of you to
          whom I speak this morning. Every sin in the essence of it is a killing
          of God. Do you comprehend me? Every time you do what God would not
          have you do, you do in effect, so far as you can, put God out of his
          throne, and disown the authority which belongs to his Godhead; you do
          in intent, so far as you can, kill God. That is the drift of sin --
          sin is a God-killing thing. Every violation of law is treason in its
          essence -- it is rebellion against the lawgiver. When our Lord Jesus
          Christ was nailed to the tree by sinners, sin only did then literally
          and openly what all sin really does in a spiritual sense. Do you
          understand me? Those offendings of yours which you have thought so
          little of, have been really a stabbing at the Deity. Will you not
          repent, if it be so? While you thought your sins to be mere trifles,
          light things to be laughed at, you would not repent; but now I have
          shown you (and I think your conscience will bear me out) that every
          sin is really an attempt to thrust God out of the world, that every
          sin is saying, |Let there be no God.| Oh! then there is cause enough
          to repent of it. Come hither and reason with me, thou who hast broken
          God's law. Suppose the principle of thy disobedience were carried out
          to the full, would not all laws be disregarded, and moral government
          subverted? And why not, since what one may do another has clearly the
          same right to do? What, then, if the authority of God should be no
          more owned in the universe -- where should we all be? What a hell
          above ground would this world become! What a moral chaos and den of
          beasts! Do you not see what a mischievous thing, then, your iniquity
          has been? Repent and turn from it. If you can really believe this
          morning that though you did not nail Christ to the cross, nor plait
          the crown of thorns and put it on his head, nor stand and mock him
          there, yet that every sin is a real crucifixion of Christ, and a
          mockery of Christ, and a slaughter of Christ. Then, truly, there is
          abundant reason why you should repent and turn from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle also used another argument, namely, that he whom they had
          slain was a most blessed person -- one so blessed that God the Father
          had exalted him. Jesus Christ came not into this world with any
          selfish motive, but entirely out of philanthropy, full of love to men;
          and yet men put him to death! Now, every sin is an insult against the
          good and kind God. God does not deserve that we should rebel against
          him. If he were a great tyrant domineering over us, putting us to
          misery, there might be some excuse for our sin, but when he acts like
          a tender father to us, supplying our wants day by day, and forgiving
          our offenses, it is a shame, a cruel shame, that we should live in
          daily revolt against him. You who have not believed in Christ, have
          mighty cause for repenting that you have not believed in him, seeing
          he is so good and kind. What hurt has he ever done you that you should
          curse at him? What injury has Jesus done to any one of you that you
          should despise him? You deny his Deity, perhaps; or, at any rate, you
          despise the great salvation which he came into this world to work out.
          Does he deserve this of you? Prince of life and glory, King of angels,
          the adored of seraphs, art thou despised of men for whom thy blood was
          shed? Oh, what an accursed thing, then, sin must be, since it treats
          so badly so kind and blessed a person! This ought to make us melt,
          this should make us shed the drops of pity and of grief; we ought,
          indeed, to turn from our idle and evil ways when against Jesus we have
          so offended.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, Peter used another plea, that while they had rejected the
          blessed Christ they had chosen a murderer. Sinner, thou hast despised
          Christ, and what is it thou hast chosen? Has it been the drunkard's
          cup? Oh, what a bestial thing to prefer to Christ! Or has it been thy
          lust? What a devilish thing to set in the place of Christ! Man, what
          have thy sins done to thee that thou shouldst prefer them to Jesus?
          Have you lived in them for years? then what wages have you had? what
          profit have you had? Tell me now, you that have gone the farthest in
          sin, tell me now, are you satisfied with the service? Would you wish
          to go over again the days you have lived, and to reap in your own
          bodies the fruit of your misdeeds? Nay, but you serve a hard master; a
          murderer from the beginning is that devil to whom you surrender your
          lives. Oh, then, this is a thing to be repented of -- that you have
          cast Christ away, but have chosen a murderer. |Not this man,| say you,
          |but Barabbas.| You will take this murderous world, this killing sin,
          but the blessed Saviour, you let him go. Is not there good argument
          here for repentance and conversion? Surely there is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peter clenches his reasoning with another argument, bringing down, if
          I may so say, the big hammer this time upon the head of the nail. It
          is this, that the Lord Christ, whom you have hitherto despised, is
          able to do great things for you. |His name through faith in his name
          hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know.| Christ then, by
          faith in him, is able to do for you all that you want. If you will
          trust Jesus today, all your iniquities shall be blotted out; the past
          shall not be remembered; the present shall be rendered safe, and the
          future blessed. If thou trustest in Christ, there is no sin which he
          will not forgive thee, no evil habit the power of which he will not
          break, no foul propensity the weight of which he cannot remove.
          Believing in him, he can make thee blessed beyond a dream. And is not
          this cause for repentance, that thou shouldst have slighted one who
          can do thee so much good? With hands loaded with love he stands
          outside the door of your heart. Is not this good reason for opening
          the door and letting the heavenly stranger in, when he can bless you
          to such a vast extent of benediction? What, will you reject your own
          mercies? Will you despise the heaven which shall be yours if you will
          have my Master? Will you choose the doom from which none but he can
          rescue you, and let go the glory to which none but he can admit you?
          When I think of the usefulness of Christ to perishing sinners, there
          is indeed abundant cause for repentance that you should not have
          closed with him long ago, and accepted him to be your all in all. Thus
          you see the apostle argued with them by that word |Therefore.|
        </p>
        <p>
          There was one other plea which he used, which I would employ this
          morning. He said, |Brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it.|
          As if he would say, |Now that ye have more light, repent of what you
          did in the dark.| So might I say to some here present. You had not
          heard the gospel, you did not know that sin was so bad a thing, you
          did not understand that Jesus Christ was able to save to the uttermost
          them that came unto God by him. Well, now you do understand it. The
          times of your ignorance God winks at, but now, |commandeth all men
          everywhere to repent.| Greater light brings greater responsibility. Do
          not go back to your sin, lest it become tenfold sin to you; for if you
          do in the light what once you did in the darkness, he who winked at
          you when you knew no better, may lift his hand, and swear that you
          shall never enter into his rest, because you sinned presumptuously,
          and did despite to the Spirit of his grace. I charge every unconverted
          man here to mind what he is at in future. If he did not know that
          Jesus was able to save him before, he knows it now; if he was in the
          dark till this morning, he is not in the dark any longer. |Now ye have
          no cloak for your sin.| Therefore, because the cloak is pulled away,
          and you sin against the light, I say as Peter did, |Repent and be
          converted, that your sins may be blotted out.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But now, our third remark shall be given with brevity, and it is
          this, THAT WITHOUT REPENTANCE AND CONVERSION, SIN CANNOT BE PARDONED.
        </p>
        <p>
          The expression used in the text, |blotted out,| in the original may be
          better explained in this way. Many Oriental merchants kept their
          accounts on little tablets of wax. On these tablets of wax, they
          indented marks which recorded the debts, and when these debts were
          paid, they took the blunt end of the stylus or pencil, and just
          flattened down the wax, and the account entirely disappeared. That was
          the form of |blotting out| in those days. Now, he that repents and is
          pardoned, is, through the precious blood of Christ, so entirely
          forgiven, that there is no record of his sin left. It is as though the
          stylus had levelled the marks in the wax, and there was no record
          left. What a beautiful picture of the forgiveness of sin! It is all
          gone, not a trace left. If we blot out an account from our books,
          there is the blot: the record is gone, but there is the blot; but on
          the wax tablet there was no blot -- it was all gone, and the wax was
          smooth. So is it with the sin of God's people when removed by Jesus'
          blood, it is all gone and gone for ever. But rest assured it cannot be
          removed except there be repentance and conversion as the result of
          faith in Jesus. This must be so, for this is most seemly. Would you
          expect a great king to forgive an erring courtier unless the offender
          first confessed his fault? Where is the honour and dignity of the
          throne of God, if men are to be pardoned while as yet they will not
          confess their sin? In the next place, it would not be moral; it would
          be pulling up the very sluices of immorality to tell men that they
          could be pardoned while they went on in their sins and loved them.
          What, a thief pardoned and continue to thieve! A harlot forgiven and
          remain unchaste! The drunkard forgiven and yet delight in his
          tankards! Truly, then, the gospel would be the servant of
          unrighteousness, and against us who preach it morality should make a
          law. But it is not so, impenitent sinners shall be damned, let them
          boast what they will about grace. My hearer, thou must hate thy sin,
          or God will hate thee. Thou must turn or burn. Thou canst not have thy
          sins and go to heaven. Which shall it be? Wilt thou leave thy sins and
          go to heaven, or hold thy sins and go to hell? Which shall it be, for
          it must be one or the other; there must be a divorce between us and
          sin, or there cannot be a marriage between us and Christ. Does not
          conscience tell us this? There is not a conscience here that will say
          to a man, |You can hope to be saved and yet live as you list.| Some
          have said this -- I query if any have believed it. No, no, no, blind
          as conscience is, and though its voice be often very feeble, yet there
          is enough of sight about conscience to see that continuance in sin and
          pardon cannot consist, and that there must be a forsaking of iniquity
          if there is to be a forgiving of it. But, my hearer, whether your
          conscience shall say so or not, God says it; |He that confesseth and
          forsaketh his sin shall find mercy,| but there is no promise for the
          unrepenting. God declares that he that repents shall be forgiven. |To
          this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite
          spirit, and trembleth at my word;| but for haughty Pharaoh, who says,
          |Who is the Lord, that I should obey him?| there is nothing but
          eternal destruction from the presence of the Lord. He who goeth on in
          his iniquity and hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and
          that without remedy. Ah! I have no pardons to preach to you who settle
          your minds to continue in sin, no gentle notes of love at all, nothing
          but a fearful looking for of judgment and of fiery indignation. But
          ah! if you loathe your sins, if God's Holy Spirit has made you hate
          your past lives, if you are anxious to be made new men in Christ
          Jesus, I have nothing but notes of love for you. Believe in Jesus,
          cast yourself on him, for he has said, |Him that cometh unto me I will
          in no wise cast out.| |Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be
          as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as
          wool.| The door is shut and fast bolted to every man who will keep his
          sin, but it is wide open even to the biggest sinner out of hell, if he
          will but leave his sin and lay hold of Jesus and put his trust in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The last remark is this -- REPENTANCE AND CONVERSION WILL BE
          REGARDED AS PECULIARLY PRECIOUS IN THE FUTURE, for my text says, |That
          your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come
          from the presence of the Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          A very difficult passage indeed. Its meaning is scarcely known. Three
          or four meanings have been attached to it. In the first place, I think
          it means this -- he that repents and is converted, shall enjoy the
          blotting out of sin in that season of sweet peace which always follows
          pardon. After a man has been thoroughly broken down on account of sin,
          God deals with him very tenderly. Amongst the very happiest parts of
          human life are the hours immediately after conversion. You know how we
          sing --
        </p>
        <p>|Where is the blessedness I knew</p>
        <p>When first I saw the Lord?|</p>
        <p>
          When the broken bone begins to heal, David puts it, |Thou makest the
          bones which thou hast broken to rejoice.| When the prisoner first gets
          out of prison, when the fetters for the first time clank music as they
          fall broken to the ground! when the sick man leaves the sick chamber
          of his convictions to breathe the air of liberty, and to feel the
          health of a pardoned sinner! Oh, if you did but know what a bliss it
          is to be forgiven, you would never stay away from Christ! But you do
          not know, and cannot tell how sweet it is to be washed in the precious
          blood, and wrapped about with the fair white linen, and to have the
          kiss of the heavenly Father on your cheek! O |repent and be converted,
          that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall
          come from the presence of the Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps these |times of refreshing| may also relate to times of
          revival in the Christian church. The only way in which you, dear
          friends, can share in the refreshment of a revival, is by your own
          repenting and being converted. A revival is a great refreshment to the
          church. I pray that a mighty wave may sweep over Great Britain, for
          much we need it. But of what use is a revival to an unpardoned sinner?
          It is like the soft south wind blowing upon a corpse -- it can bring
          no genial warmth therewith. If you repent, and be converted, then,
          amidst the general joy of the revival, you shall have this joy, that
          your sins have been blotted out. What a mournful cry is that, |The
          harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved!| I think I
          hear that cry from some in the Tabernacle this morning. Oh, that
          blessed month of February and the beginning of March! It was to us
          like a harvest and a summer. What prayers, what tears, what cries! How
          full this house was to pray! How all day long from before the daystar
          shone til long after sunset we continued in prayer! But you are not
          saved, some of you. The harvest and the summer is ended, and you are
          not saved. Ah! I have been praying to God that you may yet be saved
          now. I am unable to achieve a purpose which has been hot upon my heart
          -- to go and preach to a greater congregation in the Agricultural Hall
          during the next month: I find myself restrained by the Master's hand.
          Ill-health has returned to me, and most probably there are months of
          weariness and pain awaiting me; but I have prayed that if I may not
          cast the net in the greater place, I may have the more of you here. We
          cannot have a larger congregation, but I would fain have more
          conversions. It is hard preaching, it is dull working, unless there be
          results. We must have conversions. As that woman of old said, |Give me
          children or I die,| so is it with the preacher: he must have sinners
          saved, or he prays to die. Dear hearer, if these times of refreshing
          may come, our prayer is that you may repent and be converted, that
          your sins may be blotted out, and so may partake to the full in the
          priceless blessings of the season.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, the text means, according to the context, the second
          advent. Jesus is yet to come a second time, and like a mighty shower
          flooding a desert shall his coming be. His church shall revive and be
          refreshed; she shall once again lift up her head from her lethargy,
          and her body from her sepulchre. But woe unto you who are not saved
          when Christ cometh, for the day of the Lord will be darkness and not
          light to you. When Christ cometh to the unconverted, |the day shall
          burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly,
          shall be stubble.| |But who may abide the day of his coming? and who
          shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and
          like fullers' soap: and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of
          silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi.| Oh, if ye repent and be
          converted, ye shall stand fully absolved in the day of his coming,
          when heaven and earth do reel, when the solid rock begins to melt, and
          the stars, like fig-leaves withered, fall from the tree, when the
          trumpet sounds exceeding loud and long, |Awake, ye dead and come to
          judgment,| when the grand assize is sitting, and the Judge shall be
          there -- the Judge of quick and dead, to separate the righteous from
          the wicked. The Lord have mercy upon you in that day; and so he shall
          if his grace shall make you obedient to the words of our text, |Repent
          and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when times of
          refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.|
