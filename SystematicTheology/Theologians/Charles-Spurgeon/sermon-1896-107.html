          9. He has distributed, he has given to the poor; his righteousness
          endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honor.10. The wicked
          shall see it, and be angry; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt
          away: The desire of the wicked shall perish.

          9 He has distributed, he hath given to the poor Once more he affirms
          that the righteous never lose the fruit and the reward of their
          liberality. And first, by dispersing, the prophet intimates, that they
          did not give sparingly and grudgingly, as some do who imagine that
          they discharge their duty to the poor when they dole out a small
          pittance to them, but that they give liberally as necessity requires
          and their means allow; for it may happen that a liberal heart does not
          possess a large portion of the wealth of this world. All that the
          prophet means is, that they are never so parsimonious as not to be
          always ready to distribute according to their means. Next he adds,
          they give to the poor, meaning that they do not bestow their charity
          at random, but with prudence and discretion meet the wants of the
          necessitous. We are aware that unnecessary and superfluous expenditure
          for the sake of ostentation is frequently lauded by the world; and,
          consequently, a larger quantity of the good things of this life is
          squandered away in luxury and ambition than is dispensed in charity
          prudently bestowed. The prophet instructs us that the praise which
          belongs to liberality does not consist in distributing our goods
          without any regard to the objects upon whom they are conferred, and
          the purposes to which they are applied, but in relieving the wants of
          the really necessitous, and in the money being expended on things
          proper and lawful. This passage is quoted by Paul, (2 Corinthians 9:9)
          in which he informs us that it is an easy matter for God to bless us
          with plenty, so that we may exercise our bounty freely, deliberately,
          and impartially, and this accords best with the design of the prophet.
          The next clause, his righteousness endureth for ever, is susceptible
          of two interpretations. That immoderate ambition which impels the
          ungodly to squander away their goods merits not the name of virtue. It
          may, therefore, with propriety be said, that it is a uniform course of
          liberality which is here praised by the prophet, according to what he
          formerly observed, that the righteous manage their affairs with
          discretion. If any prefer to refer it to the fruit of righteousness, I
          have no objection. And, indeed, it appears to be a repetition of the
          same sentence which lately came under our notice. Then the prophet
          shows how God by his benefits preserves the glory of that
          righteousness which is due to their liberality, and does not
          disappoint them of their reward, in that he exalteth their horn more
          and more, that is, their power or their prosperous condition.

          10. The wicked shall see it. Here follows a contrast similar to that
          which we met with in Psalm 2:5, which renders the grace of God towards
          the faithful the more illustrious. His meaning is, that though the
          wicked may cast off all regard to piety, and banish from their minds
          all thoughts of human affairs being under the superintending
          providence of God, they shall yet be made to feel, whether they will
          or no, that the righteous, in compliance with God's command, do not
          vainly devote themselves to the cultivation of charity and mercy. Let
          them harden themselves as they choose, yet he declares that the honor,
          which God confers upon his children, shall be exhibited to them, the
          sight of which shall make them gnash with their teeth, and shall
          excite an envy that shall consume them by inches. In conclusion, he
          adds, that the wicked shall be disappointed of their desires They are
          never content, but are continually thirsting after something, and
          their confidence is as presumptuous as their avarice is unbounded. And
          hence, in their foolish expectations, they do not hesitate at grasping
          at the whole world. But the prophet tells them that God will snatch
          from them what they imagined was already in their possession, so that
          they shall always depart destitute and famishing.<br />
