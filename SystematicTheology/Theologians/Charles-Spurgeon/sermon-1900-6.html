        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.2667)</p>
        <p>Intended for Reading on Lord's-Day, March 25th, 1900,</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington,</p>
        <p>On Thursday Evening, October 12th, 1882.</p>
        <p>
          |Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he
          said unto him, Dost thou believe on he Son of God? He answered and
          said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? And Jesus said
          unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with
          thee. And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.| -- John
          9:35-38.
        </p>
        <p>
          D LAST Sabbath morning,* I spoke to you concerning one who was
          impressed into the King's service. That was Simon, the Cyrenian, who
          was compelled to bear Christ's cross. He was not a volunteer, but; a
          pressed man; yet, I think that, after he had been forced to bear the
          cross, he willingly carried it, and I hope that he afterwards became a
          faithful follower of the Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, strange to say, here is another pressed man; for I do not think
          that this man, whose eyes had been opened by Christ, had thought of
          becoming a believer in the Son of God until the Lord Jesus found him
          out. Before he had reached that point; indeed, before he knew that the
          prophet who had opened his eyes was the Son of God, the Pharisees had
          cast him out of the synagogue, so that he was compelled to bear the
          cross for Christ although he did not then fully know Christ, and
          certainly had not believed upon the Son of God. Yet, in his case also,
          it appears that he cheerfully took up the cross which had been at the
          first forcibly laid upon him. It may happen that there are some
          persons here who are in a similar position, some who have been
          ridiculed for being Christians even before they are Christians, who
          have been mocked at merely because they go to a place of worship,
          though as yet they have not yielded themselves to Christ; well, if
          that is the case; with any, seeing that the cross is laid upon their
          shoulders, I do trust that they will not throw it off, but that they
          will bravely bear it for Christ, and freely suffer what, up till now,
          has seemed to them to be a piece of injustice, for they have been
          treated as if they were believers in Christ, when really they are not
          yet on the Lord's side.
        </p>
        <p>
          This man, then, bearing Christ's cross in a certain way, was cast out
          of the synagogue, and then Christ found him, and blessed him. Observe,
          dear friend, where Christ began with him; for it will show us where
          and how the blessing usually enters. The door by which the richest of
          heaven's favors must come to us is indicated by our Lord going to that
          door, and opening it. He said to the man, |Dost thou believe on the
          Son of God.| So that faith in the Son of God is the gate of
          benediction. Faith is that window of agate and gate of carbuncle by
          which the divine light of Jesu's love comes streaming into the soul.
          This is the way by which God's mercy enters the heart of man, and
          therefore the Lord Jesus Christ himself begins there; and in all our
          dealings with the unconverted, it will be wise for us also to begin
          there. That is the place where the decisive battle will have to be
          fought; for, upon the believing or the non-believing on the Son of
          God, the eternal destiny of each individual will turn. |He that
          believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not
          the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.| That
          wrath abides even now upon him if the life of God is not in him. Let
          us hammer away at that all-important point of faith in Christ. This is
          the Thermopylae, of Christian experience. If this pass can be stormed
          and carried, we can capture the citadel of men's hearts; but if
          unbelief continues to guard that narrow passage to eternal life and to
          hold it against the gospel and its invitations, and exhortations, and
          promises, and threatenings, then nothing whatever can be done. So, in
          this enquiry of our Lord, we have most instructive teaching. His
          object, no doubt, was to bless this man by working in him saving
          faith, and therefore he said to him, |Dost thou believe on the Son of
          God?|
        </p>
        <p>
          I think our text will help us, first, to speak of true faith, -- how
          it is known; secondly, true faith, -- how it progresses; and thirdly,
          true faith, -- how we can promote it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, I want to speak concerning TRUE FAITH, -- the faith that
          saves -- HOW IT IS KNOWN.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it is absolutely essential that it should be faith in the Son
          of God. Our blessed Lord knew that this man believed in him as a
          prophet; so might he not have been content with that? No; because, to
          believe in Christ merely as a prophet is not saving faith. It may be a
          step towards salvation, and it may lead up to it; but the faith that
          is absolutely necessary is that belief in him as the Son of God; and
          he who does not believe in the Deity of Christ has not a Saviour who
          can save him. The work of saving a soul is a divine operation, and no
          one but a divine being can accomplish it. It is he who sitteth upon
          the throne who saith, |Behold, I make all things new!| There cannot be
          anyone except the Creator who can create; and the Creator must, in
          every case, be God. To save a soul, there must be a work performed
          which is analogous to the resurrection; but, in order to raise the
          dead, there must be the presence and power of God. It is one of those
          operations which it is not conceivable can be performed by an angel or
          by any created being. The Highest alone can accomplish it; has he not
          said of himself, |I kill, and I make alive|? The power of life and
          death must rest with God alone. Hence, then, the work of salvation
          needs a power nothing less than divine. He who believes in Christ as a
          mere man has not believed in a person who can give him salvation; and
          Christ cannot accomplish the stupendous task if he be only man, for
          the Saviour must be God.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no true and logical standpoint, in reference to the Deity of
          Christ, except one of two things. Either our Lord was the Son of God,
          equal with the Father, or else he was an impostor, for he most
          distinctly claimed that he was the Son of God. In the chapter
          preceding our text at the 54th verse, we read that Jesus said to the
          Jews, |If I honor myself, my honor is nothing: it is my Father that
          honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God.| Then they took up
          stones to cast at him because he said that he was the Son of God:;
          and, in this case of the blind man whom he had healed, he took pains
          to find him out that he might communicate to him in private the fact
          that he was himself the Son of God. He never withdrew his claim to the
          Deity; if he had only said to the Jews, |No, I am not the Son of God;'
          you are mistaken in supposing that I said I was. The expressions I
          used are not intended to convey that idea,| then they would not have
          crucified him. This was the chief point of their quarrel with him, and
          I must again say that either he was God, or he wilfully misled the
          people by using words which made them think that he was God. His words
          have led millions of Christians, from those days until now, to worship
          him as God; and they were perfectly justified, by his utterances, in
          doing so; and if he meant anything less than that, then he was a
          deceiver. But he did really mean that he was God, and it is our joy
          and glory to rest in him as being alike the Son of Mary and the Son of
          Jehovah himself, |Light of Light, very God of very God,| co-equal and
          co-eternal with the Father; and here we feel that we can rest for our
          soul's salvation, we can lean with our whole weight on One who is
          indeed |mighty to saw? Seeing that all power is his, and that he is
          equal with God, he can and he will save all those who put their trust
          in him. Do not any of you, I beseech you, be content with any faith
          less than that. If you have any sort of faith which does not recognize
          Christ as God, do with it as the man did with the bank note, when he
          found that it was bad, -- he laid it down, and ran away from it, for
          fear anybody should suspect him of being its owner. Put away every
          kind of confidence that is short of faith in the Son of God, and abhor
          it, for it is a damnable delusion; and may the Lord bring you fully
          into this blessed state of salvation through believing on the Son of
          God!
        </p>
        <p>
          A second point about saving faith is that it rests upon a knowledge of
          him. This man said to Jesus, |Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on
          him?| He was not one whose notion of faith was that he need not know
          what he believed. The Church of Rome seems to inculcate some kind of
          implicit faith (or credulity) which can exist apart from knowledge;
          but how can I believe that which I do not know Paul puts it thus,
          |Faith cometh by hearing.| You must first hear and know what it is you
          are to believe before you can believe it; otherwise, your faith is
          vain, like that of the man of whom I have sometimes spoken, who said,
          |I believe what the Church believes.| |But what does the Church
          believe?| It believes what I believe.| |Then what do you and the
          Church believe?| |Why, we both believe the same thing.| That is not
          the kind of believing that can save the soul. It is through the
          knowledge of Christ that we are saved. To know Christ is sometimes
          said to be analogous to believing in Christ. You must know what it is
          that you have to believe; a faith that does not know is no faith at
          all. Read through the Epistles of John, and mark with your pencil
          every time the word |know| is used. The apostle makes that; word
          |know| come in again and again, for a man must know that which he is
          to believe and hence this man says to Christ, |Who is he, Lord, that I
          might believe on him?|
        </p>
        <p>
          For my part, I could never be content without unquestioning certainty
          as to my soul's salvation. Do you think that is more than a man ought
          to wish for. Are any of you at ease while you are afraid that you have
          a mortal disease working within you? Oh, no! You want to know, from a
          qualified physician, the truth about your case. And if it were
          whispered in your ear, at this moment, that your house was being
          broken into or was on fire, would you sit still here, and not trouble
          yourself as to whether the report were true or not? Would you not want
          to go at once, and see for yourself. If you knew that you bought an
          estate, some time ago, bug you have since heard that the title to it
          is a very uncertain one, in fact, that, in all probability, you will
          lose all you have paid for it, would you not say, |I ought to have
          taken care to be certain about the title, and I would not have bought
          the estate if I had not felt that the deeds relating to it were all
          right|. Well, then, if you desire certainty about your bodily health,
          and about the safety of your house, and about the validity of your
          title-deeds, can you afford to go without certainty as to your soul's
          affairs? No, you cannot; therefore, rest not till you have it. If you
          have various questions about your spiritual condition, boldly face
          those questions, and answer them; but never let any questions about
          your eternal welfare be such that you dare not face them, and do not
          wish to search out the answers to them. Pry to the very bottom of
          them; and, better still, ask the Lord to search you, and know your
          heart, to try you, and know your thoughts, and to lead you in the way
          everlasting; and be not content till you can truthfully say, |I know
          whom I have, believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that
          which I have committed unto him.| This man, of whom I am speaking,
          knew that Christ had opened his eyes, therefore he must be at least a
          prophet. He also knew, further, that whatever that prophet told him
          must be true, for the man who had opened his eyes must have been sent
          by God, and God does not work miracles by liars. He said to himself,
          |This man is undoubtedly a faithful person, or God would not employ
          him in such a wonderful work as that of opening the eyes of a man who
          was born blind;| and then he stood perfectly prepared to receive what
          -- ever might be spoken by this prophet of whom he knew something,
          though he did not know enough to understand what was meant by the
          Savior when he asked, |Dost thou believe on the Son of God|? He,
          therefore, sat as an enquirer at the Savior's feet, waiting for
          something to be told him which should enable him to believe.
        </p>
        <p>
          You, dear friend, may not be in exactly the same condition that this
          man was in; but, still, your case may be, in many respects, a parallel
          one. You Say, perhaps, |I wish, above all things in the world, that I
          could believe in Christ.| Do you intend to sit down, and. try to make
          yourself believe in him That would be a very unwise thing because
          faith is not wrought in the soul in that fashion. Suppose it was
          rumoured, at the present moment, that there had been another massacre
          in Alexandria, and that our troops had been driven out of the city;
          how would you decide whether the report was to be believed or not
          Would you sit down in your pew, and say, |I will try to make myself
          believe it|. Well, you might come, by a process of reasoning, to some
          sort of conclusion as to whether it was or was not a likely thing; but
          the mere sensible plan would be to enquire what foundation there was
          for the report; and if, on going to the War Office, you were informed,
          by someone in authority, |Yes, there has been a very great disaster,|
          well, then, knowing the facts of the case, you could believe. The
          enquiry at headquarters would be the way to ascertain the truth of the
          report, and just so is it in connection with believing in Christ. if I
          am to believe in him, I ask, with this man, |Who is he.| and until I
          know who he is, it is idle for me to talk about forcing myself to
          believe in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now listen. He in whom you are asked to believe for salvation is,
          first, of all, himself God. Then, in infinite mercy, he came and took
          upon himself our nature, and dwelt among men. He voluntarily came, --
          being God, -- but he was also sent of God, appointed and authorized to
          be God's Ambassador to man. He was, in addition to being sent of God,
          anointed of God, for the Spirit of God rested upon him without
          measure, qualifying him for his work. The life he led here on earth
          was unique, there was never another like it, and the imagination of
          man cannot write the history of another man that shall be at all
          comparable to the life of Christ. It stands apart in a lone, simple
          majesty, utterly inimitable, absolutely perfect. Then he died, and by
          that death he for ever put away the sin of his people. He took upon
          himself the sin which he had never committed; he was numbered with the
          transgressors, and he suffered as if men's transgressions had been his
          own; he died, |the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to
          God.| And God has accepted those sufferings as a propitiation for all
          who believe in him; and now, this is the witness of God concerning
          him, that he has raised him from the dead, and taken him up to his
          throne, and made him to sit there, at his Father's right hand, where,
          at this moment, he is making intercession for all who come unto God by
          him. And, now, our prayers are accepted through him; and the infinite
          blessings, which are his, he distributes among us; and he is shortly
          coming again, with sound of trumpet, and attended by myriads of saints
          and angels. As he ascended from Olivet, in like manner also will he
          descend to earth again. King of kings and Lord of lords shall he be in
          that day; |and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall
          separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from
          the goats.| He is God, he still lives, it is the living, reigning
          Christ whom we preach unto you. He lives in glory, and he also lives
          here by the presence of his Holy Spirit, who is with us, and who is to
          abide with us evermore; and it is upon him as God incarnate, as
          Savior, crucified, risen, and gone into the glory, that you are asked
          to place your soul's confidence. If you would learn this truth more
          fully, read the four Gospels, and the Epistles, and ask the Spirit,
          who inspired the writers of them, to explain and apply them to you.
          That is the way to obtain faith. Many a man has been reading in the
          Bible the story of the cross, and so he has believed in Jesus. Many
          another has heard about the Savior, and so has been led to believe in
          him. It is the simplest thing in the world to believe upon trustworthy
          evidence; and when we get the evidence of Christ's life and death
          manifesting the glory of his person, the graciousness of his
          character, and the efficacy of his atoning-blood, then are we led to
          believe in him. True faith is based upon knowledge of Christ, as it
          was in this man's case. Take care, dear friends, that you always
          remember that simple but important truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, further, true faith always expresses itself to the Lord. This
          man, when he had believed in Jesus, said, |Lord, I believe.| True
          faith ought also to express itself to men, as Paul puts it, in writing
          to the Romans, |For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness;
          and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation;| or, as the
          Master himself puts it, |He that believeth and is baptized shall be
          saved.| Therefore, the confession before men ought not to be neglected
          in any case; yet I fear, and hope, that there are some pilgrims who
          steal into heaven, scarcely known by men to be Christians, -- at
          least, not avowed as such by open profession. I do not recommend that
          dodging behind the hedges, and getting to heaven along back roads;
          that is a bad plan, but, still, I trust some have managed it, though
          with much trouble and loss to themselves; but, in every case, every
          one who has believed has made the confession of that faith to the
          Master himself. He has said to Jesus, as this man did, |Lord, I
          believe,| even though he has added, with another man, |Help thou mine
          unbelief.| He has said to Jesus, with Thomas, |My Lord and my God.|
          There has been a personal acknowledgment, as we sometimes sing it, --
        </p>
        <p>|My faith looks up to thee,</p>
        <p>Thou Lamb of Calvary,</p>
        <p>Savior divine.|</p>
        <p>
          It is a very vital point about true faith that it thus recognizes its
          obligation to speak to him, and to avow itself to him. How sweetly
          doth faith, sometimes, come up from the wilderness, leaning upon her
          Beloved, and owning to him that she is his, and he is hers! She cannot
          help making this confession; she would be untrue to herself and to her
          Lord if She did not do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          In one respect, We are better off than this man was, for we have many
          divine promises to help us to believe in Christ. Have you ever
          noticed, dear friends, how much we live upon the promises of our
          fellow-men? In buying a small article at a shop, you pay your twopence
          far it across the counter; but, the larger the business transaction
          gets to be, the less there is of metallic currency in connection with
          it, and then you often pay each other in promises. The commonest form
          of a promise is a bank note; and it is worth while to observe how much
          a bank note is made after the model of God's promises. How does the
          wording of this bank note run it is headed, |Bank of England;| and it
          begins, |I promise.| You take this note readily enough instead of five
          golden sovereigns, because you read on it, |I promise to pay the
          bearer;| and God's promise is payable to |the bearer.| Whoever has the
          promise in his possession, whoever has faith enough to lay hold of
          God's promise, may read it in this way: |I promise to pay the bearer.|
          I remember when I first snatched at one of God's precious promises; I
          could hardly hope that I had any right to it, for I felt myself so
          utterly unworthy, but I snatched it up, and ran with it to the Bank of
          Faith, and as soon as I presented it, received its full value. God
          always honours his own promises; here is one: |Him that cometh to me I
          will in no wise cast out.| Go to him with that gracious message, and
          it shall be fulfilled to you whoever you are. The note says, |I
          promise to pay the bearer.| If a sweep takes that note to the Bank of
          England, he will get the money for it; -- I mean a sweep in character
          as well as by trade, for the declaration on it is, |I promise to pay
          the bearer.|
        </p>
        <p>
          What does it new say on the bank note |I promise to pay the bearer on
          demand.| That is how all God's promises run: |on demand.| It is worthy
          of note that, in the olden time, when the Lord had made many promises
          to his people, he added, |I will yet for this be enquired of by thee
          house of Israel, to do it for them; |as though the fulfillment of the
          promise was delayed until it was asked for. No doubt many of God's
          great and precious promises are not realized by you and me because
          they are not presented to the Lord as we should take a note to the
          bank to get it cashed. We do not enquire of God as much as we ought.
          You hear of enquirers going to see the minister; that may be a good
          thing, but the best sort of enquirers are those I heard before I came
          up here to preach to-night, when some good earnest, souls met downs in
          the lecture-hall to enquire of God for a blessing, and to ask him to
          help his servant to speak the Word with power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, coming back to this bank note, I daresay you would not mind
          having a pile of paper, of this kind, reaching from the floor to the
          ceiling, and then you would say to yourself, |Now I am a rich man.|
          But you have not a single farthing there, you have only a promise |to
          pay the bearer on demand the sum of five pounds.| |Ah!| you say, |but
          that promise is good all the world over.| Whose promise is it? Well,
          it is signed by the chief cashier, but he only signs it |for the
          Governor and Company of the Bank of England.| That is where the value
          of the promise lies; and it is our comfort, to know that we have a
          noble name written below all God's promises, for the Lord Jesus Christ
          has signed them all in God's behalf, for the great Governor of heaven
          and earth, who has no need of any |company| to be joined with him, for
          his sole resources are fully equal to the fulfillment of every promise
          that he has ever issued. Now, if we treat men's promises with respect,
          and pass them from hand to hand as if they were genuine gold, and we
          constantly do so; shall we not treat God's promises with something
          more than respect, and trust them with implicit confidence. Will any
          man have the impudence to say, |I have faith in a note signed by the
          chief cashier of the Bank of England, but cannot trust a promise that
          is certified by the Lord Jesus Christ himself?| Shall I consider that
          bank note to be as good as the money it represents, and yet, when I
          hold in my hand God's Word, signed, and sealed, and ratified by the
          sprinkling of the very blood of his dear Son, shall I dare to say, |I
          find it hard to believe in that word|? If I talk so, I shall grieve
          the people of God, and what is far worse, shall grieve the Lord
          himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now I turn to the second part of our subject, which is, TRUE
          FAITH, HOW IT PROGRESSES.
        </p>
        <p>
          Very often it has a very small beginning. Saving faith does not always
          come on a sudden. Some men are saved, as Saul of Tarsus was; they are
          struck down in the midst of their sins, and converted ill remarkable
          and unusual manner; but with many others there is, first, a faint
          twilight; then, by-and-by, a little more; and, at last, the sun has
          fully risen upon them. Perhaps you cannot tell when it did actually
          rise; but you know that it has risen, for there is the light and the
          brightness of its shining.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of the man of whom I am speaking, faith began with a
          preparedness to believe. His eyes had been opened, and he was thereby
          made ready to believe anything that Jesus might tell him. And there is
          many a man who, looking back upon God's goodness to himself, and God's
          goodness to his father and mother, and God's goodness to gracious
          people in general, and thinking of the holy and lovely character of
          Christ, has in that way been prepared to believe when the truth was
          clearly set before him.
        </p>
        <p>
          This man went a step further on the right road, for he desired to
          believe. He said, |Who is he, Lord,| not, |that I might know about
          him, and talk about him| -- but, |that I might believe on him?| He lad
          a desire to possess true faith; and there are many like him, who
          desire to believe, but who have not exercised faith in Christ. This is
          very wonderful, but it is true. Of all things in the world, to believe
          in Christ is one of the most simple, yet that is the reason why many
          find it so difficult. If it were difficult, it would seem easy to
          them; but, being easy, it appears difficult. Some of you, dear
          friends, when I try to describe how we come to trust in Christ, will
          twist and turn what I say, even if I make it |as plain as a
          pikestaff.| You think, |Oh, he must mean something very different from
          what he says!| You really cannot get this idea into your heads, --
          that you have just to depend upon Christ, to trust him, and then you
          are saved, for |he that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life.|
          Whenever we use a metaphor, or figure, or illustration to try to
          explain the simplicity of faith, straightway somebody finds a
          difficulty even in that. When I have been trying to catch a sinner, I
          find that he has as many hiding-places as there are days in the year.
          I have stopped up one after another, and I have said to him, |No,
          salvation only comes through believing.| |Yes, sir, I know, but -- |
          and down he runs into another hole. When I have dug him out of that,
          and fancied I should surely catch him, he says, |Oh, yes! we are to
          trust the Savior, but -- | and again he is off. Somehow, men seem very
          ingenious in trying to find out reasons why they should not be saved,
          and all their foolish ingenuity seems to be employed in attempting to
          escape from this blessed divine simplicity, |Believe on the Lord Jesus
          Christ, and thou shalt be saved.| May God the Holy Spirit lead them to
          believe in him! He must lead them, for no man can see Christ until his
          eyes are divinely opened. We may put the truth as plainly as ever we
          can, and preach it so that we think we cannot be misunderstood; but
          men will misunderstand us still, even those who desire to believe in
          Christ, until the Holy Spirit shall work effectually in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This man went still further on the right road; for he not only desired
          to believe, but he made enquiry in order that he might believe. I put
          it to you very simply, just now, with regard to making enquiries
          concerning a certain piece of news. Well, this man did the same. He
          said to the Master, |Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him.| If
          sinners would only make enquiries about the Savior, they would soon
          trust in him. You will find, as a rule, that the people who rail at
          the New Testament, have never read it. If they would but read it,
          their cavils might soon come to an end, and be followed by a blessed
          faith in Christ; but, instead of doing so, they read what some
          objection-manufacturer has said about the Bible, instead of going to
          the Book itself, and seeing what it really teaches, if I were very
          thirsty, I do not think that I should abstain from going to a well
          because somebody told me that it contained bad water; but I should go,
          and see, and taste for myself; and when a soul gets very thirsty, if
          it is wise, it goes to the Word for itself. I advise you to do that,
          dear friends. |O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the
          man that trusteth in him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          When this man had made his enquiry, and received Christ's answer, he
          soon became decided. He said, |Lord, I believe.| I like that simple,
          clear avowal of faith. So often, when we are conversing with an
          enquirer, he says, |Yes, sir; I hope I believe.| Oh, dear! is that al
          you can say? |Well, I trust! believe;| and so faith is surrounded by
          fog. -- |I hope I believe; I trust I believe.| Man, don't you know
          whether you believe or not? You may know it; one thing I know, you
          have no business to go to sleep till you do know this once for all;
          for, if you are not a believer, you are an unbeliever. There is no
          middle state between the two; and if you are an unbeliever, you are
          |condemned already,| because you have not believed in the name of the
          only-begotten Son of God. This matter of believing ought never to be
          left in doubt at all, but it should be definitely settled, so that you
          can say, with this man, |Lord, I believe.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, further, he acted as a believer: for |he worshipped him.| This
          proves how his faith had grown. I should like to ask you who are the
          people of God when you are happiest. I think you will agree with what
          I am going to say; and if you do not, it will still he just as true to
          me. My happiest moments are when I am worshipping God, really adoring
          the Lord Jesus Christ, and having fellowship with the ever-blessed
          Spirit. In that worship, I forget the cares of the church, and
          everything else; and, to me, it is the nearest approach to what it
          will be in heaven, where, day without night, they offer perpetual
          adoration unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.
          Hence, what a memorable moment it was for this man when he worshipped
          Christ! Now, if Christ was not God, that man was all idolater, a
          man-worshipper; and you and instead of being regarded as very
          excellent people, by those who call themselves |Unitarian Brethren,|
          should be condemned as idolaters. If Christ was not God, we are not
          Christians; we are deceived dupes, we are idolaters, as bad as the
          heathen whom we now pity. It is making a man into a God if Christ be
          not God. But, blessed be his holy name, he is God; and we feel that it
          is the supreme delight of our being to worship him. We cannot veil our
          face with our wings, for we have none; but we do veil them with his
          own robe of righteousness whenever we approach him. We cannot cover
          our feet with our wings, as the angels do; but we do take his blood
          and his righteousness both as a covering for our feet, and as wings
          with which we fly up to him; and though as yet we have no crowns to
          cast at his dear feet, yet, if we have any honor, any good repute, any
          grace, anything that is comely, anything that is honest, we lay it all
          at his feet, and cry, |Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy
          name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now I come to the third point, which is this, TRUE FAITH, -- HOW
          TO PROMOTE IT.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brothers and sisters beloved, there are many of you who are constantly
          looking out for souls, and trying to bring them to Christ; you have
          here an example of what you may do in endeavoring to lead them to
          exercise faith in Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, if you have any choice as to those to whom you go, seek out the
          oppressed. You are to go, so far as you can, |into all the world, and
          preach the gospel to every creature;| but if you may specially look
          for some more than others, seek out the sick, the sad, the weary, the
          poor, the broken-down ones, and especially such as have been put out
          of the synagogue. When our missionaries have gone among the Brahmins
          in India, they have had a few converts; but the most blessing has been
          given among the poor people who have no high caste of which they are
          proud. When the gospel was taken to them, they gladly received it. The
          gospel worker will be wise if, instead of shunning those whom even
          nominally religious people put away, he looks after them first. They
          are likely soil for the good seed of the kingdom to grow in, and bring
          forth fruit. Our Lord Jesus Christ, at Sychar, did not go to some
          goodly matron, who was an ornament to her sex; but you know where he
          found the woman who became his disciple and missionary, and you know
          what kind of woman she was; and, to this day, he delights to go about,
          as Whitefield used to say, |sweeping up the devil's castaways.| Those
          whom nobody else wants, and nobody else will have, our blessed Lord
          and Master delights to receive. Do you, therefore, look after those
          out-of-the-way sinners. I like that expression, those out-of-the-way
          Sinners; because our Lord Jesus Christ is the High Priest |who can
          have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way.|
          Out-of-the-way sinners are the sort he came to save; therefore, look
          out for them, you who would follow the example of the great
          Soul-Winner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, next, when you come to close quarters with them, ask them
          questions, as Christ did. He said to this man, |Dost thou believe on
          the Son of God:| Put the enquiry pointedly and personally. Here am I,
          up in the pulpit, firing the gospel gun, and the shot flies where God
          directs it; but you, downstairs, who love the Lord, can, as it were,
          hold a pistol close to the sinner's head. Take them separately, one by
          one; and make them |stand and deliver.| Put the question as our Lord
          did, |Dost thou believe?| See, friend,| you can say, |the minister has
          been preaching about faith. 'Dost thou believe?'| This is what nine
          people out of ten want, somebody to come and make a personal
          application of the truth to them. They are like soldiers out upon the
          battlefield; they lie there, wounded, bleeding, dying. Close by, there
          is all that is needed to bind up their wounds, and plenty of it; then,
          why do they lie there in agony? They need personal attention, and it
          is your business, as an army surgeon, to go and put on the lint, and
          bind up the wounds. Oh, that we had multitudes who would do this, and
          that all God's people were constantly looking out for opportunities of
          making a personal application of the truth to those who hear it! |Dost
          thou believe?| said the Lord Jesus to this man, and by that question
          he held him fast. That is the way to win souls, begin with a personal
          question.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, be ready to answer enquiries. This is what our Lord himself did
          when he revealed himself to this man. Tell them all you know; and if
          you cannot tell them all they want to know, try to bring them to
          somebody more advanced in spiritual things than you yourself are, so
          that, with prayer, and patience, and wise instruction, he may lead
          them to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, pray to the Lord Jesus Christ to reveal himself to them, for
          that is the way faith comes. We cannot speak of Christ as he should be
          spoken of; but, when he reveals himself, then the sinners see him. All
          the portraits of a beauty never touch the heart like one glance from
          her eyes; and all the portraits of Christ, that ever were painted by
          his most admiring disciples, never make such an impression on the
          heart of man as when once he says, as he said to this man, |Thou hast
          both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.| None but Christ
          himself can preach Christ to the full. He must reveal himself, or the
          Spirit must reveal him, or else men do not see him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, glorify Christ by you're your personal testimony. Recollect
          that wondrous intercessory prayer of our Lord, in which he said,
          |Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe
          on me through their word.| It was so kind, yet just like him, not to
          say, |through my word,| though it is his word that we are to proclaim;
          but we get it into our hearts, and so appropriate it that, when we
          utter it, we speak out of our own heart, and soul, and then it becomes
          our word, too, and so sinners believe on Christ through our word. Go
          on speaking your word, that is, Christ's word spoken by you, for this
          is how to win souls for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, in closing, I want to begin again, and give you another little
          sermon altogether, only I shall not be able to preach it to you, but
          just to give you the heads of it, and leave it with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first head is, when you are believing, mind that you believe in
          Jesus himself. |Dost thou believe on the Son of God?| or is it
          somebody else in whom you are believing? Is it merely what others say
          about Christ that you believe? Is it your own opinion of Christ? Or is
          it really the Son of God upon whom you are believing when you are
          believing, believe in Jesus himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, when you are enquiring, enquire of Jesus himself. This is a
          beautiful thing, to my mind. Here is a man asking Christ about Christ,
          -- asking Jesus, |Who is he?| and, all the while, speaking to the very
          person about whom he was enquiring. He did not know it was Jesus, yet
          he had gone to the very fountain-head. Now, perhaps some of you have
          made enquiries of Christian people, and you have read the Bible, and
          prayed, and yet you cannot find Jesus; then go direct to him, by
          faith, and say, |Lord, show me thyself.| That is the way to learn of
          him. Have I a book of which I cannot make heads or tail as I read it?
          If I knew where the author lived, I would call on him, and say, |Dear
          sir, will you kindly tell me what you mean by this expression? I
          cannot understand it.| That is the way to find anything out; go to the
          fountain-head. So, go you to Christ always; and, when you are
          enquiring, enquire of Christ himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, when you are seeking Christ, ask Christ to reveal himself to
          you, for there is nobody who can reveal Christ as Christ can reveal
          himself by is blessed Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, next, when you are confessing your faith, confess it to Christ
          himself. Say, as this man did, |Lord, I believe.| Say to your
          minister, or to your mother, or to your friends, |I believe;| but
          take, care, above all the rest, that you say, |Lord, I believe.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And, lastly, when you are worshipping, worship Christ himself: |He
          worshipped HIM,| and no one else. Take care that your reverence and
          adoration are not given, in any degree, to the church, or to any
          person in it, or to any priest, or minister, or anything created or
          made; but worship God, and God in Christ Jesus; and the Lord bless
          you, beloved, for his name's sake! Amen.
