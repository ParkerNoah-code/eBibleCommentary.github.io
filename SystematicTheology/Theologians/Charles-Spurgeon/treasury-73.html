<p align="center">PSALM 71 <br/>
 </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">TITLE. There is no title to this Psalm, and hence some 
    have conjecture that Psalm 70 is intended to be a prelude to it, and has 
    been broken off from it. Such <i>imaginings </i>have no value with us. We 
    have already met with five Psalms without title, which are, nevertheless, as 
    complete as those which bear them. </p>
<p align="justify">We have here THE PRAYER OF THE AGED BELIEVER, who, in 
    holy confidence of faith, strengthened by a long and remarkable experience, 
    pleads against his enemies, and asks further blessings for himself. 
    Anticipating a gracious reply, he promises to magnify the Lord exceedingly.</p>
<p align="justify">DIVISION. </p>
<p align="justify">The first four verses are<i> faith's cry for help</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">The next four are a testimony of experience. </p>
<p align="justify">From verses 9-13, the aged saint pleads against his foes,
    </p>
<p align="justify">and then rejoices in hope, verses 14-16. </p>
<p align="justify">He returns to prayer again in verses 17-18, </p>
<p align="justify">repeats the confident hopes which cheered his soul, 
    verses 19-21; </p>
<p align="justify">and then he closes with the promise of abounding in 
    thanksgiving.</p>
<p align="justify">Throughout, this Psalm may be regarded as <i>the 
    utterance of struggling, but unstaggering, faith.<br/>
 </i></p>

<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. In you, O Lord, do I put my trust. </p></b>Jehovah 
    deserves our confidence; let him have it all. <i>Every day must we guard 
    against every form of reliance upon an arm of flesh, and hourly hang our 
    faith upon the ever faithful God. 
</i>
<p align="justify">Not only on God must we rest, as a man stands on a rock, 
    but in him must we trust, as a man hides in a cave. <i>The more intimate we 
    are with the Lord, the firmer will our trust be. </i>God knows our faith, 
    and yet he loves to hear us avow it; hence, the psalmist not only trusts in 
    the Lord, but tells him that he is so trusting.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Let me never be put to confusion.</p></b> So long as the 
    world stands, stand by me; yes, forever and ever be faithful to your 
    servant. If you forsake me, men will ridicule my religion, and how shall I 
    be able to answer them? Confusion will silence me, and your cause will be 
    put to shame.
<p align="justify">This verse is a good beginning for prayer; <i>those who 
    commence with trust shall conclude with joy.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. Deliver me in your righteousness, and cause me 
    to escape.</p></b> Be true, O God, to your word. It is a righteous thing in you 
    to keep the promises which you have made unto your servants. I have trusted 
    you, and you will not be unrighteous to forget my faith. I am taken as in a 
    net, but do you liberate me from the malice of my persecutors. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Incline your ear unto me, and save me.</p></b> Stoop to my 
    feebleness, and hear my faint whispers; be gracious to my infirmities, and 
    smile upon me. I ask salvation; listen you to my petitions, and save me. 
    Like one wounded and left for dead by my enemies, I need that you bend over 
    me and bind up my wounds. These mercies are asked on the plea of faith, and 
    they cannot, therefore, be denied.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. Be my strong habitation.</p></b> Permit me to enter 
    into you, and be as much at home as a man in his own house, and then allow 
    me to remain in you as my settled abode. Whereas foes molest me, I need a 
    dwelling framed and bulwarked, to sustain a siege and resist the attacks of 
    armies; let, then, your omnipotence secure me, and be as a fortress unto me.
    
<p align="justify">Here we see a weak man, but he is in a strong habitation; 
    his security rests upon the tower in which he hides, and is not placed in 
    jeopardy through his personal feebleness. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Whereunto I may continually resort.</p></b> Fast shut is this 
    castle against all adversaries, its gates they cannot burst open; the 
    drawbridge is up, the bars are fast in their places. But there is a secret 
    door, by which friends of the great Lord can enter at all hours of the day 
    or night, as often as ever they please. 
<p align="justify">There is never an hour when it is unlawful to pray. <i>
    Mercy's gates stand wide open</i>, and shall do so, until, at the last, the 
    Master of the house has risen up and shut to the door. <i>Believers find 
    their God to be their habitation, strong and accessible, and this is for 
    them a sufficient remedy for all the ills of their mortal life.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">You have given commandment to save me.</p></b> Nature is 
    charged to be tender with God's servants; Providence is ordered to work 
    their good, and the forces of the invisible world are ordained as their 
    guardians.
<p align="justify">David charged all his troops to spare the young man 
    Absalom, but yet he fell. God's commandment is of far higher virtue, for it 
    compels obedience, and secures its end. </p>
<p align="justify">Destruction cannot destroy us, famine cannot starve us; 
    but we laugh at both, while God's mandate shields us. No stones of the field 
    can throw us down, while angels bear us up in their hands; neither can the 
    beasts of the field devour us, while David's God delivers us from their 
    ferocity, or Daniel's God puts them in awe of us.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">For you are my rock and my fortress.</p></b> In God we have 
    all the security which nature which furnishes the rock, and art which builds 
    the fortress, could supply; he is the complete preserver of his people. <i>
    Immutability may be set forth by the rock, and omnipotence by the fortress</i>. 
    Happy is he who can use the personal pronoun "my"—not only once, but as many 
    times as the many aspects of the Lord may render desirable. 
<p align="justify">Is he a strong habitation? I will call him "my strong 
    habitation," and he shall be my rock, my fortress, my God (verse 4), my 
    hope, my trust (verse 5), my praise (verse 6). All my shall be his, all his 
    shall be mine. This was the reason why the psalmist was persuaded that God 
    had commanded his salvation, namely, because he had enabled his to exercise 
    a calm and appropriating faith.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the 
    wicked. </p></b>God is on the same side with us, and those who are our enemies 
    are also his, for they are wicked; therefore will the Lord surely rescue his 
    own confederates, and he will not allow the evil to triumph over the just.
    
<b>
<p align="justify">Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.</p></b> 
    Being wicked to God, they become unrighteous towards men, and cruel in their 
    persecutions of the godly. Two hands are here mentioned: they grasp and they 
    crush; they strike and they would slay if God did not prevent; had they a 
    hundred hands as Briarcus, the finger of God would more than match them.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. For you are my hope, O Lord God.</p></b> God who 
    gives us grace to hope in him, will assuredly fulfill our hope, and, 
    therefore, we may plead it in prayer. His name is "Jehovah, the hope of 
    Israel" (Jeremiah 17:13); and, as he cannot be a false or failing hope, we 
    may expect to see our confidence justified. 
<b>
<p align="justify">You are my trust from my youth. </p></b>David had proved his 
    faith by notable exploits when he was a youth and ruddy; it was to him a 
    cheering recollection, and he felt persuaded that the God of his youth would 
    not forsake him in his age. They are highly favored who can like David, 
    Samuel, Josiah, Timothy, and others say, "You are my trust from my youth."
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. By you have I been held up from the womb.</p></b> 
    Before he was able to understand the power which preserved him, he was 
    sustained by it. God knows us before we know anything. The elect of old lay 
    in the bosom of God before they were laid on their mothers' bosoms; and when 
    their infantile weakness had no feet strong enough to carry it, the Lord 
    upheld it. <i>We do well to reflect upon divine goodness to us in childhood, 
    for it is full of food for gratitude</i>. 
<b>
<p align="justify">You are he who took me out of my mother's womb.</p></b><i> 
    Even before conscious life, the care of God is over his chosen. </i>Birth is 
    a mystery of mercy, and God is with both mother and babe. If marriages are 
    registered in Heaven, we may be sure that births are also. Holy women do 
    well to bless God for his mercy to them in nature's perilous hour; but 
    everyone who is born of woman has equal cause for thankfulness. She, whose 
    life is preserved, should render thanks, and so should he whose life is 
    given. 
<b>
<p align="justify">My praise shall be continually of you.</p></b> Where goodness 
    has been unceasingly received, praise should unceasingly be offered. God is 
    the circle where praise should begin, continue, and endlessly revolve, since 
    in him we live, and move, and have our being.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. I am as a wonder unto many.</p></b> The saints are 
    men wondered at; often their dark side is gloomy even to amazement, while 
    their bright side is glorious even to astonishment. The believer is a 
    riddle, an enigma puzzling the unspiritual. He is a monster warring with 
    those delights of the flesh, which are the <i>all in all </i>of other men. 
    He is a prodigy, unaccountable to the judgments of ungodly men; a wonder 
    gazed at, feared, and, by and by, contemptuously derided. Few understand us, 
    many are surprised at us. 
<b>
<p align="justify">But you are my strong refuge. </p></b>Here is the answer to 
    our riddle. If we are strong, it is in God. If we are safe, our refuge 
    shelters us. If we are calm, our soul has found her stay in God. When faith 
    is understood, and the grounds of her confidence seen, the believer is no 
    longer a wonder; but the marvel is that so much unbelief remains among the 
    sons of men.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. Let my mouth be filled with your praise and with 
    your honor all the day.</p></b> What a blessed mouthful! A man never grows 
    nauseated though the flavor of it be all day in his mouth. God's bread is 
    always in our mouths, so should his praise be. 
<p align="justify">He fills us with good; let us be also filled with 
    gratitude. This would leave no room for murmuring or backbiting; therefore, 
    may we well join with holy David in this sacred wish.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. Cast me not off in the time of old age.</p></b> 
    David was not tired of his Master, and his only fear was lest his Master 
    should be tired of him. The Amalekite in the Bible history left his Egyptian 
    servant to famish when he grew old and sick, but not so the Lord of saints; 
    even to hoary hairs he bears and carries us. Alas for us, if we were 
    abandoned by our God, as many a courtier has been by his prince! 
<p align="justify">Old age robs us of personal beauty, and deprives us of 
    strength for active service; but it does not lower us in the love and favor 
    of God. An ungrateful country leaves its worn out defenders to starve upon a 
    scanty pittance, but the pensioners of Heaven are satisfied with good 
    things. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Forsake me not when my strength fails.</p></b> Bear with me, 
    and endure my infirmities. To be forsaken of God is the worst of all 
    conceivable ills, and if the believer can be but clear of that grievous 
    fear, he is happy: no saintly heart need be under any apprehension upon this 
    point.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. For my enemies speak against me. </p></b>Dogs howl 
    over a dying lion. When David's arm was able to chastise his foes, they were 
    yet impudent enough to slander him, and he fears that now they will take 
    fresh license in the hour of his weakness. 
<p align="justify">The text most properly means that his enemies had said 
    that God would forsake him; and, therefore, he is the more earnest that the 
    Lord's faithful dealings may give them the lie. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together.</p></b> 
    The psalmist had enemies, and these were most malicious; seeking his utter 
    destruction, they were very persevering, and stayed long upon the watch; to 
    this they added cunning, for they lay in ambush to surprise him, and take 
    him at a disadvantage; and all this they did with the utmost unanimity and 
    deliberation, neither spoiling their design by want of prudence, nor marring 
    its accomplishment by a lack of unity. The Lord our God is our only and all 
    sufficient resort from every form of persecution.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. Saying, God has forsaken him. </p></b>O bitter 
    taunt! There is no worse arrow in all the quivers of Hell. Our Lord felt 
    this barbed shaft, and it is no marvel if his disciples feel the same. Were 
    this exclamation the truth, it were indeed an ill day for us; but, glory be 
    to God, it is a barefaced lie. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Persecute and take him.</p></b> Let loose the dogs of 
    persecution upon him, seize him, worry him, <b>for there is none to deliver 
    him</b>. Down with him, for he has no friends. It is safe to insult him, for 
    none will come to his rescue. O cowardly boasts of a braggart foe, how do 
    you wound the soul of the believer: and only when his faith cries to his 
    Lord is he able to endure your cruelty.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. O God, be not far from me.</p></b> Nearness to God 
    is our conscious security. A child in the dark is comforted by grasping its 
    father's hand. 
<b>
<p align="justify">O my God, make haste for my help.</p></b> To call God <i>ours</i>, 
    as having entered into covenant with us, is a mighty plea in prayer, and a 
    great stay to our faith. The cry of "make haste" has occurred many times in 
    this portion of the Psalms, and it was evoked by the sore pressure of 
    affliction. Sharp sorrows soon put an end to procrastinating prayers.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. Let them be confounded and consumed that are 
    adversaries to my soul.</p></b> It will be all this to them to see your servant 
    preserved; their envy and malice, when disappointed, will fill them with 
    life consuming bitterness. The defeat of their plans shall baffle them, they 
    shall be confounded as they inquire the reason for their overthrow; the men 
    they seek to destroy seem so weak, and their cause so contemptible, that 
    they will be filled with amazement as they see them not only survive all 
    opposition, but even surmount it. 
<p align="justify">How confounded must Pharaoh have been when Israel 
    multiplied, despite his endeavors to exterminate the race. How consumed with 
    rage must the Scribes and Pharisees have become when they saw the gospel 
    spreading from land to land by the very means which they used for its 
    destruction. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor who seek 
    my hurt.</p></b> He would have their shame made visible to all eyes, by their 
    wearing it in their blushes as a mantle. They would have made a laughing 
    stock of the believer, if his God had forsaken him; therefore, let unbelief 
    and atheism be made a public scoffing in their people.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14.</p></b> The holy faith of the persecuted saint 
    comes to the front in these three verses. <b>But I will hope continually.
    </b>When I cannot rejoice in what I have, I will look forward to what shall 
    be mine, and will still rejoice. 
<p align="justify">Hope will live on a bare common, and sing on a branch 
    laden down with snow. No date and no place are unsuitable for hope. <i>Hell 
    alone excepted, hope is a dweller in all regions. </i>We may always hope, 
    for we always have grounds for it<i>. </i>We will always hope, for it is a 
    never failing consolation. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And will yet praise you more and more.</p></b> He was not 
    slack in thanksgiving; in fact, no man was ever more diligent in it. Yet he 
    was not content with all his former praises, but vowed to become more and 
    more a grateful worshiper. 
<p align="justify">When good things are both continual and progressive with 
    us, we are on the right tack. We ought not to be misers in doing good, and 
    our motto should be "more and more." While we do not disdain to "rest and be 
    thankful," we cannot settle down into resting in our thankfulness.</p>
<p align="justify">"Superior" cries the eagle, as he mounts towards the sun. 
    higher and yet higher is also our aim, as we soar aloft in duty and 
    devotion. It is our continual hope that we shall be able more and more to 
    magnify the Lord.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 15. My mouth shall show forth your righteousness 
    and your salvation all the day. </p></b>We are to bear testimony as experience 
    enables us, and not withhold from others that which we have tasted and 
    handled. The faithfulness of God in saving us, in delivering us out of the 
    hand of our enemies, and in fulfilling his promises—is to be everywhere 
    proclaimed by those who have proved it in their own history. 
<p align="justify">How gloriously conspicuous is righteousness in the divine 
    plan of redemption! It should be the theme of constant discourse. The devil 
    rages against the substitutionary sacrifice, and errorists of every form 
    make this the main point of their attack. Be it ours, therefore, to love the 
    doctrine, and to spread its glad tidings on every side, and at all times. 
    Mouths are never so usefully employed as in recounting the righteousness of 
    God revealed in the salvation of believers in Jesus. The preacher who should 
    be confined to this one theme would never need seek another: it is the very 
    pith and marrow of revealed truth. Has our reader been silent upon this 
    choice subject? Let us, then, press him to tell abroad what he enjoys 
    within: he does not well who keeps such glad tidings to himself. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">For I know not the numbers thereof.</p></b> He knew the 
    sweetness of it, the sureness, the glory, and the truth of it; but as to the 
    full reckoning of its plenitude, variety, and sufficiency, he felt he could 
    not reach to the height of the great argument. Lord, where I cannot count I 
    will believe, and when a truth surpasses numeration I will take to 
    admiration. 
<p align="justify">When David spoke of his enemies, he said they were more 
    in number than the hairs of his head; he had, therefore, some idea of their 
    number, and found a figure suitable to set it out. But, in the case of the 
    Lord's covenant mercies, he declares, "I know not the number," and does not 
    venture upon any sort of comparison. To creatures belong number and limit, 
    to God and his grace there is neither. We may, therefore, continue to tell 
    out his great salvation all day long, for the theme is utterly 
    inexhaustible.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 16. I will go in the strength of the Lord God.</p></b> 
    Our translators give us a good sense, but not the sense in this place, which 
    is on this wise, <i>"I will come with the mighty deeds of the Lord Jehovah."</i> 
    He would enter into those deeds by admiring study, and then, wherever he 
    went, he would continue to rehearse them. He should ever be a welcome guest 
    who can tell us of the mighty acts of the Lord, and help us to put our trust 
    in him. 
<p align="justify">The authorised version may be used by us as a resolve in 
    all our exertions and endeavors. In our own strength we must fail; but, when 
    we hear the voice which says, "Go in the strength of the Lord God," we may 
    advance without fear. Though Hell itself were in the way, the believer would 
    pursue the path of duty, crying:<b> I will go in the strength of the Lord 
    God: I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours alone. </b></p>

<p align="justify">Man's righteousness is not fit to be mentioned—filthy 
    rags are best hidden; neither is there any righteousness under Heaven, or in 
    Heaven, comparable to the divine. As God himself fills all space, and is, 
    therefore, the only God, leaving no room for another—so God's righteousness, 
    in Christ Jesus, fills the believer's soul, and he counts all other things 
    but dross and dung "that he may win Christ, and be found in him, not having 
    his own righteousness which is of the law, but the righteousness which is of 
    God by faith."</p>
<p align="justify">What would be the use of speaking upon any other 
    righteousness to a dying man? and all are dying men. Let those who will cry 
    up man's natural innocence, the dignity of the race, the purity of 
    philosophers, the loveliness of untutored savages, the power of sacraments, 
    and the infallibility of pontiffs; this is the true believer's immovable 
    resolve<i>: "I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours 
    alone." </i>Forever dedicated to you, my Lord, be this poor, unworthy 
    tongue, whose glory it shall be to glorify you.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 17. O God, you have taught me from my youth. </p></b>It 
    was comfortable to the psalmist to remember that from his earliest days he 
    had been the Lord's disciple. None are too young to be taught of God, and 
    they make the most proficient scholars who begin early.
<b>
<p align="justify">And hitherto have I declared your wondrous works. </p></b>He 
    had learned to tell what he knew, he was a pupil teacher; he continued still 
    learning and declaring, and did not renounce his first master. This, also, 
    was his comfort, but it is one which those who have been seduced from the 
    school of the gospel, into the various colleges of philosophy and 
    skepticism, will not be able to enjoy. A sacred conservatism is much needed 
    in these days, when men are giving up old lights for new. We mean both to 
    learn and to teach the wonders of redeeming love, until we can discover 
    something nobler or more soul-satisfying; for this reason <i>we hope that 
    our gray heads will be found in the same road as we have trodden, even from 
    our beardless youth</i>.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 18. Now also when I am old and grey headed, O God, 
    forsake me not.</p></b> There is something touching in the sight of hair 
    whitened with the snows of many a winter. The old and faithful soldier 
    receives consideration from his king, the venerable servant is beloved by 
    his master. When our infirmities multiply, we may, with confidence, expect 
    enlarged privileges in the world of grace, to make up for our narrowing 
    range in the field of nature. Nothing shall make God forsake those who have 
    not forsaken him. Our fear is lest he should do so; but his promise kisses 
    that fear into silence.
<b>
<p align="justify">Until I have showed your strength unto this generation.</p></b> 
    He desired to continue his testimony and complete it; he had respect to the 
    young men and little children about him, and knowing the vast importance of 
    training them in the fear of God, he longed to make them all acquainted with 
    the power of God to support his people, that they also might be led to walk 
    by faith. He had leaned on the almighty arm, and could speak <i>
    experimentally </i>of its all sufficiency, and longed to do so before life 
    came to a close. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And your power to every one that is to come.</p></b> He would 
    leave a record for unborn ages to read. He thought the Lord's power to be so 
    worthy of praise, that he would make the ages ring with it until time should 
    be no more. For this cause believers live, and they should take care to 
    labor zealously for the accomplishment of this their most proper and 
    necessary work. <i>Blessed are they who begin in youth to proclaim the name 
    of the Lord, and cease not until their last hour brings their last word for 
    their divine Master.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 19. Your righteousness also, O God, is very high.</p></b> 
    Very sublime, unsearchable, exalted, and glorious is the holy character of 
    God, and his way of making men righteous. His plan of righteousness uplifts 
    men from the gates of Hell to the mansions of Heaven. It is a high doctrine 
    gospel, gives a high experience, leads to high practice, and ends in high 
    felicity! 
<b>
<p align="justify">Who have done great things.</p></b> The exploits of others 
    are mere child's play compared with yours, and are not worthy to be 
    mentioned in the same age. <i>Creation, providence, redemption, are all 
    unique, and nothing can compare with them.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">O God, who is like unto you.</p></b> As your works are so 
    transcendent, so are you. You are without compeer, or even second, and such 
    are your works, and such, especially, your plan of justifying sinners by the 
    righteousness which you have provided. 
<i>
<p align="justify">Adoration is a fit frame of mind for the believer. </p></i>
    When he draws near to God, he enters into a region where everything is 
    surpassingly sublime; miracles of love abound on every hand, and marvels of 
    mingled justice and grace. 
<p align="justify">A traveler among the high Alps often feels overwhelmed 
    with awe, amid their amazing sublimities; much more is this the case when we 
    survey the heights and depths of the mercy and holiness of the Lord. O God, 
    who is like unto you!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 20. You, which have showed me great and sore 
    troubles, shall quicken me again. </p></b>Here is faith's inference from the 
    infinite greatness of the Lord. He has been strong to smite—he will be also 
    strong to save. He has shown me many heavy and severe trials—and he will 
    also show me many and precious mercies. He has almost killed me—he will 
    speedily revive me. 
<p align="justify">Though I have been almost dead and buried, he will give 
    me a resurrection, <b>and bring me up again from the depths of the earth</b>. 
    However low the Lord may permit us to sink, he will fix a limit to the 
    descent, and in due time will bring us up again. </p>
<p align="justify">Even when we are laid low in the tomb, the mercy is that 
    we can go no lower, but shall retrace our steps and mount to better lands; 
    and all this, because the Lord is ever mighty to save.<i> A little God would 
    fail us, but not Jehovah the Omnipotent. It is safe to lean on him, since he 
    bears up the pillars both of Heaven and earth.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 21. You shall increase my greatness. </p></b>As a king, 
    David grew in influence and power. God did great things for him, and by him, 
    and this is all the greatness believers want. May we have faith in God, such 
    as these words evince. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And comfort me on every side. </p></b>As we were surrounded 
    with afflictions—so shall we be environed with consolations. From above, and 
    from all around, light shall come to dispel our former gloom; the change 
    shall be great, indeed, when the Lord returns to comfort us. 
<p align="justify">Here is the final vow of praise.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 22. I will also praise you with the harp.</p></b><i> 
    Love so amazing calls for sweetest praise. </i>David would give his best 
    music, both vocal and instrumental, to the Best of Masters. His harp should 
    not be silent, nor his voice. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Even your truth, O my God. </p></b>This is ever a most 
    enchanting attribute—namely, the truth or faithfulness of our covenant God. 
    On this we rest, and from it we draw streams of richest consolation.<i> His 
    promises are sure, his love is unalterable, his veracity is indisputable.
    </i>What saint will not praise him as he remembers this? 
<b>
<p align="justify">Unto you will I sing with the harp, O you Holy One of 
    Israel.</p></b> Here is a new name, and, as it were, a new song. The Holy One of 
    Israel is at once a lofty and an endearing name, full of teaching. Let us 
    resolve, by all means within our power, to honor him. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 23. My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto 
    you.</p></b> It shall be no weariness to me to praise you. It shall be a 
    delightful recreation, a solace, a joy. The essence of song lies in the holy 
    joy of the singer. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And my soul, which you have redeemed. </p></b><i>Soul singing 
    is the soul of singing</i>. Until men are redeemed, they are like 
    instruments out of tune; but when once the precious blood has set them at 
    liberty, then are they fitted to magnify the Lord who bought them. Our being 
    bought with a price is a more than sufficient reason for our dedicating 
    ourselves to the earnest worship of God our Savior. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 24. My tongue also shall talk of your righteousness 
    all the day long.</p></b> I will talk to myself, and to you, my God, and to my 
    fellow men: my theme shall be your way of justifying sinners, the glorious 
    display of your righteousness and grace in your dear Son; and this most 
    fresh and never to be exhausted subject shall be ever with me, from the 
    rising of the sun to the going down of the same. 
<p align="justify">Others talk of their beloveds, and they shall be made to 
    hear of mine. I will become an incessant talker, while this matter lies on 
    my heart, for in all company this subject will be in season.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">For they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, 
    that seek my hurt. </p></b>As in many other Psalms, the concluding stanzas speak 
    of that as an accomplished fact, which was only requested in former verses. 
    Faith believes that she has her request, and she has it. She is the 
    substance of things hoped for—a substance so real and tangible, that it sets 
    the glad soul singing. Already <i>sin</i>, <i>Satan</i>, and the <i>world
    </i>are vanquished, and the victory is ours.
<p align="justify">"Sin, Satan, Death appear<br/>
    To harass and appal:<br/>
    Yet since the gracious Lord is near,<br/>
    Backward they go, and fall."</p>
<p align="justify">"We meet them face to face,<br/>
    Through Jesus' conquest blessed;<br/>
    March in the triumph of his grace,<br/>
    Right onward to our rest."</p>
