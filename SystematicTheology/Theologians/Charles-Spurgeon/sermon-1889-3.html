        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.2078)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, April 7th, 1889,</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy
          kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt
          thou be with me in paradise.| -- Luke 23:42-43.
        </p>
        <p>
          SOME TIME AGO I preached upon the whole story of the dying thief. I do
          not propose to do the same to-day, but only to look at it from one
          particular point of view. The story of the salvation of the dying
          thief is a standing instance of the power of Christ to save, and of
          his abundant willingness to receive all that come to him, in whatever
          plight they may be. I cannot regard this act of grace as a solitary
          instance, any more than the salvation of Zacchaeus, the restoration of
          Peter, or the call of Saul, the persecutor. Every conversion is, in a
          sense, singular: no two are exactly alike, and yet any one conversion
          is a type of others. The case of the dying thief is much more similar
          to our conversion than it is dissimilar; in point of fact, his case
          may be regarded as typical, rather than as an extraordinary incident.
          So I shall use it at this time. May the Holy Spirit speak through it
          to the encouragement of those who are ready to despair!
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, beloved friends, that our Lord Jesus, at the time he saved
          this malefactor, was at his lowest. His glory had been ebbing out in
          Gethsemane, and before Caiaphas, and Herod, and Pilate; but it had now
          reached the utmost low-water mark. Stripped of his garments, and
          nailed to the cross, our Lord was mocked by a ribald crowd, and was
          dying in agony: then was he |numbered with the transgressors,| and
          made as the offscouring of all things. Yet, while in that condition,
          he achieved this marvellous deed of grace. Behold the wonder wrought
          by the Saviour when emptied of all his glory, and hanged up a
          spectacle of shame upon the brink of death! How certain is it it that
          he can do great wonders of mercy now, seeing that he has returned unto
          his glory, and sitteth upon the throne of light! |He is able to save
          them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth
          to make intercession for them.| If a dying Saviour saved the thief, my
          argument is, that he can do even more now that he liveth and reigneth.
          All power is given unto him in heaven and in earth; can anything at
          this present time surpass the power of his grace?
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not only the weakness of our Lord which makes the salvation of
          the penitent thief memorable; it is the fact that the dying malefactor
          saw it before his very eyes. Can you put yourself into his place, and
          suppose yourself to be looking upon one who hangs in agony upon a
          cross? Could you readily believe him to be the Lord of glory, who
          would soon come to his kingdom? That was no mean faith which, at such
          a moment, could believe in Jesus as Lord and King. If the apostle Paul
          were here, and wanted to add a New Testament chapter to the eleventh
          of Hebrews, he might certainly commence his instances of remarkable
          faith with this thief, who believed in a crucified, derided, and dying
          Christ, and cried to him as to one whose kingdom would surely come.
          The thief's faith was the more remarkable because he was himself in
          great pain, and bound to die. It is not easy to exercise confidence
          when you are tortured with deadly anguish. Our own rest of mind has at
          times been greatly hindered by pain of body. When we are the subjects
          of acute suffering it is not easy to exhibit that faith which we fancy
          we possess at other times. This man, suffering as he did, and seeing
          the Saviour in so sad a state, nevertheless believed unto life
          eternal. Herein was such faith as is seldom seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recollect, also, that he was surrounded by scoffers. It is easy to
          swim with the current, and hard to go against the stream. This man
          heard the priests, in their pride, ridicule the Lord, and the great
          multitude of the common people, with one consent, joined in the
          scorning; his comrade caught the spirit of the hour, and mocked also,
          and perhaps he did the same for a while; but through the grace of God
          he was changed, and believed in the Lord Jesus in the teeth of all the
          scorn. His faith was not affected by his surroundings; but he, dying
          thief as he was, made sure his confidence. Like a jutting rock,
          standing out in the midst of a torrent, he declared the innocence of
          the Christ whom others blasphemed. His faith is worthy of our
          imitation in its fruits. He had no member that was free except his
          tongue, and he used that member wisely to rebuke his brother
          malefactor, and defend his Lord. His faith brought forth a brave
          testimony and a bold confession. I am not going to praise the thief,
          or his faith, but to extol the glory of that grace divine which gave
          the thief such faith, and then freely saved him by its means. I am
          anxious to show how glorious is the Saviour -- that Saviour to the
          uttermost, who, at such a time, could save such a man, and give him so
          great a faith, and so perfectly and speedily prepare him for eternal
          bliss. Behold the power of that divine Spirit who could produce such
          faith on soil so unlikely, and in a climate so unpropitious.
        </p>

          Let us enter at once into the centre of our sermon. First, note the
          man who was our Lord's last companion on earth; secondly, note that
          this same man was our Lord's first companion at the gate of paradise;
          and then, thirdly, let us note the sermon which our Lord preaches to
          us from this act of grace. Oh, for a blessing from the Holy Spirit all
          the sermon through!
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Carefully NOTE THAT THE CRUCIFIED THIEF WAS OUR LORD'S LAST
          COMPANION ON EARTH. What sorry company our Lord selected when he was
          here! He did not consort with the religious Pharisees or the
          philosophic Sadducees, but he was known as |the friend of publicans
          and sinners.| How I rejoice at this! It gives me assurance that he
          will not refuse to associate with me. When the Lord Jesus made a
          friend of me, he certainly did not make a choice which brought him
          credit. Do you think he gained any honour when he made a friend of
          you? Has he ever gained anything by us? No, my brethren; if Jesus had
          not stooped very low, he would not have come to me; and if he did not
          seek the most unworthy, he might not have come to you. You feel it so,
          and you are thankful that he came |not to call the righteous, but
          sinners to repentance.| As the great physician, our Lord was much with
          the sick: he went where there was room for him to exercise his healing
          art. The whole have no need of a physician: they cannot appreciate
          him, nor afford scope for his skill; and therefore he did not frequent
          their abodes. Yes, after all, our Lord did make a good choice when he
          saved you and me; for in us he has found abundant room for his mercy
          and grace. There has been elbow room for his love to work within the
          awful emptiness of our necessities and sins; and therein he has done
          great things for us, whereof we are glad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lest any here should be despairing, and say, |He will never deign to
          look on me,| I want you to notice that the last companion of Christ on
          earth was a sinner, and no ordinary sinner. He had broken even the
          laws of man, for he was a robber. One calls him |a brigand|; and I
          suppose it is likely to have been the case. The brigands of those days
          mixed murder with their robberies: he was probably a freebooter in
          arms against the Roman government, making this a pretext for
          plundering as he had opportunity. At last he was arrested, and was
          condemned by a Roman tribunal, which, on the whole, was usually just,
          and in this case was certainly just; for he himself confesses the
          justice of his condemnation. The malefactor who believed upon the
          cross was a convict, who had lain in the condemned cell, and was then
          undergoing execution for his crimes. A convicted felon was the person
          with whom our Lord last consorted upon earth. What a lover of the
          souls of guilty men is he! What a stoop he makes to the very lowest of
          mankind! To this most unworthy of men the Lord of glory, ere he
          quitted life, spoke with matchless grace. He spoke to him such
          wondrous words as never can be excelled if you search the Scriptures
          through: |To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.| I do not suppose
          that anywhere in this Tabernacle there will be found a man who has
          been convicted before the law, or who is even chargeable with a crime
          against common honesty; but if there should be such a person among my
          hearers, I would invite him to find pardon and change of heart through
          our Lord Jesus Christ. You may come to him, whoever you may be; for
          this man did. Here is a specimen of one who had gone to the extreme of
          guilt, and who acknowledged that he had done so; he made no excuse,
          and sought no cloak for his sin; he was in the hands of justice,
          confronted with the death-doom, and yet he believed in Jesus, and
          breathed a humble prayer to him, and he was saved upon the spot. As is
          the sample, such is the bulk. Jesus saves others of like kind. Let me,
          therefore, put it very plainly here, that none may mistake me. None of
          you are excluded from the infinite mercy of Christ, however great your
          iniquity: if you believe in Jesus, he will save you.
        </p>
        <p>
          This man was not only a sinner; he was a sinner newly awakened. I do
          not suppose that he had seriously thought of the Lord Jesus before.
          According to the other Evangelists, he appears to have joined with his
          fellow thief in scoffing at Jesus: if he did not actually himself use
          opprobrious words, he was so far consenting thereunto, that the
          Evangelist did him no injustice when he said, |The thieves also, which
          were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.| Yet, now, on a
          sudden, he wakes up to the conviction that the man who is dying at his
          side is something more than a man. He reads the title over his head,
          and believes it to be true -- |This is Jesus the King of the Jews.|
          Thus believing, he makes his appeal to the Messiah, whom he had so
          newly found, and commits himself to his hands. My hearer, do you see
          this truth, that the moment a man knows Jesus to be the Christ of God
          he may at once put his trust in him and be saved? A certain preacher,
          whose gospel was very doubtful, said, |Do you, who have been living in
          sin for fifty years, believe that you can in a moment be made clean
          through the blood of Jesus?| I answer, |Yes, we do believe that in one
          moment, through the precious blood of Jesus, the blackest soul can be
          made white. We do believe that in a single instant the sins of sixty
          or seventy years can be absolutely forgiven, and that the old nature,
          which has gone on growing worse and worse, can receive its death-wound
          in a moment of time, while the life eternal may be implanted in the
          soul at once.| It was so with this man. He had reached the end of his
          tether, but all of a sudden he woke up to the assured conviction that
          the Messiah was at his side, and, believing, he looked to him and
          lived.
        </p>
        <p>
          So now, my brothers, if you have never in your life before been the
          subject of any religious conviction, if you have lived up till now an
          utterly ungodly life, yet if now you will believe that God's dear Son
          has come into the world to save men from sin, and will unfeignedly
          confess your sin and trust in him, you shall be immediately saved. Ay,
          while I speak the word, the deed of grace may be accomplished by that
          glorious One who has gone up into the heaven with omnipotent power to
          save.
        </p>
        <p>
          I desire to put this case very plainly: this man, who was the last
          companion of Christ upon earth, was a sinner in misery. His sins had
          found him out: he was now enduring the reward of his deeds. I
          constantly meet with persons in this condition: they have lived a life
          of wantonness, excess, and carelessness, and they begin to feel the
          fire-flakes of the tempest of wrath falling upon their flesh; they
          dwell in an earthly hell, a prelude of eternal woe. Remorse, like an
          asp, has stung them, and set their blood on fire: they cannot rest,
          they are troubled day and night. |Be sure your sin will find you out.|
          It has found them out, and arrested them, and they feel the strong
          grip of conviction. This man was in that horrible condition: what is
          more, he was in extremis. He could not live long: the crucifixion was
          sure to be fatal; in a short time his legs would be broken, to end his
          wretched existence. He, poor soul, had but a short time to live --
          only the space between noon and sundown; but it was long enough for
          the Saviour, who is mighty to save. Some are very much afraid that
          people will put off coming to Christ, if we state this. I cannot help
          what wicked men do with truth, but I shall state it all the same. If
          you are now within an hour of death, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,
          and you shall be saved. If you never reach your homes again, but drop
          dead on the road, if you will now believe in the Lord Jesus, you shall
          be saved: saved now, on the spot. Looking and trusting to Jesus, he
          will give you a new heart and a right spirit, and blot out your sins.
          This is the glory of Christ's grace. How I wish I could extol it in
          proper language! He was last seen on earth before his death in company
          with a convicted felon, to whom he spoke most lovingly. Come, O ye
          guilty, and he will receive you graciously!
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, this man whom Christ saved at last was a man who could do
          no good works. If salvation had been by good works, he could not have
          been saved; for he was fastened hand and foot to the tree of doom. It
          was all over with him as to any act or deed of righteousness. He could
          say a good word or two, but that was all; he could perform no acts;
          and if his salvation had depended on an active life of usefulness,
          certainly he never could have been saved. He was a sinner also, who
          could not exhibit a long-enduring repentance for sin, for he had so
          short a time to live. He could not have experienced bitter
          convictions, lasting over months and years, for his time was measured
          by moments, and he was on the borders of the grave. His end was very
          near, and yet the Saviour could save him, and did save him so
          perfectly, that the sun went not down till he was in paradise with
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          This sinner, whom I have painted to you in colours none too black, was
          one who believed in Jesus, and confessed his faith. He did trust the
          Lord. Jesus was a man, and he called him so; but he knew that he was
          also Lord, and he called him so, and said, |Lord, remember me.| He had
          such confidence in Jesus, that, if he would but only think of him, if
          he would only remember him when he came into his kingdom, that would
          be all that he would ask of him. Alas, my dear hearers! the trouble
          about some of you is that you know all about my Lord, and yet you do
          not trust him. Trust is the saving act. Years ago you were on the
          verge of really trusting Jesus, but you are just as far off from it
          now as you were then. This man did not hesitate: he grasped the one
          hope for himself. He did not keep his persuasion of our Lord's
          Messiahship in his mind as a dry, dead belief, but he turned it into
          trust and prayer, |Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy
          kingdom.| Oh, that in his infinite mercy many of you would trust my
          Lord this morning! You shall be saved, I am sure you shall: if you are
          not saved when you trust, I must myself also renounce all hope. This
          is all that we have done: we looked, and we lived, and we continue to
          live because we look to the living Saviour. Oh, that this morning,
          feeling your sin, you would look to Jesus, trusting him, and
          confessing that trust! Owning that he is Lord to the glory of God the
          Father, you must and shall be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          In consequence of having this faith which saved him, this poor man
          breathed the humble but fitting prayer, |Lord, remember me.| This does
          not seem to ask much; but as he understood it, it meant all that an
          anxious heart could desire. As he thought of the kingdom, he had such
          clear ideas of the glory of the Saviour, that he felt that if the Lord
          would think of him his eternal state would be safe. Joseph, in prison,
          asked the chief butler to remember him when he was restored to power;
          but he forgat him. Our Joseph never forgets a sinner who cried to him
          in the low dungeon; in his kingdom he remembers the moanings and
          groanings of poor sinners who are burdened with a sense of sin. Can
          you not pray this morning, and thus secure a place in the memory of
          the Lord Jesus?
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have tried to describe the man; and, after having done my best,
          I shall fail of my object unless I make you see that whatever this
          thief was, he is a picture of what you are. Especially if you have
          been a great offender, and if you have been living long without caring
          for eternal things, you are like that malefactor; and yet you, even
          you, may do as that thief did; you may believe that Jesus is the
          Christ, and commit your souls into his hands, and he will save you as
          surely as he saved the condemned brigand. Jesus graciously says, |Him
          that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.| This means that if you
          come and trust him, whoever you may be, he will for no reason, and on
          no ground, and under no circumstances, ever cast you out. Do you catch
          that thought? Do you feel that it belongs to you, and that if you come
          to him, you shall find eternal life? I rejoice if you so far perceive
          the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Few persons have so much intercourse with desponding and despairing
          souls as I have. Poor cast down ones write to me continually. I scarce
          know why. I have no special gift of consolation, but I gladly lay
          myself out to comfort the distressed, and they seem to know it. What
          joy I have when I see a despairing one find peace! I have had this joy
          several times during the week just ended. How much I desire that any
          of you who are breaking your hearts because you cannot find
          forgiveness would come to my Lord, and trust him, and enter into rest!
          Has he not said, |Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy
          laden, and I will give you rest|? Come and try him, and that rest
          shall be yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. In the second place, NOTE, THAT THIS MAN WAS OUR LORD'S COMPANION
          AT THE GATE OF PARADISE. I am not going into any speculations as to
          where our Lord went when he quitted the body which hung on the cross.
          It would seem, from some Scriptures, that he descended into the lower
          parts of the earth, that he might fill all things. But he very rapidly
          traversed the regions of the dead. Remember that he died, perhaps an
          hour or two before the thief, and during that time the eternal glory
          flamed through the underworld, and was flashing through the gates of
          paradise just when the pardoned thief was entering the eternal world.
          Who is this that entereth the pearl-gate at the same moment as the
          King of glory? Who is this favoured companion of the Redeemer? Is it
          some honoured martyr? Is it a faithful apostle? Is it a patriarch,
          like Abraham; or a prince, like David? It is none of these. Behold,
          and be amazed at sovereign grace. He that goeth in at the gate of
          paradise, with the King of glory, is a thief, who was saved in the
          article of death. He is saved in no inferior way, and received into
          bliss in no secondary style. Verily, there are last which shall be
          first!
        </p>
        <p>
          Here I would have you notice the condescension of our Lord's choice.
          The comrade of the Lord of glory, for whom the cherub turns aside his
          sword of fire, is no great one, but a newly-converted malefactor. And
          why? I think the Saviour took him with him as a specimen of what he
          meant to do. He seemed to say to all the heavenly powers, |I bring a
          sinner with me; he is a sample of the rest.| Have you never heard of
          him who dreamed that he stood without the gate of heaven, and while
          there he heard sweet music from a band of venerable persons who were
          on their way to glory? They entered the celestial portals, and there
          were great rejoicing and shouts. Enquiring |What are these?| he was
          told that they were the goodly fellowship of the prophets. He sighed,
          and said, |Alas! I am not one of those.| He waited a while, and
          another band of shining ones drew nigh, who also entered heaven with
          hallelujahs, and when he enquired, |Who are these, and whence came
          they?| the answer was, |These are the glorious company of the
          apostles.| Again he sighed, and said, |I cannot enter with them.| Then
          came another body of men white-robed, and bearing palms in their
          hands, who marched amid great acclamation into the golden city. These
          he learned were the noble army of martyrs; and again he wept, and
          said, |I cannot enter with these.| In the end he heard the voices of
          much people, and saw a greater multitude advancing, among whom he
          perceived Rahab and Mary Magdalene, David and Peter, Manasseh and Saul
          of Tarsus, and he espied especially the thief, who died at the right
          hand of Jesus. These all entered in -- a strange company. Then he
          eagerly enquired, |Who are these?| and they answered, |This is the
          host of sinners saved by grace.| Then was he exceeding glad, and said,
          |I can go with these.| Yet, he thought there would be no shouting at
          the approach of this company, and that they would enter heaven without
          song; instead of which, there seemed to rise a seven-fold hallelujah
          of praise unto the Lord of love; for there is joy in the presence of
          the angels of God over sinners that repent.
        </p>
        <p>
          I invite any poor soul here that can neither aspire to serve Christ,
          nor to suffer for him as yet, nevertheless to come in with other
          believing sinners, in the company of Jesus, who now sets before us an
          open door.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we are handling this text, note well the blessedness of the
          place to which the Lord called this penitent. Jesus said, |To day
          shalt thou be with me in paradise.| Paradise means a garden, a garden
          filled with delights. The garden of Eden is the type of heaven. We
          know that paradise means heaven, for the apostle speaks of such a man
          caught up into paradise, and anon he calls it the third heaven. Our
          Saviour took this dying thief into the paradise of infinite delight,
          and this is where he will take all of us sinners who believe in him.
          If we are trusting him, we shall ultimately be with him in paradise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next word is better still. Note the glory of the society to which
          this sinner is introduced: |To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.|
          If the Lord said, |To day shalt thou be with me,| we should not need
          him to add another word; for where he is, is heaven to us. He added
          the word |paradise,| because else none could have guessed where he was
          going. Think of it, you uncomely soul; you are to dwell with the
          Altogether-lovely One for ever. You poor and needy ones, you are to be
          with him in his glory, in his bliss, in his perfection. Where he is,
          and as he is, you shall be. The Lord looks into those weeping eyes of
          yours this morning, and he says, |Poor sinner, thou shalt one day be
          with me.| I think I hear you say, |Lord, that is bliss too great for
          such a sinner as I am|; but he replies -- I have loved thee with an
          everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness will I draw thee, till
          thou shalt be with me where I am.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stress of the text lies in the speediness of all this. |Verily I
          say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.| |To day.|
          Thou shalt not lie in purgatory for ages, nor sleep in limbo for so
          many years; but thou shalt be ready for bliss at once, and at once
          thou shalt enjoy it. The sinner was hard by the gates of hell, but
          almighty mercy lifted him up, and the Lord said, |To day shalt thou be
          with me in paradise.| What a change from the cross to the crown, from
          the anguish of Calvary to the glory of the New Jerusalem! In those few
          hours the beggar was lifted from the dunghill and set among princes.
          |To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.| Can you measure the change
          from that sinner, loathsome in his iniquity, when the sun was high at
          noon, to that same sinner, clothed in pure white, and accepted in the
          Beloved, in the paradise of God, when the sun went down? O glorious
          Saviour, what marvels thou canst work! How rapidly canst thou work
          them!
        </p>
        <p>
          Please notice, also, the majesty of the Lord's grace in this text. The
          Saviour said to him, |Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be
          with me in paradise.| Our Lord gives his own will as the reason for
          saving this man. |I say.| He says it who claims the right thus to
          speak. It is he who will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and
          will have compassion on whom he will have compassion. He speaks
          royally, |Verily I say unto thee.| Are they not imperial words? The
          Lord is a King in whose word there is power. What he says none can
          gainsay. He that hath the keys of hell and of death saith, |I say unto
          thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.| Who shall prevent the
          fulfilment of his word?
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice the certainty of it. He says, |Verily.| Our blessed Lord on the
          cross returned to his old majestic manner, as he painfully turned his
          head, and looked on his convert. He was wont to begin his preaching
          with, |Verily, verily, I say unto you|; and now that he is dying he
          uses his favourite manner, and says, |Verily.| Our Lord took no oath;
          his strongest asseveration was, |Verily, verily.| To give the penitent
          the plainest assurance, he says, |Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt
          thou be with me in paradise.| In this he had an absolutely
          indisputable assurance that though he must die, yet he would live and
          find himself in paradise with his Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have thus shown you that our Lord passed within the pearly gate in
          company with one to whom he had pledged himself. Why should not you
          and I pass through that pearl-gate in due time, clothed in his merit,
          washed in his blood, resting on his power? One of these days angels
          will say of you, and of me, |Who is this that cometh up from the
          wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?| The shining ones will be amazed
          to see some of us coming. If you have lived a life of sin until now,
          and yet shall repent and enter heaven, what an amazement there will be
          in every golden street to think that you have come there! In the early
          Christian church Marcus Caius Victorinus was converted; but he had
          reached so great an age, and had been so gross a sinner, that the
          pastor and church doubted him. He gave, however, clear proof of having
          undergone the divine change, and then there were great acclamations,
          and many shouts of |Victorinus has become a Christian!| Oh, that some
          of you big sinners might be saved! How gladly would we rejoice over
          you! Why not? Would it not glorify God? The salvation of this
          convicted highwayman has made our Lord illustrious for mercy even unto
          this day; would not your case do the same? Would not saints cry,
          |Hallelujah! hallelujah!| if they heard that some of you had been
          turned from darkness to marvellous light? Why should it not be?
          Believe in Jesus, and it is so.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now I come to my third and most practical point: NOTE THE LORD'S
          SERMON TO US FROM ALL THIS.
        </p>
        <p>
          The devil wants to preach this morning a bit. Yes, Satan asks to come
          to the front and preach to you; but he cannot be allowed. Avaunt, thou
          deceiver! Yet I should not wander if he gets at certain of you when
          the sermon is over, and whispers, |You see you can be saved at the
          very last. Put off repentance and faith; you may be forgiven on your
          death-bed.| Sirs, you know who it is that would ruin you by this
          suggestion. Abhor his deceitful teaching. Do not be ungrateful because
          God is kind. Do not provoke the Lord because he is patient. Such
          conduct would be unworthy and ungrateful. Do not run an awful risk
          because one escaped the tremendous peril. The Lord will accept all who
          repent; but how do you know that you will repent? It is true that one
          thief was saved -- but the other thief was lost. One is saved, and we
          may not despair; the other is lost, and we may not presume. Dear
          friends, I trust you are not made of such diabolical stuff as to fetch
          from the mercy of God an argument for continuing in sin. If you do, I
          can only say of you, your damnation will be just; you will have
          brought it upon yourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider now the teaching of our Lord; see the glory of Christ in
          salvation. He is ready to save at the last moment. He was just passing
          away; his foot was on the doorstep of the Father's house. Up comes
          this poor sinner the last thing at night, at the eleventh hour, and
          the Saviour smiles and declares that he will not enter except with
          this belated wanderer. At the very gate he declares that this seeking
          soul shall enter with him. There was plenty of time for him to have
          come before: you know how apt we are to say, |You have waited to the
          last moment. I am just going off, and I cannot attend to you now.| Our
          Lord had his dying pangs upon him, and yet he attends to the perishing
          criminal, and permits him to pass through the heavenly portal in his
          company. Jesus easily saves the sinners for whom he painfully died.
          Jesus loves to rescue sinners from going down into the pit. You will
          be very happy if you are saved, but you will not be one half so happy
          as he will be when he saves you. See how gentle he is!
        </p>
        <p>|His hand no thunder bears,</p>
        <p>No terror clothes his brow;</p>
        <p>No bolts to drive our guilty souls</p>
        <p>To fiercer flames below.|</p>
        <p>
          He comes to us full of tenderness, with tears in his eyes, mercy in
          his hands, and love in his heart. Believe him to be a great Saviour of
          great sinners. I have heard of one who had received great mercy who
          went about saying, |He is a great forgiver;| and I would have you say
          the same. You shall find your transgressions put away, and your sins
          pardoned once for all, if you now trust him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next doctrine Christ preaches from this wonderful story is faith
          in its permitted attachment. This man believed that Jesus was the
          Christ. The next thing he did was to appropriate that Christ. He said,
          |Lord, remember me.| Jesus might have said, |What have I to do with
          you, and what have you to do with me? What has a thief to do with the
          perfect One?| Many of you, good people, try to get as far away as you
          can from the erring and fallen. They might infect your innocence!
          Society claims that we should not be familiar with people who have
          offended against its laws. We must not be seen associating with them,
          for it might discredit us. Infamous bosh! Can anything discredit
          sinners such as we are by nature and by practice? If we know ourselves
          before God we are degraded enough in and of ourselves? Is there
          anybody, after all, in the world, who is worse than we are when we see
          ourselves in the faithful glass of the Word? As soon as ever a man
          believes that Jesus is the Christ, let him hook himself on to him. The
          moment you believe Jesus to be the Saviour, seize upon him as your
          Saviour. If I remember rightly, Augustine called this man, |Latro
          laudabilis et mirabilis,| a thief to be praised and wondered at, who
          dared, as it were, to seize the Saviour for his own. In this he is to
          be imitated. Take the Lord to be yours, and you have him. Jesus is the
          common property of all sinners who make bold to take him. Every sinner
          who has the will to do so may take the Lord home with him. He came
          into the world to save the sinful. Take him by force, as robbers take
          their prey; for the kingdom of heaven suffereth the violence of daring
          faith. Get him, and he will never get himself away from you. If you
          trust him, he must save you.
        </p>
        <p>Next, notice the doctrine of faith in its immediate power.</p>
        <p>|The moment a sinner believes,</p>
        <p>And trusts in his crucified God,</p>
        <p>His pardon at once he receives,</p>
        <p>Redemption in full through his blood.|</p>
        <p>
          |To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.| He has no sooner believed
          than Christ gives him the seal of his believing in the full assurance
          that he shall be with him for ever in his glory. O dear hearts, if you
          believe this morning, you shall be saved this morning! God grant that
          you, by his rich grace, may be brought into salvation here, on the
          spot, and at once!
        </p>
        <p>
          The next thing is, the nearness of eternal things. Think of that a
          minute. Heaven and hell are not places far away. You may be in heaven
          before the clock ticks again, it is so near. Could we but rend that
          veil which parts us from the unseen! It is all there, and all near.
          |To day,| said the Lord; within three or four hours at the longest,
          |shalt thou be with me in paradise;| so near is it. A statesman has
          given us the expression of being |within measurable distance.| We are
          all within measurable distance of heaven or hell; if there be any
          difficulty in measuring the distance, it lies in its brevity rather
          than in its length.
        </p>
        <p>|One gentle sigh the fetter breaks,</p>
        <p>We scarce can say, 'He's gone,'</p>
        <p>Before the ransomed spirit takes</p>
        <p>Its mansion near the throne.|</p>
        <p>
          Oh, that we, instead of trifling about such things, because they seem
          so far away, would solemnly realize them, since they are so very near!
          This very day, before the sun goes down, some hearer, now sitting in
          this place, may see, in his own spirit, the realities of heaven or
          hell. It has frequently happened, in this large congregation, that
          some one of our audience has died ere the next Sabbath has come round:
          it may happen this week. Think of that, and let eternal things impress
          you all the more because they lie so near.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, know that if you have believed in Jesus you are prepared
          for heaven. It may be that you will have to live on earth twenty, or
          thirty, or forty years to glorify Christ; and, if so, be thankful for
          the privilege; but if you do not live another hour, your instantaneous
          death would not alter the fact that he that believeth in the Son of
          God is meet for heaven. Surely, if anything beyond faith is needed to
          make us fit to enter paradise, the thief would have been kept a little
          longer here; but no, he is, in the morning, in the state of nature, at
          noon he enters the state of grace, and by sunset he is in the state of
          glory. The question never is whether a death-bed repentance is
          accepted if it be sincere: the question is -- Is it sincere? If it be
          so, if the man dies five minutes after his first act of faith, he is
          as safe as if he had served the Lord for fifty years. If your faith is
          true, if you die one moment after you have believed in Christ, you
          will be admitted into paradise, even if you shall have enjoyed no time
          in which to produce good works and other evidences of grace. He that
          reads the heart will read your faith written on its fleshy tablets,
          and he will accept you through Jesus Christ, even though no act of
          grace has been visible to the eye of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          I conclude by again saying that this is not an exceptional case. I
          began with that, and I want to finish with it, because so many
          demi-semi-gospellers are so terribly afraid of preaching free grace
          too fully. I read somewhere, and I think it is true, that some
          ministers preach the gospel in the same way as donkeys eat thistles,
          namely, very, very cautiously. On the contrary, I will preach it
          boldly. I have not the slightest alarm about the matter. If any of you
          misuse free-grace teaching, I cannot help it. He that will be damned
          can as well ruin himself by perverting the gospel as by anything else.
          I cannot help what base hearts may invent; but mine it is to set forth
          the gospel in all its fulness of grace, and I will do it. If the thief
          was an exceptional case -- and our Lord does not usually act in such a
          way -- there would have been a hint given of so important a fact. A
          hedge would have been set about this exception to all rules. Would not
          the Saviour have whispered quietly to the dying man, |You are the only
          one I am going to treat in this way|? Whenever I have to do an
          exceptional favour to a person, I have to say, |Do not mention this,
          or I shall have so many besieging me.| If the Saviour had meant this
          to be a solitary case, he would have faintly said to him, |Do not let
          anybody know; but you shall to day be in the kingdom with me.| No, our
          Lord spoke openly, and those about him heard what he said. Moreover,
          the inspired penman has recorded it. If it had been an exceptional
          case, it would not have been written in the Word of God. Men will not
          publish their actions in the newspapers if they feel that the record
          might lead others to expect from them what they cannot give. The
          Saviour had this wonder of grace reported in the daily news of the
          gospel, because he means to repeat the marvel every day. The bulk
          shall be equal to sample, and therefore he sets the sample before you
          all. He is able to save to the uttermost, for he saved the dying
          thief. The case would not have been put there to encourage hopes which
          he cannot fulfil. Whatsoever things were written aforetime were
          written for our learning, and not for our disappointing. I pray you,
          therefore, if any of you have not yet trusted in my Lord Jesus, come
          and trust in him now. Trust him wholly; trust him only; trust him at
          once. Then will you sing with me --
        </p>
        <p>|The dying thief rejoiced to see</p>
        <p>That fountain in his day,</p>
