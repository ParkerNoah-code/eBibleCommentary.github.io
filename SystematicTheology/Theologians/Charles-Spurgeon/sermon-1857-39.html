        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.146)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, August 16, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain." -- Philippians
          1:21.
        </p>
        <p>
          HOW OMINOUSLY these words follow each other in the text -- "live,"
          "die." There is but a comma between them, and surely as it is in the
          words so is it in reality. How brief the distance between life and
          death! In fact there is none. Life is but death's vestibule, and our
          pilgrimage on earth is but a journey to the grave. The pulse that
          preserves our being beats our death march, and the blood which
          circulates our life is floating it onward to the deeps of death.
          To-day we see our friends in health, to-morrow we hear of their
          decease. We clasped the hand of the strong man but yesterday, and
          to-day we close his eyes. We rode in the chariot of comfort but an
          hour ago, and in a few more hours the last black chariot must convey
          us to the home of all living. Oh, how closely allied is death to life!
          The lamb teat sporteth in the field must soon feel the knife. The ox
          that loweth in the pasture is fattening for the slaughter. Trees do
          but grow that they may be felled. Yea, and greater things than these
          feel death. Empires rise and flourish, they flourish but to decay,
          they rise to fall. How often do we take up the volume of history, and
          read of the rise and fall of empires. We hear of the coronation and
          the death of kings. Death is the black servant who rides behind the
          chariot of life. See life! and death is close behind it. Death
          reacheth far throughout this world, and hath stamped all terrestrial
          things with the broad arrow of the grave. Stars die mayhap; it is said
          that conflagrations have been seen far off in the distant ether, and
          astronomers have marked the funerals of worlds, the decay of those
          mighty orbs that we had imagined set for ever in sockets of silver to
          glisten as the lamps of eternity. But blessed be God, there is one
          place where death is not life's brother, where life reigns alone; "to
          live," is not the first syllable which is to be followed by the next,
          "to die." There is a land where deathknells are never tolled, where
          winding-sheets are never woven, where graves are never digged. Blest
          land beyond the skies! To reach it we must die. But if after death we
          obtain a glorious immortality, our text is indeed true: "To die is
          gain."
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would get a fair estimate of the happiness of any man you must
          judge him in these two closely connected things, his life and his
          death. The heathen Solon said, "Call no man happy until he is dead;
          for you know not what changes may pass upon him in life." We add to
          that -- Call no man happy until he is dead; because the life that is
          to come, if that be miserable, shall far outweigh the highest life of
          happiness that hath been enjoyed on earth. To estimate a man's
          condition we must take it in all its length. We must not measure that
          one thread which reacheth from the cradle to the coffin. We must go
          further; we must go from the coffin to the resurrection, and from the
          resurrection on throughout eternity. To know whether acts are
          profitable, I must not estimate their effects on me for the hour in
          which I live, but for the eternity in which I am to exist. I must not
          weigh matters in the scales of time; I must not calculate by the
          hours, minutes and seconds of the clock, but I must count and value
          things by the ages of eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, then, beloved; we have before us the picture of a man, the two
          sides of whose existence will both of them bear inspection; we have hi
          life, we have his death: we have it said of his life, "to live is
          Christ," of his death, "to die is gain;" and if the same shall be said
          of any of you, oh! ye may rejoice! Ye are amongst that thrice happy
          number whom the Lord hath loved, and whom he delighteth to honor.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall now divide our text very simply into these two points, the
          good man's life, and the good man's death.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. As to HIS LIFE, we have that briefly described thus: "For me to
          live is Christ." The believer did not always live to Christ. When he
          was first born into this world he was a slave of sin, and an heir of
          wrath, even as others. Though he may have afterwards become the
          greatest of saints, yet until divine grace hath entered his heart, he
          is "in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity." He only
          begins to live to Christ when God the Holy Spirit convinceth him of
          his sin, and of his desperate evil nature, and when by grace he is
          brought to see the dying Saviour making a propitiation for his guilt.
          From that moment when by faith he sees the slaughtered victim of
          Calvary, and casts his whole life on him, to be saved, to be redeemed,
          to be preserved, and to be blest by the virtue of his atonement and
          the greatness of his grace, from that moment the man begins to live to
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now shall we tell you as briefly as we can what living to Christ
          means.
        </p>
        <p>
          It means, first, that the life of a Christian derives its parentage
          from Christ. "For me to live is Christ." The righteous man has two
          lives. He has one which he inherited from his parents; he looks back
          to an ancestral race of which he is the branch, and he traces his life
          to the parent stock; but he has a second life, a life spiritual, a
          life which is as much above mere mental life, as mental life is above
          the life of the animal or the plant; and for the source of this
          spiritual life he looks not to father or mother, nor to priest nor
          man, nor to himself, but he looks to Christ. He says, "O Lord Jesus,
          the everlasting Father, the Prince of peace, thou art my spiritual
          parent; unless thy Spirit had breathed into my nostrils the breath of
          a new, holy and spiritual life, I had been to this day "dead in
          trespasses and sins." I owe my third principle, my spirit, to the
          implantation of thy grace. I had a body and a soul by my parents, I
          have received the third principle, the spirit from thee, and in thee I
          live, and move, and have my being. My new, my best, my highest my most
          heavenly life, is wholly derived from thee. To thee I ascribe it. My
          life is hid with Christ in God. It is no longer I that live, but
          Christ that liveth in me." And so the Christian says, "For me to live
          is Christ," because for me to live is to live a life whose parentage
          is not of human origin, but of divine, even of Christ himself. Again
          he intended to say, that Christ was the sustenance of his life, the
          food his newborn spirit fed upon. The believer hath three parts to be
          sustained. The body, which must have its proper nutriment; the soul,
          which must have knowledge and thought to supply it; and the spirit
          which must feed on Christ. Without bread I become attenuated to a
          skeleton, and at last I die; without thought my mind becomes dwarfed,
          and, and dwindles itself until I become the idiot, with a soul that
          hath just life, but little more. And without Christ my newborn spirit
          must become a vague shadowy emptiness. It cannot live unless it feeds
          on that heavenly manna which came down from heaven. Now the Christian
          can say, "The life that I live is Christ," because Christ is the food
          on which he feeds and the sustenance of his new-born Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle also meant, that the fashion of his life was Christ. I
          suppose that every man living has a model by which he endeavors to
          shape his life. When we start in life, we generally select some
          person, or persons, whose combined virtues shall be to us the mirror
          of perfection. "Now," says Paul, "if you ask me after what fashion I
          mould my life, and what is the model by which I would sculpture my
          being, I tell you, it is Christ. I have no fashion, no form, no model
          by which to shape my being, except the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, the
          true Christian, if he be an upright man, can say the same. Understand,
          however what I mean by the word "upright." An upright man mean" a
          straightt up man -- a man that does not cringe and bow, and fawn to
          other men's feet; a man that does not lean for help on other men, but
          just stands with his head heavenward, in all the dignity of his
          independence, leaning nowhere except on the arm of the Omnipotent.
          Such a man will take Christ alone to be his model and pattern. This is
          the very age of conventionalities. People dare not now do a thing
          unless everybody else does the same. You do not often say, "Is a thing
          right?" The most you say is, "Does so-and-so do it?" You have some
          great personage or other in your family connection, who is looked upon
          as being the very standard of all propriety; and if he do it, then you
          think you may safely do it. And oh! what an outcry there is against a
          man who dares to be singular, who just believes that some of your
          conventionalities are trammels and chains, and kicks them all to
          pieces and says, "I am free!" The world is at him in a minute; all the
          ban-dogs of malice and slander are at him, because he says, "I will
          not follow your model! I will vindicate the honor of my Master, and
          not take your great masters to be for ever my pattern." Oh! I would to
          God that every statesman, that every minister, that every Christian
          were free to hold that his only form, and his only fashion for
          imitation, must be the character of Christ. I would that we could
          scorn all superstitious attachments to the ancient errors of our
          ancestors; and whilst some would be for ever looking upon age and upon
          hoary antiquity with veneration, I would we had the courage to look
          upon a thing, not according to its age, but according to its
          rightness, and so weigh everything, not by its novelty, or by its
          antiquity, but by its conformity to Christ Jesus and his holy Gospel;
          rejecting that which is not, though it be hoary with years, and
          believing that which is, even though it be but the creature of the
          day, and saying with earnestness, "For me to live is not to imitate
          this man or the other, but for me to live is Christ.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          I think, however, that the very center of Paul's idea would be this:
          The end of his life is Christ. You think you see Paul land upon the
          shores of Philippi. There, by the river-side, were ships gathered and
          many merchant men. There you would see the merchant busy with his
          ledger, and overlooking his cargo, and he paused and put his hand upon
          his brow, and said as he griped his money-bag, "For me to live is
          gold." And there you see his humbler clerk, employed in some plainer
          work, toiling for his master, and he, perspiring with work mutters
          between his teeth, "For me to live is to gain a bare subsistence." And
          there stands for a moment to listen to him, one with a studious face
          and a sallow countenance, and with a roll full of the mysterious
          characters of wisdom. "Young man," he says, "for me to live is
          learning." "Aha! aha!;" says another, who stands by, clothed in mail,
          with a helmet on his head, "I scorn your modes of life, for me to live
          is glory." But there walks one, a humble tent-maker, called Paul; you
          see the lineaments of the Jew upon his face, and he steps into the
          middle of them all and says, "For me to live is Christ." Oh! how they
          smile with contempt upon him, and how they scoff at him, for having
          chosen such an object! "For me to live is Christ." And what did he
          mean! The learned man stopped, and said, "Christ! who is he? Is he
          that foolish, mad fellow, of whom I have heard, who was executed upon
          Calvary for sedition?" The meek reply is, "It is he who died, Jesus of
          Nazareth, the King of the Jews." "What?" says the Roman soldier, "and
          do you live for a man who died a slave's death? What glory will you
          get by fighting his battles?" What profit is there in your preaching,
          chimes in the trader. Ah! and even the merchant's clerk thought Paul
          mad; for he said, "How can he feed his family? how will he supply his
          wants if all he liveth for is to honor Christ?" Ay, but Paul knew what
          he was at. He was the wiser man of them all. He knew which way was
          right for heaven, and which would end the best. But, right or wrong,
          his soul was wholly possessed with the idea -- "For me to live is
          Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren and sisters, can you say, as professing Christians, that you
          live up to the idea of the apostle Paul? Can you honestly say that for
          you to live is Christ? I will tell you my opinion of many of you. You
          join our churches you are highly respectable men; you are accepted
          among us as true and real Christians; but in all honesty and truth I
          do not believe that for you to live is Christ. I see many of you whose
          whore thoughts are engrossed with the things of earth; the mere
          getting of money; the amassing of wealth, seems to be your only
          object. I do not deny that you are liberal, I will not dare to say
          that you are not generous, and that your cheque-book does not often
          bear the mark of some subscription for holy purposes, but I dare to
          say, after all, that you cannot in honesty say that you live wholly
          for Christ. You know that when you go to your shop or your warehouse,
          you do not think, in doing business, that you are doing it for Christ;
          you dare not be such a hypocrite as to say so. You must say that you
          do it for self-aggrandisement, and for family advantage. "Well!" says
          one, "and is that a mean reason?" By no means; not for you, if you are
          mean enough to ask that question, but for the Christian it is. He
          professes to live for Christ; then how IS it he dares to profess to
          live for his Master, and yet does not do so, but lives for mere
          worldly gain? Let me speak to many a lady here. You would be shocked
          if I should deny your Christianity. You move in the highest circles of
          life, and you would be astonished if I should presume to touch your
          piety, after your many generous donations to religious objects; but I
          dare to do so. You -- what do you do? You rise late enough in the day:
          you have your carriage out, and call to see your friends, or leave
          your card by way of proxy. You go to a party in the evening; you talk
          nonsense, and come home and go to bed. And that is your life from the
          beginning of the year to the end. It is just one regular round. There
          comes the dinner or the ball, and the conclusion of the day; and then
          Amen, so be it, for ever. Now you don't live for Christ. I know you go
          to church regularly, or attend at some dissenting chapel; all well and
          good. I shall not deny your piety, according to the common usage of
          the term, but I deny that you have got to anything like the place
          where Paul stood when he said, "For me to live is Christ." I, my
          brethren, know that with much earnest seeking I have failed to realize
          the fullness of entire devotion to the Lord Jesus. Every minister must
          sometimes chasten himself and say, "Am I not sometimes a little warped
          in my utterances? Did I not in some sermon aim to bring out a grand
          thought instead of stating a home truth? Have I not kept back some
          warning that I ought to have uttered, because I feared the face of
          man?" Have we not all good need to chasten ourselves, because we must
          say that we have not lived for Christ as we should have done? And yet
          there are, I trust, a noble few, the elite of God's elect, a few
          chosen men and women on whose heads there is the crown and diadem of
          dedication, who can truly say, "I have nothing in this world I cannot
          give to Christ -- I have said it, and mean what I have said --
        </p>
        <p>'Take my soul and body's powers,</p>
        <p>All my goods and all my hours,</p>
        <p>All I have, and all I am.'</p>
        <p>
          Take me, Lord, and take me for ever." These are the men who make our
          missionaries; these are the women to make our nurses for the sick,
          these are they that would dare death for Christ; these are they who
          would give of their substance to his cause; these are they who would
          spend and be spent, who would bear ignominy, and scorn, and shame if
          they could but advance their Master's interest. How many of this sort
          have I here this morning? Might I not count many of these benches
          before I could find a score? Many there are who do in a measure carry
          out this principle; but who among us is there (I am sure he standeth
          not here in this pulpit) that can dare to say he hath lived wholly for
          Christ, as the apostle did? And yet, till there be more Pauls, and
          more men dedicated to Christ, we shall never see God's kingdom come,
          nor shall we hope to see his will done on earth, even as it is in
          heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, this is the true life of a Christian, its source, its sustenance,
          its fashion, and its end, all gathered up in one word, Christ Jesus;
          and, I must add, its happiness, and its glory, is all in Christ. But I
          must detain you no longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I must go to the second point, THE DEATH OF THE CHRISTIAN. Alas,
          alas, that the good should die; alas, that the righteous should fall!
          Death, why dost thou not hew the deadly upas? Why dost thou not mow
          the hemlock? Why dost thou touch the tree beneath whose spreading
          branches weariness hath rest? Why dost thou touch the flower whose
          perfume hath made glad the earth? Death, why dost thou snatch away the
          excellent of the earth, in whom is all our delight? If thou wouldest
          use thine axe, use it upon the cumber-grounds, the trees that draw
          nourishment, but afford no fruit; thou mightest be thanked then. But
          why wilt thou cut down the cedars, why wilt thou fell the goodly trees
          of Lebanon? O Death, why dost thou not spare the church? Why must the
          pulpit be hung in black; why must the missionary station be filled
          with weeping? Why must the pious family lose its priest, and the house
          its head? O Death, what art thou at? touch not earth's holy things;
          thy hands are not fit to pollute the Israel of God. Why dost thou put
          thine hand upon the hearts of the elect? Oh stay thou, stay thou;
          spare the righteous, Death, and take the bad! But no, it must not be;
          death comes and smites the goodliest of us all; the most generous, the
          most prayerful, the most holy, the most devoted must die. Weep, weep,
          weep, O church, for thou hast lost thy martyrs; weep, O church, for
          thou hast lost thy confessors, thy holy men are fallen. Howl, fir
          tree, for the cedar hath fallen, the godly fail, and the righteous are
          cut off. But stay awhile; I hear another voice. Say ye thus unto the
          daughter of Judah, spare thy weeping. Say ye thus unto the Lord's
          flock, Cease, cease thy sorrow thy martyrs are dead, but they are
          glorified; thy ministers are gone, but they have ascended up to thy
          Father, and to their Father, thy brethren are buried in the grave, but
          the archangel's trumpet shall awake them, and their spirits are ever
          now with God.

          Hear ye the words of the text, by way of consolation, "To die is
          gain." Not such gain as thou wishest for, thou son of the miser, not
          such gain as thou art hunting for, thou man of covetousness and
          self-love; a higher and a better gain is that which death brings to a
          Christian.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dear friends, when I discoursed upon the former part of the verse,
          it was all plain. No proof was needed; ye believed it, for you saw it
          clearly. "To live is Christ," hath no paradox in it. But "To die is
          gain," is one of the Gospel riddles which only the Christian can truly
          understand. To die is not gain if I look upon the merely visible, to
          die is loss, it is not gain. Hath not the dead man lost his wealth?
          though he had piles of riches, can he take anything with him? Hath it
          not been said, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall
          I return thither." "Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."
          And which of all thy goods, canst thou take with thee? The man had a
          fair estate and a goodly mansion; he hath lost that. He can no more
          tread those painted halls, nor walk those verdant lawns. He had
          abundance of fame and honor; he hath lost that, so far as his own
          sense of it is concerned, though still the harp string trembles at his
          name. He has lost his wealth, and buried though he may be in a costly
          tomb, yet is he as poor as the beggar who looked upon him in the
          street in envy. That is not gain, it is loss and he hath lost his
          friends: he hath left behind him a sorrowing wife and children,
          fatherless, without his guardian care; he hath lost the friend of his
          bosom, the companion of his youth. Friends are there to weep over him,
          but they cannot cross the river with him; they drop a few tears into
          his tomb, but with him they must not and cannot go. And hath he not
          lost all his learning, though he hath toiled ever so much to fill his
          brain with knowledge? What is he now above the servile slave, though
          he hath acquired all knowledge of earthly things? Is it not said,
        </p>
        <p>"Their memory and their love are lost</p>
        <p>Alike unknowing and unknown?"</p>
        <p>
          Surely death is loss. Hath he not lost the songs of the sanctuary and
          the prayers of the righteous? Hath he not lost the solemn assembly,
          and the great gathering of the people? No more shall the promise
          enchant his ear, no more shall the glad tidings of the gospel wake his
          soul to melody. He sleeps in the dust, the Sabbath-bell tolls not for
          him, the sacramental emblems are spread upon the table, but not for
          him. He hath gone to his grave, he knoweth not that which shall be
          after him. There is neither work nor device in the grave, whither we
          all are hastening. Surely death is loss. When I look upon thee, thou
          clay-cold corpse, and see thee just preparing to be the palace of
          corruption and the carnival for worms, I cannot think that thou hast
          gained. When I see that thine eye hath lost light, and thy lip hath
          lost its speech, and thine ears have lost hearing, and thy feet have
          lost motion, and thy heart hath lost its joy, and they that look out
          of the windows are darkened, the grinders have failed, and no sounds
          of tabret and of harp wake up thy joys, O clay-cold corpse, than hast
          lost, lost immeasurably. And yet my text tells me it is not so. It
          says, "To die is gain." It looks as if it could not be thus, and
          certainly it is not, so far as I can see. But put to your eye the
          telescope of faith, take that magic glass which pierces through the
          veil that parts us from the unseen. Anoint your eyes with eyesalve,
          and make them so bright that they can pierce the ether and see the
          unknown worlds. Come, bathe yourself in this sea of light, and live in
          holy revelation and belief, and then look, and oh how changed the
          scene! Here is the corpse, but there the spirit; here is the clay, but
          there the soul, here is the carcase, but there the seraph. He is
          supremely blest; his death is gain. Come now, what did he lose? I will
          show that in everything he lost, he gained far more. He lost his
          friends, did he? His wife, and his children, his brethren in church
          fellowship, are all lea to weep his loss. Yes, he lost them, but, my
          brethren what did he gain? He gained more friends than e'er he lost.
          He had lost many in his lifetime, but he meets them all again.
          Parents, brethren and sisters who had died in youth or age, and passed
          the stream before him, all salute him on the further brink. There the
          mother meets her infant, there the father meets his children, there
          the venerable patriarch greets his family to the third and fourth
          generation, there brother clasps brother to his arms, and husband
          meets with wife, no more to be married or given in marriage, but to
          live together, like the angels of God. Some of us have more friends in
          heaven than in earth. We have more dear relations in glory, than we
          have here. It is not so with all of us, but with some it is so; more
          have crossed the stream than are left behind. But if it be not so, yet
          what friends we have to meet us there! Oh, I reckon on the day of
          death if it were for the mere hope of seeing the bright spirits that
          are now before the throne; to clasp the hand of Abraham, and Isaac,
          and Jacob, to look into the face of Paul the apostle, and grasp the
          hand of Peter; to sit in flowery fields with Moses and David, to bask
          in the sunlight of bliss with John and Magdalene. Oh how blest! The
          company of poor imperfect saints on earth is good; but how much better
          the society of the redeemed. Death is no loss to us by way of friends.
          We leave a few, a little band below, and say to them, "Fear not little
          flock," and we ascend and meet the armies of the living God, the hosts
          of his redeemed. "To die is gain." Poor corpse! thou hast lost thy
          friends on earth; nay, bright spirit, thou hast received a hundred
          fold in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          What else did we say he lost? We said he lost all his estate, all his
          substance and his wealth. Ay, but he has gained infinitely more.
          Though he were rich as Crþsus, yet he might well give up his wealth
          for that which he hath attained. Were his fingers bright with pearls,
          and hath he lost their brilliancy? The pearly gases of heaven glisten
          brighter far. Had he gold in his storehouse? Mark ye, the streets of
          heaven are paved with gold, and he is richer far. The mansions of the
          redeemed are far brighter dwelling places than the mansions of the
          richest here below. But it is not so with many of you. You are not
          rich, you are poor. What can you lose by death? You are poor here, you
          shall be rich there. Here you suffer toil, there you shall rest for
          ever. Here you earn your bread by the sweat of your brow but there, no
          toil Here wearily you cast yourself upon your bed at the week's end,
          and sigh for the Sabbath, but there Sabbaths have no end. Here you go
          to the house of God, but you are distracted with worldly cares and
          thoughts of suffering; but there, there are no groans to mingle with
          the songs that warble from immortal tongues, Death will be gain to you
          in point of riches and substance.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as for the means of grace which we leave behind, what are they
          when compared with what we shall have hereafter? Oh, might I die at
          this hour, I think I would say something like this, "Farewell
          Sabbaths, -- I am going to the eternal Sabbath of the redeemed.
          Farewell minister; I shall need no candle, neither light of the sun,
          when the Lord God shall give me light, and be my life for ever and
          ever. Farewell ye songs and sonnets of the blessed; farewell, I shall
          not need your melodious burst; I shall hear the eternal and unceasing
          hallelujahs of the beatified. Farewell, ye prayers of God's people; my
          spirit shall hear for ever the intercessions of my Lord, and join with
          the noble army of martyrs in crying, O Lord, how long?' Farewell, O
          Zion! Farewell, house of my love, home of my life! Farewell, ye
          temples where God's people sing and pray; farewell, ye tents of Jacob,
          where they daily burn their offering!-I am going to a better Zion than
          you, to a brighter Jerusalem, to a temple that hath foundations, whose
          builder and maker is God!" O my dear friends, in the thought of these
          things, do we not, some of us, feel as if we could die!
        </p>
        <p>"E'en now by faith we join our hands</p>
        <p>With those that went before,</p>
        <p>And greet the blood-besprinkled bands</p>
        <p>Upon th' eternal shore.</p>
        <p>One army of the living God,</p>
        <p>At his command we bow,</p>
        <p>Part of the host have crossed the flood,</p>
        <p>And part are crossing now."</p>
        <p>
          We have not come to the margin yet, but we shall be there soon: we
          soon expect to die.
        </p>
        <p>
          And again, one more thought. We said that when men died they lost
          their knowledge, we correct ourselves. Oh, no, when the righteous die
          they know infinitely more than they could have known on earth.
        </p>
        <p>"There shall I see and hear and know</p>
        <p>All I desired or wished below;</p>
        <p>And every power find sweet employ,</p>
        <p>In that eternal world of joy."</p>
        <p>
          "Here we see through a glass darkly, but there face to face." There,
          what "eye hath not seen nor ear heard" shall be fully manifest to us.
          There, riddles shall be unravelled, mysteries made plain, dark texts
          enlightened, hard providences made to appear wise. The meanest soul in
          heaven knows more of God than the greatest saint on earth. The
          greatest saint on earth may have it said of him, "Nevertheless he that
          is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he." Not our
          mightiest divines understand so much of theology as the lambs of the
          flock of glory. Not the greatest master-minds of earth understand the
          millionth part of the mighty meanings which have been discovered by
          souls emancipated from clay. Yes, brethren, "To die is gain." Take
          away, take away that hearse, remove that shroud; come, put white
          plumes upon the horse's heads and let gilded trappings hang around
          them. There, take away that fife, that shrill sounding music of the
          death march. Lend me the trumpet and the drum. O hallelujah,
          hallelujah, hallelujah; why weep we the saints to heaven; why need we
          lament? They are not dead, they are gone before. Stop, stop that
          mourning, refrain thy tears, clap your hands, clap your hands.
        </p>
        <p>"They are supremely blest,</p>
        <p>Have done with care and sin and woe;</p>
        <p>And with their Saviour rest."</p>
        <p>
          What! weep! weep! for heads that are crowned with coronals of heaven?
          Weep, weep for hands that grasp the harps of gold? What, weep for eyes
          that see the Redeemer? What, weep for hearts that are washed from sin,
          and are throbbing with eternal bliss! What, weep for men that are in
          the Saviour's bosom?-No, weep for yourselves, that you are here. Weep
          that the mandate has not come which bids you to die. Weep that you
          must tarry. But weep not for them. I see them turning back on you with
          loving wonder, and they exclaim, "Why weepest thou?" What, weep for
          poverty that it is clothed in riches? What, weep for sickness, that it
          hath inherited eternal health? What, weep for shame, that it is
          glorified; and weep for sinful mortality, that it hath become
          immaculate? Oh, weep not, but rejoice. "If ye knew what it was that I
          have said unto you, and whither I have gone, ye would rejoice with a
          joy that no man should take from you." "To die is gain." Ah, this
          makes the Christian long to die -- makes him say,
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, that the word were given!</p>
        <p>O Lord of Hosts, the wave divide,</p>
        <p>And land us all in heaven!"</p>
        <p>
          And now, friends, does this belong to you all? Can you claim an
          interest in it? Are you living to Christ? Does Christ live in you? For
          if not, your death will not be gain. Are you a believer in the
          Saviour? Has your heart been renewed, and your conscience washed in
          the blood of Jesus? If not, my bearer, I weep for thee. I will save my
          tears for lost friends; there, with this handkerchief I'd staunch mine
          eyes for ever for my best beloved that shall die, if those tears could
          save you. O, when you die, what a day! If the world were hung in
          sackcloth, it could not express the grief that you would feel. You
          die. O death! O death! how hideous art thou to men that are not in
          Christ! And yet, my hearer, thou shalt soon die. Save me thy bed of
          shrieks, thy look of gall, thy words of bitterness! Oh that thou
          couldst be saved the dread hereafter! Oh! the wrath to come! the wrath
          to come! the wrath to come! who is he that can preach of it? Horrors
          strike the guilty soul! It quivereth upon the verge of death; no, on
          the verge of hell. It looketh over, clutching hard to life, and it
          heareth there the sullen groans, the hollow moans, and shrieks of
          tortured ghosts, which come up from the pit that is bottomless, and it
          clutcheth firmly to life, clasps the physician, and bids him hold,
          lest he should fall into the pit that burneth. And the spirit looketh
          down and seeth all the fiends of everlasting punishments, and back it
          recoileth. But die it must. It would barter all it hath to coin an
          hour; but no, the fiend hath got its grip, and down it must plunge.
          And who can tell the hideous shriek of a lost soul? It cannot reach
          heaven; but if it could, it might well be dreamed that it would
          suspend the melodies of angels, might make even God's redeemed weep,
          if they could hear the wailings of a damned soul. Ah! you men and
          women, ye have wept; but if you die unregenerate, there will be no
          weeping like that, there will be no shriek like that, no wail like
          that. May God spare us from ever hearing it or uttering it ourselves!
          Oh, how the grim caverns of Hades startle, and how the darkness of
          night is frighted, when the wail of a lost soul comes up from the
          ascending flames, whilst it is descending in the pit. "Turn ye, turn
          ye; why will ye die, O house of Israel?" Christ is preached to you.
          "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
          Jesus came into the world to save sinners." Believe on him and live,
          ye guilty, vile, perishing; believe and live. But this know -- if ye
          reject my message, and depise my Master, in that day when he shall
          judge the world in righteousness by that man, Jesus Christ, I must be
          a swift witness against you. I have told you -- tat your soul's peril
          reject it. Receive my message, and you are saved; reject it -- take
          the responsibility on your own head. Behold, my skirts are clear of
          your blood. If ye be damned, it is not for want of warning. Oh God
          grant, ye may not perish.<br />
