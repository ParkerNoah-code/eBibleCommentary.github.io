          32. And they provoked him to anger at the waters of strife , and it
          turned out ill to Moses on their account: 33. For they grieved his
          spirit, so that he spake with his lips.34. They did not destroy the
          nations whom Jehovah had commanded them: 35. But were mingled with the
          heathen, and learned their works.36. And served their idols: which
          were the occasion of their overthrow.37. And sacrificed their sons and
          daughters unto devils, 38. And they shed innocent blood, the blood of
          their sons and their daughters whom they sacrificed to the idols of
          Canaan; and the land was defiled with blood.39. And they were polluted
          with their own works, and went a whoring after their own inventions.

        <p></p>

          32 And they provoked him The prophet mentions another offense of which
          they were guilty, in that, they contended with God at the waters of
          strife, from which circumstance that place derived its name. The
          clamor was, it is true, raised directly against Moses, but if we
          examine the matter properly, we will find that they virtually murmured
          against God himself. And to point out the aggravation of their
          offense, he says that Moses was hardly dealt with on their account.
          From this it may be inferred that their transgression was very
          heinous, in that God did not spare even his own servant, whom he had
          chosen in preference to all others. We do not deny that Moses deserved
          that punishment; but if we search for the origin of the trespass, we
          will find that it was the sin of the people that was visited upon him.
          If Moses was prevented from entering the land of Canaan, because
          through the influence of the sin of others, and in opposition to the
          convictions of his own mind, he had been hurried on to the commission
          of iniquity, how much more inexcusable is the impiety of that people
          who deliberately strove with God, and by their folly and fretfulness,
          brought in Moses for a share of their guilt?
        </p>
        <p>
          33. For they grieved his spirit The verb mrh, marah, properly
          signifies to vex or irritate, but as it is here put in what the
          Hebrews call the Hiphil conjugation, some are of opinion that it is to
          be understood passively, to denote that it was the people who were the
          occasion of the rebellion; which interpretation does not appear to me
          to be very objectionable. I cannot, however, agree with those who
          would have the particle 't, eth, to be a sign of what is denominated
          the dative case, as if Moses might be said to have rebelled against
          the Spirit of God. Had he done so, then assuredly the prophet would
          not have spoken so severely of the sin and folly into which he had
          inadvertently fallen. The meaning which I have already given answers
          very well, That the prime movers of the rebellion must have committed
          a very heinous offense, seeing that Moses, who had been pushed on by
          the impetuosity of the people to sin, was so severely dealt with by
          God. But while the prophet informs us that Moses was punished on the
          people's account, he is not to be understood as saying that he was
          altogether blameless. For even admitting that his spirit was ruffled
          in consequence of the tumult of the people, this ought to have made
          him the more careful to continue steadfast in his adherence to the Law
          of God. He adds, that he spoke with his lips; and this I take to refer
          to Moses, there being no ground for the conjecture that it refers to
          the punishment which God expressly denounced against Moses. It is more
          likely that these words were intended by the prophet to express how
          greatly the spirit of Moses was agitated when he openly murmured
          against God. The prophet, therefore, informs us that the submissive
          and gentle spirit of Moses was fanned, as it were, into a breeze by
          the perverseness of the people, so that even he spake un-advisedly,
          saying, "Can God give you water out of the rock?" (Numbers 20:10) For
          such was the indignation which he felt burning within him, that he
          could not calmly wait for the commandment of God to smite the rock.
        </p>
        <p>
          34. They did not destroy the nations It appears to me that those
          persons are mistaken who think that the prophet is here simply giving
          a relation of the punishment which was inflicted upon the Jews, as if
          he were imputing to them the entire blame of not exterminating the
          nations, in consequence of their not deserving the honor of obtaining
          any more victories over them. But he rather prefers another charge
          against them, that they had been remiss in driving out the heathen, or
          more probably that they had not obeyed the Divine command to root them
          out of the land. Now that the cup of the iniquity of the Amorites was
          full, it was the purpose of God that they should be exterminated, lest
          their society might prove injurious to the holy people. For God,
          having chosen that land for a habitation to himself, intended that it
          should be holy and purified from all defilement. In refusing,
          therefore, to execute the vengeance enjoined upon them, the people
          showed their willingness to associate with the uncircumcised
          inhabitants of Canaan. In manifesting such indifference about God's
          command respecting the driving out these nations, they gave just cause
          for his anger waxing hot against them. Behold, saith he, I have
          commanded all these nations to be cut off by the sword; and now,
          because ye have not obeyed my voice,
        </p>
        <p>
          "they shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and
          shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell," Numbers 33:55
        </p>
        <p>
          The not destroying all these nations, but permitting some of them to
          remain, might appear to be an act of mercy; but in thus acting, the
          people were guilty of neglecting to execute God's righteous vengeance
          upon them, and of leaving the land liable to be polluted with their
          abominations. From these things it ought to be noticed, that there are
          two extremes in which men are apt to indulge, either in being
          unnecessarily over rigorous, or in defeating the ends of justice by
          too great lenity. We must, therefore, adhere strictly to God's
          command, if we would desire to shun both extremes. For if the
          Israelites are condemned for sparing some of these nations wholly,
          what are we to think of those judges who, from a timid and apathetic
          attention to the responsible duties of their office, exercise too much
          lenity to a few persons, thus weakening the restraints of the inlets
          to vice, to the great detriment of the public weal?
        </p>
        <p>
          35 But were mingled He describes what was the result of this foolish
          humanity; namely, that they were defiled with the pollutions of the
          nations whom they had spared. Had they exclusively inhabited the land
          of Canaan, they would have more easily retained the pure worship of
          God. Allured by the influence of such neighbors, it is not wonderful
          that they soon degenerated from the footsteps of their fathers, for we
          are more inclined to follow the example of the bad than of the good.
          And now he speaks of the descendants of those who had so frequently
          provoked God's anger in the wilderness, and declares, that as the same
          unbelief, rebellion, and ingratitude, were rampant in the succeeding
          race, they were no better than their fathers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In mingling with the heathens they openly rejected the distinguishing
          loving-kindness of God, who adopted them as his children, under the
          express condition that they should be separated from these profane
          nations. Therefore, in associating with them indiscriminately, they
          render this holy covenant of no effect. When he adds, that they
          learned their works, he warns us, that nothing is more dangerous than
          associating with the ungodly; because, being more prone to follow vice
          than virtue, it cannot but be, that the more conversant we are with
          corruption, the more widely will it spread. In such circumstances, the
          utmost care and caution are requisite, lest the wicked, with whom we
          come into contact, infect us by their vitiated morals; and
          particularly where there is danger of relapsing into idolatry, to
          which we are all naturally prone. What, then, will be the effect
          produced upon us when instigated by others to commit sin, but to add
          sin to sin? The prophet, therefore, declares that the Jews were
          already so much under the tuition of the heathen as to abandon
          themselves to the practice of their idolatrous rites. In employing the
          word to serve, he confutes the contemptible evasion of the Papists,
          who pretend that they do not give to images the worship that is due to
          God alone, but only a sort of honorary adoration. But if the
          worshipping of images be lawful, the prophet had no sufficient cause
          to condemn his own nation for serving strange gods. Despicable,
          therefore, is the distinction, that Divine homage is to be paid to God
          alone, and that a kind of honorary adoration is to be given to images.
          He adds, that this issued in their overthrow, in order that their
          obstinate attachment to their follies, and their despising the
          chastisements of God, may more palpably appear.
        </p>
        <p>
          37. And they sacrificed The prophet here mentions one species of
          superstition which demonstrates the awful blindness of the people;
          their not hesitating to sacrifice their sons and daughters to devils.
          In applying such an abominable designation to the sin of the people,
          he means to exhibit it in more hateful colors. From this we learn that
          inconsiderate zeal is a flimsy pretext in favor of any act of
          devotion. For by how much the Jews were under the influence of burning
          zeal, by so much does the prophet convict them with being guilty of
          greater wickedness; because their madness carried them away to such a
          pitch of enthusiasm, that they did not spare even their own offspring.
          Were good intentions meritorious, as idolaters suppose, then indeed
          the laying aside of all natural affection in sacrificing their own
          children was a deed deserving of the highest praise. But when men act
          under the impulse of their own capricious humor, the more they occupy
          themselves with acts of external worship, the more do they increase
          their guilt. For what difference was there between Abraham and those
          persons of whom the prophet makes mention, but that the former, under
          the influence of faith, was ready to offer up his son, while the
          latter, carried away by the impulse of intemperate zeal, cast off all
          natural affection, and imbrued their hands in the blood of their own
          offspring.
        </p>
        <p>
          38. And they shed He inveighs with still greater indignation against
          that religious phrensy which led them to sacrifice their own children,
          and thus to pollute the land by the shedding of innocent blood. Should
          any one object that Abraham is praised, because he did not withhold
          his only son, the answer is plain, That he did it in obedience to
          God's command, so that every vestige of inhumanity was effaced by
          means of the purity of faith. For if obedience is better than
          sacrifice, (1 Samuel 15:22) it is the best rule both for morality and
          religion. It is an awful manifestation of God's vindictive wrath, when
          the superstitious heathens, left to their own inventions, become
          hardened in deeds of horrid cruelty. As often as the martyrs put their
          life in jeopardy in defense of the truth, the incense of such a
          sacrifice is pleasing to God. But when the two Romans, by name Decii,
          in an execrable manner devoted themselves unto death, that was an act
          of atrocious impiety. It is not without just cause, therefore, that
          the prophet enhances the guilt of the people by this consideration,
          that to the perverse mode of worshipping God, they had added excessive
          cruelty. Nor is there less cause for charging them with having
          polluted that land out of which God had commanded them to expel the
          ancient inhabitants, in order that he might render it the peculiar
          scene where he was to be worshipped. The Israelites then were doubly
          wicked, who, by not only defiling the land with their idolatry, but
          also by cruelly butchering their children, robbed God of his due, and
          in a manner frustrated his designs.
        </p>
        <p>
          39 And they were polluted with their own works He now concludes by
          stating generally, that the Jews, in adopting the abominable practices
          of the heathen, were become wholly filthy; because in all the devices
          of men there is nothing else than impurity. He denominates as the
          works of men all the false worship which they devise without the
          Divine sanction; as if he should say, that the holiness, which is
          truly connected with the worship of God, comes from his word, and that
          all human inventions and admixtures in religion are profane, and tend
          to corrupt the service of God. Doubtless it was the intention of the
          Israelites to serve God, but the Holy Spirit declares that all the
          fruit of their burning zeal was their becoming more abominable in
          God's sight by their lewd inventions. For a strict adherence to the
          word of God constitutes spiritual chastity.<br />
