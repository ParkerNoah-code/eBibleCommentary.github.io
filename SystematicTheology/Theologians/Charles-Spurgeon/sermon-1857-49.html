        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.157)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Evening, October 4, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>"And thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel." -- Isaiah 41:14.</p>
        <p>
          AND WHY DOES it say, "and thy Redeemer?" What was the use of appending
          the Redeemers name to this precious exhortation? By God's help it
          shall be the business of this evening to show why there is a peculiar
          blessedness in the fact that God hath not only said, "I will help
          thee, saith the Lord," but has added, "and thy redeemer, the Holy One
          of Israel."
        </p>
        <p>
          You will please to notice that it looks as if this were a repetition
          by three different persons. Israel was cast down, and Jehovah, for
          that is the first word -- (you will notice that the word "Lord" is in
          capitals, and should be translated "Jehovah") -- says to his poor,
          tried, desponding servant, "I will help thee." No sooner is that
          uttered than we think we shall not be straining the text if we surmise
          that God the Holy Spirit, the Holy One of Israel, adds his solemn
          affidavit also; and declares by oath and covenant, "I will help thee."
          Does not this, we say, look somewhat like repetition? Was it not
          sufficient that Jehovah the Father should declare that he would help
          his people! Why did the other persons of the divine Trinity unite in
          this solemn declaration? We think we shall be able, if God shall help
          us, to show great usefulness therein, especially dwelling to-night
          upon that word, "thy Redeemer," and marking how the repetition of the
          word by our Lord Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, adds a peculiar
          blessedness to the exhortation -- "Fear not, thou worm Jacob."
        </p>
        <p>
          First, methinks this was added for amplification; secondly for
          sweetness; thirdly, for confirmation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, when it says, "and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel," it
          was added FOR AMPLIFICATION. There are some preachers from whom you
          will never learn anything; not be cause they do not say much which is
          instructive, but because they just mention the instructive thought
          once, and immediately pass on to another thought, never expanding upon
          the second thought, but immediately passing on, almost without
          connection, to a third -- just casting forth, as it were, bare
          thoughts, without opening them up, and explaining them to the people.
          Such preachers are generally complained of as being very unprofitable
          to the hearers. "Why," said the hearer, "it made no impression upon
          me; it was good, but there was so much of it that I could not
          recollect it. I had nothing to bring away." Other preachers, on the
          other hand, follow a better method. Having given one idea, they
          endeavor to amplify it, so that their hearers, if they are not able to
          receive the idea in the abstract, at least are able to lay hold upon
          some of its points, when they come to the amplification of it. Now,
          God, the great Author of the great book, God, the preacher of the
          truth by his prophets, when he would preach it, and when he would
          write it, so amplifies a fact, so extends a truth, and enlarges upon a
          doctrine, says, "I will help thee, saith Jehovah." That means Father,
          Son, and Holy Ghost. "Ah! but," said God, "my people will forget that,
          unless I amplify the thought; so I will even break it up; I will
          remind them of my Trinity. They understand my Unity; I will bid them
          recollect that there are Three in One, though these Three be One;" and
          he adds, "thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. Jehovah -- Redeemer --
          Holy One of Israel -- three persons, all included, indeed, in the word
          Jehovah, but very likely to be forgotten unless they had been
          distinctly enumerated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, brethren, suffer your thoughts for a moment to enlarge upon the
          fact, that the promise contained in this verse, "Fear not, I will help
          thee" (I will help thee), is a promise from Three Divine Persons. Hear
          Jehovah, the everlasting Father, saying, "I will help them." "Mine are
          the ages: before the ages began, when there were no worlds, when
          nought had been created, from everlasting I am thy God. I am the God
          of election, the God of the decree, the God of the covenant; by my
          strength I did set fast the mountains, by my skill I laid the pillars
          of the earth; and the beams of the firmament of heaven; I spread out
          the skies as a curtain, and as a tent for man to dwell in; I the Lord
          made all these things. 'I will help thee.'" Then comes Jehovah the
          Son. "And I, also, am thy Redeemer, I am eternal; my name is wisdom. I
          was with God, when there were no depths, before he had digged the
          rivers, I was there as one brought up with him. I am Jesus, the God of
          ages; I am Jesus, the man of sorrows; ' I am he that liveth and was
          dead, I am alive for evermore.' I am the High Priest of your
          profession, the Intercessor before the throne, the Representative of
          my people. I have power with God. 'I will help thee.'" Poor worm, thy
          Redeemer vows to help thee; by his bleeding hands he covenants to give
          thee aid. And then in comes the Holy Spirit. "And I," saith the
          Spirit, "am also God -- not an influence, but a person -- I, eternal
          and everlasting, co-existent with the Father and the Son -- I, who did
          brood over chaos, when as yet the world was not brought into form and
          fashion, and did sow the earth with the seeds of life when I did brood
          over it, -- I, that brought again from the dead your Lord Jesus
          Christ, the Shepherd of the sheep, who am the Eternal Spirit, by whose
          power the Lord Jesus did arise from the thraldom of his tomb -- I, by
          whom souls are quickened, by whom the elect are called out of darkness
          into light -- I, who have the power to maintain my children and
          preserve them to the end -- 'I will help thee.'" Now, soul, gather up
          these three, and dost thou want more help than they can afford? What!
          dost thou need more strength than the omnipotence of the United
          Trinity? Dost thou want more wisdom than exists in the Father, more
          love than displays itself in the Son, and more power than is manifest
          in the influences of the Spirit? Bring hither thine empty pitcher!
          Sure this well will fill it. Haste! gather up thy wants, and bring
          them here -- thine emptiness, thy woes, thy needs. Behold, this river
          of God is full for thy supply. What canst thou want beside? Stand up,
          Christian, in this thy might Jehovah Father, Jehovah Jesus, Jehovah
          Spirit, -- these are with thee to help thee. This is the first thing.
          It is an amplification.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now, secondly, concerning that word, "thy Redeemer," it is a
          SWEETENING OF THE PROMISE. Did you never notice that a promise always
          seems all the sweeter for having Jesus in it? All the promises are yea
          and amen in him; but when a promise mentions the name of the Redeemer,
          it imparts a peculiar blessedness to it. Brethren, it is something
          like, if I may represent it by such a figure, the beautiful effect of
          certain decorations of stained glass. There are some persons whose
          eyes are so weak that the light seems to be injurious to them,
          especially the red rays of the sun, and a glass has been invented,
          which rejects the rays that are injurious, and allows only those to
          pass which are softened and modified to the weakness of the eye. It
          seems as if the Lord Jesus were some such a glass as this. The grace
          of God the Trinity, shining through the man Christ Jesus, becomes a
          mellow, soft light, so that mortal eye can bear it. My God, I could
          not drink from thy well, if thou hadst not put there the earthen
          pitcher of my Saviour; but with him living waters from thy sacred well
          I draw. Heaven! thou art too bright; I could not bear thine
          insufferable light, if I had not this shade with which I cover thee;
          but through it, as through a mist, I do behold the halo of thy glory,
          undiminished in its effulgence, but somewhat diminished in their
          potency which would be my destruction. The Saviour seems to calm his
          glory, to tone it down to our poor feeble frame. His name put into
          this wine of heaven, does not diminish in the least degree its
          sparkling and its exhilirating power; but it takes out of it that deep
          strength which might upset an angel's brain, if he could drink to his
          full. It takes away the profundity of mystery, which would make the
          deep old wine of the kingdom intoxicating rather than cheering. Christ
          Jesus cast into the river of God, makes all the streams more sweet;
          and when the believer sees God in the person of the Saviour, he then
          sees the God whom he can love, and to whom with boldness he can
          approach. Surely I love this promise all the better, because I think I
          see my Saviour, with his hand all bleeding, stamping his hand upon it,
          and saying, "And thy Redeemer," and there is the blood mark left upon
          the promise. It does seem to me as if when God uttered that promise to
          the poor worm Jacob, Jesus Christ could not be still. He heard his
          Father say, "Fear not, worm Jacob;" and he saw the poor worm, with his
          head on one side, with his eyes all flowing with tears, with his heart
          palpitating with terror, and his arms folded in dismay; and when his
          Father had said, "Fear not," he stepped from behind, and whispered in
          a voice more soft than the voice of his Father, "Fear not, worm Jacob,
          it is God that speaks;" and then the soft voice says, "And it is thy
          Redeemer that speaks too." He says, "Fear not." He who loves thee, who
          knows thee, who has felt what thou feelest, who has passed through the
          woes which thou art now enduring -- he who is thy Kinsman and thy
          Brother, he also says "Fear not, worm Jacob." Oh, it is sweet, it is
          precious to look upon that word, as spoken by our Redeemer.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now we come to the other point. I think this is put in by way
          of CONFIRMATION. "In the mouth of two or three witnesses surely the
          whole shall be established."
        </p>
        <p>"Blind unbelief is sure to err."</p>
        <p>
          It needs many witnesses to make such unbelieving souls as we are,
          believe the promises. "Now," says God, "I will help thee. Unbelief!
          wilt thou doubt Jehovah? Can the "I Am that I Am" lie? Can the God of
          faithfulness and truth deceive thee? O unbelief! infamous traitor!
          wilt thou dare to doubt him? Yes, and Christ knew it would; and so he
          comes in and he says, "and thy Redeemer," as a second witness; whilst
          the Spirit is the third. "Thy Redeemer," volunteers to be the second
          guarantee, the other security to the faithfulness of this promise. The
          Father will lose his honor if he breaks his word; and I too do give as
          the security for the fulfillment of this promise, my troth and honor
          also. "Thy Redeemer" engages that he will help thee, O thou worm!
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, I want you to read the promise, recollecting that it says,
          "Thy Redeemer ;" and then, as you read it through, you will see how
          the word "Redeemer" seems to confirm it all. Now begin. "I will help
          thee;" lay a stress on that word. If you read it so, there is one blow
          at your unbelief. "I will help thee," saith the Redeemer. "Others may
          not, but I have loved thee with an everlasting love, and by the bands
          of my lovingkindness have I drawn thee. 'I will help thee, though the
          earth forsake thee; though thy father and thy mother forsake thee, I
          will take thee up. Wilt thou doubt me? I have proved my love to thee.
          Behold this gash, this spear thrust in my side. Look hither at my
          hands: wilt thou but believe me? ' Tis I.' I said that on the waters,
          and I said to my people, Be not afraid; it is I.' I say to thee, now
          thou art on the waters, ' Be not afraid; I will help thee.' Sure thou
          needst not fear that I shall ever forget thee. Can a woman forget her
          sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her
          womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.' I have graven
          thee on my hands; thy walls are ever before me.' 'I will help thee.'"
          Now, you must just suppose the Saviour standing here -- that Man whose
          garments are red with blood; you must suppose him standing where I
          stand to-night, and saying to you, personally, "Fear not, I will help
          you." O my Lord, I have ungratefully doubted thy promise many a time;
          but methinks, if I could see thee in all thy woe and sorrow for me, if
          I could hear thee say, "I will help thee," I should cast myself at thy
          feet, and say, "Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief." But though
          he is not here to speak it, though the lips that utter it are but the
          lips of man, remember that he speaks through me to-night, and through
          his word, as truly as if he spoke himself. If some great man should by
          a servant, or by a letter send to you this message, "I will keep you,"
          though you had not heard his own lips declare it, yet if you saw his
          own hand writing, you would say, "It is enough, I believe it; there is
          the master's hand writing; it is his own autograph, it is written by
          himself; behold the bloody signature! It is stamped with his cross,
          and I his messenger am sent to-night to myself and to you, and I say
          to my own heart and to you, "Why art thou cast down, O my soul? Why
          art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet
          praise him; for the Redeemer says, I will help thee," and if he saith
          "I will help thee," who can doubt him? who dare distrust him?
        </p>
        <p>
          And now let us read the promise again, and lay the stress on the
          "will." Oh, the "wills" and the "shalls:" they are the sweetest words
          in the Bible. "I will help thee." W hen God says "I will," there is
          something in it, brethren. The will of God started worlds into
          existence; the will of God made nature leap from chaos; the will of
          God sustains all worlds, "bears the earth's huge pillars up," and
          establishes creation. It is God's "I will." He lets the world live;
          they live on the "will" of God; and if he willed that they should die,
          they must sink as the bubble into the breaker, when its moment has
          arrived. And if the "will" of God is so strong as that, may we not lay
          a great stress upon it here -- "I will help thee?" There is no doubt
          about it. I do not say I may help thee peradventure. No; I will. I do
          not say, that possibly I may be persuaded to help thee. No; I
          voluntarily will to help thee. "I will help thee." I do not say that,
          in an probability, ninety-nine chances out of a hundred, it is likely
          I may help thee. No; but without allowing any peradventure, or so much
          as a jot or tittle of hap or hazard, I will. Now, is there not
          strength in that? Indeed, my brethren, this is enough to cheer any
          man's spirit, however much he may be cast down, if God the Holy Spirit
          does but breathe upon the text, and let its spices flow abroad into
          our poor souls, "Fear not, I will help thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now we lay stress on another word: "I will help thee." That is
          very little for me to do, to help thee. Consider what I have done
          already. What! not help thee? Why, I bought thee with my blood. What!
          not help thee? I have died for thee; and if I have done the greater,
          will I not do the less? Help thee, my beloved! It is the least thing I
          will ever do for thee. I have done more, and I will do more. Before
          the day-star first began to shine I chose thee. "I will help thee." I
          made the covenant for thee, and exercised all the wisdom of my eternal
          mind in the scheming of the plan of salvation. "I will help thee." I
          became a man for thee; I doffed my diadem, and laid aside my robe; I
          laid the purple of the universe aside to become a man for thee. If I
          did this, I will help thee. I gave my life, my soul, for thee; I
          slumbered in the grave, I descended into Hades, all for thee; I will
          help thee. It will cost me nothing. Redeeming thee cost me much, but I
          have all and abound. In helping thee, I am giving thee what I have
          bought for thee already. It is no new thing. I can do it easily. "Help
          thee?" Thou needst never fear that. If thou needest a thousand times
          as much help as thou dost need, I would give it thee; but it is little
          that thou dost require compared with what I have to give. Tis great
          for thee to need, but it is nothing for me to bestow. "Help thee?"
          Fear not. If there were an ant at the door of thy granary asking for
          help, it would not ruin thee to give him a handful of thy wheat; and
          thou art nothing but a tiny insect at the door of my all-sufficiency.
          All that thou couldst ever eat, all that thou couldst ever take, if
          thou wert to take on to all eternity, would no more diminish my
          all-sufficiency, than the drinking of the fish would diminish the sea.
          No; "I will help thee." If I have died for thee, I will not leave
          thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, just take the last word -- "I will help thee." Lay the stress
          there. "Fear not, thou worm Jacob; I will help thee." If I let the
          stars fall, I will help thee; if I let all nature run to rack and
          ruin, I will help thee. If I permit the teeth of time to devour the
          solid pillars upon which the earth doth stand, yet I will help thee. I
          have made a covenant with the earth, "that seed-time and harvest,
          summer and winter, shall never cease;" but that covenant, though true,
          is not so great as the covenant that I have made concerning thee. And
          if I keep my covenant with the earth, I will certainly keep my
          covenant with my Son. "Fear not; I will help thee." Yes, thee! Thou
          sayest, "I am too little for help;" but I will help thee, to magnify
          my power; thou sayest, "I am too vile to be helped," but I will help
          thee to manifest my grace. Thou sayest, "I have been ungrateful for
          former help;" but I will help thee to manifest my faithfulness. Thou
          sayest, "But I shall still rebel, I shall still turn aside." "I will
          help thee," to show forth my long suffering: let it be known, "I will
          help thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now just conceive my Master on his gross bleeding there, looking
          down on you and on me. Picture him, whilst his voice falters with love
          and misery conjoined; and hear him. He has just now spoken to the
          thief, and he has said to him, "To-day, shalt thou be with me in
          Paradise." And after he has said that, he catches a sight of you and
          of me, poor and depressed, and he says, "Fear not, worm Jacob; I will
          help thee; I helped the thief -- I will help thee. I promised him that
          he should be with me in paradise; I may well promise thee that thou
          shalt be helped. I will help thee. O Master! may thy love that prompts
          thee thus to speak, prompt us to believe thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now hear Him again. He is exalted on high; he hath "led captivity
          captive and received gifts for men;" -- now hear him, as in the midst
          of the solemn pomp of heaven he is not unmindful of his poor
          relations. He looks down, and he sees us in this world still
          struggling with sin and care and woe; he hears us claiming kingship
          with himself; and he says, "Worm Jacob! though I now do reign exalted
          high, my love is still as great. I will help thee." I pray the Lord
          apply the sweetness of that pronoun to your hearts, my brethren, and
          to mine. "I will help thee." O surely when the husband speaks to the
          wife in the hour of darkness and sorrow, and comforts her, you can
          easily understand what arguments he uses, when he says, "Wife of my
          youth! my joy, my delight, I will help thee!" You can easily conceive
          how he enumerates times of love, seasons when he stood by her in the
          hour of trouble; you can easily think how he reminds her of the days
          of their espousals, and tells her of their struggles, and of their
          joys; and he says, "Wife, canst thou doubt me? No; as I am a husband I
          will help thee! And now you hear the Saviour speaking of his church.
          "Betrothed to me ere time began, I have taken thee into union with my
          adorable person; and O my bride, though my palace stand in ruins, and
          heaven itself should shake, I will help thee. Forget thee? Forget my
          bride? Be false to my troth? Forsake my covenant? No; never. I will
          help thee." Hear the mother speaking to her little child in great
          danger; "Child," she says, "I will help thee;" and then she reminds
          that child that she is its mother, that from her breast the child drew
          its needed nourishment in the days of weakness; she reminds it how she
          has nursed it, and dandled it upon her knee, and how in every way she
          has been its solace and support. "Child !" says she, and her heart
          runs over -- "I will help thee!" Why, the child never doubts it, it
          says, "Yes, mother, I know you will; I am sure of that, I do not need
          to be told it, I was certain you would, for I have had such proofs of
          your love." And now ought not we who love the Saviour just to let our
          eyes run with tears, and say, "O thou blest Redeemer! thou needst not
          tell us thou wilt help us, for we know thou wilt. Oh do not suppose
          that we doubt thee so much as to want to be told of it again; we know
          thou will help us; we are sure of it; thy former love, thine ancient
          love, the love of thine espousals, thy deeds of kindness, thine
          everlasting drawings, all these declare that thou never canst forsake
          us." No, no; "I will help thee."

          And now, brethren, we are coming down stairs to eat the body of Christ
          and drink his blood in a spiritual manner; and I hope whilst we are
          partaking of that bread and wine, the emblems of the Saviour, we shall
          think we hear every mouthful of bread and every sip of wine saying out
          in the Master's behalf, "I will help thee, I will help thee." And then
          let us just frighten Satan, by cheering up our spirits through the
          power of the Holy Ghost, and buckling on our armor, let us go forth
          into the world to-morrow, to show what the Redeemer can do, when his
          promise is applied by the Spirit. "Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye
          men of Israel; I will help thee." Come, bring your fears out to-night,
          and serve them in the worst way you can. Hang them here upon the
          scaffold this night. Come now, and blow them away at the great guns of
          the promises, let them be destroyed forever. They are renegade
          mutineers; let them be cut off, let them be utterly destroyed, and let
          us go and sing, "Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be
          removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the
          sea; though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the
          mountains shake with the swelling thereof." "I will help thee," saith
          the Redeemer.
        </p>
        <p>
          O sinners, I pity you, that this is not your promise. If this were all
          that you did lose by being out of Christ, it were enough to lose
          indeed. May God call you, and help you to trust in the Redeemer's
          blood. Amen.<br />
