        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.2718)</p>
        <p>Intended for Reading on Lord's-Day, March 17th, 1901,</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.</p>
        <p>On Thursday Evening, May 13th, 1880.</p>
        <p>
          "Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we
          trust that he will yet deliver us." -- 2 Corinthians 1:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHEN children are learning their grammar, they have to pay particular
          attention to the tenses of the verbs; and it is important for
          Christians also to remember their tenses, -- to recollect the past,
          the present, and the future. Our text brings all three very vividly
          before us, and reminds us that God hath delivered, doth deliver, and
          will yet deliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, let us think for a little while concerning the past. How old
          art thou, my friend? How many of thy years hast thou employed
          profitably, and how many hast thou allowed to run to waste? For how
          many years hast thou wrought the will of the flesh, and been a servant
          of sin and Satan? How long hast thou been born again? What is thine
          age spiritually? Take down the record of thy life, and examine it,
          from the days of thy childhood, through youth and early manhood, up
          till now. It is a book which should do us good to read; in some
          respects, all its pages may make us weep; and yet, viewed in another
          light, many of them may give us cause to sing. This is the one book in
          the library that many people do not like to take down and read, for
          there are so many blots in it, and so many humbling records; yet "God
          requireth that which is past," and it is a token of wisdom for a man
          to talk with his past years, and to learn from them the many lessons
          they are able to teach. All the days we have lived will go before us
          to the judgment seat, and each one will bear its record, and leave it
          there; so let us not be oblivious of that which God remembers, but let
          us recollect it that we may be penitent for all that has been wrong in
          it, and that we may be grateful for all that has been right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, think about the second part of life, namely, the time present;
          and here let me urge upon you, dear friends, the importance of valuing
          the present. In fact, time present is the only time that you have. The
          past has gone, and you cannot recall it; the future will never really
          be yours, for, when it comes, it will be present, too. It is only in
          the present that we live; so that, if we waste these precious hours
          that are with us now, we waste all that we have. If we serve not God
          to-day, when will we serve him? To-morrow? Nay, for when that
          opportunity comes, "to-morrow" will have been changed into "to-day."
          Let us endeavor, as God shall help us, even to watch our moments so as
          not to waste one of them. It is a good thing to have our life divided
          up into short periods. The other day, I saw John Wesley's diary, or
          rather, horary, for it had in it not merely an entry for every day,
          but for every distinct occupation for every twenty minutes. The good
          man made his days to have many hours in them, and his hours seemed to
          have more minutes in them than most men's hours have, because he did
          not waste any of them, but diligently used them all in his Master's
          service. God help us all to do the same by paying great attention to
          the present portion of our life!
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the future, there is an idle curiosity which prompts men to try
          to live in it; that we must renounce. But there is a gracious
          expectation which enables us to live in it, a holy anxiety which
          prompts us to prepare for it. It is greatly wise for us to talk with
          those years that are to come if we talk with them in view of their
          end. I would have you familiar with your graves, for you will soon be
          in them; and more familiar still with your resurrection
          dwelling-place, remembering that God "hath raised us up together, and
          made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." Let us often
          project ourselves beyond the present into the future; to gather
          strength from the future, is frequently the best way to deal with the
          present. You will be able more easily to bear your present burdens
          when you think how short is the time in which you will have to carry
          them. Your "light affliction, which is but for a moment," will seem
          scarcely like a feather's weight to you when you anticipate the "far
          more exceeding and eternal weight of glory" which God hath prepared
          for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recommend to you, therefore, this rule of three, and advise you
          always to consider the past, the present, and the future; and just now
          I invite you to do so in connection with the delivering mercy of God.
          He hath delivered us; he doth deliver us; he will deliver us. And,
          first, I am going to point out to you three trains of thought; next,
          three lines of argument; and, thirdly, three inferences.
        </p>
        <p>I. First, THE TEXT SUGGESTS THREE TRAINS OF THOUGHT.</p>
        <p>
          The first is this, memory, which tells us of the deliverances in the
          past: "who delivered us from so great a death." Take the words exactly
          as Paul wrote them, and recall how God has delivered some of us from
          death. A few here, perhaps, have been very near to death in sickness.
          Some of us have several times in our lives looked into eternity; our
          illness has been no child's play, and we have realized the
          possibility, or even the probability of our soon passing away from all
          the engagements of this mortal life, and standing before our God. But
          we have been raised up again; we have come forth from our chamber,
          tottering on our staff, perhaps, through weakness, yet we are still
          preserved, the living, the living, to praise the Lord, as we do this
          day. I have no doubt that almost all of you have had, at one time or
          another, some very special proof that "unto God the Lord belong the
          issues from death."
        </p>
        <p>
          Our past deliverances, however, have not only been from physical
          death; we have had greater deliverances than that. There was, first of
          all, our deliverance from spiritual death. Do you not remember the
          time, dear brother, dear sister, when you were brought out of nature's
          darkness into God's marvellous light? You say that you do not know the
          day when this great change took place; never mind if you do not, it is
          not at all essential if you can now say, "One thing I know, that,
          whereas I was blind, now I see." Some of us do remember the very day
          when we came to Christ, and rested in him; and we do, with our whole
          heart and soul, bless him that we were delivered from that terrible
          death which had so long held us in captivity. God rescued us by his
          grace, and enabled us to come forth from our grave of sin, looking
          unto Jesus, and longing to be made like him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, some of you remember when you were delivered from despair. It
          is an awful thing to be driven away from all hope of salvation, and to
          be at your wits' end. You were not all brought to Christ in a terrible
          tempest, as some of us were; many of you came to him under happier
          circumstances. Be very thankful that it was so; but some of us were
          hard put to it when we tried to touch the hem of his garment, we were
          pressed and crushed in the crowd, and seemed to lose our very breath.
          I remember how, when I was under conviction of sin, my soul rolled to
          and fro, and staggered like a drunken man; yet the Lord delivered me,
          and taught me to rest upon him, and thus even full assurance became
          possible although I had thought, aforetime, that mercy could never
          reach me. Beloved, if I am describing your experience as well as my
          own, let us together bless the Lord for his mercy in deliverance from
          so great a death. The remembrance of our deliverance from sin and
          despair must take the first rank amongst our grateful reminiscences.
        </p>
        <p>
          But since then, have you not been many times delivered out of
          temptation? You said, with the psalmist, "My feet were almost gone; my
          steps had well nigh slipped;" yet the Lord graciously preserved you.
          If you look back with careful eye, you will see many occasions where,
          if it had not been for interposing mercy, you would either have fallen
          into the bog on your right hand, or into the quagmire on your left. If
          the Lord had not piloted your vessel, it would have been wrecked on
          the rocks of Scylla or engulfed in the whirlpool of Charybdis. Do you
          not wonder, sometimes, how you ever got through that peculiar
          temptation, which was so suitable to your circumstances, and so
          fascinating to your flesh? Yet you did not know, at the time, that it
          was a temptation; and you had not the wisdom necessary to meet the
          craft of Satan; yet you were not taken captive in the Satanic net,
          cunningly as it was spread; and for that deliverance you must bless
          the name of the Lord. There are some of you who ought to praise him
          for deliverances over which you wept at the time. He would not let you
          have what you desired; you were disappointed, and you talked about
          your heart being broken. Ah! but the Lord's dealings with you saved
          you from having a broken heart. You said, "Alas! alas! I have lost
          something which I fondly cherished." It was well that you did lose it,
          for that which you thought was a bracelet sparkling with jewels was a
          viper, which, had you grasped it, would have stung you to death.
          Blessed be God for not hearing some of our prayers! Blessed be the
          Lord for not gratifying many of our desires!
        </p>
        <p>
          We ought to praise him, too, for our deliverances in the time of
          trouble. You are not all tried alike. I am very thankful that some of
          you are not troubled as others are; but I know that I am addressing
          some whose trials have been very many and very heavy. Your road has
          been a very rough one. John Bunyan truly says, "A Christian man is
          seldom long at ease; when one trouble's gone, another doth seize;" and
          that has been true in the lives of many of us. We can say, with the
          psalmist, "We went though fire and through water." Some of God's
          children have been brought very low in their circumstances, so that
          they have had to live "from hand to mouth," -- though I do not know
          that many of us live very differently from that; -- but there are some
          godly people who never have any reserve store even if they do not
          actually come to want. I do not know that there is anything very
          grievous in that, for the sparrows and the ravens live in that style,
          yet God cares for them. But some of you find it to be a trial to have
          scantiness in the home, or sickness in your own person, or one who is
          dear to you as your own life constantly afflicted. There are all sorts
          of losses and crosses, trials and troubles, for the godly to endure.
          Yes; but none of these things have crushed us yet, for the Lord hath
          delivered us. Here is a poor widow, and she wonders how she ever
          brought up that large family of little children. She scarcely knew how
          to provide for them all when she had a husband, and yet, when the head
          of the house was gone, they were provided for; it is very wonderful,
          yet it was done; and you, who seemed to see all your prospects
          suddenly dissolve, like the mirage of the desert, were helped. You
          said, at one time, "If such-and-such a thing should happen, it would
          kill me." It did happen, yet it did not kill you, for you are here to
          testify to the Lord's delivering mercy. One Job's messenger after
          another came to bring you evil tidings, yet the Lord delivered you
          from the trials which threatened to crush you. I cannot stay to
          mention all those past deliverances; and, probably, most of them are
          not even known to us. Glory be to God for unknown mercies, -- favours
          which came in the night when we most needed them, favours which helped
          us to sleep and to awake refreshed, favours that stole, with silent
          footfall, into our home and our heart, and went away leaving traces of
          the sacred oil of divine mercy behind them.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is the first train of thought, -- memory, which tells of
          deliverances in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second is observation, which calls attention to present
          deliverance: "and doth deliver." Open your eyes, my brethren and
          sisters, and see how God is delivering you at this moment. I do not
          say that, with the most widely opened eye, you will perceive all your
          deliverances; for, many times, you have been saved from trouble,
          while, on other occasions, you have been delivered out of it. I have
          often told you the story of the good old Puritan who met his son at a
          half-way house. When the young man came in, he said, "Father, I had a
          very special providence as I rode here to-day." "What was that, my
          son?" "My horse stumbled three times very badly, yet I was not
          thrown." "And I have had an equally special providence in riding
          here." "What was that?" "My horse never stumbled all the way, so I was
          not thrown." You know that, if we are in a railway accident, and
          escape from any hurt, we say, "What a providence!" Yes, but what a
          providence it was when you were preserved from a railway accident by
          stopping at home! Oftentimes, we do not see the very thing that has
          the most of mercy in it. What evidences of divine deliverance there
          are in the fact that you are here this moment! A comparatively
          trifling incident might have resulted in your death. You may be,
          tomorrow morning, in doubt as to which of two ways you should take;
          but there will be the providence of God directing you which to choose,
          and your choice of that one may affect the whole of the rest of your
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are not just now being assailed by any temptation, it is
          because God is delivering you from it. Yet it may be that Satan is
          planning some fresh temptation with which to assail you; but, though
          he desires to have you that he may sift you as wheat, Christ is
          praying for you, that your faith fail not. We might have fallen into
          doctrinal error had it not been for God's restraining mercy. How apt
          thoughtful people are to be carried away by the particular novelty of
          the hour! It seems as if they could not resist the cogency of the
          argument by which the new teaching is supported, but we have been kept
          from yielding to it by having our hearts established in the faith, so
          that we have not believed every novel doctrine, but have judged it by
          the Word of God, and so have been kept from wandering into devious
          ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          How graciously God is preserving many of us from the tongue of
          slander! It is a wonderful thing for any man to live much in public
          without being accused of some vile crime; and the woman who lives in
          the most retired position, the housewife who does nothing but look
          after her own children, will find somebody or other slandering her.
          You cannot always escape from the envenomed tongue of slander, be you
          what you will and where you will; and for God to keep the reputation
          of any Christian man unstained year after year, is a subject for the
          greatest thankfulness.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not know where or what we might have been if God's gracious
          protection had not been like a wall of fire round about us, as it is
          even now, for still doth the Lord deliver all those who put their
          trust in him. I want you, dear brothers and sisters, to believe with
          unquestioning confidence that God is delivering you just now. You know
          that he has delivered you, be quite as sure that he is delivering you
          at this moment. "Oh!" says one, "I am shut up in the dungeon of
          despair." Yes; but your Lord has a key that can open the door, and so
          let you out. "Ay; but I am in great want." But he knows all about it,
          and he has his basket in his hand full of good things with which he is
          going to supply all your needs. "Oh!" says another, "but I am sinking
          in the flood." But he is throwing the life-belt over you. "Oh, but I
          am fainting!" But he is putting a bottle of sweet perfume to your nose
          to refresh your spirit. God is near thee, to revive and cheer thy
          fainting soul. Perhaps someone says, "I find faith concerning the past
          and concerning the ultimate future tolerably easy; but it is faith for
          the next hour or two I cannot so readily exercise." At certain times,
          it is found that trial is peculiarly present, but one cannot always
          realize that God is "a very present help in trouble;" yet it is true.
          He hath delivered, and he doth deliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third train of thought in this, -- expectation looks out of the
          window upon the future: "in whom we trust that he will yet deliver
          us." Yes, dear friends, there may be many trials before you yet; but
          there is a mass of mercy laid up in store to meet those trials.
          Troubles such as you have never yet known, as well as repetitions of
          those you have experienced, will surely come upon you; but as your
          days are, so shall your strength be, for your Lord will continue to
          deliver you. As the eyes gradually fail, and the limbs grow weak, and
          the infirmities of age creep over us, we are apt to be distressed; yet
          our Lord will not forsake us. When severe sickness invades our mortal
          frame, and our pains are multiplied and intensified, we wonder how we
          shall hold out to the end; and especially as we look forward to the
          time of death, -- not always viewing it in the true light, we say,
          "What shall we do in the swellings of Jordan? How shall we be able to
          bear the stern realities of our last hours?" Be of good comfort, my
          brother, my sister; he who hath delivered, and doth deliver, will yet
          deliver. As surely as the trial comes, the way of escape shall be
          opened up for you by your Lord. Will you try to realize all this of
          which I have been speaking? He hath delivered you; then, give him your
          gratitude: he is delivering you; then, give him your confidence: he
          will deliver you; then give him a full and joyful expectation, and
          begin even now to praise him for mercies which are yet to come, and
          for grace which you have not tasted yet, but which you shall taste in
          his good time.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, in the second place, THE TEXT SUPPLIES THREE LINES OF
          ARGUMENT, all running to the same point.
        </p>
        <p>
          The point to be proved is that the Lord will deliver his people; and I
          argue that he will deliver us in the future because he has already
          begun to deliver us. There is a chain of continuity here; he hath
          delivered, he doth deliver, and he will deliver. He began to work for
          our deliverance long before we sought him. The first movement was not
          from us to God, but from God to us. We were lying dead in trespasses
          and sins, and he came and quickened us. He gave his Son to die for us
          many centuries before we were born; he provided the gospel for us long
          before you and I had ever sinned; in all things he had the start, and
          was beforehand with us. Yet he need not have done all this, except
          that it was by his own choice and free will that he acted. I do
          rejoice in the free will of God which moved him to deliver us.

          Surely, then, since the motive that impelled him to save us must have
          been in himself alone, that motive is still there. If he had begun to
          deliver us because he saw some goodness in us, or because we first
          applied to him, then he might leave us after all; but as the
          commencement was with himself, out of his own heart, spontaneously,
          depend upon it that, as he began the work, he will carry it on. God
          has no more knowledge of any one of us than he had at the first. When
          he began with us, he knew what we should be; foresaw all our sins and
          all our follies, all our ingratitude and all our backsliding. He did
          not enter, blindfold, upon a task which, after second thoughts, he
          would have to relinquish; but, even from eternity, he saw us just as
          we have turned out to be. Yet he began with us; and having begun with
          the deliberation of eternal love, let us be quite sure that he will
          prosecute his gracious purpose with the perseverance of eternal love.
          If there had been, at the first, some reason in us why God should
          begin to deliver us, then, that reason being removed from us, God
          might cease to deliver us; but as the reason was not in us, but in
          himself, since he can never change, the reason for our deliverance
          abides the same, and the argument is good and clear, -- God hath
          delivered us, then he will deliver us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next argument comes from the fact that, as he is now delivering
          us, therefore he will continue to do so. Here is the continuity of his
          grace. Now look, beloved; he has, up to this hour, continued to
          deliver you and me who have trusted him. How many times has he
          delivered me? Out of how many troubles have I been delivered? From how
          many sins have I been delivered? Well, then, if the Lord has kept on
          delivering me so long, I argue that, if he had ever meant to stop, he
          would have stopped before now; and, therefore, --
        </p>
        <p>"His love in time past forbids me to think</p>
        <p>He'll leave me at last in trouble to sink;</p>
        <p>Each sweet Ebenezer I have in review,</p>
        <p>Confirms his good pleasure to help me quite through."</p>
        <p>
          When a man begins to build, we reckon that he will finish the building
          if he can. We know that our God can complete what he has commenced, so
          we conclude that he will do so. I feel that he has gone so far with me
          that he cannot give me up now.
        </p>
        <p>"Can he have taught me to trust in his name,</p>
        <p>And thus far have brought me to put me to shame?"</p>
        <p>
          No, that can never be; and many of you must feel just as I do about
          this matter. Some of you are, as it were, sitting on the very doorstep
          of heaven; you are over eighty years of age, so you cannot be here
          long; cannot you trust the Lord for the few months or years you have
          yet to live? He has been helping you, my aged sister, ever since you
          were a girl; and he has delivered you out of all sorts of troubles, do
          you think that he will leave you now? And my dear venerable brother,
          you knew the Lord when you were but a boy, and he has never left you
          yet; will he forsake you now? No; blessed be his name, he will not!
          All those years of his favour go to confirm us in the conviction that
          he will keep on delivering us till he brings us safely home.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord has not only delivered us so often, but he has also done it
          in such a wonderful way, that he must go on working in a similar
          fashion. What marvellous wisdom has he sometimes displayed in
          delivering us from the consequences of our own folly! Often hath he
          seemed to lavish his mercy upon us that he might help us in our time
          of need, and not once has he failed us. There is not one broken
          promise of his, nor one covenant blessing that he has ever withheld
          from us. If any of you, who have known him the longest, have aught to
          say against your God, say it; but you have not. You have never had any
          reason for doubting him, nor have you ever had any suspicion of his
          faithfulness raised in your mind by anything that he has done which
          might lead you to mistrust him in the future. He hath delivered, he is
          delivering, and he will yet deliver. There are two arguments drawn
          from the past and the present.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best argument, however, comes from God himself: "in whom we
          trust." He is always the same, and everything is ever present to his
          unchanging mind. What was the nature of God when he first determined
          to deliver me? Was it love? Then, it is love now. What was the motive
          which impelled the Son of God when he came from above, and snatched me
          from the deep waters? It was love, surprising love; and it is
          surprising love which still moves him to deliver me. Did I sing about
          his faithfulness, the other day? That faithfulness is just the same
          to-day. Have I adored his wisdom? That wisdom is not exhausted.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is not only the same nature in God as there always was, but
          there is also the same unchanging purpose. You and I shift and change;
          and we are obliged to do so, because we make rash promises and faulty
          plans; but God, who is infinitely wise, always keeps to his purpose.
          Now, if it was his original purpose to save us, -- and it must have
          been, or he would never have delivered us as he has done, -- that
          purpose still stands, and shall for ever stand. Though earth's old
          columns bow, though heaven and earth shall pass away, as the morning
          rime dissolves in the beams of the rising sun, yet the decree of the
          immutable Jehovah shall never be changed. "For the Lord of hosts hath
          purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his hand is stretched out,
          and who shall turn it back?
        </p>

          III. Time fails me, so I can only very briefly show you that THE TEXT
          IS OPEN TO THREE INFERENCES.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first inference I draw from it is, that we shall always be in
          danger so long as we are here. The Lord hath delivered, doth deliver,
          and he will deliver, so we shall always need divine deliverance while
          we are in this world. We must not expect here to be ever out of
          gun-shot of the enemy. You may depend upon it, brethren and sisters in
          Christ, that you will always have tribulation as long as you are in
          the world, you will have trials in the flesh, you will have trials in
          the spirit, you will have trials from God, and trials from Satan; and
          if, at any time, you are a long while without any trouble, keep a good
          look-out for it, for it is probably on the way to you. We should
          always suspect some danger nigh when we perceive too much delight.
          When God has given us a long stretch of smooth sailing, it well
          behoves us to steer our vessel cautiously, and to be ready to furl our
          sails at any moment, for a cyclone may be upon us before we know where
          we are. We need not ask the Lord to send us trouble, but when it
          comes, let us have the grace to accept it, and to glorify God in it.
          While we are in this world, we shall always know that it is the world,
          so let us not make any mistake about the matter; the devil is the
          devil, the world is the world, and the flesh is the flesh. None of
          these things have changed, and the mercy is that God has not changed,
          he is still the same as ever he was. If I found that the world was not
          the world, I might be afraid that God was not God; but that can never
          be the case, So, as trials are always arising, I may fairly suspect
          that they always will come while this time-state lasts; but I also
          fully believe that God will always be the same, and that he will
          deliver all who trust in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second inference from the text is, that we may constantly expect a
          display of God's delivering grace. The past says, "He has delivered;"
          the present says, "He doth deliver;" and the future says, "He will yet
          deliver." Yesterday, God was very gracious to me; to-morrow he will be
          very gracious to me; and the same will be true the next day, and the
          next day, and the next day, until there shall be no more days, and
          time shall be swallowed up in eternity. Between here and heaven, every
          minute that the Christian lives will be a minute of grace. From here
          to the throne of the Highest, you will have to be continually supplied
          with new grace from the Lord who sits on high. Dear brother, you never
          live a truly holy, happy, blessed day, except by divine grace. You
          never think a right thought, never do a right act, you never make any
          advance heavenward except by grace. I like to think that it is so,
          that every day I am a monument of mercy; that every day a fresh
          display of sovereign grace is made to me; every day my Father feeds
          me, my Saviour cleanses me, the Comforter sustains me. Every day, new
          manifestations of the lovingkindness of the Lord break forth upon my
          wondering soul, and give me fresh visions of his miraculous love. I
          could not find another word to express what I wanted to say, that one
          seemed to leap into my mouth just then, -- his miraculous love! And so
          it is, miracle-working love, making the Christian's life to be a
          series of miracles, at which angels shall gaze for ever in astonished
          adoration of the amazing love of God to guilty men. So I reckon that
          we may go onward with great confidence; for, although every day will
          bring dangers, every day will also witness divine deliverances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, the last inference I draw from the text is, that our whole
          life should be filled with praise of God our Deliverer. How doth it
          run? He delivered us, and now we deliver ourselves? No, no, no! He
          delivered us; he doth deliver us; -- but what about the future? We
          must deliver ourselves? No, no, no! He hath delivered; he doth
          deliver; and he will yet deliver; -- the same Person, working in the
          beginning, in the centre, and at the close. It is all of God from
          first to last; there is not one deliverance which you have ever had
          which you can ascribe to anyone but the Lord alone. Inside heaven's
          gate, all the praise is given to the Triune Jehovah: "Glory be to the
          Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost; as it was in the
          beginning, is now, and ever shall be;" and outside heaven's gate, let
          us sing the same song, to the same tune; let it always be to the
          praise of grace, grace, GRACE; to the God of grace, the Father of
          grace, the Christ of grace, the Holy Ghost and his grace; and to God
          be all the glory, for ever and for ever! Amen.
