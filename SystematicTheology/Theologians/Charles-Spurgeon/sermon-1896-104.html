          As the majority of mankind expect to prosper by evil deeds, and as
          they generally endeavor to enrich themselves by plunder, fraud, and
          every species of injustice, the prophet enumerates the blessings of
          God which attend those who worship him in purity, in order that we may
          know that, in aiming at a life of piety and morality, we shall not
          lose our reward. <br />
