        <p>On the Nature of Christ.</p>
        <p>
          For there is no need, to persons of intelligence, to attempt to prove,
          from the deeds of Christ subsequent to His baptism, that His soul and
          His body, His human nature like ours, were real, and no phantom of the
          imagination. For the deeds done by Christ after His baptism, and
          especially His miracles, gave indication and assurance to the world of
          the Deity hidden in His flesh. For, being at once both God and perfect
          man likewise, He gave us sure indications of His two natures: of His
          Deity, by His miracles during the three years that elapsed after His
          baptism; of His humanity, during the thirty similar periods which
          preceded His baptism, in which, by reason of His low estate as regards
          the flesh, He concealed the signs of His Deity, although He was the
          true God existing before all ages.
