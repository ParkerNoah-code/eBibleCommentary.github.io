        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1028)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's Day Morning, January 7th, 1872, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right
          hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: I
          am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore,
          Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death." -- Revelation 1:17-18.
        </p>
        <p>
          LOW THOUGHTS OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST are exceedingly mischievous to
          believers. If you sink your estimate of him you shift everything else
          in the same proportion. He who thinks lightly of the Savior thinks so
          much the less of the evil of sin; and, consequently, he becomes
          callous as to the past, careless as to the present, and venturesome as
          to the future. He thinks little of the punishment due to sin, because
          he has small notions of the atonement made for sin. Christian activity
          for right is also abated; as well as holy horror of wrong. He who
          thinks lightly of the Lord Jesus renders to him but small service; he
          does not estimate the Redeemer's love at a rate high enough to stir
          his soul to ardor; if he does not count the blood wherewith he was
          redeemed an unholy thing, yet he thinks it a small matter, not at all
          sufficient to claim from him life-long service. Gratitude is weak when
          favors are undervalued. He serves little who loves little, and he
          loves little who has no sense of having been greatly beloved. The man
          who thinks lightly of Christ also has but poor comfort as to his own
          security. With a little Savior I am still in danger, but if he be the
          mighty God, able to save unto the uttermost, then am I safe in his
          protecting hand, and my consolations are rich and abounding. In these,
          and a thousand other ways, an unworthy estimate of our Lord will prove
          most solemnly injurious. The Lord deliver us from this evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          If our conceptions of the Lord Jesus are very enlarged, they will only
          be his due. We cannot exaggerate here. He deserves higher praise than
          we can ever render to him. As high as the heavens are above the earth,
          so high is be above our loftiest conceptions. Even when the angels
          strike their loudest notes, and chant his praises most exultingly on
          their highest festal days, the music falls far short of his
          excellence. He is higher than a seraph's most soaring thought! Rise
          then, my brethren, as on eagle's wings, and let your adoring souls
          magnify and extol the Lord your Savior.
        </p>
        <p>
          When our thoughts of Jesus are expanded and elevated, we obtain right
          ideas upon other matters. In the light of his love and atoning
          sacrifice, we see the depth of the degradation from which such a
          Redeemer has uplifted us, and we hate, with all our hearts, the sins
          which pierced such an altogether lovely one, and made it needful for
          the Lord of life to die. Forming some adequate estimate of what Jesus
          has done for us, our gratitude grows, and with our gratitude our love
          -- while love compels us to consecration, and consecration suggests
          heroic self-denying actions. Then are we bold to speak for him, and
          ready, if needs be, to suffer for him while we feel we could give up
          all we have to increase his glory, without so much as dreaming that we
          had made a sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let your thoughts of Christ be high, and your delight in him will be
          high too; your sense of security will be strong, and with that sense
          of security will come the sacred joy and peace which always keep the
          heart which confidently reposes in the mediator's hands. If thou
          wouldst thyself be raised, let thy thoughts of Christ be raised. If
          thou wouldst rise above these earthly toys, thou must have higher and
          more elevated thoughts of him who is high above all things. Earth
          sinks as Jesus rises. Honor the Son even as thou wouldst honor the
          Father, and, in so doing, thy soul shall be sanctified and brought
          into closer fellowship with the great Father of Spirits, whose delight
          it is to glorify his Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          My object, this morning, is to suggest some few truths to your
          recollection which may help to set the Lord Jesus on a glorious high
          throne within your hearts. My motto, this morning, will be --
        </p>
        <p>"Bring forth the royal diadem</p>
        <p>And crown him Lord of all."</p>
        <p>
          My anxiety is that he may be crowned with many crowns in all these
          many hearts, and that you may now perform those exercises of faith,
          those delightful acts of adoring love, which shall bring to him great
          glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Coming to the text, the first thing we notice in it is THE DISCIPLE
          OVERPOWERED. We will meditate a little while upon that. John writes,
          "And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead."
        </p>
        <p>
          The beloved disciple was favored with an unusual vision of his
          glorified Lord. In the blaze of that revelation even his eagle eye was
          dimmed and his holy soul was overwhelmed. He was overpowered, but not
          with ecstacy. At first sight it would have seemed certain that excess
          of delight would have been John's most prominent feeling; it would
          appear certain that to see his long lost Master, whom he had so dearly
          loved, would have caused a rush of joy to John's soul, and that if
          overpowered at all, it would have been with ecstatic bliss. That it
          was not so is clear from the fact that our Lord said to him, "Fear
          not." Fear was far more in the ascendant than holy joy. I will not say
          that John was unhappy, but, certainly, it was not delight which
          prostrated him at the Savior's feet; and I gather from this that if
          we, in our present embodied state, were favored with an unveiled
          vision of Christ, it would not make a heaven for us; we may think it
          would, but we know not what spirit we are of. Such new wine, if put
          into these old bottles, would cause them to burst. Not heaven but
          deadly faintness would be the result of the beatific vision, if
          granted to these earthly eyes. We should not say, if we could behold
          the King in his beauty as we now are, "I gazed upon him, and my heart
          leaped for joy," but like John we should have to confess, "When I saw
          him I fell at his feet as dead." There is a time for everything, and
          this period of our sojourn in flesh and blood is not the season for
          seeing the Redeemer face to face: that vision will be ours when we are
          fully prepared for it. We are as yet too feeble to bear the far more
          exceeding and eternal weight of glory. I do not say but what we are so
          prepared by his grace that, if now he took us away from this body, are
          should be able to bear the splendor of his face; but, I do say, that
          flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, and that when, as
          an exception to the rule, a mortal man is permitted to behold his
          Lord, his flesh and blood are made to feel the sentence of death
          within themselves, and to fall as if slain by the revelation of the
          Lord. We ought, therefore, to thank God that "he holdeth back the face
          of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it." That face which
          shines as the sun in its strength, manifests its love by wearing as
          yet a concealing veil. Be grateful, that while you are to be here to
          serve him, and to do his will in suffering for him, he does not
          deprive you of your power to serve or suffer, by overwhelming you with
          excessive revelations. It is an instance of the glory of God's grace
          that he conceals his majesty from his people, and wraps clouds and
          darkness round about him; this he does not to deny his saints a bliss
          which they might covet, but to preserve them from an unseasonable joy,
          which, as yet, they are not capable of bearing. We shall see him as he
          is, when he shall be like him, but not till then. That for a while we
          may be able to perform the duties of this mortal life, and not lie
          perpetually stretched like dead men at his feet, he doth not manifest
          himself to us in the clear light which shone upon the seer of Patmos.
        </p>
        <p>
          I beg you to notice with care this beloved disciple in his fainting
          fit, and note first, the occasion of it. He says, "I saw him." This it
          was that made him faint with fear. "I saw HIM." He had seen him on
          earth, but not in his full glory as the first begotten from the dead,
          and the prince of the kings of the earth. When our Savior dwelt among
          men, in order to their redemption, he made himself of no reputation,
          and took upon himself the form of a servant; for this reason he
          restrained the flashings of his Deity, and the godhead shone through
          the manhood with occasional and softened rays. But now, Jesus was
          resplendent as the ancient of days, girt with a golden girdle, with a
          countenance outshining the sun in its strength, and this even the best
          beloved apostle could not endure. He could gaze with dauntless eye
          upon the throne of jasper and the rainbow of emerald, he could view
          with rapture the sea of glass like unto crystal, and the seven lamps
          of fire burning before the throne, but the vision of the Lord himself
          was too much for him. He who quailed not when the doors of both heaven
          and hell were opened to him in vision, yet fell lifeless when he saw
          the Lord. None either in earth or heaven can compare with Jesus in
          glory. Oh for the day when we shall gaze upon his glory and partake in
          it. Such is his sacred will concerning us. "Father, I will that they
          also whom thou hast given me may be with me where I am, that they may
          behold my glory." To bear that sight we shall need to be purified and
          strengthened. God himself must enlarge and strengthen our faculties,
          for as yet, like the disciples upon labor, we should be bewildered by
          the brightness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here was the occasion of his faintness. But what was the reason why a
          sight of Christ so overcame Him? I take it we have the reason in the
          text, it was partly fear. But, why fear? Was not John beloved of the
          Lord Jesus? Did he not also know the Savior's love to him? Yes, but
          for all that, he was afraid, or else the Master would not have said to
          him, "Fear not." That fear originated partly in a sense of his own
          weakness and insignificance in the presence of the divine strength and
          greatness. How shall an insect live in the furnace of the sun? How can
          mortal eye behold unquenched the light of Deity, or mortal ear hear
          that voice which is as many waters? We are such infirmity, folly and
          nothingness, that, if we have but a glimpse of omnipotence, awe and
          reverence prostrate us to the earth. Daniel tells us that when he saw
          the great vision by the river Hiddekel, there remained no strength in
          him, for his comeliness was turned in on him into corruption, and he
          fell into a deep sleep upon his face. John, also, at that time,
          perhaps, perceived more impressively than ever the purity and
          immaculate boldness of Christ: and, being conscious of his own
          imperfection, he felt like Isaiah when he cried "Woe is me, I am
          undone; for I am a man of unclean lips; for mine eyes have seen the
          Lord of Hosts." Even his faith, though fixed upon the Lord, our
          righteousness, was not able to bear him up under the first surprising
          view of uncreated holiness. Methinks his feelings severe like those of
          the patriarch of Uz, when he says, "I have heard of thee by the
          hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee, wherefore I abhor
          myself, and repent in dust and ashes." The most spiritual and
          sanctified minds, when they fully perceive the majesty and holiness of
          God, are so greatly conscious of the great disproportion between
          themselves and the Lord, that they are humbled and filled with holy
          awe, and even with dread and alarm. The reverence which is commendable
          is pushed by the infirmity of our nature into a fear which is
          excessive, and that which is good in itself is made deadly unto us; so
          prone are we to err on the one side or the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no doubt, too, that a part of the fear which caused John to
          swoon arose from a partial ignorance or forgetfulness of his Lord.
          Shall we charge this upon one who wrote one of the gospels, and three
          choice epistles? Yes, it was doubtless so, because the Master went on
          to instruct and teach him in order to remove his fear. He needed fresh
          knowledge or old truths brought home with renewed power, in order to
          cure his dread. As soon as he knew his Lord he recovered his strength.
          The wonderful person who then stood before him bade him know that he
          was the first and the last, the ever living and Almighty Lord. The
          knowledge of Jesus is the best remedy for fears: when we are better
          acquainted with our Lord we part company with half our doubts -- these
          bats and owls cannot bear the sun. Jesus in his person, work, offices,
          and relations, is a mine of consolation; every truth which is
          connected with him is an argument against fear: when our heart shall
          be filled with perfect love to him fear will be cast out, as Satan was
          cast down from heaven. Study then your Lord. Make it your life's
          object to know him. Seek the Holy Spirit's illumination, and the
          choice privilege of fellowship, and your despondency and distress will
          vanish as night birds fly to hide themselves when the day breaketh. It
          is folly to walk in sorrow when we might constantly rejoice. We do not
          read that John was any more afraid after the Lord had discoursed
          lovingly upon his own glorious person and character. That divine
          enlightenment which was given to his mind, purged from it any secret
          mistake and misjudgment which had created excessive fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, while we thus notice the occasion and the reasons, we must not
          forget the extent to which John was overpowered. He says, "I fell at
          his feet as dead;" He does not say in a partial swoon, or overcome
          with amazement: he uses a very strong description, "I fell at his feet
          as dead." He was not dead, but he was "as dead;" that is to say, he
          could see no more, the blaze of Jesus' face had blinded him; he could
          hear no more, the voice like the sound of many waters had stunned his
          ear; no bodily faculty retained its power. His soul, too, had lost
          consciousness under the pressure put upon it; he was unable to think
          much less to act. He was stripped not only of self-glory and strength,
          but almost of life itself. This is by no means a desirable natural
          condition, but it is much to be coveted spiritually. It is an infinite
          blessing to us to be utterly emptied, stripped, spoiled, and slain
          before the Lord. Our strength is our weakness, our life is our death,
          and when both are entirely gone, we begin to be strong and in very
          deed to live. To lie at Jesus' feet is a right experience; to lie
          there as sick and wounded is better, but to lie there as dead is best
          of all; a man is taught in the mysteries of the kingdom, who comes to
          that. Moses with dim legal light needs to be told to put off his shoe
          from off his foot in the presence of the Lord of Hosts, but John is
          manifestly far in advance of him, because he lies lower, and is like a
          dead man before the Infinite Majesty. How blessed a death is death in
          Christ! How divine a thing is life in him. If I might see Christ at
          this moment upon the terms of instant death, I would joyfully accept
          the offer, the bliss would far exceed the penalty. But as for the
          death of all within us, that is of the flesh and of fallen nature, it
          is beyond measure desirable, and if for nothing else; my soul would
          pant more and more to see Jesus. May that two-edged sword which cometh
          out of his mouth smite all my besetting sins; may the brightness of
          his countenance scorch and burn up in me the very roots of evil: may
          he mount his white horse and ride through my soul conquering, and to
          conquer, casting out of me all that is of the old dragon and his
          inventions, and bringing every thought into subjection to himself.
          There would I lie at his dear conquering feet, slain by his mighty
          grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only one other reflection while we look at this fainting apostle,
          observe well the place where he was overpowered. Oh, lovely thought.
          "I fell as dead;" but where? "I fell at his feet as dead." It matters
          not what aileth us if we lie at Jesus' feet. Better be dead there than
          alive anywhere else. He is ever gentle and tender, never breaking the
          bruised reed or quenching the smoking flax. In proportion as he
          perceives that our weakness is manifest to us, in that degree will he
          display his tenderness. He carrieth the lambs in his bosom, and doth
          gently lead those that are with young; feebleness wins on him. When he
          sees a dear disciple prostrate at his feet, he is ready at once to
          touch him with the hand of his familiar love, and to revive him by his
          own strength. "He restoreth my soul." "He giveth power unto the
          faint." He saith unto our pitiful weakness, "Fear not, I am the first
          and the last." To be as dead were not desirable, but to be as dead at
          Jesus' feet is safe and profitable. Well doth our poet say, when
          expressing his desire to escape from all worldly bonds.
        </p>
        <p>"But oh, for this, no strength have I,</p>
        <p>My strength is at his feet to lie."</p>
        <p>
          II. And now, having seen the disciple overpowered, I shall ask your
          consideration of THAT SAME DISCIPLE RESTORED. He was not long in the
          condition of death, for the Master laid his right hand upon him, and
          said to him, "Fear not." Here then, we shall notice, that when the
          children of God become exceeding faint and feeble, and their own sense
          of impurity and nothingness becomes painful, and even killing to them,
          the Lord has ways of restoring and reviving their spirits.
        </p>
        <p>
          And first, he does it by a condescending approach. "He laid his hand
          upon me." It is noticeable, that in the great cures which our Savior
          wrought, he almost always touched the patient. He could with a word
          have healed, but to prove his fellowship with the sick, he put his
          hand upon the leper, and upon the blind eye, and touched the deaf ear;
          thus manifesting his condescending contact with the infirmities of our
          nature. The Master could have spoken a word to John, and have revived
          him; but he did not stand at a distance, or guard himself with a
          "Touch me not" but, instead of that, he commenced his care with a
          touch. No other hand could have revived the apostle, but the hand
          which was pierced for him had matchless power. There is mighty healing
          in the royal hand of our Immanuel. When the Holy Spirit inspires us
          with a sense of the relationship which Christ bears to us, of the
          sympathy which Christ feels with us, of the kinship and fellowfeeling
          which reign in Jesus' breast, then are we comforted. To know that he
          is not ashamed to call us brethren is a wellspring of comfort to a
          tried child of God; to feel his presence, to perceive the touch of his
          hand, and to hear him say: "I am with thee, be not dismayed, for I am
          thy God," this is new life to our waning spirits. Oh what bliss is
          this. "In all their afflictions he was afflicted." He is a brother
          born for adversity, a sympathetic and tender friend touched with a
          feeling of our infirmities. "He laid his hand upon me." "O child of
          God, pray for a manifestation of the kinsman Christ to thy soul; ask
          that he would instruct thee as to the fact that he enters into thy
          grief, having himself endured the like. Thou art one with him, and he
          is one with thee; and as surely as the head feels the pain of the
          members, so does Jesus share in all the sorrows of his people. Let
          this be a comfort to thee, thou who art now lying as dead before the
          risen Lord. He comes near to thee, not to kill thee, but to revive
          thee by most intimate intercourse, talking with thee as a man speaketh
          with his friend. O man, greatly beloved, be not so overwhelmed with
          the greatness of thy Lord as to forget his love, his great love, his
          familiar love, which at this moment lays its hand upon thee.
        </p>

          The same action implies the communication of divine strength. "He laid
          his right hand upon me." It is the hand of favor, it is also the hand
          of power. God gives strength to those who have none. He puts power
          into the faint. When the child of God is brought very low, it is not a
          mere subject for consideration or theme for reflection that can lift
          him up: sick men want more than instruction, they require cordials and
          supports. There must be actual strength and energy imparted to a
          swooning soul, and, glory be to God, by his own Holy Spirit, Jesus can
          and does communicate energy to his people in the time of weakness. He
          is come that we may have life, and that we may have it more
          abundantly. The omnipotence of God is made to rest upon us, so that we
          even glory in infirmities. "My grace is sufficient for thee, my
          strength is made perfect in weakness," is a blessed promise, which has
          been fulfilled to the letter to many of us. Our own strength has
          departed, and then the power of God has flowed in to fill up the
          vacuum. I cannot explain the process: these are secrets and mysteries
          to be experienced rather than expounded; but as the coming of the
          Spirit of God into us first of all makes us live in regeneration, so
          the renewed coming of the power of God into our soul raises us up from
          our weakness and our faintness into fresh energy. Be thou encouraged,
          then, thou fainting spirit today. They that trust upon the Lord shall
          renew their strength. All power belongeth unto the Lord, and be will
          give it plenteously to those who have none of their own. Be of good
          courage and wait upon him for none shall be ashamed who make him their
          confidence.

          Then there followed a word from the Master's own mouth. He spoke and
          said, "Fear not." Here he applied the remedy to the disease. Christ
          himself is our medicine, as well as our physician. His voice which
          stilled the sea, also casts out all our fears. The word of God, as we
          find it in this book, is very consoling; the word of God, as we hear
          it from Christ's ministers, has great power in it; but the real and
          true power of the word lies in Jesus THE WORD. When the truth falls
          fresh from his own lips, then is it power. Right truly did the Master
          say, "the words which I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are
          life." With what power did those syllables fall on the fluttered heart
          of John -- "Fear not." Oh that we might hear the same voice by the
          Spirit in our inmost souls.
        </p>
        <p>"Oh might I hear thine heavenly tongue,</p>
        <p>But whisper 'Thou art mine.'</p>
        <p>Those gentle words should raise my song</p>
        <p>To notes almost divine."</p>
        <p>
          Truly there are many voices and each has its significance, but the
          voice of Jesus has a heaven of bliss in its every accent. Let but my
          beloved speak to me, and I will forego the angelic symphonies. Though
          he should only say, "Fear not," and not a word beyond, it were worth
          worlds to see him open his mouth unto us. But you say, can we still
          hear Jesus speak to us? Ay, by his Spirit. His Spirit still hath
          fellowship with the hearts of men, and he can bring the word of
          Scripture right home into the soul, until it becometh no more the
          letter but the living, quickening word of Christ. Do you know what I
          mean by this? If you do not, it is not possible to tell you; and if
          you do, you will need no explanation. Jesus speaks to the heart, the
          truth comes not in word only, but in demonstration of the Spirit and
          with power. O thou troubled believer, thou who art abashed by the very
          glory thou hast been made to see, be assured that Jesus will draw near
          unto thy soul, and touch thee, and speak with thee, so that thou shalt
          be strengthened with might by his Spirit in thine inner man. Had John
          not fallen as dead, he might never have heard the voice and felt the
          touch of his Lord. Sweet is the fall which leads to such a rise again.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to complete the cure of his servant our Lord went on to give
          him fuller instruction in that very matter which had overpowered him.
          Sometimes like cures like. If in a certain sense it is true of divine
          revelations, that "shallow draughts intoxicate the brain," it is
          assuredly true that "drinking largely sobers us again." If a glimpse
          of Christ makes holy men to faint, a clearer sight of him will set
          them on their feet again. Our Lord went on to instruct John in the
          glory of his person and power, that his fears might be removed. And
          truly, brethren, John was in a right state for such celestial
          instruction; he who is lowly is ready to learn mysteries. He was like
          wax ready for the seal; or as paper cleansed of all other writing.
          Because we think we know, we know not; but the death of the pride of
          knowledge is the birth of true understanding. The Lord loves best for
          pupils those who lie lowest before him. "The meek will he guide in
          judgment, the meek will he teach his way." "With the lowly is wisdom."
          Where Jesus is the teacher, and instructs the heart in the things
          concerning, himself, the soul is made to inherit substance, and its
          treasures are filled. Blessed are the men who are taught by him who is
          the wisdom of God, even though while they watch at the posts of his
          doors they lie as dead men; they are blessed, for they shall find
          life, and obtain favor of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. We will now advance to the third point of our discourse which
          contains the pith of it. We have observed the beloved disciple
          overpowered and we have seen him afterwards revived; now we shall
          consider for awhile THE SAME DISCIPLE STILL FURTHER INSTRUCTED. Let me
          have your attention, dear friends, to the glorious truth which is now
          opening up before us in the text. John was first of all instructed as
          to the Lord's person. "Fear not, I am the first and the last; I am he
          that liveth and was dead." As to the Lord's person, Jesus revealed to
          his disciple that he was most truly divine. "I am the first and the
          last." This language can be used of none but God himself; none but he
          is first; none but he is last; none but God can be first and last.
          Now, our Lord Jesus Christ was evidently first. He existed before he
          was born into the world. We read, "a body hast thou prepared me." Then
          Christ was a previously existing one for whom that body was prepared;
          and he it is who said, "Lo, I come, to do thy will O God." He came
          into the world, but he had from old eternity dwelt in the bosom of the
          Father. John the Baptist was born into the world before the Savior, of
          whom he was the forerunner, but what does he say? His testimony is
          "he, coming after me, is preferred before me, for he was before me."
          He is first in order of honor because first in order of existence.
          John was the elder as man, but as God the Lord Jesus is from
          everlasting. Go back in history as far as you will; with one leap
          ascend to the days of Moses, and there is Christ before you, for we
          read: "Let us not tempt Christ as some of them also tempted, and were
          destroyed of serpents." There was Christ, then, in the wilderness
          vexed by the people. He it was whose voice then shook the earth, but
          who will yet shake not the earth only but also heaven. Go further back
          to Abraham, and we find the angel of the covenant there. Our Lord
          expressly says, "Before Abraham was I am." Mark you, not "I was," but
          "I am;" -- he speaks in a God-like manner. Ascend even to the age of
          Noah, the second parent of our race, and there we discover Jesus
          Christ preaching to those spirits who are now in prison, who sometime
          were disobedient, when the long-suffering of God waited in the days of
          Noah, while the ark was preparing." It was Christ in Noah, who by the
          Spirit preached to the antediluvian sinners. We go further back to the
          creation of the world, and are find "In the beginning was the word,
          and the word was God;" and if we fly back to old eternity, before the
          creating hand commenced its work, we find in Proverbs, the eighth
          chapter, the witness of the incarnate wisdom himself. "I was set up
          from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. When
          there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no
          fountains abounding with water. Before the mountains were settled.
          Before the hills was I brought forth: While as yet he had not made the
          earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world."
          Our Lord is thus the first: and so assuredly will he be the last; for
          all things consist and subsist through the perpetual emanations of his
          infinite power; and when the kings of the earth shall sleep in the
          dust, and the popovers thereof shall have passed away, when the
          treasures of time shall have melted, and its most enduring memorials
          shall have gone like the mists of the morning, he shall be the same,
          and of his years there shall be no end. Christ is the true
          Melchisedec, without beginning of days or end of years, "made a priest
          not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an
          endless life." This was revealed to John for his comfort, and it
          stands true to us today, and is equally fraught with consolation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, by the words "the first and the last" are signified, in most
          languages, the sum and substance of all things. We say sometimes the
          top and the bottom of it is so and so; we mean that it is the whole of
          it. And the Greeks were wont to say, "This is the prow and stern of
          the business," meaning that it is the whole. And so Jesus Christ, in
          being first and last, is all in all. And, truly, it is so in the
          working of redemption and salvation; he begins, carries on, completes;
          he asks no creature help and will have none. To us he is the author
          and the finisher of our faith, the alpha of our first comfort, and the
          omega of our final bliss. We worship Christ as the sum and substance
          of all good. Herein is wealth of comfort, and, therefore, did the Lord
          instruct his servant, John, therein, he did as much as say, "John,
          thou needest no ear, for I am no enemy, no stranger, no avenging
          spirit, but God himself, in whom thou has learned to put thy trust.
          Thou believest in God, believe also in me." To every trembling
          believer we would say, Why dost thou fear? Jesus is all. Art thou
          afraid of him, thy brother, thy Savior, thy friend. Then, what dost
          thou fear? Anything old? He is the first. Anything to come? He is the
          last. Anything in all the world? He is all in all, from the first to
          the last. What dost thou want? If thou hast him thou hast all. Dost
          thou need more than all? Hast thou discovered a need within thy
          spirit, a grievous lack which troubles thee? How can that be when thy
          Lord Jesus fills all things, and all things are yours in him. If thou
          hast, indeed, placed thy confidence in him, and made him all thy
          salvation, to what end and for what cause shouldst thou be troubled
          with any sort of fear? Having a divine person to be thy protector and
          thy Savior, Why shouldst thou be afraid?
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, however, to rendering to John the comfort derived from
          his person, our blessed Master went on to comfort him with the truth
          of his self existence. "I am he that liveth," saith he, "or I am the
          living one." Creatures are not living in themselves, they borrow leave
          to be; to God alone it belongs to exist necessarily. He is the I AM,
          and such is Christ. Why then dost thou fear? If the existence of thy
          Lord, thy Savior, were precarious and dependent upon some extraneous
          circumstances, thou wouldst have cause for fear, for thou wouldst be
          in constant jeopardy. If he had to borrow permission to be, derived
          strength from creatures, and needed to look hither and thither for
          strength to sustain his own existence, thou wouldst be ever in danger,
          and consequently in distress; but, since Jesus cannot possibly cease
          to be, or be other than he is, or less than he is, what occasion canst
          thou have for alarm? A self-existent Savior, and yet a troubled
          Christian! Oh, let it not be so. "Fear not, I am he that liveth."
        </p>
        <p>
          And, if these two sources of consolation should not suffice, the Lord
          in the glory of his tenderness mentions a third -- viz, his atoning
          death. He says, "I was dead," the original more correctly rendered is
          "was made dead." Here we come upon the human nature of our Redeemer.
          As God and as man he had two natures, but he was not two persons. As
          one person he ever lives, and yet he was made to die. He came into
          this world in human form that he might be capable of death; the pure
          spirit of God could not die, it was not possible that he, the I AM,
          could be subject to death; but he allied himself with humanity, and in
          that human form Jesus could die, and did die. In very deed, and truth,
          and not in semblance; Jesus bowed his head, and gave up the ghost, and
          they laid his corpse in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea. Here to the
          child of God is a fruitful source of consolation. He died, then the
          atonement is complete; without the shedding of blood there is no
          remission, but the death of the Son of God brings plenteous pardon.
          There must be in the death of such a one of sufficient merit to remove
          guilt and cleanse transgression. Is it not written, "He hath washed us
          from our sins in his own blood?" Dost thou not hear that song in
          heaven? Will not its music make thee glad? His own blood hath washed
          thee; if thou believest in him thou art clean. Look to Calvary, and as
          thou lookest there and perceivest that he was dead, "fear not."
        </p>
        <p>
          And then the master declared his endless life, "I am alive for
          evermore." He who offered up the atonement lives again to claim the
          effect of his sacrifice. He has presented the meritorious sacrifice,
          and now he has gone to heaven to plead the sacrifice before the throne
          of God, and to lay claim to the place which he has prepared for them
          that love him. Thou hast no dead Savior to trust to: thou reliest in
          him who once died -- this is comfort to thee, but he lives, the great
          Redeemer lives. He has risen from the tomb; he has climbed the hills
          of heaven; he sits at the right hand of the Father, prepared to defend
          his people. If thou hadst a Christ in the sepulcher that were sorrow
          upon sorrow; but thou hast a Christ in heaven, who can die no more. Be
          thou of good cheer.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, to close the whole, the Master said "Amen, and hath the keys
          of hell and of death." The mediatorial office which Christ now
          occupies is one of great power. He is "God over all, blessed for
          ever." His dominion is over land and seas and over heaven and the
          regions of the dead. There is nothing hid from the energy of his
          power. He is Lord of all. "He hath the keys of hell and of death." By
          the word "hell" may be meant here the entire invisible land, the whole
          realm of spirits: Christ is Lord there, adored in heaven and feared in
          hell. But, if we restrict the sense to the common meaning of the word
          in our language, he is Lord of hell. The devil despite his malignity
          can do nothing but what Christ permits him. He is a chained enemy; he
          may rave and rage, but he cannot injure the child of God. Christ hath
          him ever in check, and when he permits him to wander abroad, he makes
          the wrath of man and the wrath of devils to praise him, and the
          remainder he doth restrain. Why dost thou fear therefore? Thou sayest,
          "I am a sinner -- Satan will prevail against me." But Christ saith "I
          am master of Satan, I am Lord of hell, he cannot prevail against
          thee." He cannot leave hell unless Christ permits him, for Christ can
          turn the key and lock him in. He could not take thee there, for Christ
          has locked thee out and keeps the key. Thou art eternally and
          perpetually safe from all the machinations of the powers of darkness.
          And dost thou tremble at death? Is it that which alarms thee? Have the
          pains and groans and dying strifes sounded in thine ear till thou art
          timid and afraid? Then remember Christ hath the keys of death. Thou
          canst not die until he permits. If men of blood should seek thy life,
          they could not smite thee till thy Lord should allow it; and if
          plagues and death should fly about thee, and thousands die at thy
          right hand, and ten thousands at thy left, thou canst not die till the
          Lord wills it. Thou art immortal till he saith "return." The iron gate
          of death opens not of its own accord to thee, a thousand angels could
          not drag thee to the tomb; thou comest there only at his call. Fear
          not, therefore, but remember that death is no longer death to the
          saints of God, they fall asleep in Jesus. Since thy Lord will be with
          thee, it will not be death to die; thou shalt find death to thee an
          enemy muzzled and chained: the wasp shall have lost its sting, it
          shall be a bee that shall bring thee honey; out of the lion, as Samson
          did, shalt thou get sweetness to thyself. Death is overborne, and when
          it arrives, Jesus will come with it, and make thy dying bed most soft
          to thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember one thought more. He that hath the key of death will
          annihilate death; for thy body shall not become the prey of the worm
          for ever. At the trump of the archangel thy body shall rise again.
          There shall not a bone or a piece of a bone of one of his people
          perish, their very dust is precious in his sight. They sleep awhile,
          and rest from their labors; but, from beds of dust and silent clay,
          the Lord of life shall call them all. O death, where is thy sting! O
          grave, wherein thy victory! Since Jesus who died and ever lives has
          the keys of death and hell at his girdle, we will not fear to die, let
          the time appointed be when it may. So that you see there was abundance
          of comfort for the sinking spirit of the apostle John.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me close by saying, in the glory and exaltation of Christ is the
          saint's cordial. Some of us have tried it when our mouths were full of
          bitterness, and we have rejoiced and been exceeding glad at the
          thought. A reigning Savior makes a joyful people. Run there for
          comfort, ye sons of sorrow: rejoice ye in your king all ye his saints.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this same glorious Savior will be the sinner's terror. They shall
          hide their faces at the last from the brightness of his glory; they
          shall ask the hills and mountains to conceal them from his face who
          sits upon the throne. A glorious monarch is the rebel's horror. By so
          much as he whom you have rejected is great and glorious, by so much
          shall the punishment from his right hand be intolerable. Oh that you
          were wise enough to cease from fighting with the Almighty Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, lastly, he is also the penitent's hope; for now, to-day, if you
          would be forgiven, the exalted Savior presents himself to you most
          freely. He is exalted on high, but what for? It is to give "repentance
          and remission of sins." The greater he is the better for those who
          need great mercy; the more royal and kingly he is the better for
          humble, broken, bleeding hearts. "Oh, kiss the son, lest he be angry
          and ye perish from the way while his wrath is kindled but a little."
          From the highest heaven he stretches down the silver scepter; touch it
          by a simple faith. May he enable you to do it, and though as yet you
          fall at his feet as dead, you shall hear him say this morning, "Fear
          not, I am he that liveth, and was dead, and am alive for evermore, and
          am, therefore, able to save unto the uttermost them that come unto God
          by me, seeing I ever live to make intercession for thee." God bless
          you, dear friends, by his Spirit. Amen.
