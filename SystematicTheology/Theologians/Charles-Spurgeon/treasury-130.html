<p align="justify">Preface to Volume 7, Psalms 125-150</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    At the end of all these years, the last page of this 
    Commentary is printed, and the <i>seventh preface </i>is requested. This 
    demand sounds strange in my ears. A preface when the work is done? It is 
    only nominally a preface--it is really a farewell. I introduce my closing 
    volume and then retire with many apologies for having trespassed so much on 
    my reader's patience.</p>
<p align="justify">A tinge of sadness is on my spirit as I leave <i>The 
    Treasury of David</i>. On this earth, I will never find a richer storehouse, 
    though the entire palace of revelation is open to me. Blessed have been the 
    days spent in meditating, mourning, hoping, believing, and rejoicing with 
    David! Can I hope to spend more joyous hours on this side of the golden 
    gate? Perhaps not, for these have been choice seasons in which the harp of 
    the great poet of the sanctuary has charmed my ears. </p>
<p align="justify">Yet, the training that has come from those heavenly 
    contemplations has created and sustained a peaceful spirit, which will never 
    be without its own happy sacred song and never without aspirations for 
    something higher than it has known. The Book of Psalms instructs in the use 
    of <i>wings </i>as well as <i>words</i>, for it set us <i>flying </i>and <i>
    singing</i>. Often I have stopped commenting on a text that I might rise 
    with the Psalm and gaze on visions of God. My only hope is that these 
    volumes will be as useful to other hearts in the reading, as they have been 
    to mine in the writing. If so, I will be well rewarded.</p>
<p align="justify">The previous volumes have enjoyed great popularity. It 
    may be questioned if so large a commentary on a single book of the Bible has 
    enjoyed a circulation close to that of this work. Among all orders of 
    Christians, <i>The Treasury </i>has found its way, unrestrained by sectarian 
    prejudiceâ€”another proof of the unity of the spiritual life and the oneness 
    of the food on which it delights to feed. The author would not dare to be 
    proud of the generous acknowledgments received from all sections of the 
    church but, on the other hand, he cannot let them pass in ungrateful 
    silence. Conscious of his many literary sins of omission and commission in 
    these seven volumes, he is glad to have been allowed to do his best and to 
    have received abundant encouragement. <i>Of all its good, the glory is the 
    Lord's. Of all its weakness, the unworthy author must bear the blame.</i></p>

<p align="justify">This last portion of the Psalms has not been the easiest 
    part of my gigantic task. On the contrary, with the exception of <i>The 
    Songs of Ascents </i>and one or two other Psalms, these later hymns and 
    hallelujahs have not been much expounded or referred to by our leading 
    preachers. Failing the English, we have made a larger use of the Latin 
    authors. My esteemed friend, W Durban, has given me great service in the 
    Latin translation. It would astonish our readers to see the books that have 
    been read and the folios that have been covered with translations just to 
    yield <i>tiny morsels</i>, which have been incorporated into this Treasury. 
    The heaps of earth have been sifted and washed, and have yielded only here 
    and there a little 'dust of gold.' No labor has been spared, and no 
    difficulty has been shirked. May the good Lord accept my service and enrich 
    His church by it this day, and when I am gathered to my fathers!</p>
<p align="justify">And now the colossal work is done! To God be all glory. 
    More than twenty years have glided away while this pleasant labor has been 
    in the making. The wreath of mercy lavished on me during that time is 
    something my grateful heart is unable to measure. Surely goodness and mercy 
    have followed me all those years and made my heart sing new Psalms for new 
    mercies. There is none like the God of Jeshurun. To Him be all glory forever 
    and ever.</p>
<p align="justify">In these busy days, it would profit Christians 
    spiritually to become more familiar with the Book of Psalms. It contains a 
    complete armory for life's battles and a perfect supply for life's needs. 
    Here are both delight and usefulness, consolation and instruction. For every 
    condition, there is a Psalm that is suitable and elevating. This book 
    supplies the babe in grace with penitent cries, and the perfected saint with 
    triumphant songs. Its breadth of experience stretches from the jaws of Hell 
    to the gates of Heaven. Those who are acquainted with the marches of the 
    Psalm country know that the land flows with milk and honey, and they are 
    delighted to travel there. To such, I have aspired to be a helpful 
    companion.</p>
<p align="justify">Reader, I implore David's God to bless you. When it is 
    well with you, I pray that you will breathe a like prayer for,</p>
<p align="justify">Yours heartily,<br/>
    C. H. Spurgeon<br/>
    Westwood, Upper Norwood<br/>
    October 1885</p>
