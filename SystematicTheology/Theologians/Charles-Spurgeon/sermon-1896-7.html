          11. Jehovah knoweth the thoughts of men, that they are vain. 12.
          Blessed is the man whom thou hast instructed, O God! And taught out of
          thy law; 13. To give him rest from days of evil whilst the pit is
          digged for the wicked.

          11. Jehovah knoweth the thoughts of men, etc. He again insists upon
          the folly of men in seeking to wrap themselves up in darkness, and
          hide themselves from the view of God. To prevent them from flattering
          themselves with vain pretexts, he reminds them that the mists of
          delusion will be scattered at once when they come to stand in God's
          presence. Nothing can avail them, so long as God from heaven stamps
          vanity upon their deepest counsels. The Psalmist's design in citing
          them before the Judge of all, is to make them thoroughly search and
          try their own hearts; for the great cause of their self-security lay
          in failing to realize God, burying all distinction between right and
          wrong, and, so far as that was possible, hardening themselves against
          all feeling. They might contrive to soothe their minds by means like
          these, but he tells them that God ridiculed all such trifling. The
          truth may be a plain one, and well known; but the Psalmist states a
          fact which many overlook, and which we would do well to remember, That
          the wicked, when they attempt to hide themselves under subtile
          refuges, cannot deceive God, and necessarily deceive themselves. Some
          read -- They (that is, men themselves) are vanity; but this is a
          forced rendering, and the form of expression is one which both in the
          Greek and Hebrew may be translated, God knows that the thoughts of men
          are vain.

          12 Blessed is the man whom thou hast instructed, O God! The Psalmist
          now passes from the language of censure to that of consolation,
          comforting himself and others of the Lord's people with the truth,
          that though God might afflict them for a time, he consulted their true
          interests and safety. At no period of life is this a truth which it is
          unnecessary to remember, called as we are to a continued warfare. God
          may allow us intervals of ease, in consideration of our weakness, but
          would always have us exposed to calamities of various kinds. The
          audacious excesses to which the wicked proceed we have already
          noticed. Were it not for the comfortable consideration that they are a
          blessed people whom God exercises with the cross, our condition would
          be truly miserable. We are to consider, that in calling us to be his
          people, he has separated us from the rest of the world, to participate
          a blessed peace in the mutual cultivation of truth and righteousness.
          The Church is often cruelly oppressed by tyrants under color of law --
          the very case of which the Psalmist complains in this psalm; for it is
          evident that he speaks of domestic enemies, pretending to be judges in
          the nation. Under such circumstances, a carnal judgment would infer,
          that if God really concerned himself in our welfare he would never
          suffer these persons to perpetrate such enormities. To prevent this,
          the Psalmist would have us distrust our own ideas of things, and feel
          the necessity of that wisdom which comes from above. I consider the
          passage to mean that it is only in the Lord's school we can ever learn
          to maintain composure of mind, and a posture of patient expectation
          and trust under the pressure of distress. The Psalmist declares that
          the wisdom which would bear us onward to the end, with an inward peace
          and courage under long-continued trouble, is not natural to any of us,
          but must come from God. Accordingly, he exclaims, that those are the
          truly blessed whom God has habituated through his word to the
          endurance of the cross, and prevented from sinking under adversity by
          the secret supports and consolations of his own Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The words with which the verse begins, Blessed is the man whom thou
          hast instructed, have no doubt a reference to chastisements and
          experience of the cross, but they also comprehend the gift of inward
          illumination; and afterwards the Psalmist adds, that this wisdom,
          which is imparted by God inwardly, is, at the same time, set forth and
          made known in the Scriptures. In this way he puts honor upon the use
          of the written word, as we find Paul saying, that all things
        </p>
        <p>
          "were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort
          of the Scriptures, might have hope" (Romans 15:4)
        </p>
        <p>
          This shows from what quarter we are to derive our patience -- the
          oracles of God, which supply us with matter of hope for the mitigation
          of our griefs. In short, what the Psalmist means is summarily this:
          Believers must, in the first place, be exhorted to exercise patience,
          not to despond under the cross, but wait submissively upon God for
          deliverance; and next, they must be taught how this grace is to be
          obtained, for we are naturally disposed to abandon ourselves to
          despair, and any hope of ours would speedily fail, were we not taught
          from above that all our troubles must eventually issue in salvation.
          We have here the Psalmist's testimony to the truth, That the word of
          God provides us with abundant ground of comfort, and that none who
          rightly avails himself of it need ever count himself unhappy, or yield
          himself to hopelessness and despondency. One mark by which God
          distinguishes the true from the false disciple is, that of his being
          ready and prepared to bear the cross, and waiting quietly for the
          Divine deliverance, without giving way to fretfulness and impatience.
          A true patience does not consist in presenting an obstinate resistance
          to evils, or in that unyielding stubbornness which passed as a virtue
          with the Stoics, but in a cheerful submission to God, based upon
          confidence in his grace. On this account it is with good reason that
          the Psalmist begins by laying it down as a fundamental truth,
          necessary to be learned by all the Lord's people, That the end of
          those temporary persecutions, to which they are subjected, is their
          being brought at last to a blessed rest after their enemies have done
          their worst. He might have contented himself with saying, that the
          truly blessed were those who had learned from God's word to bear the
          cross patiently, but that he might the more readily incline them to a
          cheerful acquiescence in the Divine disposals, he subjoined a
          statement of the consolation which tends to mitigate the grief of
          their spirits. Even supposing that a man should bear his trials
          without a tear or a sigh, yet if he champ the bit in sullen
          hopelessness -- if he only hold by such principles as these, "We are
          mortal creatures," "It is vain to resist necessity, and strive against
          fate," "Fortune is blind" -- this is obstinacy rather than patience,
          and there is concealed opposition to God in this contempt of
          calamities under color of fortitude. The only consideration which will
          subdue our minds to a tractable submission is, that God, in subjecting
          us to persecutions, has in view our being ultimately brought into the
          enjoyment of a rest. Wherever there reigns this persuasion of a rest
          prepared for the people of God, and a refreshment provided under the
          heat and turmoil of their troubles, that they may not perish with the
          world around them, -- this will prove enough, and more than enough, to
          alleviate any present bitterness of affliction.
        </p>
        <p>
          By evil days, or days of evil, the Psalmist might thus mean the
          everlasting destruction which awaits the ungodly, whom God has spared
          for a certain interval. Or his words may be expounded as signifying,
          that the man is blessed who has learned to be composed and tranquil
          under trials. The rest intended would then be that of an inward kind,
          enjoyed by the believer even during the storms of adversity; and the
          scope of the passage would be, that the truly happy man is he who has
          so far profited, by the word of God, as to sustain the assault of
          evils from without, with peace and composure. But as it is added,
          whilst the pit is digged for the wicked, it would seem necessary, in
          order to bring out the opposition contained in the two members of the
          sentence, to suppose that the Psalmist rather commends the wisdom of
          those who reckon that God afflicts them with a view to saving them
          from destruction, and bringing them eventually to a happy issue. It
          was necessary to state this second ground of comfort, because our
          hearts cannot fail to be affected with the most intense grief when we
          see the wicked triumph, and no Divine restraint put upon them. The
          Psalmist meets the temptation by appropriately reminding us that the
          wicked are left upon earth, just as a dead body which is stretched out
          upon a bed, till its grave be dug. Here believers are warned that, if
          they would preserve their constancy, they must mount their watchtower,
          as Habakkuk says, (Habakkuk 2:1) and take a view in the distance of
          God's judgments. They shall see worldly men rioting in worldly
          delights, and, if they extend their view no farther, they will give
          way to impatience. But it would moderate their grief, would they only
          remember that those houses which are nominally appropriated to the
          living, are, in fact, only granted to the dead, until their grave be
          digged; and that, though they remain upon earth, they are already
          devoted to destruction.
