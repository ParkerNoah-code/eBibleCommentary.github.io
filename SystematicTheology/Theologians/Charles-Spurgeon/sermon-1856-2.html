        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.55)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, December 9, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years,
          even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord
          went out from the land of Egypt." -- Exodus 12:41.
        </p>
        <p>
          IT IS our firm conviction and increasing belief, that the historical
          books of Scripture were intended to teach us by types and figures
          spiritual things. We believe that every portion of Scripture history
          is not only a faithful transcript of what did actually happen, but
          also a shadow of what happens spiritually in the dealings of God with
          his people, or in the dispensations of his grace towards the world at
          large. We do not look upon the historical books of Scripture as being
          mere rolls of history, such as profane authors might have written, but
          we regard them as being most true and infallible records of the past,
          and also most bright and glorious foreshadowings of the future, or
          else most wondrous metaphors and marvellous illustrations of things
          which are verily received among us, and most truly felt in the
          Christian heart. We may be wrong -- we believe we are not; at any
          rate, the very error has given us instruction, and our mistake has
          afforded us comfort. We look upon the book of Exodus as being a book
          of types of the deliverances which God will give to his elect people:
          not only as a history of what he has done, in bringing them out of
          Egypt by smiting the first-born, leading them through the Red Sea, and
          guiding them through the wilderness, but also as a picture of his
          faithful dealings with all his people, whom by the blood of Christ he
          separates from the Egyptians, and by his strong and mighty hand takes
          out of the house of their bondage and out of the land of their
          slavery. Last Sabbath evening we had the type of the Passover -- the
          Paschal Lamb; and we showed you then, how the sprinkled blood, and the
          eaten lamb, were types of the blood applied for our justification, and
          of the flesh received by inward communion with Jesus, the soul living
          and feeding upon him. We now take the Exodus, or the going of the
          children of Israel out of Egypt, as being a type and picture of the
          going out of all the vessels of mercy from the house of their bondage,
          and the deliverance of all the lawful captives from the chains of
          their cruel taskmasters, by sovereign and omnipotent grace, through
          the Passover of our Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The land of Egypt is a picture of the house of bondage into which all
          God's covenant people will, sooner or later, be brought on account of
          their sin. All those whom God means to give an inheritance in Canaan,
          he will first take down into Egypt. Even Jesus Christ himself went
          into Egypt before he appeared publicly as a teacher before the world,
          that in his instance, as well as in that of every Christian, the
          prophecy might be fulfilled -- "Out of Egypt have I called my Son."
          Every one who enjoys the liberty wherewith Christ doth make us free,
          must first feel the galling bondage of sin. Our wrists must be made to
          smart by the fetters of our iniquity, and our backs must be made to
          bleed by the lash of the law -- the taskmaster which drives us to
          Jesus Christ. There is no true liberty which is not preceded by true
          bondage; there is no true deliverance from sin, unless we have first
          of all groaned and cried unto God, as did the people of Israel when in
          bondage in Egypt. We must all serve in the brick-kiln; we must all be
          wearied with toiling among the pots; or otherwise we could never
          realize that glorious verse -- "Though ye have lien among the pots,
          yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her
          feathers with yellow gold." We must have bondage before liberty;
          before resurrection there must come death; before life there must come
          corruption; before we are brought out of the horrible pit and the miry
          clay we must be made to exclaim, "I sink in deep mire, where there is
          no standing;" and ere, like Jonah, we can be fetched out of the
          whale's belly, and delivered from our sin, we must have been taken
          down to the bottoms of the mountains, with the weeds wrapped about our
          heads, shuddering under a deep sense of our own nothingness and
          fearing that the earth with her bars was about us for ever. Taking
          this as key, you will see that the deliverance out of Egypt is a
          beautiful picture of the deliverance of all God's people from the
          bondage of the law and the slavery of their sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, consider THE MODE OF THEIR GOING OUT. When the children of
          Israel went out of Egypt it is a remarkable thing that they were
          forced out by the Egyptians. Those Egyptians who had enriched
          themselves with their slavery, said, "Get ye hence, for we be all dead
          men;" they begged and entreated them to go; yea, they hurried them
          forth, gave them jewels that they might depart, and made them quit the
          land. And it is a striking thing, that the very sins which oppress the
          child of God in Egypt, are the very things that drive him to Jesus.
          Our sins makes slaves of us while we are in Egypt, and when God the
          Holy Spirit stirs them up against us, how do they beat us with cruel
          lashes, till our soul is worn with extreme bondage; but those very
          sins, by God's grace, are made the means of driving us to the Saviour.
          The dove fleeth not to its cote unless the eagle doth pursue it; so
          sins like eagles pursue the timid soul, making it fly into the clefts
          of the Rock Christ Jesus to hide itself. Once, beloved, our sins kept
          us from Christ; but now every sin drives us to him for pardon. I had
          not known Christ if I had not known sin; I had not known a deliverer,
          if I had not smarted under the Egyptians. The Holy Spirit drives us to
          Christ, just as the Egyptians drove the people out of Egypt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: the children of Israel went out of Egypt covered with jewels
          and arrayed in their best garments. The Jews have ever on their feast
          days been desirous of wearing jewels and all kinds of goodly apparel;
          and when they were too poor to possess them, they would borrow jewels
          for the purpose. So it was at this remarkable Passover. They had been
          so oppressed that they had kept no festival for many a year; but now
          they all arrayed themselves in their best garments, and at the command
          of God did borrow of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of
          gold, and raiment; "and the things as they required: and they spoiled
          the Egyptians." Let none say that this was robbery. It would have
          been, had it not been commanded of God; but as a king can set aside
          his own laws, so God is above his laws, and whatsoever he orders is
          right. Abraham would have been guilty of murder in taking up his knife
          to slay his son, had not God commanded him to do so; but the fact of
          God having commanded the action, made it justifiable and right. But,
          moreover, the word "borrowed" here is by the best translators said to
          mean nothing more than that the children of Israel asked them for
          their jewels, and had no intention whatever of returning them, and
          entered into no agreement to do so; and it was most just, that they
          should do this, because they had toiled for the Egyptians for years,
          without having had any remuneration. Sometimes necessity has no law:
          how much more shall that God who is above all necessities be the
          master of his own laws? The great Potentate, the only wise God, the
          King of kings, hath a right to make what laws he pleases; and let not
          vain man dare to question his Maker, when his Maker gives him a
          command. But the fact is very significant. The children of Israel did
          not go out of Egypt poorly clad; they went out with their best
          clothing on, and moreover, they had borrowed jewels of gold, and
          jewels of silver, and raiment; and they went gladly out of the land.
          Ah! beloved, that is just how a child of God comes out of Egypt. He
          does not come out of his bondage with his old garments of
          self-righteousness on: oh! no; as long as he wears those he will
          always keep in Egypt; but he marches out with the blood and
          righteousness of Jesus Christ upon him, and adorned with the goodly
          graces of the Holy Spirit. Oh! beloved, if you could see a child of
          Israel coming out of the bondage of sin, you would say, "Who is this
          that cometh up from the wilderness?" Is this the poor slave that was
          making bricks without straw? Is this the wretch who had nothing but
          rags and tatters on him? Is this the poor creature whose whole person
          was soiled with the mud of Egypt's river, and who laboured in Goshen's
          land without a wage or pay? Yes, it is he; and now he is arrayed like
          a king, and apparelled as a prince. Lo, each of these men of labour
          cometh like a bridegroom decked for his wedding, and their wives seem
          like royal brides clad in their bridal robes. Every child of God, when
          he comes out of Egypt, is arrayed in goodly apparel.
        </p>
        <p>"Strangely, my soul, art thou arrayed,</p>
        <p>By the great sacred Three;</p>
        <p>In sweetest harmony of praise.</p>
        <p>Let all thy powers agree."</p>
        <p>
          Note, moreover, that these people obtained their jewels from the
          Egyptians. God's people never lose anything by going to the house of
          bondage. They win their choicest jewels from the Egyptians. "Strangely
          true it is, sins do me good," said an old writer once, "because they
          drive me to the Saviour; and so I get good by them." Ask the humble
          Christian where he got his humility, and ten to one he will say that
          he got it in the furnace of deep sorrow on account of sin. See another
          who is tender in conscience: where did he get that jewel from? It cam
          from Egypt, I'll be bound. We get more by being in bondage, under
          conviction of sin, that we often do by liberty. That bondage state,
          under which thou art now labouring, thou poor way-worn child of
          sorrow, shall be good for thee; for when thou comest out of Egypt thou
          wilt steal jewels from the Egyptians; thou wilt have won pearls from
          thy very convictions. "Oh!" say some, "I have been for months and
          years toiling under a sense of sin, and cannot get deliverance." Well,
          I hope you will get it soon; but if you do not, you will have gained
          all the more jewels by stopping there, and when you come out, you will
          very likely make the best of Christians. What more noble preacher to
          sinners than John Bunyan? And who suffered more than he did? For years
          he was doubting and hesitating, sometimes thinking that Christ would
          save him, at other times thinking that he was never one of the elect,
          and continually bemoaning himself; but he got jewels while he was in
          bondage that he would never have obtained anywhere else. Who could
          have made a large collection of jewels like Pilgrim's Progress, if he
          had not lived in Egypt? It was because he tarried so long in Egypt
          that he gathered so many jewels. And oh! beloved, let us be content to
          stop a little while in distress; for the jewels that we shall win
          there will adorn us all our lives long, and we shall one night come
          out of Egypt, not with weeping, but with songs and crowns of
          rejoicing. We shall have "the garments of praise for the spirit of
          heaviness;" the sackcloth shall be removed from our loins, and the
          ashes from our head, and we shall march forth decked with jewels,
          glittering with gold and silver.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is one more thought concerning the way of their coming out;
          and that is, they came out in haste. I think a child of God, whenever
          he has the opportunity of coming out of bondage, will quickly avail
          himself of it. When a man comes to me, and says, "I am under deep
          conviction of sin," and so on, and seems to be very well content,
          talking about to-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, and saying, "I
          can repent when I please, and I can believe when I please," and always
          procrastinating! -- Ah! I think to myself, that is not the Lord's
          deliverance, for when his people go forth out of Egypt, they are
          always in a hurry to get out. I never met with a poor sinner under a
          sense of sin, who was not in haste to get his burden off his back. No
          man has a broken heart, unless he wants to have it bound up directly.
          "To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your heart," says the
          Holy Ghost; he never say to-morrow; to-day is his continual cry, and
          every true-born Israelite will pant to get out of Egypt, whenever he
          has the opportunity. He will not stop to knead his dough, and make his
          bread to carry with him; but he will carry the unleavened bread on his
          shoulders, he will be in such a hurry to get away. He who hateth the
          noisomeness of the dungeon, longeth to hear the wards of the lock
          creak, that he may find liberty; he who hath been long in the pit
          hasteth to escape; he who hath suffered the task-master's whip fleeth
          like a dove unto his window, that he may find peace and deliverance in
          Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But having noticed three points of similarity in the emigration of
          the Israelites and the deliverance of God's people, we would lead your
          attention, secondly, to a remark concerning THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS
          DELIVERANCE. Did it never strike you what a wonderful exodus of the
          people of Israel this was? Do you know how many people went out?
          According to the very lowest calculations, there must have been two
          millions and a half, all assembled together in one place, and all
          coming out of the country at one time. And then, besides these, there
          went out with them an exceeding great company -- a mixed multitude.
          The number must have been so large that it is impossible to imagine
          it. Suppose the people of London should all go out at once to march
          through a wilderness; it would be a marvellous thing in history, such
          as we can hardly conceive of; but here were, to say the least, two
          millions of people, all at one time coming out from the midst of
          Egypt, and going forth from the country. "They journeyed," it is said,
          "from Rameses to Succoth." Rameses was where they were employed in
          building a city for the king. They stayed in Succoth, or booths.
          Because such an immense multitude could not find houses, they
          therefore made booths; and hence the children of Israel ever
          afterwards kept "the feast of tabernacles," to commemorate their
          building of the booths at Succoth, when they first of all came out of
          Egypt. What a mind Moses must have had, to direct so great an army; or
          rather what a spirit must that have been that rested on him, so that
          he could lead them all to one place, and then guide them all through
          the wilderness; if you bear in mind this mighty number, you will be
          astonished to think what a quantity of manna it must have required to
          feed them, and what a stream of water that must have been which
          followed them! Talk of the armies of Xerxes, or the host of the
          Persians; speak of the mighty armies that kings and potentates have
          assembled! Here was an army that outvied them all. But oh! beloved,
          how much grandeur is there in the thought of the multitudes Christ
          redeems with his blood. Christ did not die to save a few; "he shall
          see of the travail of his soul, and shall be abundantly satisfied."
          "By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many." "A
          multitude which no man can number" shall stand before the throne of
          God and of the Lamb. Oh! wondrous the stars of heaven, nor the dust of
          the earth, nor the sand of the sea; but let us remember that God hath
          promised to Abraham -- "As the sand upon the sea shore, even so shall
          thy seed be." "Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the
          fourth part of Israel?" They lick up the earth like water, and the
          land is utterly devoured before them. Oh! mighty God! how great is
          that deliverance which bringeth out a host of thine elect, more
          countless than the stars and as innumerable as the sands upon a
          thousand shores! all hail to thy power that doeth all this!
        </p>
        <p>
          You will have another idea of the greatness of this work, when you
          think of the different stations which the children of Israel must have
          occupied. I suppose they were not all equally destitute; they were not
          all toiling in the same brick-kilns, but some of them would be in one
          place, some in another -- some working in the king's court, some for
          the meaner Egyptians -- dispersed every where; but whatever they might
          be, they all came from hence. If Pharoah had slaves in his halls, they
          marched out the self-same day from his golden-gated palace, at Memphis
          or at Thebes. They all came forth that same day from their different
          situations, and guided by God they all came to one spot, where they
          built their booths, and called it Succoth. As when the autumn doth
          decline, and the winter approacheth, we have seen the chattering
          swallows gather upon the house-top, prepared for distant flights
          beyond the purple sea, where they might find another summer in another
          land, so did these Israelites from all their countries thus assemble,
          and stand together, about to take their flight across a trackless
          wilderness to that land of which God had told them saying, "Behold, I
          will bring you into a land that floweth with milk and honey." Oh!
          great and glorious works of God! "great are thy works, O Lord, and
          marvellous are thy doings; and that my soul knoweth right well."
        </p>
        <p>
          I would have you, beloved, particularly remember one thing; and that
          is, that great as this emigration was, and enormous as were the
          multitudes that quitted Egypt, it was only one Passover that set them
          all free. They did not want two celebrations of the supper; they did
          not need two angels to fly through Egypt; it was not necessary to have
          two deliverances: but all in one night, all by the Paschal Lamb, all
          by the Passover supper, they were saved. Look at yonder host above!
          See ye the blood-washed throng of souls, chosen of God and precious?
          Can you tell their number? Can you count the small dust of the
          beatified ones before the throne? Ah! no; but here is a thought for
          you. They did not want two Christs to save them; they did not require
          two Holy Spirits to deliver them; nor did it need two sacrifices to
          bring them there.
        </p>
        <p>"Ask them whence their victory came,</p>
        <p>They with united breath</p>
        <p>Ascribe their victory to the Lamb,</p>
        <p>Their triumph in his death."</p>
        <p>
          One agonizing sacrifice, one death on Calvary, one bloody sweat on
          Gethsemane, one shriek of "It is finished." consummated all the work
          of redemption. Oh! the precious blood of Christ! I love it when I
          think it saves one sinner; but oh! to think of the multitude of
          sinners that it saves! Beloved, we do not think enough of our Lord
          Jesus Christ; we have not half such an estimation of his precious
          person as we ought to have. We do not value his blood at the right
          price. Why, poor sinner, thou art saying this morning, "This blood
          cannot save me." What! not save thee, when it is engaged to save
          thousands upon thousands, and myriads of myriads? Shall the shepherd
          who gathereth the whole flock together, and leadeth them unto the
          pastures lose a single lamb? Thou sayest, perhaps, "I am so little."
          For that very reason then, thou dost not want so much of his power to
          take care of thee. "But," says one, "I am so great a sinner." Ay,
          then, so much the better, for he "came to save sinners, of whom I am
          chief," said Paul; and he came to save thee. Ah! do not fear, ye sons
          of God; he who brought the Israelites all out in one night can bring
          you all out, though you are in the veriest bondage. Perhaps there is
          one of you who not only has to make bricks without straw, but has to
          make twice as many bricks as any one else, you think, and your
          taskmaster has a whip which goes right round you, and cuts the flesh
          off you every time; you have worse bondage than any one, your slavery
          is more intense, your oven hotter, your pots harder to make. Very
          well, I am glad of it: how sweet liberty will be to thee! and I will
          tell you, you shall not be left in Egypt; for if you were, what would
          old Pharaoh say? "He said he would bring them all out, but he has not;
          there is one left;" and he would parade that poor Israelite through
          the streets, he would take him through Memphis and Thebes, and say,
          "There is one that God would not deliver; there is one I had so tight
          in my grasp that he could not get him out!" Ah! master devil! you
          shall not say that of one of the Lord's people; they shall all be
          there, the great and the small; this unworthy hand shall take the hand
          of the blessed St. Paul; they shall all be in heaven, shall all be
          redeemed, shall all be saved; but all, mark you, through one
          sacrifice, one covenant, one blood, one Passover.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. This bring us to speak more fully of THE COMPLETENESS OF THEIR
          DELIVERANCE. Our text says, -- "It came to pass at the end of the four
          hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that
          all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt." Our dear
          Arminian friends think that some of the Lord's people will not come
          out of Egypt, but will be lost at last. Ah! well, as good Hart says --
        </p>
        <p>"If one poor saint may fall away,</p>
        <p>It follows so may all;"</p>
        <p>
          and none of us are safe and secure. Therefore, we do not give way to
          that. But all the hosts came out of Egypt, every one of them; not a
          soul was left behind. There is a poor man that was lame. Ah! you see
          him throw away his crutches. There is a poor woman sick; ay, but she
          suddenly rises from her bed. There is another palsied, who can by no
          means lift himself up, but his frame in a moment becomes firm, "for
          there was not one feeble person in all their tribes." -- Psalm 105:37.
          There is a poor little babe who knows nothing about it; but still it
          leaves Egypt, carried by its mother. The old greyheaded sire tottered
          not on his staff. Though eighty years of age, yet he was a son of
          Israel, and out he came. There was a youth who had just begun to have
          his shoulders galled; but though he was young the time was come for
          him, and out he came. They all came out, every one of them; there was
          not one left behind. I do not suppose they had any hospitals there;
          but if they had, I am sure they did not leave any of them in the
          hospital, but all were healed in an instant. There was one Israelite
          who had rebelled against the government of Moses, and said, "Who made
          you a judge and a divider over us?" But they did not leave him behind;
          even he came out. All of them came out; nor do we find that there was
          some poor shrivelled creature whose arms and legs were almost useless,
          and who was half an idiot, whose brain was nearly gone, left behind.
          So beloved, if you are "the meanest lamb in Jesus' fold," you are "one
          in Jesus now;" though you have very little learning, and very little
          common sense, you will come out of Egypt. If the Lord has put you
          there in bondage, and you have been made to groan there, he will make
          you sing by-and-by, when you are redeemed from it. There is no fear of
          your being left behind; for if you were, Pharoah would say, "He
          delivered the strong ones, but he was not able to fetch out the weak;"
          and then there would be laughter in hell against the might and
          omnipotence of God. They all came out.
        </p>
        <p>
          But not only so; they all had their cattle with them. As Moses said,
          "Not a hoof shall be left behind." They were to have all their goods,
          as well as their persons. What does this teach us? Why, not only that
          all God's people shall be saved, but that all God's people ever had
          shall be restored. All that Jacob ever took down to Egypt shall be
          brought out again. Have I lost a perfect righteousness in Adam? I
          shall have a perfect righteousness in Christ. Have I lost happiness on
          earth in Adam? God will give me much happiness here below in Christ.
          Have I lost heaven in Adam? I shall have heaven in Christ; for Christ
          came not only to seek and to save the people that were lost, but that
          which was lost; that is, all the inheritance, as well as the people;
          all their property. Not the sheep merely, but the good pasture that
          the sheep had lost: not only the prodigal son, but all the prodigal
          son's estates. Everything was brought out of Egypt; not even Joseph's
          bones were left behind. The Egyptians could not say that they had a
          scrap of the Israelites' property -- not even one of their kneading
          troughs, or one of their old garments. And when Christ shall have
          conquered all things to himself, the Christian shall not have lost one
          atom by the toils of Egypt, but shall be able to say, "O death where
          is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?" O hell, where is thy
          triumph? Thou has not a flag nor a pennon to show of thy victory;
          there is not a casque or a helmet left upon the battle-field; there is
          not a single trophy which thou mayest raise up in hell in scorn of
          Christ. He hath not only delivered his people, but they have gone out
          with flying colours, taking their shields with them. Stand and admire
          and love the Lord, who thus delivers all his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. This brings us to notice, in the fourth place, THE TIME WHEN THE
          ISRAELITES CAME OUT OF EGYPT. "It came to pass at the end of four
          hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that
          all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt." God had
          promised to Abraham that his people should be in bondage four hundred
          and thirty years, and they were not in bondage one day more. As soon
          as God's bond became due, though it had been drawn four hundred and
          thirty years before, he paid the bill; he required no more time to do
          it in, but he did it at once. Christopher Ness says, they had to tarry
          for the fulfillment of the promise till the night came; for though he
          fulfilled it the selfsame day, he made them stay to the end of it, to
          prove their faith. He was wrong there, because scripture days begin at
          night. "The evening and the morning were the second day." So that God
          did not make them wait, but paid them at once. As soon as the day
          came, beginning with our night, as the Jewish day does now, and the
          scriptural day always did -- as soon as the clock struck -- God paid
          his bond. We have heard of some landlords who come for their rent at
          twelve o-clock precisely. Well, we admire a man's honesty if he pays
          him exactly at that minute; but God is never behind hand in fulfilling
          his promises, not by the ticking of a clock. Though his promise seem
          to tarry, wait for it; you may be mistaken as to the date; if he has
          promised anything on a certain day, he will not keep you waiting till
          the morrow. The selfsame day that the Lord had promised, the
          Israelites came out. And so all the Lord's people shall come out of
          bondage at the predestined moment: and they cannot possibly come out
          of bondage before the appointed time. O thou poor distressed heir of
          heaven, groaning under sin, and seeking rest, but finding none,
          believe that it is the Lord's will that thou shouldst be a little
          longer where there is a smoking furnace. Wait a little he is doing
          thee good. Like Jesus of old, he is speaking hardly to thee, to try
          thy faith; he is telling thee now that thou art a dog, because he
          wants to hear thee say, "Truth, Lord, but the dogs eat of the crumbs."
          He would not keep thee waiting, if thine eagerness did not thereby get
          fresh vigour; he would not keep thee crying, if he did not mean to
          make it a sign of better grace to you for the future. Therefore wait;
          for you shall come out of Egypt, and have a joyous rescue in that day
          when they shall come with singing unto Zion, with songs and
          everlasting joy upon their heads.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, beloved, we must finish up in a very solemn manner, by
          reminding you of the companions that came out of Egypt with the
          children of Israel. When the children of Israel came out of Egypt,
          there were certain persons in Egypt, dissatisfied with the king --
          very likely culprits, condemned persons, debtors, bankrupts, and such
          like persons, who were tired of their country, and who, as is wittily
          said of those who are transported, "left their country for their
          country's good." But though these people went with the children of
          Israel, mark you, they were not of them. They escaped, but the door
          was not opened to let them out; it was only opened to let out the
          children of Israel. It is said that the mixed multitude fell a
          lusting; it was the mixed multitude that taught them to worship the
          golden calf; it was the mixed multitude that always led them astray.
          And that mixed multitude have their representatives now. There are
          many men that came out of the land of Egypt who never were Israelites;
          and there are many that join with us in church fellowship, and eat
          that spiritual bread, and drink of that spiritual rock that followed
          them; and yet with many of them God is not well-pleased, just as there
          were many of old with whom he was not well-pleased, and who were
          overthrown in the wilderness. "Ah!" says one, "but I thought if they
          had been in Egypt, certainly if they came out they must have been
          Christians; for you have used the metaphors." Ay, yes, but mark how
          these people were in Egypt. This mixed multitude was never in bondage
          in Egypt. It was Israel that had to feel the task-master's whip, and
          to make the bricks without straw. But these fellows had nothing to do.
          They were Egyptians themselves -- true-born Egyptians -- "heirs of sin
          and children of wrath;" they never had any real bondage, and therefore
          they could not rejoice as the true Israelite did, when they were set
          free from the yoke of Pharaoh. These people are represented amongst us
          by certain persons, who will tell us, "Ah! I know I have been a
          sinner." That is as much as to say you have been an Egyptian, and that
          is all: "but I cannot say, I have felt my sin, and utterly abhored it
          and wept over it." They come and say, "I am a sinner," hear something
          about Jesus Christ, catch at it with a fancied faith -- not with the
          faith that unites with the Lamb and brings us true salvation, but with
          a notional, pretended faith, and they get deliverance; and some of
          these people are marvellously happy; they do not have doubts and
          fears; they are at ease, like Moab; they have not been emptied from
          vessel to vessel. They can tell us about Egypt, of course; they know
          as much about it as the child of God. If the child of God describes
          the brick-kiln, and how they made bricks without straw, he has seen
          it, though he has not felt it; and he can talk about it, perhaps
          better than the poor Israelite; for the poor Israelite has sometimes
          been smitten on the mouth, it may be, so that he stammers, and cannot
          speak so well as the other, who never had a blow. He knows all about
          the bondage; perhaps he has invented some of it, in order to try the
          poor Israelite; and he can describe very accurately the going out of
          Egypt and the journey through the wilderness. But here is the
          difference, mark you, between the Israelites and the Egyptians. The
          Egyptians did not sprinkle the blood on the door-posts; and we do not
          read of the mixed multitude eating the paschal lamb, for it is
          written, "No stranger shall eat thereof." Some persons are continually
          saying, "I believe I am going to heaven;" but they have never
          sprinkled the blood, never eaten the paschal Lamb, never had
          fellowship with Christ, and never had vital union with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          O ye members of Christian churches! there are many of you who have a
          feigned experience and a feigned religion. How many there are of you
          who have the externals merely of godliness! ye are white-washed
          sepulchres, outwardly fair and beautiful, like the garnished gardens
          of a cemetery; but inwardly ye are full of dead men's bones and
          rottenness! Be persuaded, I beseech you, to get no deliverance any way
          except by the blood of the Lamb, and by really feasting on Christ.
          Many a man gets a deliverance by stifling his conscience. "Ah!" says
          one of these mixed multitude, "here am I in the prison; and this is
          the night when the children of Israel go out of Egypt; Oh! if I might
          go out!" What does he do? Why, the keeper is frightened; he has lost
          his eldest son, and the prisoner says, "Let me out!" and he bribes the
          keeper to let him go. And there is many a man that get out of Egypt by
          bribing his conscience. "There, master conscience," he says, "I will
          never get drunk any more; I will always go to church; there is my
          shop, that is always open on Sunday -- I will put two shutters up, and
          that is almost as good as closing it entirely; and I will not do the
          business myself -- I will get a servant to do it for me." And out he
          comes! But he had better remain in Egypt than get out like that. There
          are some again that get out by main force; the keeper falls down dead,
          and so they get out of prison. There are men who not only bribe, but
          kill their conscience; they go so far that their conscience is almost
          dead, and when he is in a fit one day they rush forth, and escape; and
          so they have "peace, peace, where there is no peace." They wrap
          themselves up in the folds of their own delusions, and invent for
          themselves refuges of lies, where they do place their trust. O ye
          mixed multitude! ye are the ruin of the churches; ye set us a lusting;
          the pure Israelite's blood is tainted by union with you; you sit as
          God's people sit, and yet you are not his people; you hear as God's
          people hear, and yet you are "in the gall of bitterness and in the
          bonds of iniquity." You take the sacrament as sweetly as others, while
          you are eating and drinking damnation to yourself; you come to the
          church-meeting, and you sit in the private assembly of the saints; but
          even when you are there, you are nothing but a wolf in sheep's
          clothing, entering the flock when you ought not to be there.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dear hearers, do try yourselves, to see whether you are real
          Israelites. Oh! could Christ say to you, "Behold an Israelite indeed,
          in whom there is no guile." Have you the blood on your door-post? Have
          you eaten of Jesus? Do you live on him? Do you have fellowship with
          him? Has God the Holy Ghost brought you out of Egypt? or have you come
          out yourself? Have you found refuge in his dear cross and wounded
          side? If you have, rejoice, for Pharaoh himself cannot bring you back
          again; but if you have not, I pray my Master to dash your peace into
          atoms, fair and lovely as it may be; I beseech him to send the winds
          of conviction and the floods of his wrath, that your house may fall
          now, rather than it should stand to your death, and then, in the last
          solemn hour, the edifice of your own hands should totter. Mixed
          multitude! hear ye this! ye assembled gatherings of professors!
          "Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your-own
          selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you,
          except ye be reprobates?" But if he be not in you, then are ye
          reprobates still, whom God abhorreth. The Lord bring all his people
          out of Egypt, and deliver all his children from the house of bondage.
