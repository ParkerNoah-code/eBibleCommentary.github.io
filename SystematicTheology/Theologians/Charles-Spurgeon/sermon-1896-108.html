          In this psalm the providence of God furnishes matter for praising him,
          because, though his excellency is far above the heavens, nevertheless,
          he deigns to cast his eyes upon the earth to take notice of mankind.
          And as not a few are disconcerted by the vicissitudes which they
          behold occurring in the world, the prophet takes occasion, from these
          sudden and unlooked for changes, to warn us to attend expressly to
          God's providence, that we may entertain no doubt that all things are
          governed according to his will and pleasure. <br />
