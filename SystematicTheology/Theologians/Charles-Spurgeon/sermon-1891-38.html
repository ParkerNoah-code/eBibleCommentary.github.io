          1. The cause, then, of such a dispensation on the part of God, is to
          be inquired after; but the formation of the world is not to be
          ascribed to any other. And all things are to be spoken of as having
          been so prepared by God beforehand, that they should be made as they
          have been made; but shadow and vacuity are not to be conjured into
          existence. But whence, let me ask, came this vacuity [of which they
          speak]? If it was indeed produced by Him who, according to them, is
          the Father and Author of all things, then it is both equal in honour
          and related to the rest of the Æons, perchance even more ancient than
          they are. Moreover, if it proceeded from the same source [as they
          did], it must be similar in nature to Him who produced it, as well as
          to those along with whom it was produced. There will therefore be an
          absolute necessity, both that the Bythus of whom they speak, along
          with Sige, be similar in nature to a vacuum, that is, that He really
          is a vacuum; and that the rest of the Æons, since they are the
          brothers of vacuity, should also be devoid of substance. If, on the
          other hand, it has not been thus produced, it must have sprang from
          and been generated by itself, and in that case it will be equal in
          point of age to that Bythus who is, according to them, the Father of
          all; and thus vacuity will be of the same nature and of the same
          honour with Him who is, according to them, the universal Father. For
          it must of necessity have been either produced by some one, or
          generated by itself, and sprung from itself. But if, in truth, vacuity
          was produced, then its producer Valentinus is also a vacuum, as are
          likewise his followers. If, again, it was not produced, but was
          generated by itself, then that which is really a vacuum is similar to,
          and the brother of, and of the same honour with, that Father who has
          been proclaimed by Valentinus; while it is more ancient, and dating
          its existence from a period greatly anterior, and more exalted in
          honour than the remaining Æons of Ptolemy himself, and Heracleon, and
          all the rest who hold the same opinions.

          2. But if, driven to despair in regard to these points, they confess
          that the Father of all contains all things, and that there is nothing
          whatever outside of the Pleroma (for it is an absolute necessity that,
          [if there be anything outside of it,] it should be bounded and
          circumscribed by something greater than itself), and that they speak
          of what is without and what within in reference to knowledge and
          ignorance, and not with respect to local distance; but that, in the
          Pleroma, or in those things which are contained by the Father, the
          whole creation which we know to have been formed, having been made by
          the Demiurge, or by the angels, is contained by the unspeakable
          greatness, as the centre is in a circle, or as a spot is in a garment,
          -- then, in the first place, what sort of a being must that Bythus be,
          who allows a stain to have place in His own bosom, and permits another
          one to create or produce within His territory, contrary to His own
          will? Such a mode of acting would truly entail [the charge of]
          degeneracy upon the entire Pleroma, since it might from the first have
          cut off that defect, and those emanations which derived their origin
          from it, and not have agreed to permit the formation of creation
          either in ignorance, or passion, or in defect. For he who can
          afterwards rectify a defect, and does, as it were, wash away a stain,
          could at a much earlier date have taken care that no such stain
          should, even at first, be found among his possessions. Or if at the
          first he allowed that the things which were made [should be as they
          are], since they could not, in fact, be formed otherwise, then it
          follows that they must always continue in the same condition. For how
          is it possible, that those things which cannot at the first obtain
          rectification, should subsequently receive it? Or how can men say that
          they are called to perfection, when those very beings who are the
          causes from which men derive their origin -- either the Demiurge
          himself, or the angels -- are declared to exist in defect? And if, as
          is maintained, [the Supreme Being,] inasmuch as He is benignant, did
          at last take pity upon men, and bestow on them perfection, He ought at
          first to have pitied those who were the creators of man, and to have
          conferred on them perfection. In this way, men too would verily have
          shared in His compassion, being formed perfect by those that were
          perfect. For if He pitied the work of these beings, He ought long
          before to have pitied themselves, and not to have allowed them to fall
          into such awful blindness.

          3. Their talk also about shadow and vacuity, in which they maintain
          that the creation with which we are concerned was formed, will be
          brought to nothing, if the things referred to were created within the
          territory which is contained by the Father. For if they hold that the
          light of their Father is such that it fills all things which are
          inside of Him, and illuminates them all, how can any vacuum or shadow
          possibly exist within that territory which is contained by the
          Pleroma, and by the light of the Father? For, in that case, it behoves
          them to point out some place within the Propator, or within the
          Pleroma, which is not illuminated, nor kept possession of by any one,
          and in which either the angels or the Demiurge formed whatever they
          pleased. Nor will it be a small amount of space in which such and so
          great a creation can be conceived of as having been formed. There will
          therefore be an absolute necessity that, within the Pleroma, or within
          the Father of whom they speak, they should conceive of some place,
          void, formless, and full of darkness, in which those things were
          formed which have been formed. By such a supposition, however, the
          light of their Father would incur a reproach, as if He could not
          illuminate and fill those things which are within Himself. Thus, then,
          when they maintain that these things were the fruit of defect and the
          work of error, they do moreover introduce defect and error within the
          Pleroma, and into the bosom of the Father.<br />
