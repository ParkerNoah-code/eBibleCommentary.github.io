        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.186)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, April 4, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto
          us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of
          our enemies." -- 1 Samuel 4:3.
        </p>
        <p>
          THESE MEN made a great mistake: what they wanted was the Lord in their
          midst; whereas they imagined that the symbol of God's presence, the
          ark of the covenant, would be amply sufficient to bestow upon them the
          assistance which they required in the day of battle. As is man, such
          must his religion be. Now, man is a compound being. To speak
          correctly, man is a spiritual being: he hath within him a soul, a
          substance far beyond the bounds of matter. But man is also made up of
          a body as well as a soul. He is not pure spirit; his spirit is
          incarnate in flesh and blood. Now, such is our religion. The religion
          of God is, as to its vitality, purely spiritual -- always so; but
          since man is made of flesh as well as of spirit, it seemed necessary
          that his religion should have something of the outward, external, and
          material, in which to embody the spiritual, or else man would not have
          been able to lay hold upon it. This was especially the case under the
          old dispensation. The religion of the Jew is really a heavenly and
          spiritual thing; a thing of thought, a thing that concerns the mind
          and spirit; but the Jew was untaught; he was but a babe, unable to
          understand spiritual things unless he saw them pictured out to him,
          or, (to repeat what I have just said) unless he saw them embodied in
          some outward type and symbol: and therefore God was pleased to give
          the Jew a great number of ceremonies, which were to his religion what
          the body is to man's soul. The Jewish religion taught the doctrine of
          the atonement, but the Jew could not understand it, and therefore God
          gave him a lamb to be slain every morning and every evening, and he
          gave him a goat over which the sins of the people were to be
          confessed, and which was to be driven into the depths of the
          wilderness, to show the great doctrine of a substitute and atonement
          through him. The Jewish religion teaches, as one of its prominent
          doctrines, the unity of the Godhead; but the Jew was ever apt to
          forget that there was but one God; and God, to teach him that, would
          have but one temple, and but one altar upon which the sacrifice might
          rightly be offered. So that the idea of the one God was (as I have
          already said) made incarnate in the fact that there was but one
          temple, but one altar, and but one great high priest. And mark, this
          is true of our religion -- Christianity: not true to so full an extent
          as of Judaism -- for the religion of the Jew had a gross and heavy
          body -- but our religion has a body transparent, and having but little
          of materialism in it. If you ask me what I would call the materialism
          of our religion, the embodiment of the spiritual part of that in which
          we trust and hope, I would point, first of all, to the two ordinances
          of the Lord, Baptism and the Lord's Supper. I would point you next to
          the services of God's house, to the Sabbath day, to the outward ritual
          of our worship: I would point you to our solemn song, to our sacred
          service of prayer; and I would point you also -- and I think I am
          right in so doing -- to the form of sound words, which we ever desire
          to hold fast and firm, as containing that creed which it is necessary
          for men to believe if they would hold the truth as it is in Jesus. Our
          religion, then, has an outward form even to this day; for the Apostle
          Paul, when he spoke of professing Christians, spoke of some who had "a
          form of godliness, but denied the power thereof." So that it is still
          true, though I confess not to the same extent as it was in the days of
          Moses, that religion must have a body, that the spiritual thing may
          come out palpably before our vision, and that we may see it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, three points this morning inferred from our narrative. The first
          point is this -- that the outward form of religion is to be carefully
          and reverently observed. But my second and most important head is this
          -- you will notice that the very men who have the least of the spirit
          of religion are the most superstitiously observant of the form of it;
          just as you find the people here, who did not care for God, had a very
          superstitious regard for that chest called the ark of the covenant.
          And then, my third point will be, that those who trust in the outward
          form of religion, apart from the spirit of it, are fearfully deceived,
          and the result of their deception must be of the most fatal character.
          The first point I feel is necessary, lest I should lead any to despise
          the form of religion, while endeavoring to insist upon the absolute
          necessity of attending in the first place to the spirit of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In the first place then, THE FORM OF RELIGION IS TO BE REVERENTLY
          OBSERVED. This ark of the covenant was with the Jew the most sacred
          instrument of his religion. There were many other things which he held
          holy: but this ark always stood in the most holy place, and it was
          rendered doubly sacred, because, between the outstretched wings of
          those cherubic figures that rested upon the mercy-seat, there was
          usually to be seen a bright light, called the Shekinah, which
          manifested that Jehovah, the God of Israel, who dwelt between the
          cherubims, was there. And, indeed, they had great reason in the days
          of Samuel to reverence this ark, for you will recollect that when
          Moses went to war with the Midianites, a great slaughter of that
          people was occasioned by the fact that Eleazar, the high priest, with
          a silver trumpet, stood in the forefront of the battle, bearing in his
          hands the holy instruments of the law -- that is , the ark; and it was
          by the presence of this ark that the victory was achieved. It was by
          this ark, too, that the river Jordan was dried up. When the tribes
          came to it, there was no ford, but the priests put the staves of the
          ark upon their shoulders, and they marched with solemn pace down to
          the waters' edge, and before the presence of the ark the waters
          receded, so that the people went through dry-shod. And when then had
          landed in the promised country, you remember it was by this ark that
          the walls of Jericho fell flat to the ground; for the priests, blowing
          the trumpets and carrying the ark, went before, when they compassed
          the city seven days, and at last, by the power of the ark, or rather
          by the power of that God who dwelt within the ark, the walls of
          Jericho fell flat down, and every man went straight up to the
          slaughter. These people, therefore, thought if they could once get the
          ark, it would be all right, and they would be sure to triumph; and,
          while I shall have in the second head, to insist upon it that they
          were wrong in superstitiously imputing strength to the poor chest, yet
          the ark was to be reverently observed, for it was the outward symbol
          of a high spiritual truth, and it was never to be treated with any
          indignity.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is quite certain, in the first place, that the form of religion
          must never be altered. You remember that this ark was made by Moses,
          according to the pattern that God had given him in the mount. Now, the
          outward forms of our religion, if they be correct, are made by God.
          His two great ordinances of Baptism and the Lord's Supper are sent for
          us from on high. I dare not alter either of them. I should think it is
          a high sin and treason against heaven, if, believing that baptism
          signifieth immersion, and immersion only, I should pretend to
          administer it by sprinkling; or, believing that baptism appertaineth
          to believers only, I should consider myself a criminal in the sight of
          God if I should give it to any but those who believe. Even so with the
          Lord's Supper. Believing that it consists of bread and wine, I hold it
          to be highly blasphemous in the Church of Rome to withhold the cup
          from the people; and knowing that this ordinance was intended for the
          Lord's people only, I consider it an act of high treason against the
          Majesty of Heaven, when any are admitted to the Lord's Supper who have
          not made a profession of their faith and of their repentance, and who
          do not declare themselves to be the true children of God. And with
          regard to the doctrines of the Gospel, no alteration must be allowed
          here. I know that forms of doctrine are very little, compared with the
          spirit and the heart; but still we must not alter even the form of it.
          It has often been said, that we ought not to have a strict religion. I
          believe that is just the very thing we ought to have: a religion that
          is of such a cast that it does not know how to alter; a religion that
          comes from the Infallible Head of the Church, that is, Jesus Christ
          our Lord, and which to the latest time is to be like the Law and the
          Prophets -- not on jot or tittle of it must fail while the earth
          endureth. The men who think that we may alter this and alter that, and
          still maintain the spirit of religion, have some truth on their side;
          but let them remember, that while the spirit of religion may be
          maintained in the midst of many errors, yet every error tends to
          weaken our spirituality. And, beside that, have no right to consider
          the effect upon ourselves merely. Whatever form of religion God has
          ordained, it is ours to practise without the slightest alteration; and
          to alter any one of the ordinances of God is an act of dire
          profanation; however reasonable that alteration may seem to be, it is
          treason against high heaven, and is not to be permitted in the Church
          of Christ. "Hold fast the form of sound words," said Paul, "which thou
          hast heard of me;" or, as I remember to have said before, while the
          form of religion is not power, yet unless the form be carefully
          observed, it is not easy to maintain the power. It is like an
          egg-shell enclosing the egg; there is no life in the shell, but you
          must take care you do not crack it, or else you may destroy the life
          within. The ordinances and doctrines of our faith are only the shell
          of religion -- they are not the life; but we must take care that we do
          not hurt so much as the outward shell, for if we do, we may endanger
          the life within; though that may manage to live, it must be weakened
          by any injury done to the outward form thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as the form must not be altered, so it must not be despised. These
          Philistines despised the ark. They took it and set it in their idol
          temple, and the result was that their idol god, Dagon, was broken in
          pieces. They then sent it through their cities, and they were smitten
          with emerods. And then, being afraid to put it within walls, they set
          it in the open country, and they were invaded with mice, so that
          everything was eaten up. God would not have any dishonour put even
          upon the outward form of his religion; he would have men reverently
          take care that they did no dishonour even to his ark; it might be
          nothing but gopher-wood, but because, between the wings of those
          cherubim God had dwelt, the ark was to be held sacred, and God would
          not have it dishonoured. Take care, ye that despise God, lest ye
          despise his outward ordinances. To laugh at the Sabbath, to despise
          the ordinances of God's House, to neglect the means of grace, to call
          the outward form of religion a vain thing -- all this is highly
          offensive in the sight of God. He will have us remember that while the
          form is not the life, yet the form is to be respected for the sake of
          the life which it contains; the body is to be venerated for the sake
          of the inward soul; and as I would have no man maim my body, even
          though in maiming it he might not be able to wound my soul, so God
          would have no man maim the outward parts of religion, although it is
          true no man can touch the real vitality of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet one more remark, and that a very solemn one. As the outward form
          is neither to be altered nor despised, so neither is it to be intruded
          upon by unworthy persons. You remember that this ark of the covenant,
          after it was brought back from the land of the Philistines, was set in
          the field of Joshua the Bethshemite, and the Bethshemites took off the
          lid, and looked into the ark of the Lord, and, for this, the Lord
          "smote of that people fifty-thousand and three-score and ten men; and
          the people lamented because the Lord had smitten many of the people
          with a great slaughter." These Bethshemites had no intention whatever
          of dishonouring the ark. They had a vain curiosity to look within, and
          the sight of those marvellous tables of stone struck them with death;
          for the law, when it is not covered by the mercy-seat, is death to any
          man, and it was death to them. Now, you will easily remember how very
          solemn a penalty is attached to any man's intruding into the outward
          form of religion when he is not called to do so. Let me quote this
          awful passage: "He" (speaking of the Lord's Supper) "that eateth and
          drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not
          discerning the Lord's body." How frightful an announcement is that! A
          curse is pronounced upon the man who dares to touch even the outward
          form of religion, unless he hath the power of it; and we know there is
          nothing which excites God's holy anger more swiftly than a man's
          attending to the ordinances of his house and making an outward
          profession of being in Christ, while he has no part nor lot in the
          matter. Oh, take heed. The outward ordinances of Christ are not the
          vitality of religion, but nevertheless they are so solemnly important,
          that we must neither alter nor despise them, nor rush into them
          without being invited; for if we do so, the curse of God must light
          upon us for having despised the holy thing of the Most High God of
          Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, before I close this first head, let me remark, that the
          outward things of God are to be diligently cared for and loved. We
          have in our reading had two instances of that. There was holy Eli: he
          knew very well that the ark of God was not God; he understood that it
          was but the outward sign of the inward and spiritual; yet when the ark
          of God was taken, mark the poor old man's trouble: his heart broke,
          and then he fell down and broke his neck. Then there was that nameless
          woman. Her husband was the priest who attended to this very ark, but
          he was a man whose character I cannot describe better than by saying
          that he was a son of Belial. It is hard for a woman to believe
          religion if she has a minister for a husband who is profane and
          wicked. This woman's husband not only committed wrongs against God,
          but against her. He was a filthy and unclean person, who polluted the
          very courts of the Lord's house with his fornications; and yet she had
          such faith in her God, that she knew how to love the religion which
          her husband, by his awful character, brought into disrepute. She knew
          how to distinguish between the man and his duty, between the priest
          and the priesthood, between the officer and the office. I do wonder at
          her. I am sure there is nothing that staggers our faith like seeing a
          minister walking inconsistently; but this man was the chief minister,
          and her own husband, living in known sin, and a sin which came home to
          her, because he sinned against her. I am sure it was wonderful that
          she believed at all; but so strong was her faith and attachment to her
          religion, that though, like Eli, she knew that the ark was not God,
          that the form was not the inward thing, yet the form itself was so
          precious to her, that the pangs of child-birth were hurried on
          prematurely and in the midst of her pain, this still was uppermost --
          that the ark of the Lord was taken. It was in vain to cheer her with
          the news that her child was born; it was an idle tale to her, and she
          rejoiced not in it. She lay in a swoon; but at last, opening her eyes,
          and remembering that her husband was dead, and that therefore,
          according to Jewish usage, it was her duty to give the child a name,
          she faintly opened her lips before she died, and said, "Call his name
          Inglorious (Ichabod) for the glory is departed;" and then she added
          this reason for it: she did not say, "because my husband is dead,"
          though she loved him; she did not say, "because my father-in-law, Eli,
          is dead" or "because my nation has been defeated," but she added that
          all-significant reason, "because the ark of the Lord was taken;" and
          she died. Oh, I would to God that we all loved God's house, and loved
          the ways of God, and the ordinances of God as much as she did. While
          we attach no superstitious importance to the outward ceremony, I wish
          we thought as much of holy things, because of the Holy One of Israel.
          as did Eli, and this nameless, but noble woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have preached upon the first head, and no ceremonialist here, I
          am sure, can differ from me, for they must all say it is true. Even
          the Puseyite will confess that this is just what he believes -- that
          ceremonies ought to be carefully observed. But I shall not agree with
          Mr. Puseyite in the second head.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, it is a notorious fact, that THE VERY MEN WHO HAVE THE LEAST
          IDEA OF WHAT SPIRITUAL RELIGION IS, ARE THE MEN WHO PAY THE MOST
          SUPERSTITIOUS ATTENTION TO OUTWARD FORMS. We refer you again to this
          instance. These people would neither repent, nor pray, nor seek God
          and his prophets; yet they sought out this ark and trusted in it with
          superstitious veneration. Now, in every country where there had been
          any religion at all that is true, the great fact has come out very
          plainly, that the people who don't know anything about true religion,
          have always been the most careful about the forms. Do you want to know
          the man who used to swallow widows' houses, and devour the patrimonies
          of the fatherless? Do you want to know the hypocrites, the deceivers,
          in the days of Christ? Why, they were the Pharisees, who "for a show
          made long prayers;" they were the men who gave alms to the poor in the
          corners of the street -- the men that tithed the anise, and the mint,
          and the cummin, and forgot the weightier matters of the law, such as
          justice and righteousness. If you wanted to find the seducer, the
          unjust judge, the liar, the perjured man, in the days of Christ, you
          had only to ask for the man who had fasted thrice in the week, and
          gave tithes of all he possessed. These Pharisees would do any wicked
          action, and never stick at it; yet if in drinking wine a small gnat
          should have fallen in and been swallowed with it, they would have
          considered themselves defiled, because their law did not allow them to
          eat a creature from which the blood had not been withdrawn. Thus they
          strained at the gnat, thus getting the reputation of being very
          religious, and swallowed the camel, hump and all. You smile; but what
          they did in their day is done now. You know the Romanists; did you
          ever know one of them who would not think it to be a very high offence
          against the Majesty of Heaven, if he were to eat any meat on Good
          Friday? Do you know anyone of them who did not think it necessary to
          keep Lent with strict punctilious observance? Notice how carefully
          they go to their places of worship on the Sabbath morning, how
          diligently they observe that sacred rite of crossing their foreheads
          with holy water. How necessary is it, that the holy water and
          everything else of the same kind, should be tenderly cared for. And do
          not the same persons in their own countries keep their theatres open
          on the Sabbath day? Do you not find the very men, who are so solemnly
          observant of their religion in the morning, forgetting it all in the
          evening; thinking no more of the Sabbath, which they call holy, than
          if it were any other day, but making it more a day of merriment than
          any day of the week? Look again at our Church of England; God be
          thanked that there are so many true Evangelical men in the midst of
          it; but there are certain sections there to whom my remarks will
          apply. Do you want to know the men who know nothing at all about the
          new birth, who do not know what it is to be justified by faith, who
          have not a spark of religion? Do you know where to find them? They are
          the men that never said their creed without turning their heads the
          right way, that never said the name of Jesus without bowing their
          heads most reverently; they are the men who always take care that the
          church should be builded so as to be a goodly edifice, in order that
          the parishioners going there may see the glory of God in the glory of
          his house; they are the people who mark every red letter day, who take
          care that every rubric is attended to, who think that holly on
          Christmas is a most heavenly thing, and a few flowers upon the altar
          almost equal to the Lily of the Valley and the Rose of Sharon. These
          are the gentlemen who could no more preach without a cassock than they
          could live without a head. Of course they have not any religion at
          all, and because the inner life is clean gone, evaporated, dissipated,
          they have to be so extremely particular that they observe the outward
          form of it. I know many Evangelical Churchmen (and they are generally
          precise enough) that would break through every form. I could point you
          out this morning some two or three clergymen of the Church of England
          who are heretical enough to be sitting here and listening to the words
          of one who is a Dissenter, and of course a Schismatic, but who would
          no more think of calling me a Schismatic than they would think of
          flying, and would give me the right hand of fellowship with all their
          hearts. I believe that many of them would forget the rubrics if they
          could, and, if it were in their power, would cut their catechism all
          to pieces, and turn half of their church prayer-book out of doors. And
          these are the men that have most religion; they care least about the
          form but they have most of the grace within; they have more true
          religion, more evangelism, more of the grace of God in their hearts,
          than fifty of their Puseyite brethren.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let me come to Dissenters, for we are just as bad. I must deal
          with all alike. We have among us a certain class of people, a sort of
          dissenting Puseyites, Where the Puseyite thinks it necessary to keep
          Good Friday and Easter Sunday, these good brethren take as much care
          to keep holy day the wrong way, as the others the right way. They
          think it would be a grievous sin to go to chapel on Good Friday, and
          they are solemnly in earnest that they should never break the law of
          the church not to observe holy days. To them it is a very sacred thing
          that they should always be found in their chapel twice on the Sunday;
          they think it highly necessary that they should have their children
          baptized, or that they should be baptized themselves, and that they
          should take the Lord's Supper. That is all well and good; but alas! we
          must confess it, there are some among us who, if they are orthodox in
          their opinions and precise in their outward practice, are quite
          content to be utterly destitute of the power of religion. I must deal
          faithfully with all. I know in all our dissenting denominations there
          are to be found many self-righteous persons, who have not any religion
          at all, but who are the most precise people in all the world to stick
          up for the outward form of it. Do you not know some old member of the
          church here and there? Well, you say, if anybody in the church is a
          hypocrite, I should say old So-and-so is one. If you were to propose
          any alteration in anything, oh! how these gentlemen would bristle up;
          how they would draw their swords. They! they love every nail in the
          chapel door, they would not have a different colour for the pulpit for
          the world. They will have everything strictly observed. Their whole
          salvation seems to depend upon the rightness of the form. Oh no, not
          they; they could not think of altering may of the forms of their
          church. You know it is quite as easy for a man to trust in
          ceremonials, when the are severely simple, as for a man to rely upon
          them with they are gorgeous and superb. A man may as much trust in the
          simple ordinance of immersion and the breaking of bread, as another
          may trust in the high mass and in the prayers of priests. We man have
          Rome in Dissent, and Rome in the Church of England, and Rome anywhere;
          for wherever there is a trust in ceremonies, there is the essence of
          Popery, there is anti-Christ and the man of sin. Oh! take heed of this
          any of you who have been relying upon your ceremonies. This is just
          the truth, that the more zeal for ceremonies, generally the less power
          of vital godliness within. But now, how is it that the man who would
          not eat anything but salt-fish on Good Friday, cheats his neighbour on
          Saturday? How is it that the man who never would by any means go to
          anything but an orthodox sixteen-ounces-to-the-pound Baptist Chapel,
          can be found committing acts of injustice in his daily business, and
          perhaps more filthy deeds still? I will tell you, the man feels he
          must have some righteousness or other, and when he knows himself to be
          a good-for-nothing rascal, he feels he has not got a moral
          righteousness, and therefore he tries to get a ceremonial one. Mark
          the man that drinks and swears, that commits all kinds of iniquity,
          and you will very often find him (I have known such cases) the most
          superstitiously reverent man that can be found. He would not go inside
          a place of worship without taking off his hat immediately. He will
          curse and swear outside, perhaps, and it never pricks his conscience;
          but to walk up the aisle of a church with his hat on -- oh! how
          frightful. He feels, if he did so, he would be lost for ever. He would
          not forget to tithe the mint, anise, and cummin, but all the while the
          weightier matters of the law are left totally unregarded. Another
          reason is, because a religion of ceremonies is so much easier than
          true religion. To say Ava Maria and Pater Nosters is easy enough; you
          may soon get it over, and it does not check the conscience much. To go
          to chapel twice on the Sunday -- there is nothing very hard in that.
          It is not half so hard as turning to the Lord with full purpose of
          heart. It is not half so hard as breaking off one's sin by
          righteousness, and putting one's trust in Christ Jesus alone.
          Therefore, because the thing is so easy, people like it better. Again
          it is so complimentary. When the Romanist beasts his back, and flogs
          his flesh, why is it that he likes that better than the simple gospel,
          "Believe and live?" Why, because it just flatters his pride. He thinks
          he is beating the devil out of himself, but he is in reality beating
          him in -- the devil of pride is coming in. He whispers, "Ah! you are a
          good man to have flogged yourself like that! you will carry yourself
          to heaven by the merit of your wounds and bruises." Poor human nature
          always like that. In fact, the more exacting a religion is, the better
          people like it. The more religion ties you up, and binds you, if it
          does not touch the heart, the better people like to carry it out.
          Hindooism has its great hold upon the people, because they can get a
          great stock of merit by walking with spikes in their shoes; or rolling
          themselves many thousands of miles, or drinking the filthy waters of
          the Ganges, or offering themselves to die. All these things please
          human nature. "Believe and live" is too humbling; to trust alone in
          Christ casts down man's high looks; therefore man says, "Away with
          it!" and he turns to anything rather than to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, there is another reason. Men always like the religion of
          ceremonies, because it does not need the giving up of their favourite
          sins. "Why", says a man, "if all that is needed for me to be saved, is
          to have the Sacrament given me by the priest when I come to die, what
          a delightful religion that is! I can drink, swear, and do just as I
          like. I have nothing to do but to get greased at last with holy oil,
          and off I go to heaven with all my sins about me." Says another, "We
          can have all our gaieties and frivolities, all the pomp of life and
          the pride of flesh; all that we need is to get confirmed; then,
          afterwards, sometimes to go to church, take a handsomely bound
          prayer-book and Bible, be very attentive and observant, and the bishop
          will no doubt set us all right." This just suits many men, because
          there is no trouble about it. They can keep on with their gaieties and
          with their sins, and yet they believe they can go to heaven with them.
          Men do not like that old-fashioned gospel which tells them that sin
          and the sinner must part, or else they must be damned. They do not
          like to be told that without holiness no man shall see the Lord, and
          that old-fashioned text, "Except a man be born again, he cannot see
          the kingdom of God," will never be palatable to human nature. Human
          nature does not mind what you tell it to do, so long as you do not
          tell it what to believe. You may tell it to observe this, that, and
          the other, and the man will do it, and thank you , and the harder it
          is, the better he will like you; but once tell him, "Jesus Christ came
          into the world to save sinners. Believe on him and thou shalt be
          saved," his pride is all up at once; he cannot endure it, and he hates
          the man that preaches it to him, and drives the very thought of the
          gospel from his soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, in the last place, it is mine to warn you that TO TRUST
          IN CEREMONIES IS A MOST DECEITFUL THING, AND WILL END IN THE MOST
          TERIFFIC CONSEQUENCES. When these people had got the ark into the
          camp, they shouted for joy , because they thought themselves quite
          safe; but, alas, they met with a greater defeat than before. Only four
          thousand men had been killed in the first battle, but in the second,
          thirty thousand footmen of Israel fell down dead. How vain are the
          hopes that men build upon their good works, and ceremonial
          observances! How frightful is that delusion which teaches for the
          gospel a thing which is not "the gospel," nor "another gospel;" but it
          is a thing that would pervert the gospel of Christ. My hearer, let me
          ask thee solemnly, what is thy ground of hope? Dost thou rely on
          baptism? O man, how foolish art thou! What can a few drops of water,
          put upon an infant's forehead, do? Some lying hypocrites tell us that
          children are regenerated by drops of water. What kind of regeneration
          is that? We have seen people hanged that were regenerated in this
          fashion. There have been men that have lived all their lives
          whoremongers, adulterers, thieves, and murderers, who have been
          regenerated in their baptism by that kind of regeneration. Oh, be not
          deceived by a regeneration so absurd, so palpable even to flesh and
          blood, as one of the lying wonders that have come from hell itself.
          But mayhap thou sayest, "Sir, I rely upon my baptism, in after life."
          Ah, my friends, what can washing in water do? As the Lord liveth, if
          thou trusteth in baptism thou trusteth in a thing that will fail thee
          at last. For what is washing in water, unless it is preceded by faith
          and repentance? We baptize you, not in order to wash away your sins,
          but because we believe they are washed away beforehand; and if we did
          not think you believed so, we would not admit you to participation in
          that ordinance. But if you will pervert this to your own destruction,
          by trusting in it, take heed; you are warned this morning. For as
          "circumcision availeth nothing, nor uncircumcision, but a new
          creature," so baptism availeth nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I may have some here who are saying within themselves, "Well, if I do
          not go to heaven, nobody will, for I have been brought up to my church
          as regularly as possible; I was regularly confirmed; my godfathers and
          godmothers stood for me in my childhood, and all after the right
          fashion. I have come here, it is true, but it is about the first
          offence I ever committed, coming into this Schismatic conventicle; if
          it please God to forgive, I will never do so again. I always go to
          church, and I have no doubt that by taking the Sacrament and saying my
          prayers I shall go to heaven." Ah! you are awfully deceived, for
          unless you are born again you must come back to the old standard after
          all -- unless you are in blessed union with the Lamb, unless you have
          found repentance for sin, unless you have true living faith in the
          Lord Jesus, you may keep all these things, you may observe every jot
          and tittle, but the gates of heaven must be shut in your face, and
          "depart from me, I never knew you," must be your doom, even though you
          reply, "Thou hast eaten and drunk in our streets, and we have listened
          to thy voice." No, my friends, be ye Presbyterians, Episcopalians, or
          Dissenters, it matters not, ye have your ceremonies; and there are
          some among us that rely upon them. This one truth cuts at the root of
          us all. If this be our hope, it is a foul delusion. We just have faith
          in Jesus, we must have the new heart and the right spirit; no outward
          forms can make us clean. The leprosy lies deep within; and unless
          there be an inward work, no outward work can ever satisfy God, and
          give us an entrance into Paradise.
        </p>
        <p>
          But before I close, there is one thing I want you to notice, and that
          is, that this ark not only could not give victory to Israel, but it
          could not preserve the lives of the priests themselves who carried it.
          This is a fatal blow to all who trust in the forms of religion. What
          would the Romanist think, if I should tell him that his outward forms
          can never save him; and how would he grind his teeth if I were to tell
          him, as I do, that the outward forms can never save his priest, for
          his priest and he must be lost together unless they have some better
          trust than this! But we have even in Protestant churches too much
          priestcraft. People say, "Well, if the Gospel does not save me, I am
          confident of the salvation of my minister." Rest assured that he that
          serveth at God's altar is no more secure from destruction, unless he
          hath a living faith in Christ, than you yourselves. Hophni and
          Phinehas are slain, and so must every priest be if he relies on
          ceremonies himself or teaches others to do so. I cannot imagine a more
          frightful death-bed than that of a man who has been a priest -- I mean
          a man who has taught others to trust in ceremonies. When he is buried,
          it will be said of him that he died in sure and certain hope of a
          blessed resurrection; but oh! the moment after death, when he opens
          his eyes to see his delusion! while he was on earth he was fool enough
          to think that drops of water could save him, that a piece of bread and
          a cup of wine could renew his heart, and save his soul, but when he
          gets into another world he will lose this folly, and then will the
          thought flash upon him, like a lightning flash, writhing his soul with
          misery -- Ah! I am destitute of the one thing needful; I had no love
          to Christ, I never had that repentance which needed not to be repented
          of; I never fled to Jesus, and now I know that that hymn is true --
        </p>
        <p>"Not all the outward forms on earth,</p>
        <p>Nor rites that God has given,</p>
        <p>Nor will of man, nor blood, nor birth,</p>
        <p>Can raise the soul to heaven."</p>
        <p>
          Oh! how frightful then afterwards to meet his parishioners, to see
          those to whom he had preached, and to be howled at through the pit by
          men whom he was the instrument of destroying, by telling them to trust
          in a rotten foundation. Let me free myself from any such fear as that.
          As the Lord my God liveth before whom I stand this day -- man, woman,
          my brother, my sister, in the race of Adam, if thou reliest on
          anything short of the blood of Jesus Christ, thou trustest in a lie;
          and if thy salvation ends in anything short of a thorough change of
          heart, if it makes thee anything less than a new creature in Christ
          Jesus,the bed is shorter than a man can stretch himself upon it, thou
          hast a religion which is not equal to the necessities of thy case, and
          when thou needest it most, it will reel beneath thy feet and leave
          thee without a standing place whereon to rest, overwhelmed with dismay
          and overcome by dispair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, before I send you away, let me make this last remark. I hear one
          say, "Sir, I renounce all trust in good works and ceremonies. Tell me
          how can I be saved?" The way is simply this. Our sins deserve
          punishment; God must and will punish sin; Jesus Christ came into this
          world and was punished in the room, place, and stead of all that
          believe on him. Your business, then, this morning is to make this
          inquiry, Do I want a Saviour? Do I feel that I want him? And my
          business, if you answer that question aright is to say, Believe on the
          Lord Jesus Christ with all thy heart, and thou shalt be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Al! there is one in heaven to-day, I firmly believe, who was always a
          worshipper in this place, and at New Park Street -- a young man who
          was led here to listen to the gospel, and was converted to God; and
          last Sabbath morning was caught away to heaven in the burning house at
          Bloomsbury -- one of those young men who was taken out of the ruins,
          one who had been brought to a knowledge of the truth here. It is
          stated in some of the papers, that his mother was far from a religious
          woman, and was somewhat given to drink; he had to struggle with some
          temptation and opposition, but he was enabled to hold on his way, and
          then, in such an hour as he thought not, the Son of Man came for him,
          and caught him to himself in the midst of flames and crashing timbers
          and the uprising of smoke. Oh! I may have one here, that, ere another
          Sabbath morning comes, may be launched into eternity, if not by the
          same deplorable process, yet in as hasty a manner; and as my soul
          rejoices over that young man, to think that God should have honoured
          me in bringing him to Christ before he took him up to heaven, I must
          lament that there are any of you in a peril so frightful, as to be
          living without God, without Christ, without a hope of heaven; to have
          death hanging over you, and yet not to tremble at it. Oh! this morning
          I beseech you, close with Christ. "Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and
          ye perish from the way, while his wrath is kindled but a little: for
          blessed are all they that put their trust in him."<br />
