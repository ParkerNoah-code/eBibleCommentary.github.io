        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.348)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, December 2nd, 1860, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>
          "If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of
          love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies." --
          Philippians 2:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE language of man has received a new coinage of words since the time
          of his perfection in Eden. Adam could scarce have understood the word
          consolation, for the simple reason that he did not understand in Eden
          the meaning of the word sorrow. O how has our language been swollen
          through the floods of our griefs and tribulations! It was not
          sufficiently wide and wild for man when he was driven out of the
          garden into the wide, wide world. After he had once eaten of the tree
          of knowledge of good and evil, as his knowledge was extended so must
          the language be by which he could express his thoughts and feelings.
          But, my hearers, when Adam first needed the word consolation, there
          was a time when he could not find the fair jewel itself. Until that
          hour when the first promise was uttered, when the seed of the woman
          was declared as being the coming man who should bruise the serpent's
          head, Adam might masticate and digest the word sorrow, but he could
          never season and flavour it with the hope or thought of consolation,
          or if the hope and thought might sometimes flit across his mind like a
          lightning flash in the midst of the tempest's dire darkness, yet it
          must have been too transient, too unsubstantial, to have made glad his
          heart, or to soothe his sorrows. Consolation is the dropping of a
          gentle dew from heaven on desert hearts beneath. True consolation,
          such as can reach the heart, must be one of the choicest gifts of
          divine mercy; and surely we are not erring from sacred Scripture when
          we avow that in its full meaning, consolation can be found nowhere
          save in Christ, who has come down from heaven, and who has again
          ascended to heaven, to provide strong and everlasting consolation for
          those whom he has bought with his blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will remember, my dear friends, that the Holy Spirit, during the
          present dispensation, is revealed to us as the Comforter. It is the
          Spirit's business to console and cheer the hearts of God's people. He
          does convince of sin; he does illuminate and instruct; but still the
          main part of his business lies in making glad the hearts of the
          renewed, in confirming the weak, and lifting up all those that be
          bowed down. Whatever the Holy Ghost may not be, he is evermore the
          Comforter to the Church; and this age is peculiarly the dispensation
          of the Holy Spirit, in which Christ cheers us not by his personal
          presence, as he shall do by-and-bye, but by te indwelling and constant
          abiding of the Holy Ghost the Comforter. Now, mark you, as the Holy
          Spirit is the Comforter, Christ is the comfort. The Holy Spirit
          consoles, but Christ is the consolation. If I may use the figure, the
          Holy Spirit is the Physician, but Christ is the medicine. He heals the
          wound, but it is by applying the holy ointment of Christ's name and
          grace. He takes not of his own things, but of the things of Christ. We
          are not consoled to-day by new revelations, but by the old revelation
          explained, enforced, and lit up with new splendour by the presence and
          power of the Holy Ghost the Comforter. If we give to the Holy Spirit
          the greek name of Paraclete, as we sometimes do, then our heart
          confers on our blessed Lord Jesus the title of the Paraclesis. If the
          one be the Comforter, the other is the comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall try this morning, first, to show how Christ in his varied
          positions is the consolation of the children of God in their varied
          trials; then we shall pass on, secondly, to observe that Christ in his
          unchanging nature is a consolation to the children of God in their
          continual sorrows; and lastly, I shall close by dwelling awhile upon
          the question as to whether Christ is a consolation to us -- putting it
          personally, "Is Christ a present and available consolation for me."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, CHRIST IN HIS VARIED POSITIONS IS A CONSOLATION FOR THE
          DIVERS ILLS OF THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Master's history is a long and eventful one; but every step of it
          may yield abundant comfort to the children of God. If we track him
          from the highest throne of glory to the cross of deepest woe, and then
          through the grave up again the shining steeps of heaven, and onward
          through his meditorial kingdom, on to the day when he shall deliver up
          the throne to God even our Father, throughout every part of that
          wondrous pathway there may be found the flowers of consolation growing
          plenteously, and the children of God have but to stoop and gather
          them. "All his paths drop fatness, all his garments which he wears in
          his different offices, smell of myrrh, and aloes and cassia, out of
          the ivory palaces, whereby he makes his people glad."
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin at the beginning, there are times when we look upon the past
          with the deepest grief. The withering of Eden's flowers has often
          caused a fading in the garden of our souls. We have mourned
          exceedingly that we have been driven out to till the ground with the
          sweat of our brow -- that the curse should have glanced on us through
          the sin of our first parent, and we have been ready to cry, "Woe worth
          the day in which our parent stretched forth his hand to touch the
          forbidden fruit." Would to God that he had rested in unsullied purity,
          that we his sons and daughters might have lived beneath an unclouded
          sky, might never have mourned the ills of bodily pain or of spiritual
          distress. To meet this very natural source of grief, I bid you
          consider Christ in old eternity. Open now the eye of thy faith,
          believer, and see Christ as thine Eternal Covenant-head stipulating to
          redeem thee even before thou hadst become a bond-slave, bound to
          deliver even before thou hadst worn the chain. Think, I pray thee, of
          the eternal council in which thy restoration was planned and declared
          even before thy fall, and in which thou wast established in an eternal
          salvation even before the necessity of that salvation had begun. O, my
          brethren, how it cheers our hearts to think of the anticipating
          mercies of God! He anticipated our fall, foreknew the ills which it
          would bring upon us, and provided in his eternal decree of
          predestinating love an effectual remedy for all our diseases, a
          certain deliverance from all our sorrows. I see thee, thou fellow of
          the Eternal, thou equal of the Almighty God! Thy goings forth were of
          old. I see thee lift thy right hand and engage thyself to fulfil thy
          Father's will -- "In the volume of the book it is written of me, I
          delight to do thy will, O God.'" I see thee forming, signing, and
          sealing that eternal covenant by which the souls of all the redeemed
          were there and then delivered from the curse, and made sure and
          certain inheritors of thy kingdom and of thy glory. In this respect
          Christ shines out as the consolation of his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, if ever your minds dwell with sadness upon the fact that we are
          at this day absent from the Lord, because we are present in the body,
          think of the great truth that Jesus Christ of old had delights with
          the sons of men, and he delights to commune and have fellowship with
          his people now. Remember that your Lord and Master appeared to Abraham
          in the plains of Mamre under the disguise of a pilgrim. Abraham was a
          pilgrim, and Christ to show his sympathy with his servant, became a
          pilgrim too. Did he not appear also to Jacob at the brook Jabbok?
          Jacob was a wrestler, and Jesus appears there as a wrestler too. Did
          he not stand before Moses under the guise and figure of a flame in the
          midst of a bush? Was not Moses at the very time the representative of
          a people who were like a bush burning with fire and yet not consumed?
          Did he not stand before Joshua -- Joshua the leader of Israel's
          troops, and did he not appear to him as the captain of the Lord's
          host? And do you not well remember that when the three holy children
          walked in the midst of the fiery furnace, he was in the midst of the
          fire too, not as a king, but as one in the fire with them? Cheer then
          thy heart with this consoling inference. If Christ appeared to his
          servants in the olden time, and manifested himself to them as bone of
          their bone, and flesh of their flesh, in all their trials and their
          troubles, he will do no less to thee to-day; he will be with thee in
          passing through the fire; he will be thy rock, thy shield, and thy
          high tower; he will be thy song, thy banner, and thy crown of
          rejoicing. Fear not, he who visited the saints of old will surely not
          be long absent from his children to-day; his delights are still with
          his people, and still will he walk with us through this weary
          wilderness. Surely this makes Christ a most blessed consolation for
          his Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now to pursue the Master's footsteps, as he comes out of the
          invisible glories of Deity, and wears the visible garment of humanity.
          Let us view the babe of Bethlehem, the child of Nazareth, the Son of
          Man. See him, he is in every respect a man. "Of the substance of his
          mother" is he made; in the substance of our flesh he suffers; in the
          trials of our flesh he bows his head; under the weakness of our flesh
          he prays, and in the temptation of our flesh he is kept and maintained
          by the grace within. You to-day are tried and troubled, and you ask
          for consolation. What better can be afforded you than what is
          presented to you in the fact that Jesus Christ is one with you in your
          nature -- that he has suffered all that you are now suffering -- that
          your pathway has been aforetime trodden by his sacred foot -- that the
          cup of which you drink is a cup which he has drained to the very
          bottom -- that the river through which you pass is one through which
          he swam, and every wave and billow which rolls over your head did in
          old time roll over him. Come! art thou ashamed to suffer what thy
          Master suffered? Shall the disciple be above his Master, and the
          servant above his Lord? Shall he die upon a cross, and wilt not thou
          bear the cross? Must he be crowned with thorns, and shalt thou be
          crowned with laurel? Is he to be pierced in hands and feet, and are
          thy members to feel no pain? O cast away the fond delusion I pray
          thee, and look to him who "endured the cross, despising the shame,"
          and be ready to endure and to suffer even as he did.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now behold our Master's humanity clothed even as ours has been
          since the fall. He comes not before us in the purple of a king, in the
          garb of the rich and the respectable, but he wears a dress in keeping
          with his apparent origin; he is a carpenter's son, and he wears a
          dress which becomes his station. View him, ye sons of poverty, as he
          stands before you in his seamless garment, the common dress of the
          peasant; and if you have felt this week the load of want -- if you
          have suffered and are suffering this very day the ills connected with
          poverty, pluck up courage, and find a consolation in the fact that
          Christ was poorer than you are -- that he knew more of the bitterness
          of want than you ever yet can guess. You cannot say, "Foxes have
          holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but I have not where to
          lay my head;" or if you could go as far as that, yet have you never
          known a forty-day's fast. You have some comforts left to you; you do
          know at least the sweet taste of bread to the hungry man, and of rest
          to the weary; but these things were often denied to him. Look at him,
          then, and see if there be not to you comfort in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          We pass now, O Jesus, from thy robe of poverty to that scene of shame
          in which thy garments were rent from thee, and thou didst hang naked
          before the sun. Children of God, if there be one place more than
          another where Christ becomes the joy and comfort of his people, it is
          where he plunged deepest into the depths of woe. Come, see him, I pray
          you, in the garden of Gethsemane; behold him, as his heart is so full
          of love that he cannot hold it in -- so full of sorrow that it must
          find a vent. Behold the bloody sweat as it distils from every pore of
          his body, and falls in gouts of gore upon the frozen ground. See him
          as all red with his own blood, wrapped in a bloody mantle of his own
          gore, he is brought before Herod and Pilate, and the Sanhedrim. See
          him now as they scourge him with their knotted whips, and afresh
          encrimson him, as though it were not ehough for him to be dyed once in
          scarlet, but he must again be enwrapped in purple. See him, I say, now
          that they have stripped him naked. Behold him as they drive the nails
          into his hand and into his feet. Look up and see the sorrowful image
          of your dolorous Lord. O mark him, as the ruby drops stand on the
          thorn-crown, and make it the blood-red diadem of the King of misery. O
          see him as his bones are out of joint, and he is poured out like water
          and brought into the dust of death. "Behold and see, was there ever
          sorrow like unto his sorrow that is done unto him?" All ye that pass
          by, draw near and look upon this spectacle of grief. Behold the
          Emperor of woe who never had an equal or a rival in his agonies! Come
          and see him; and if I read not the words of consolation written in
          lines of blood all down his side, then these eyes have never read a
          word in any book; for if there be not consolation in a murdered
          Christ, there is no joy, no peace to any heart. If in that finished
          ransom price, if in that efficacious blood, if in that all-accepted
          sacrifice, there be not joy, ye harpers of heaven, there is no joy in
          you, and the right hand of God shall know no pleasures for evermore. I
          am persuaded, men and brethren, that we have only to sit more at the
          Cross to be less troubled with our doubts, and our fears, and our
          woes. We have but to see his sorrows, and lose our sorrows; we have to
          see his wounds, and heal our own. If we would live, it must be by
          contemplation of his death; if we would rise to dignity it must be by
          considering his humiliation and his sorrow.
        </p>
        <p>"Lord, thy death and passion give</p>
        <p>Strength and comfort in my need,</p>
        <p>Every hour while here I live,</p>
        <p>On thy love my soul shall feed."</p>
        <p>
          But come now, troubled heart, and follow the dead body of thy Master,
          for though dead, it is as full of consolation as when alive. It is now
          no more naked; the loving hands of Joseph of Arimathea, and Nicodemus,
          and the Magdalene and the other Mary, have wrapped it in cerements,
          and have laid it in the new tomb. Come, saints, not to weep, but to
          dry your tears. You have been all your lifetime subject to fear of
          death: come, break your bonds asunder; be free from this fear. Where
          your Master sleeps, you may surely find an easy couch. What more could
          you desire than to lie upon the bed of your royal Solomon? The grave
          is now no more a charnel-house or a dark prison; his having entered it
          makes it a blessed retiring-room, a sacred bath in which the King's
          Esthers purify their bodies, to make them fit for the embraces of
          their Lord. It becomes now not the gate of annihilation, but the
          portal of eternal bliss, -- a joy to be anticipated, a privilege to be
          desired. "Fearless we lay us in the tomb, and sleep the night away,
          for thou art here to break the gloom, and call us back to day."
        </p>
        <p>
          I am certain, brethren, that all the consolations which wise men can
          ever afford in a dying hour will never be equal to that which is
          afforded by the record, that Jesus Christ ascended from the tomb. The
          maxims of philosophy, the endearments of affection, and the music of
          hope, will be a very poor compensation for the light of Jesus' grave.
          Death is the only mourner at Jesus' tomb, and while the whole earth
          rejoices at the sorrow of its last enemy, I would be all too glad to
          die, that I might know him, and the power of his resurrection. Heir of
          heaven! if thou wouldst be rid once for all of every doubting thought
          about the hour of thy dissolution, look, I pray thee, to Christ risen
          from the dead. Put thy finger into the print of the nails, and thrust
          thy hand into his side, and be not faithless but believing. He is
          risen; he saw no corruption; the worms could not devour him; and as
          Jesus Christ has risen from the dead, he has become the first fruits
          of them that slept. Inasmuch as he has risen, thou shalt rise. He has
          rolled the stone away, not for himself alone, but for thee also. He
          has unwrapped the grave-clothes, not for his own sake, but for thy
          sake too, and thou shalt surely stand in the latter day upon the
          earth, when he shall be here, and in thy flesh thou shalt see God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time would fail us, if we should attempt to track the Master in his
          glorious pathway after his resurrection. Let it suffice us briefly to
          observe that, having led his disciples out unto a mountain, where he
          has delighted often to commune with them, he was suddenly taken up
          from them, and a cloud received him out of their sight. We think we
          may conjecture, by the help of Scripture, what transpired after that
          cloud had covered him. Did not the angels
        </p>
        <p>"Bring his chariot from on high</p>
        <p>To bear him to his throne,</p>
        <p>Clap their triumphant wings and cry,</p>
        <p>His glorious work is done?"</p>
        <p>Do you not see him, as he mounts his triumphal chariot,</p>
        <p>"And angels chant the solemn lay,</p>
        <p>Lift up your heads, ye golden gates,</p>
        <p>Ye everlasting doors give away?"</p>
        <p>
          Behold angels gazing from the battlements of heaven, replying to their
          comrades who escort the ascending Son of Man. "Who is the King of
          Glory?" And this time those who accompany the Master sing more sweetly
          and more loudly than before, while they cry, "The Lord strong and
          mighty, the Lord mighty in battle! Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and
          be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors, that the King of Glory may come
          in." And now the doors
        </p>
        <p>"Loose all their bars of massy light,</p>
        <p>And wide unfold the radiant scene,"</p>
        <p>
          and he enters. "He claims those mansions as his right," and all the
          angels rise to "receive the King of Glory in." Behold him, as he rides
          in triumph through heaven's streets; see Death and Hell bound at his
          chariot wheels. Hark to the "Hosannas" of the spirits of the just made
          perfect! Hear how cherubim and seraphim roll out in thunders their
          everlasting song -- "Glory be unto thee; glory be unto thee, thou Son
          of God, for thou wast slain and thou hast redeemed the world by thy
          blood." See him as he mounts his throne and near his Father sits.
          Behold the benignant complacency of the paternal Deity. Hear him as he
          accepts him and gives him a name which is above every name. And I say,
          my brethren, in the midst of your tremblings, and doubtings, and
          fearings, anticipate the joy which you shall have, when you shall
          share in this triumph, for know you not that you ascended up on high
          in him? He went not up to heaven alone, but as the representative of
          all the blood-bought throng. You rode in that triumphal chariot with
          him; you were exalted on high, and made to sit far above
          principalities and powers in him; for we are risen in him, we are
          exalted in Christ. Even at this very day in Christ that Psalm is true
          -- "Thou hast put all things under his feet; thou madest him to have
          dominion over all the works of thy hands." Come, poor trembler, thou
          art little in thine own esteem, and but a worm and no man! Rise, I
          say, to the height of thy nobility; for thou art in Christ greater
          than angels be, more magnified and glorified by far. God gives you
          grace, ye who have faith, that ye may now, in the fact of Jesus
          Christ's exaltation, find consolation for yourself!
        </p>
        <p>
          But now to-day methinks I see the Master, as he stands before his
          Father's throne, dressed in the garments of a priest; upon his breast
          I see the Urim and Thummim glittering with the bejewelled remembrances
          of his people. In his hand I see still the remembrance of his
          sacrifice, the nail mark; and there I see still upon his feet the
          impress of the laver of blood in which he washed himself not as the
          priest of old with water but with his own gore. I hear him plead with
          authority before his Father's face, "I will that they also whom thou
          hast given me be with me where I am." O my poor prayers, ye shall be
          heard! O my faint groans, ye shall be answered! Oh, my poor troubled
          soul, thou art safe, for
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus pleads and must prevail,</p>
        <p>His cause can never, never fail."</p>
        <p>
          Come, my poor heart, lift up thyself now from the dunghill; shake
          thyself from the dust; ungird thy sackcloth and put on thy beautiful
          garments. He is our advocate to-day, our eloquent and earnest pleader,
          and he prevails with God. The Father smiles -- he smiles on Christ; he
          smiles on us in answer to Jesus Christ's intercession. Is he not here
          also the consolation of Israel?
        </p>
        <p>
          I only remark once more that he who has gone up into heaven shall so
          come in like manner as he was seen to go up into heaven. He ascended
          in clouds, "Behold he cometh with clouds." He went up on high with
          sound of trumpet and with shout of angels. Behold he cometh! The
          silver trumpet shall soon sound. Tis midnight: the hours are rolling
          wearily along; the virgins wise and foolish are all asleep. But the
          cry shall soon be heard -- "Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye forth
          to meet him." That same Jesus who was crucified shall come in glory.
          The hand that was pierced shall grasp the sceptre. Beneath his arm he
          shall gather up all the sceptres of all kings; monarchies shall be the
          sheaves, and he shall be the kingly reaper. On his head there shall be
          the many crowns of universal undisputed dominion. "He shall stand in
          the latter day upon the earth." His feet shall tread on the mount of
          Olivet, and his people shall be gathered in the valley of Jehoshaphat.
          Lo, the world's great battle is almost begun; the trumpet sounds the
          beginning of the battle of Armageddon. To the fight, ye warriors of
          Christ, to the fight; for it is your last conflict, and over the
          bodies of your foes ye shall rush to meet your Lord -- he fighting on
          the one side by his coming, you on the other side by drawing near to
          him. You shall meet him in the solemn hour of victory. The dead in
          Christ shall rise first, and you that are alive and remain shall be
          changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
          triumphant sounding of the dread tremendous trump. Then shall you know
          to the full how Christ can console you for all your sorrows, all your
          shame, and all your neglect which you have received from the hand of
          men. Ay, to-day bethink you, there awaits the recompense of an earthly
          splendour for your earthly poverty; there awaits you earthly dignity
          for your earthly shame. You shall not only have spiritual, but you
          shall have temporal blessings. He who takes away the curse will take
          it away not only from your soul, but from the very ground on which you
          tread. He who redeems you shall redeem not only your spirit, but your
          body. Your eyes shall see your Redeemer; your hands shall be lifted up
          in acclamation, and your feet shall bear your leaping joys in the
          procession of his glory, in your very body in which you have suffered
          for him you shall sit with him upon the throne and judge the nations
          of the earth. These things, I say, are all full of the purest and
          highest consolation to the children of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Having taken nearly all my time upon the first point, I can only
          say a word or two upon the second and on the third. The second point
          was to be this -- CHRIST IN HIS UNCHANGING NATURE; a consolation for
          our continual sorrows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ is to his people a surpassing consolation. Talk of the
          consolations of philosophy? We have all the philosopher can pretend
          to; but we have it in a higher degree. Speak of the charms of music
          which can lull our sorrows to a blessed sleep?
        </p>
        <p>"Sweeter sounds than music knows,</p>
        <p>Charm us in our Saviour's name."</p>
        <p>"Jesus, the very thought of thee,</p>
        <p>With rapture fills my breast."</p>
        <p>
          Speak we of the joys of frienship? and sweet they are indeed; but
          "there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother" -- "a brother
          born for adversity." There is one who is better than all friends, more
          able to cheer than those who are darest and nearest to our hearts. Or,
          speak we of the joys of hope? and certainly hope can console us when
          nothing else can do it. He is our hope. We cast the anchor of our hope
          into that which is within the veil, whither the forerunner hath for us
          entered. The consolations of Christ are unrivalled by any which can be
          offered by wit, by wisdom, by mirth, by hope itself; they are
          incomparable, and can never be surpassed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the consolations of Christ, from the fact of his unchanging
          nature, are unfailing.
        </p>
        <p>"When every earthly prop gives way,</p>
        <p>He still is all our strength and stay."</p>
        <p>
          Look you at Job, and see the picture of how Christ can console. The
          messenger rushes in -- "The Sabeans have taken away the oxen and the
          asses!" "Well, well," Job might console himself and say, "but the
          sheep are left." "But the fire of God hath fallen on the sheep! and
          the Chaldeans have carried away the camels and slain the servants!"
          "Alas!" the good man might say, "but my children are left, and if they
          be spared, then I can still have joy." "The wind has come from the
          wilderness, and smitten the four corners of the house, and all thy
          sons and daughters are dead!" Ah! well-a-day, penniless and childless,
          the patriarch might weep; but, looking on his wife, he would say,
          "There still remaineth one sweet comforter, my well-beloved spouse."
          She bids him "curse God and die;" "speaking as one of the foolish
          women speaketh." Yet might Job say, "Though my wife hath failed me,
          there remaineth at least three friends; there they sit with me on the
          dunghill, and they will console me." But they speak bitterness, till
          he cries, "Miserable comforters are ye all." Well, but at least he has
          his own body in health, has he not? No, he sits down upon a dunghill,
          and scrapes himself with a potsherd, for his sores become intolerable.
          Well, well, "skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for
          his life." He may at least cheer himself with the fact, that he lives.
          "Why should a living man complain?" Yes, but he fears he is about to
          die. And now comes out the grandeur of his hope: "I know that my
          Redeemer liveth, and though the worms devour this body, yet in my
          flesh shall I see God." All the other windows are darkened; but the
          sun shines in at the oriel window of redemption. All the other doors
          are shut; but this great door of hope and joy still stands wide open.
          All other wells are dry; but this flows with an unceasing stream.
          Brothers and sisters, when all things else depart, an unchanging
          Christ shall be your unchanging joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the consolations of Christ are all powerful consolations.
          When a poor soul is so deep in the mire that you cannot lift it with
          the lever of eloquence, nor draw it up with the hands of sympathy, nor
          raise it with wings of hope, he can touch it with his finger and it
          can spring up from the mire, and put his feet upon a rock, and feel
          the new song in its mouth and its goings well established. There is no
          form of melancholy which will not yield before the grace of God; there
          is no shape of distress which will not give way before the divine
          energy of the Holy Ghost the Comforter, when he uses Christ as the
          consolation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: this consolation is everlasting consolation. It consoled you, O
          aged sire, when as a youth you gave your heart to Christ; it was your
          joy in the mid-winter of your manhood; it has become your strength and
          your song in the days of your old age; when tottering on your staff
          you shall go down to Jordan's brink, he will be your consolation then.
          In the prospect of your coming dissolution, yea, when you walk through
          the valley of the shadow of death, you shall fear no evil, for he is
          with you; his rod and his staff shall comfort you. All other things
          shall pass away as a dream when you awaketh; but this substantial
          support shall abide with you in the midst of the swellings of Jordan,
          in the hour of the departure of your spirit from your body.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then remember that this is a consolation which is always within
          the believer's reach. He is "a very present help in time of trouble."
          Ye may always cheer your heart with Christ when other things are far
          away. When a friend visits you not, and your chamber becomes lonely --
          when spouse has forgotten to speak the kind word to you, and children
          have become ungrateful, he will make your bed in your sickness, he
          will be your never-failing friend and abide with you in every dark and
          gloomy hour, till he brings you into his dear arms, where you will be
          emparadised for ever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I close now with my last point -- the grave and serious question,
          IS CHRIST AN AVAILABLE CONSOLATION FOR ME?
        </p>
        <p>
          Who art thou, friend? Art thou one who needs no consolation? Hast thou
          a righteousness of thine own? Let me put it in thine own words. You
          are a good man, kind to the poor, charitable, upright, generous, holy.
          You believe there may be some faults in yourself, but they must be
          very few, and you trust that what with your own merits and with God's
          mercy you may enter heaven. In the name of God, I do solemnly assure
          you, that Christ is not an available consolation for you. Christ will
          have nothing to do with you, so long as you have anything to do with
          yourself. If you are trusting in any measure whatever upon aught that
          you have ever done or hope to do, you are trusting in a lie, and
          Christ will never be friends with a lie. He will never help you to do
          what he came to do himself. If you will take his work as it is, as a
          finished work, well and good; but if you must needs add to it your
          own, God shall add unto you the plagues which are written in this
          Book, but he shall by no means give to you any of the promises and the
          comforts which Christ can afford.
        </p>
        <p>
          But instead thereof, I will suppose that I address myself this morning
          to a man who says, "I was once, I think, a believer in Christ; I made
          a profession of religion, but I fell from it, and I have lost for
          years all the hope and joy I ever had; I think I was a presumptuous
          man, that I pretended to have what I never had, and yet at the time I
          really thought I had it. May I think that there is consolation in
          Christ for a backslider and a traitor like me? Often, sir, do I feel
          as if the doom of Judas must be mine -- as if I must perish miserably,
          like Demas, who loved this present world." Ah! backslider, backslider,
          God speaks to thee this morning, and he says, "Return ye backsliding
          children of men, for I am married to you;" and if married, there has
          never been a divorce between Christ and you. Has he put you away? Unto
          which of his creditors has he sold you? Where do you read in his Word,
          that he has divided from the affection of his heart one whose name was
          ever written in his Book? Come, come, backslider, come again to the
          cross. He who received you once will receive you again. Come where the
          flood is flowing; the blood that washed you once, can wash you yet
          once more. Come, come, thou art naked, and poor, and miserable; the
          raiment which was given to thee once, shall array thee again with
          beauty. The unsearchable riches which were opened up to thee
          aforetime, shall be thine again.
        </p>
        <p>"To thy Father's bossom press'd,</p>
        <p>Once again a child confess'd,</p>
        <p>From his hand no more to roam,</p>
        <p>Come, backsliding sinner, come."</p>
        <p>
          But I hear another say, "I am not a backslider, but simply one who
          desires to be saved. I can say honestly, I would give my right arm
          from its socket if I might but be saved. Why, sir, if I had ten
          thousand worlds I would freely cast them away as pebble stones, and
          worthless, if I might but find Christ." Poor soul, and does the devil
          tell thee thou shalt never have Christ? Why, thou hast a warrant to
          lay hold on Christ to-day. "No," sayest thou, "I have no right
          whatever." The fact that thou sayest thou hast no right should at
          least comfort the minister in addressing himself freely to thee. The
          right of a sinner to come to Christ does not lie in the sinner, nor in
          any feelings which the sinner may have had; it lies in the fact that
          Christ commands him to come. If one of you should receive as you went
          out of younder door a command to go at once to Windsor, and have an
          interview with the Queen, as soon as you had received the order and
          were sure it came from her, you might say, "Well, but if I had known
          this, I should have put on other clothes;" but the order is
          peremptory, "Come now; come just as you are;" you would, I think,
          without any very great doubt, though greatly wondering, take your
          place and ride there at once. When you came to the gate, some tall
          grenadier might ask you what you were at. "Why," he might say, "you
          are not fit to come and see Her Majesty; you are not a gentleman; you
          have not so many hundreds a year; how can you expect to be admitted?"
          You show the command, and he lets you pass on. You come to another
          door, and there is an usher there. "You are not in a court dress,"
          says he; "you are not properly robed for the occasion." You show the
          command, and he lets you pass on. But suppose when at last you should
          come into the ante-room you should say, "Now I dare not go in; I am
          not fit; I feel I shall not know how to behave myself." Suppose you
          are silly enough not to go, you would be disobedient and ten times
          more foolish in disobeying than you could have been by any blunders in
          behaviour if you had obeyed. Now it is just so with you to-day. Christ
          says, "Come unto me." He does not merely invite you, because he knows
          you would think you did not deserve the invitation; but he gives the
          command, and he bids me say to you, "Repent, and be baptized every one
          of you;" he bids me command you in his name, "Believe on the Lord
          Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved." Of his grace and mercy he puts
          it as a command. "But," you say. Ah! what right have you to say "but"
          to the Lord's commands? Again,I say, away with your "buts." What right
          have you to be "butting" at his laws and his commands. "But," you say,
          "do hear me for a moment." I will hear you then. "Sir, I cannot
          imagine that if such a hard-hearted sinner as I am were really to
          trust Christ I should be saved." The English of that is, that you give
          God the lie. He says you shall be, and do you think he speaks an
          untruth? "Ah!" says another, "but it is too good to be true. I cannot
          believe that just as I am, if I trust in Christ, my sin shall be
          forgiven." Again, I say, the simple English of that is, that you think
          you know better than God; and so you do in fact stand up and say to
          his promise, "Thou art false." He says, "Him that cometh unto me I
          will in no wise cast out." "Ah!" you say, "but that does not mean me?"
          Can any language speak more plainly? "Him. What him? Why, any "him" in
          the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes," says one, "but the invitations are made to character -- 'Come
          unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden;' I am afraid I am not
          heavy laden enough?" Yes, but you will mark, while the invitation is
          given to character, yet the promise is not given to the character; it
          is given to those who come -- "Come unto me, and I will give you
          rest;" and while that one invitation may be confined to the weary and
          heavy laden, yet there are scores of others that stand as wide and
          free as the very air we breathe. If you have that qualification, do
          not come even with it, because you are unqualified when you think you
          are qualified; you are unfit when you think you are fit; and if you
          have a sense of need, which you think makes you fit to come to Christ,
          it shows you are not fit and do not know your need; for no man knows
          his need till he thinks he does not know his need, and no man is in a
          right state to come to Christ till he thinks he is not in a right
          state to come to Christ. But he who feels that he has not one good
          thought or one good feeling to recommend him, he is the man who may
          come. He who says, "But I may not come," is the very man that is
          bidden to come. Besides, my friends, it is not what you think, or what
          I think; it is what Christ says; and is it not written by the hand of
          the Apostle John, "This is the commandment, that ye believe on Jesus
          Christ whom he hath sent?" Men who say it is not the duty of sinners
          to believe, I cannot think what they make out of such a text as that
          -- "This is the commandment, that ye believe on Jesus Christ, whom he
          hath sent;" and that one where God expressely says, "He that believeth
          not is condemned already, because he believeth not." Why, I should
          think I was addressing heathens, if I addressed a company of men who
          thought that God did not command men to repent; for Scripture is so
          plain upon the point, and I say, if God commands thee to do it, thou
          mayest do it. Let the devil say "Nay," but God says "Yes." Let him
          stand and push you back; but say to him, "Nay, Satan, nay, I come here
          in God's name;" and as devils fear and fly before the name of Christ,
          so will Satan and thy fears all fly before his command. He commands
          thee to believe -- that is, to trust him. Trust him, soul, trust him;
          right or wrong, trust him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But some of you want a great temptation, and a great deal of despair,
          before you will trust him. Well, the Lord will send it to you, if you
          will not trust him without it. I remember John Bunyan says he had a
          black temptation, and it did him a great deal of good; for, said he,
          "Before I had the temptation I used always to be questioning a
          promise, and saying, May I come, or may I not come?'" But at last he
          said, "Yea, often when I have been making to the promise, I have seen
          as if the Lord would refuse my soul for ever: I was often as if I had
          run upon the pike, and as if the Lord had thrust at me, to keep me
          from him as with a flaming sword." Ah! and perhaps you may be driven
          to that. I pray you may; but I would infinitely rather that the sweet
          love and grace of God would entice you now to trust Jesus Christ just
          as you are. He will not deceive you, sinner; he will not fail you.
          Trusting him, you shall build on a sure foundation, and find him who
          is the consolation of Israel and the joy of all his saints.
