        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.18)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, April 8, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>"Come, see the place where the Lord lay." -- Matthew 28:6.</p>
        <p>
          Every circumstance connected with the life of Christ is deeply
          interesting to the Christian mind. Wherever we behold our Saviour, he
          is well worthy of our notice.
        </p>
        <p>"His cross, his manger, and his crown,</p>
        <p>Are big with glories yet unknown."</p>
        <p>
          All his weary pilgrimage, from Bethlehem's manger to Calvary's cross,
          is, in our eyes, paved with glory. Each spot upon which he trod is, to
          our souls, consecrated at once, simply because there the foot of
          earth's Saviour and our own Redeemer once was placed. When he comes to
          Calvary, the interest thickens; then our best thoughts are centered on
          him in the agonies of crucifixion, nor does our deep affection permit
          us to leave him, even when, the struggle being over, he yields up the
          ghost. His body, when it is taken down from the tree, still is lovely
          in our eyes -- we fondly linger around the motionless clay. By faith
          we discern Joseph of Arimathea, and the timid Nicodemus, assisted by
          those holy women, drawing out the nails and taking down the mangled
          body; we behold them wrapping him in clean, white linen, hastily
          girding him round with belts of spices; then putting him in his tomb,
          and departing for the Sabbath rest. We shall, on this occasion, go
          where Mary went on the morning of the first day of the week, when
          waking from her couch before the dawn, she aroused herself to be early
          at the sepulchre of Jesus. We will try, if it be possible, by the help
          of God's Spirit, to go as she did -- not in body, but in soul -- we
          will stand at that tomb; we will examine it, and we trust we shall
          hear some truth-speaking voice coming from its hollow bosom which will
          comfort and instruct us, so that we may say of the grave of Jesus when
          we go away, "It was none other than the gate of heaven" -- a sacred
          place, deeply solemn, and sanctified by the slain body of our precious
          Saviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. AN INVITATION GIVEN. I shall commence my remarks this morning by
          inviting all Christians to come with me to the tomb of Jesus. "Come,
          see the place where the Lord lay." We will labor to render the place
          attractive, we will gently take your hand to guide you to it; and may
          it please our Master to make our hearts burn within us while we talk
          by the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Away, ye profane -- ye souls whose life is laughter, folly, and mirth!
          Away, ye sordid and carnal minds who have no taste for the spiritual,
          no delight in the celestial. We ask not your company; we speak to
          God's beloved, to the heirs of heaven, to the sanctified, the
          redeemed, the pure in heart -- and we say to them, "Come, see the
          place where the Lord lay." Surely ye need no argument to move your
          feet in the direction of the holy sepulchre; but still we will use the
          utmost power to draw your spirit thither. Come, then, for tis the
          shrine of greatness, 'tis the resting-place of the man, the Restorer
          of our race, the Conqueror of death and hell. Men will travel hundreds
          of miles to behold the place where a poet first breathed the air of
          earth; they will journey to the ancient tombs of mighty heroes, or the
          graves of men renowned by fame; but whither shall the Christian go to
          find the grave of one so famous as was Jesus? Ask me the greatest man
          who ever lived -- I tell you the man Christ Jesus was "anointed with
          the oil of gladness above his fellow." If ye seek a chamber honored as
          the resting-place of genius, turn in hither; if ye would worship at
          the grave of holiness, come ye here; if ye would see the hallowed spot
          where the choicest bones that e'er were fashioned lay for awhile, come
          with me, Christian, to that quiet garden, hard by the walls of
          Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come with me, moreover, because it is the tomb of your best friend.
          The Jews said of Mary, "she goeth unto his grave to weep there." Ye
          have lost your friends, some of you, ye have planted flowers upon
          their tombs, ye go and sit at eventide upon the green sward, bedewing
          the grass with your tears, for there your mother lies, and there your
          father or your wife. Oh! in pensive sorrow come with me to this dark
          garden of our Saviour's burial; come to the grave of your best friend
          -- your brother, yea, one who "sticketh closer than a brother." Come
          thou to the grave of thy dearest relative, O Christian, for Jesus is
          thy husband, "Thy maker is thy husband, the Lord of Hosts is his
          name." Doth not affection draw you? Do not the sweet lips of love woo
          you? Is not the place sanctified where one so well-beloved slept,
          although but for a moment ? Surely ye need no eloquence; if it were
          needed I have none. I have but the power, in simple, but earnest
          accents, to repeat the words, "Come, see the place where the Lord
          lay." On this Easter morning pay a visit to his grave, for it is the
          grave of you best friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yea, more, I will further urge you to this pious pilgrimage. Come, for
          angels bid you. Angels said, "Come, see the place where the Lord lay."
          The Syriac version reads, "Come, see the place where our Lord lay."
          Yes, angels put themselves with those poor women, and used one common
          pronoun -- our. Jesus is the Lord of angels as well as of men. Ye
          feeble women -- ye have called him Lord, ye have washed his feet, ye
          have provided for his wants, ye have hung upon his lips to catch his
          honeyed sentences, ye have sat entranced beneath his mighty eloquence;
          ye call him Master and Lord, and ye do well; "But," said the seraph,
          "he is my Lord too;" bowing his head, he sweetly said, "Come, see the
          place where our Lord lay." Dost fear then, Christian, to step into
          that tomb? Dost dread to enter there, when the angel pointeth with his
          finger and saith, "Come, we will go together, angels and men, and see
          the royal bedchamber?" Ye know that angels did go into his tomb, for
          they sat one at his head and the other at his foot in holy meditation.
          I picture to myself those bright cherubs sitting there talking to one
          another. One of them said, "It was there his feet lay;" and the other
          replied, "and there his hands, and there his head;" and in celestial
          language did they talk concerning the deep things of God; then they
          stooped and kissed the rocky floor, made sacred to the angels
          themselves, not because there they were redeemed, but because there
          their Master and their monarch, whose high behests they were obeying,
          did for awhile become the slave of death, and the captive of
          destruction. Come, Christian, then, for angels are the porters to
          unbar the door; come, for a cherub is thy messenger to usher thee into
          the death-place of death himself. Nay, start not from the entrance;
          let not the darkness affright thee; the vault is not damp with the
          vapors of death, nor doth the air contain aught of contagion. Come,
          for it is a pure and healthy place. Fear not to enter that tomb. I
          will admit that catacombs are not the places where we, who are full of
          joy, would love to go. There is something gloomy and noisome about a
          vault. there are noxious smells of corruption; oft-times pestilence is
          born where a dead body hath lain; but fear it not, Christian, for
          Christ was not left in hell -- in Hades -- neither did his body see
          corruption. Come, there is no scent, yea, rather a perfume. Step in
          here, and, if thou didst ever breathe the gales of Ceylon, or winds
          from the groves of Araby, thou shalt find them far excelled by that
          sweet, holy fragrance left by the blessed body of Jesus; that
          alabaster vase which once held divinity, and was rendered sweet and
          precious thereby. Think not thou shalt find aught obnoxious to thy
          senses. Corruption Jesus never saw; no worms ever devoured his flesh;
          no rottenness ever entered into his bones; he saw no corruption. Three
          days he slumbered, but no long enough to putrefy; he soon arose,
          perfect as when he entered, uninjured as when his limbs were composed
          for their slumber. Come then, Christian, summon up thy thoughts,
          gather all thy powers; here is a sweet invitation, let me press it
          again. Let me lead thee by the hand of meditation, my brother; let me
          take thee by the arm of thy fancy, and let me again say to thee,
          "Come, see the place where the Lord lay."
        </p>
        <p>
          There is yet one reason more why I would have thee visit this royal
          sepulchre -- because it is a quiet spot. Oh! I have longed for rest,
          for I have heard this world's rumors in my ears so long, that I have
          begged for
        </p>
        <p>"A lodge in some vast wilderness,</p>
        <p>Some boundless contiguity of shade,"</p>
        <p>
          where I might hide myself forever. I am sick of this tiring and trying
          life; my frame is weary, my soul is mad to repose herself awhile. I
          would I could lay myself down a little by the edge of some pebbly
          brook, with no companion save the fair flowers or the nodding willows.
          I would I could recline in stillness, where the air brings balm to the
          tormented brain, where there is no murmur save the hum of the summer
          bee, no whisper save that of the zephyrs, and no song except the
          caroling of the lark. I wish I could be at ease for a moment. I have
          become a man of the world; my brain is racked, my soul is tired. Oh!
          wouldst thou be quiet, Christian? Merchant, wouldst thou rest from thy
          toils? wouldst thou be calm for once? Then come hither. It is in a
          pleasant garden, far from the hum of Jerusalem; the noise and din of
          business will not reach thee there; "Come, see the place where the
          Lord lay." It is a sweet resting spot, a withdrawing room for thy
          soul, where thou mayest brush from thy garments the dust of earth and
          muse awhile in peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. ATTENTION REQUESTED. Thus I have pressed the invitation; now we
          will enter the tomb. Let us examine it with deep attention, noticing
          every circumstance connected with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, first, mark that it is a costly tomb. It is no common grave; it
          is not an excavation dug out by the spade for a pauper, in which to
          hide the last remains of his miserable and overwearied bones. It is a
          princely tomb; it was made of marble, cut in the side of a hill. Stand
          here, believer, and ask why Jesus had such a costly sepulchre. He had
          no elegant garments; he wore a coat without seam, woven from the top
          throughout, without an atom of embroidery. He owned no sumptuous
          palace, for he had not where to lay his head. His sandals were not
          rich with gold, or studded with brilliants. He was poor. Why, then
          does he lie in a noble grave? We answer, for this reason: Christ was
          unhonored till he had finished his sufferings; Christ's body suffered
          contumely, shame, spitting, buffeting, and reproach, until he had
          completed his great work; he was trampled under foot, he was "despised
          and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief;" but
          the moment he had finished his undertaking, God said, "No more shall
          that body be disgraced; if it is to sleep, let it slumber in an
          honorable grave; if it is to rest, let nobles bury it; let Joseph, the
          councillor, and Nicodemus, the man of Sanhedrim, be present at the
          funeral; let the body be embalmed with precious spices, let it have
          honor; it has had enough of contumely, and shame, and reproach, and
          buffeting; let it now be treated with respect." Christian, dost thou
          discern the meaning? Jesus, after he had finished his work, slept in a
          costly grave; for now his Father loved and honored him, since his work
          was done.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, though it is a costly grave, it is a borrowed one. I see over the
          top of it, "Sacred to the memory of the family of Joseph of
          Arimathea;" yet Jesus slept there. Yes, he was buried in another's
          sepulchre. He who had no house of his own, and rested in the
          habitation of other men; who had no table, but lived upon the
          hospitality of his disciples; who borrowed boats in which to preach,
          and had not anything in the wide world, was obliged to have a tomb
          from charity. Oh! should not the poor take courage? They dread to be
          buried at the expense of their neighbors, but if their poverty be
          unavoidable, wherefore should they blush, since Jesus Christ himself
          was interred in another's grave? Ah! I wish I might have had Joseph's
          grave to let Jesus be buried in it. Good Joseph thought he had cut it
          out for himself, and that he should lay his bones there. He had it
          excavated as a family vault, and lo, the Son of David makes it one of
          the tombs of the kings. But he did not lose it by lending it to the
          Lord; rather, he had it back with precious interest. He only lent it
          three days; then Christ resigned it; he had not injured, but perfumed
          and sanctified it, and make it far more holy, so that it would be an
          honor in future to be buried there. It was a borrowed tomb; and why? I
          take it, not to dishonor Christ, but in order to show that, as his
          sins were borrowed sins, so his burial was in a borrowed grave. Christ
          had no transgressions of his own; he took ours upon his head; he never
          committed a wrong, but he took all my sin, and all yours, if ye are
          believers; concerning all his people, it is true, he bore their griefs
          and carried their sorrows in his own body on the tree; therefore, as
          they were others' sins, so he rested in another's grave; as they were
          sins imputed, so that grave was only imputedly his. It was not his
          sepulchre; it was the tomb of Joseph.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us not weary in this pious investigation, but with fixed attention
          observe everything connected with this holy spot. The grave, we
          observe, was cut in a rock. Why was this? the rock of Ages was buried
          in a rock -- a Rock within a rock. But why? Most persons suggest that
          it was so ordained, that it might be clear that there was no covert
          way by which the disciples or others could enter and steal the body
          away. Very possibly it was the reason; but O! my soul, canst thou find
          a spiritual reason? Christ's sepulchre was cut in a rock. It was not
          cut in mould that might be worn away by the water, or might crumble
          and fall into decay. The sepulchre stands, I believe, entire to this
          day; if it does not naturally, it does spiritually. The same sepulchre
          which took the sins of Paul, shall take my iniquities into his bosom,
          for if I ever lose my guilt, it must roll off my shoulders into the
          sepulchre. It was cut in a rock, so that if a sinner were saved a
          thousand years ago, I too can be delivered, for it is a rocky
          sepulchre where sin was buried -- it was a rocky sepulchre of marble
          where my crimes were laid forever -- buried never to have a
          resurrection.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will mark, moreover, that tomb was one wherein no other man had
          ever lain. Christopher Ness says, when Christ was born, he lay in a
          virgin's womb, and when he died, he was placed in a virgin tomb; he
          slept where never man had slept before. The reason was that none might
          say that another person rose, for there never had been any other body
          there, thus a mistake of persons was impossible. Nor could it be said
          that some old prophet was interred in the place, and that Christ rose
          because he had touched his bones. You remember where Elisha was
          buried; and as they were burying a man, behold he touched the
          prophet's bones and arose. Christ touched no prophet's bones, for none
          had ever slept there; it was a new chamber where the monarch of the
          earth did take his rest for three day and three nights.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have learned a little, then, with attention; but let us stoop down
          once more before we leave the grave, and notice something else. We see
          the grave, but do you notice the grave-clothes, all wrapped and laid
          in their places, the napkin being folded up by itself? Wherefore are
          the grave-clothes wrapped up? The Jews said robbers had abstracted the
          body; but if so, surely they would have stolen the clothes; they would
          never have thought of wrapping them up an laying them down so
          carefully; they would be too much in haste to think of it. Why was it
          then? To manifest to us that Christ did not come out in a hurried
          manner. He slept till the last moment; then he awoke; he came not in
          haste. They shall not come out in haste, neither by flight, but at the
          appointed moment shall his people come to him. So at the precise hour,
          the decreed instant, Jesus Christ leisurely awoke, took off his
          cerements, left them all behind him, and came forth in his pure and
          naked innocence, perhaps to show us that as clothes were the offspring
          of sin -- when sin was atoned for by Christ, he left all raiment
          behind him -- for garments are the badges of guilt: if we had not been
          guilty we should never have needed them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the napkin, mark you, was laid by itself. The grave-clothes were
          left behind for every departed Christian to wear. The bed of death is
          well sheeted with garments of Jesus, but the napkin was laid by
          itself, because the Christian, when he dies, does not need that; it is
          used by the mourners, and the mourners only. We shall all wear
          grave-clothes, but we shall not need the napkin. When our friends die,
          the napkin is laid aside for us to use; but do our ascended brethren
          and sisters use it? No; the Lord God hath wiped away all tears from
          their eyes. We stand and view the corpses of the dear departed, we
          moisten their faces with our tears, letting whole showers of grief
          fall on their heads; but do they weep? Oh, no. Could they speak to us
          from the upper spheres they would say, "Weep not for me, for I am
          glorified. Sorrow not for me; I have left a bad world behind me, and
          have entered into a far better." They have no napkin -- they weep not.
          Strange it is that those who endure death weep not; but those who see
          them die, are weepers. When the child is born it weeps while others
          smile, (say the Arabs,) and when it dies it smiles while others weep.
          It is so with the Christian. O blessed thing! The napkin is laid by
          itself, because Christians will never want to use it when they die.
        </p>

          III. Emotion excited. We have thus surveyed the grave with deep
          attention, and, I hope, with some profit to ourselves. But that is not
          all. I love a religion which consists, in a great measure, of emotion.
          Now, if I had power, like a master, I would touch the strings of your
          hearts, and fetch a glorious tune of solemn music from them, for this
          is a deeply solemn place into which I have conducted you.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I would bid you stand and see the place where the Lord lay with
          emotions of deep sorrow. Oh cone, my beloved brother, thy Jesus once
          lay there. He was a murdered man, my soul, and thou the murderer.
        </p>
        <p>"Ah, you my sins, my cruel sins,</p>
        <p>His chief tormentors were,</p>
        <p>Each of my crimes became a nail,</p>
        <p>And unbelief the spear."</p>
        <p>"Alas! and did my Saviour bleed?</p>
        <p>And did my Sov'reign die?"</p>
        <p>
          I slew him -- this right hand struck the dagger to his heart. My deeds
          slew Christ. Alas! I slew my best beloved; I killed him who loved me
          with an everlasting love. Ye eyes, why do you refuse to weep when ye
          see Jesus' body mangled and torn? Oh! give vent to your sorrow,
          Christians, for ye have good reason to do so. I believe in what Hart
          says, that there was a time in his experience when he could so
          sympathize with Christ, that he felt more grief at the death of Christ
          than he did joy. It seemed so sad a thing that Christ should have to
          die; and to me it often appears too great a price for Jesus Christ to
          purchase worms with his own blood. Methinks I love him so much, that
          if I had seen him about to suffer, I should have been as bad as Peter,
          and have said, "That be far from thee, Lord;" but then he would have
          said to me, "Get thee behind me, Satan", for he does not approve of
          that love which would stop him from dying. "The cup which my Father
          hath given me, shall I not drink it?" But I think, had I seen him
          going up to his cross, I could fain have pressed him back and said
          "Oh! Jesus, thou shalt not die; I cannot have it. Wilt thou purchase
          my life with a price so dear?" It seems too costly for him who is the
          Prince of Life and Glory to let his fair limbs be tortured in agony;
          that the hands which carried mercies should be pierced with accursed
          nails; that the temples that were always clothed with love should have
          cruel thorns driven through them. It appears too much. Oh! weep,
          Christian, and let your sorrow rise. Is not the price all but too
          great, that your beloved should for you resign himself? Oh! I should
          think, if a person were saved from death by another, he would always
          feel deep grief if his deliverer lost his life in the attempt. I had a
          friend, who, standing by the side of a piece of frozen water, saw a
          young lad in it, and sprang upon the ice in order to save him. After
          clutching the boy, he held him in his hands and cried out, "Here he
          is! Here he is! I have saved him." But, just as they caught hold of
          the boy, he sank himself, and his body was not found for some time
          afterwards, when he was quite dead. Oh! it is so with Jesus. My soul
          was drowning. From heaven's high portals he saw me sinking in the
          depths of hell; he plunged in:
        </p>
        <p>"He sank beneath his heavy woes,</p>
        <p>To raise me to a crown;</p>
        <p>There's ne'er a gift his hand bestows,</p>
        <p>But cost his heart a groan."</p>
        <p>Ah! we may indeed regret our sin, since it slew Jesus.</p>
        <p>
          Now, Christian, change thy note a moment. "Come, see the place where
          the Lord lay," with joy and gladness. He does not lie there now. Weep,
          when ye see the tomb of Christ, but rejoice because it is empty. Thy
          sin slew him, but his divinity raised him up. Thy guilt hath murdered
          him, but his righteousness hath restored him. Oh! he hath burst the
          bonds of death, he hath ungirt the cerements of the tomb, and hath
          come out more than conqueror, crushing death beneath his feet.
          Rejoice, O Christian, for he is not there -- he is risen.
        </p>
        <p>"Come, see the place where the Lord lay."</p>
        <p>
          One more thought, and then I will speak a little concerning the
          doctrines we may learn from this grave. "Come, see the place where the
          Lord lay." with solemn awe for you and I will have to lie there too.
        </p>
        <p>"Hark! from the tomb a doleful sound,</p>
        <p>Mine ears, attend the cry,</p>
        <p>Ye living men, come view the ground</p>
        <p>Where ye must shortly lie."</p>
        <p>"Princes, this clay must be your bed,</p>
        <p>In spite of all your powers.</p>
        <p>The tall, the wise, the reverend head,</p>
        <p>Must lie as low as ours."</p>
        <p>
          It is a fact we do not often think of, that we shall all be dead in a
          little while. I know that I am made of dust, and not of iron; my bones
          are not brass, nor my sinews steel; in a little while my body must
          crumble back to its native elements. But do you ever try to picture to
          yourself the moment of your dissolution? My friends, there are some of
          you who seldom realize how old you are, how near you are to death. One
          way of remembering our age, is to see how much remains. Think how old
          eighty is, and then see how few years there are before you will get
          there. We should remember our frailty. Sometimes I have tried to think
          of the time of my departure. I do not know whether I shall die a
          violent death or not; but I would to God that I might die suddenly;
          for sudden death is sudden glory. I would I might have such a blessed
          exit as Dr. Beaumont, and die in my pulpit, laying down my body with
          my charge, and ceasing at once to work and live. But it is not mine to
          choose. Suppose I lie lingering for weeks, in the midst of pains, and
          griefs, and agonies; when that moment comes, that moment which is too
          solemn for my lips to speak of, when the spirit leaves the clay -- let
          the physician put it off for weeks, or years, as we say he does,
          though he does not -- when that moment comes, O ye lips, be dumb, and
          profane not its solemnity. When death comes, how is the strong man
          bowed down! How doth the mighty man fall! They may say they will not
          die, but there is no hope for them; they must yield, the arrow has
          gone home. I knew a man who was a wicked wretch, and I remember seeing
          him pace the floor of his bedroom saying "O God, I will not die, I
          will not die." When I begged him to lie on his bed, for he was dying,
          he said he could not die while he could walk, and he would walk till
          he did die. Ah! he expired in the utmost torments, always shrieking,
          "O God, I will not die." Oh! that moment, that last moment. See how
          clammy is the sweat upon the brow, how dry the tongue, how parched the
          lips. The man shuts his eyes and slumbers, then opens them again: and
          if he be a Christian, I can fancy that he will say:
        </p>
        <p>"Hark! they whisper: angels say,</p>
        <p>Sister spirit, come away.</p>
        <p>What is this absorbs me quite --</p>
        <p>Steals my senses -- shuts my sight --</p>
        <p>Drowns my spirit -- draws my breath?</p>
        <p>Tell me, my soul, can this be death?"</p>
        <p>
          We know not when he is dying. One gentle sigh, and the spirit breaks
          away. We can scarcely say, "he is gone," before the ransomed spirit
          takes its mansion near the throne. Come to Christ's tomb, then, for
          the silent vault must soon be your habitation. Come to Christ's grave,
          for ye must slumber there. And even you, ye sinners, for one moment I
          will ask you to come also, because ye must die as well as the rest of
          us. Your sins cannot keep you from the jaws of death. I say, sinner, I
          want thee to look at Christ's sepulchre too, for when thou diest it
          may have done thee great good to think of it. You have heard of Queen
          Elizabeth, crying out that she would give an empire for a single hour.
          Or have you heard the despairing cry of the gentleman on board the
          "Arctic," when it was going down, who shouted to the boat, "Come back!
          I will give you £30,000 if you will come and take me in." Ah! poor
          man, it were but little if he had thirty thousand worlds, if he could
          thereby prolong his life: "Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath,
          will he give for his life." Some of you who can laugh this morning,
          who came to spend a merry hour in this hall, will be dying, and then
          ye will pray and crave for life, and shriek for another Sabbath-day.
          Oh! how the Sabbaths ye have wasted will walk like ghosts before you!
          Oh! how they will shake their snaky hair in your eyes! How will ye be
          made to sorrow and weep, because ye wasted precious hours, which, when
          they are gone, are gone too far to be recalled. May God save you from
          the pangs of remorse.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. INSTRUCTION IMPARTED. And now, Christian brethren, "Come, see the
          place where the Lord lay," to learn a doctrine or two. What did you
          see when you visited "the place where the Lord lay?" "He is not here;
          for he is risen." The first thing you perceive, if you stand by his
          empty tomb, is his divinity. The dead in Christ shall rise first at
          the resurrection: but he who rose first -- their leader, rose in a
          different fashion. They rise by imparted power. He rose by his own. He
          could not slumber in the grave, because he was God. Death had no more
          dominion over him. There is no better proof of Christ's divinity that
          that startling resurrection of his, when he rose from the grave, by
          the glory of the Father. O Christian, thy Jesus is a God; his broad
          shoulders that hold thee up are indeed divine; and here thou hast the
          best proof of it -- because he rose from the grave.
        </p>
        <p>
          A second doctrine here taught well may charm thee, if the Holy Spirit
          apply it with power. Behold his empty tomb, O true believer: it is a
          sign of thine acquittal, and thy full discharge. If Jesus had not paid
          the debt, he ne'er had risen from the grave. He would have lain there
          till this moment if he had not cancelled the entire debt, by
          satisfying eternal vengeance. O beloved, is not that an overwhelming
          thought?
        </p>
        <p>"It is finished, it is finished,</p>
        <p>Hear the rising Saviour cry."</p>
        <p>
          The heavenly turnkey came, a bright angel stepped from heaven and
          rolled away the stone; but he would not have done so if Christ had not
          done all: he would have kept him there, he would have said, "Nay,nay,
          thou art the sinner now; thou hast the sins of all thine elect upon
          thy shoulder, and I will not let thee go free till thou hast paid the
          uttermost farthing." In his going free I see my own discharge.
        </p>
        <p>"My Jesu's blood's my full discharge."</p>
        <p>
          As a justified man, I have not a sin now against me in God's book. If
          I were to turn over God's eternal book, I should see every debt of
          mine receipted and cancelled.
        </p>
        <p>"Here's pardon for transgressions past,</p>
        <p>It matter not how black their cast,</p>
        <p>And O my soul, with wonder view,</p>
        <p>For sins to come, here's pardon too.</p>
        <p>Fully discharged by Christ I am,</p>
        <p>From Christ's tremendous curse and blame."</p>
        <p>
          One more doctrine we learn, and with that we will conclude -- the
          doctrine of the resurrection. Jesus rose, and as the Lord our Saviour
          rose, so all his followers must rise. Die I must -- this body must be
          a carnival for worms; it must be eaten by those tiny cannibals;
          peradventure it shall be scattered from one portion of the earth to
          another; the constituent particles of this my frame will enter into
          plants, from plants pass into animals, and thus be carried into far
          distant realms; but, at the blast of the archangel's trumpet, every
          separate atom of my body shall find its fellow; like the bones lying
          in the valley of vision, though separated from one another, the moment
          God shall speak, the bone will creep to its bone; then the flesh shall
          come upon it; the four winds of heaven shall blow, and the breath
          shall return. So let me die, let beasts devour me, let fire turn this
          body into gas and vapor, all its particles shall yet again be
          restored; this very self-same, actual body shall start up from its
          grave, glorified and made like Christ's body, yet still the same body,
          for God hath said it. Christ's same body rose; so shall mine. O my
          soul, dost thou now dread to die? Thou wilt lose thy partner body a
          little while, but thou wilt be married again in heaven; soul and body
          shall again be united before the throne of God. The grave -- what is
          it? It is the bath in which the Christian puts the clothes of his body
          to have them washed and cleansed. Death -- what is it? It is the
          waiting-room where we robe ourselves for immortality; it is the place
          where the body, like Esther, bathes itself in spices that it may be
          fit for the embrace of its Lord. Death is the gate of life; I will not
          fear to die, then, but will say,
        </p>
        <p>"Shudder not to pass the stream;</p>
        <p>Venture all thy care on him;</p>
        <p>Him whose dying love and power</p>
        <p>Stilled its tossing, hushed its roar,</p>
        <p>Safe in the expanded wave;</p>
        <p>Gentle as a summer's eve.</p>
        <p>Not one object of his care</p>
        <p>Ever suffered shipwreck there."</p>
        <p>
          Come, view the place then, with all hallowed meditation, where the
          Lord lay. Spend this afternoon, my beloved brethren, in meditating
          upon it, and very often go to Christ's grave, both to weep and to
          rejoice. Ye timid ones, do not be afraid to approach, for tis no vain
          thing to remember that timidity buried Christ. Faith would not have
          given him a funeral at all; faith would have kept him above ground,
          and would never have let him be buried; for it would have said, it
          would be useless to bury Christ if he were to rise. Fear buried him.
          Nicodemus, the night disciple, and Joseph of Arimathea, secretly, for
          fear of the Jews, went and buried him. Therefore, ye timid ones, ye
          may go too. Ready-to-halt, poor Fearing, and thou, Mrs. Despondency,
          and Much-afraid, go often there; let it be your favorite haunt, there
          build a tabernacle, there abide. And often say to your heart, when you
          are in distress and sorrow, "Come, see the place where the Lord
          lay."<br />
