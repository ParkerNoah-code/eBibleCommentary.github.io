        <p>A Sermon</p>

        <p>"Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow." -- Psalm 51:7.</p>
        <p>
          I DARESAY you have most of you heard of a little book which an old
          divine used constantly to study, and when his friends wondered what
          there was in the book, he told them that he hoped they would all know
          and understand it, but that there was not single word in it. When they
          looked at it, they found that it consisted of only three leaves; the
          first was black, the second was red, and the third was pure white. The
          old minister used to gaze upon the black leaf to remind himself of his
          sinful state by nature, upon the red leaf to call to his remembrance
          the precious blood of Christ, and upon the white leaf to picture to
          him the perfect righteousness which God has given to believers through
          the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ his Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want you, dear friends, to read this book this evening, and I desire
          to read it myself. May God the Holy Spirit graciously help us to do so
          to our profit!
        </p>
        <p>I. First, LET US LOOK AT THE BLACK LEAF.</p>
        <p>
          There is something about this in the text, for the person who used
          this prayer said, "Wash me," so he was black and needed to be washed;
          and the blackness was of such a peculiar kind that a miracle was
          needed to cleanse it away, so that the one who had been black would
          become white, and so white that he would be "whiter than snow."
        </p>
        <p>
          If we consider David's case when he wrote this Psalm, we shall see
          that he was very black. He had committed the horrible sin of adultery,
          which is so shameful a sin that we can only allude to it with bated
          breath. It is a sin which involves much unhappiness to others besides
          the persons who commit it; and it is a sin which, although the guilty
          ones may repent, cannot be undone. It is altogether a most foul and
          outrageous crime against God and man, and they who have committed it
          do indeed need to be washed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But David's sin was all the greater because of the circumstances in
          which he was placed. He was like the owner of a great flock, who had
          no need to take his neighbour's one ewe lamb when he had so many of
          his own. The sin in his case was wholly inexcusable, for he so well
          knew what a great evil it was. He was a man who had taken delight in
          God's law, meditating in it day and night. He was, therefore, familiar
          with the commandment which expressly forbad that sin; so that, when he
          sinned in this way, he sinned as one does who takes a draught of
          poison, not by mistake, but well knowing what will be the consequences
          of drinking it. It was wilful wickedness on David's part for which
          there cannot be the slightest palliation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nay, more; not only did he know the nature of the sin, but he also
          knew the sweetness of communion with God, and must have had a clear
          sense of what it must have meant for him to lose it. His fellowship
          with the Most High had been so close that he was called "the man after
          God's own heart." How sweetly has he sung of his delight in the Lord.
          You know that, in your happiest moment, when you want to praise the
          Lord with your whole heart, you cannot find any better expression than
          David has left you in his Psalms. How horrible it is that the man who
          had been in the third heaven of fellowship with God should have sinned
          in this foul fashion!
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, David had received many providential mercies at the Lord's
          hands. He was but a shepherd lad, and God took him from feeding his
          father's flock, and made him king over Israel. The Lord also delivered
          him out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear, enabled
          him to overthrow and slay giant Goliath, and to escape the malice of
          Saul when he hunted him as a partridge upon the mountains. The Lord
          preserved him from many perils, and at last firmly established him
          upon the throne; yet, after all these deliverances and mercies, this
          man, so highly favoured by God, fell into this gross sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, also, it was a further aggravation of David's sin that it was
          committed against Uriah. If you read through the lists of David's
          mighty men, you will find at the end the name of Uriah the Hittite; he
          had been with David when he was outlawed by Saul, he had accompanied
          his leader in his wanderings, he had shared his perils and privations,
          so it was a shameful return on the part of the king when he stole away
          the wife of his faithful follower who was at that very time fighting
          against the king's enemies. Searching through the whole of Scripture,
          or at least through the Old Testament, I do not know where we have the
          record of a worse sin committed by one who yet was a true child of
          God. So David had good reason to pray to the Lord, "Wash me," for he
          was indeed black with a special and peculiar blackness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, turning from David, let us consider our own blackness in the
          sight of God. Is there not, my dear friend, a peculiar blackness about
          your case as a sinner before God? I cannot picture it, but I ask you
          to call it to your remembrance now that your soul may be humbled on
          account of it. Perhaps you are the child of Christian parents, or you
          were the subject of early religious impressions, or it may be that you
          have been in other ways specially favoured by God, yet you have sinned
          against him, sinned against light and knowledge, sinned against a
          mother's tears, a father's prayers, and a pastor's admonitions and
          warnings. You were very ill once, and thought you were going to die,
          but the Lord spared your life, and restored you to health and
          strength, yet you went back to your sin as the dog returns to his
          vomit, or the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.
          Possibly a sudden sense of guilt alarmed you, so that you could not
          enjoy your sin, yet you could not break away from it. You spent your
          money for that which was not bread, and your labour for that which did
          not satisfy you, yet you went on wasting your substance with riotous
          living until you came to beggary, but even that did not wean you from
          your sin. In the house of God you had many solemn warnings, and you
          went home again and again resolving to repent, yet your resolves soon
          melted away, like the morning cloud and the early dew, leaving you
          more hardened than ever. I remember John B. Gough, at Exeter Hall,
          describing himself in his drinking days as seated upon a wild horse
          which was hurrying him to his destruction until a stronger hand than
          his own seized the reins, pulled the horse down upon its haunches, and
          rescued the reckless rider. It was a terrible picture, yet it was a
          faithful representation of the conversion of some of us. How we drove
          the spurs into that wild horse, and urged it to yet greater speed in
          its mad career until it seemed as if we would even ride over that
          gracious Being who was determined to save us! That was sin indeed, not
          merely against the dictates of an enlightened conscience, and against
          the warnings which were being continually given to us, but it was what
          the apostle calls treading under foot the Son of God, counting the
          blood of the covenant an unholy thing, and doing despite unto the
          Spirit of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me, beloved, before I turn away from this black leaf, urge you to
          study it diligently, and to try to comprehend the blackness of your
          heart and the depravity of your lives. That false peace which results
          from light thoughts of sin is the work of Satan; get rid of it at
          once, if he has wrought it in you. Do not be afraid to look at your
          sins, do not shut your eyes to them; for you to hide your face from
          them may be your ruin, but for God to hide his face from them will be
          your salvation. Look at your sins and meditate upon them until they
          even drive you to despair. "What!" says one, "until they drive me to
          despair?" Yes; I do not mean that despair which arises from unbelief,
          but that self-despair which is so near akin to confidence in Christ.
          The more God enables you to see your emptiness, the more eager will
          you be to avail yourself of Christ's fulness. I have always found
          that, as my trust in self went up, my trust in Christ went down; and
          as my trust in self went down, my trust in Christ went up, so I urge
          you to take an honest view of your own blackness of heart and life,
          for that will cause you to pray with David, "Wash me, and I shall be
          whiter than snow." Weigh yourselves in the scales of the sanctuary,
          for they never err in the slightest degree. You need not exaggerate a
          single item of your guilt, for just as you are you will find far too
          much sin within you if the Holy Spirit will enable you to see
          yourselves as you really are.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But now we must turn to the second leaf, THE BLOOD-RED LEAF OF THE
          WORDLESS BOOK, which brings to our remembrance the precious blood of
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the sinner cries, "Wash me," there must be some fount of
          cleansing where he can be washed "whiter than snow." So there is, but
          there is nothing but the crimson blood of Jesus that can wash out the
          crimson stain of sin. What is there about Jesus Christ that makes him
          able to save all who come unto God by him? This is a matter upon which
          Christians ought to meditate much and often. Try to understand, dear
          friends, the greatness of the atonement. Live much under the shadow of
          the cross. Learn to --
        </p>
        <p>"View the flowing</p>
        <p>Of the Saviour's precious blood,</p>
        <p>By divine assurance knowing</p>
        <p>He has made your peace with God."</p>
        <p>
          Feel that Christ's blood was shed for you, even for you. Never be
          satisfied till you have learned the mystery of the five wounds; never
          be content till you are "able to comprehend with all saints what is
          the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love
          of Christ, which passeth knowledge."
        </p>
        <p>
          The Power of Jesus to cleanse from sin must lie, first, in the
          greatness of his person. It is not conceivable that the sufferings of
          a mere man, however holy or great he might have been, could have made
          atonement for the sins of the whole multitude of the Lord's chosen
          people. It was because Jesus Christ was one of the persons in the
          Divine Trinity, it was because the Son of Mary was none other than the
          Son of God, it was because he who lived, and laboured, and suffered,
          and died and was the great Creator, without whom was not anything made
          that was made, that his blood has such efficacy that it can wash the
          blackest sinner so clean that they are "whiter than snow." The death
          of the best man who ever lived could not make an atonement even for
          his own sins, much less could it atone for the guilt of others; but
          when God himself "took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in
          the likeness of men," and "humbled himself, and became obedient unto
          death, even the death of the cross," no limit can be set to the value
          of the atonement that he made. We hold most firmly the doctrine of
          particular redemption, that Christ loved his Church, and gave himself
          for it; but we do not hold the doctrine of the limited value of his
          precious blood. There can be no limit to Deity, there must be infinite
          value in the atonement which was offered by him who is divine. The
          only limit of the atonement is in its design, and that design was that
          Christ should give eternal life to as many as the Father has given
          him; but in itself the atonement is sufficient for the salvation of
          the whose world, and if the entire race of mankind could be brought to
          believe in Jesus, there is enough efficacy in his precious blood to
          cleanse everyone born of woman from every sin that all of them have
          ever committed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the power of the cleansing blood of Jesus must also lie in the
          intense sufferings which he endured in making atonement for his
          people. Never was there another case like that of our precious
          Saviour. In his merely physical sufferings there may have been some
          who have endured as much as he did, for the human body is only capable
          of a certain amount of pain and agony, and others beside our Lord have
          reached that limit; but there was an element in his sufferings that
          was never present in any other case. The fact of his dying in the
          room, and place, and stead of his people, the one great sacrifice for
          the whole of his redeemed, makes his death altogether unique, so that
          not even the noblest of the noble army of martyrs can share the glory
          with him. His mental sufferings also constituted a very vital part of
          the atonement, the sufferings of his soul were the very soul of his
          sufferings. If you can comprehend the bitterness of his betrayal by
          one who had been his follower and friend, and of his desertion by all
          his disciples, his arraignment for sedition and blasphemy before
          creatures whom he had himself made; if you can realize what it was for
          him, who did no sin, to be made sin for us, and to have laid upon him
          the iniquity of us all; if you can picture to yourself how be loathed
          sin and shrank from it, you can form some slight idea of what his pure
          nature must have suffered for our sakes. We do not shrink from sin as
          Christ did because we are accustomed to it, it was once the element in
          which we lived, and moved, had our being; but his holy nature shrank
          from evil as a sensitive plant recoils from the touch. But the worst
          of his sufferings must have been when his Father's wrath was poured
          out upon him as he bore what his people deserved to bear, but which
          now they will never have to bear.
        </p>
        <p>"The waves of swelling grief</p>
        <p>Did o'er his bosom roll,</p>
        <p>And mountains of almighty wrath</p>
        <p>Lay heavy on his soul."</p>
        <p>
          For his Father to have to hide his face from him so that he cried in
          his agony, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" must have been
          a veritable hell to him. This was the tremendous draught of wrath
          which our Saviour drank for us to its last dregs so that our cup might
          not have one drop of wrath in it for ever. It must have been a great
          atonement that was purchased at so great price.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may think of the greatness of Christ's atonement in another way. It
          must have been a great atonement which has safely landed such
          multitudes of sinners in heaven, and which has saved so many great
          sinners, and transformed them into such bright saints. It must be a
          great atonement which is yet to bring innumerable myriads into the
          unity of the faith, and into the glory of the church of the firstborn,
          which are written in heaven. It is so great an atonement, sinner, that
          if thou wilt trust to it, thou shalt be saved by it however many and
          great thy sins may have been. Art thou afraid that the blood of Christ
          is not powerful enough to cleanse thee? Dost thou fear that his
          atonement cannot bear the weight of such a sinner as thou art? I
          heard, the other day, of a foolish woman at Plymouth who, for a long
          while, would not go over the Saltash Bridge because she did not think
          it was safe. When, at length, after seeing the enormous traffic that
          passed safely over the bridge, she was induced to trust herself to it,
          she trembled greatly all the time, and was not easy in her mind until
          she was off it. Of course, everybody laughed at her for thinking that
          such a ponderous structure could not bear her little weight. There may
          be some sinner, in this building, who is afraid that the great bridge
          which eternal mercy has constructed, at infinite cost, across the gulf
          which separates us from God, is not strong enough to bear his weight.
          If so, let me assure him that across that bridge of Christ's atoning
          sacrifice millions of sinners, as vile and foul as he is, have safely
          passed, and the bridge has not even trembled beneath their weight, nor
          has any single part of it ever strained or displaced. My poor fearful
          friend, your anxiety lest the great bridge of mercy should not be able
          to bear your weight reminds me of the fable of the gnat that settled
          on the bull's ear, and then was concerned lest the powerful beast
          should be incommoded by his enormous weight. It is well that you
          should have a vivid realization of the weight of your sins, but at the
          same time you should also realize that Jesus Christ, by virtue of his
          great atonement, is not only able to bear the weight of your sins, but
          he can also carry -- indeed, he has already carried upon his shoulders
          the sins of all who shall believe in him right to the end of time; and
          he has borne them away into the land of forgetfulness, where they
          shall not be remembered or recovered for ever. So efficacious is the
          blood of the everlasting covenant that even you, black as you are, may
          pray, with David, "Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. This brings me to THE WHITE LEAF OF THE WORDLESS BOOK, which is
          just as full of instruction as either the black leaf or the red one:
          "Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow."
        </p>
        <p>
          What a beautiful sight it was, this morning, when we looked out, and
          saw the ground all covered with snow! The trees were all robed in
          silver; yet it is almost an insult to the snow to compare it to
          silver, for silver at its brightest is not worthy to be compared with
          the marvelous splendour that was to be seen wherever the trees
          appeared adorned with beautiful festoons above the earth which was
          robed in its pure white mantle. If we had taken a piece of what we
          call white paper, and laid it down upon the surface of newly-fallen
          snow, it would have seemed quite begrimed in comparison with the
          spotless snow. This morning's scene at once called the text to my
          mind: "Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow." You, O black sinner,
          if you believe in Jesus, shall not only be washed in his precious
          blood until you become tolerably clean, but you shall be made white,
          yea, you shall be "whiter than snow." When we have gazed upon the pure
          whiteness of the snow before it has become defiled, it has seemed as
          though there could be nothing whiter. I know that, when I have been
          among the Alps, and have for hours looked upon the dazzling whiteness
          of the snow, I have been almost blinded by it. If the snow were to lie
          long upon the ground, and if the whole earth were to be covered with
          it, we should soon all be blind. The eyes of man have suffered with
          his soul through sin, and just as our soul would be unable to bear a
          sight of the unveiled purity a God, our eyes cannot endure to look
          upon the wondrous purity of the snow. Yet the sinner, black through
          sin, when brought under the cleansing power of the blood of Jesus,
          becomes "whiter than snow."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, how can a sinner be made "whiter than snow"? Well, first of all,
          there is a permanence about the whiteness of a blood-washed sinner
          which there is not about the snow. The snow that fell this morning was
          much of it anything but white this afternoon. Where the thaw had begun
          to work, it looked yellow even where no foot of man had trodden upon
          it; and as for the snow in the streets of London, you know how soon
          its whiteness disappears. But there is no fear that the whiteness
          which God gives to a sinner will ever depart from him; the robe of
          Christ's righteousness which is cast around him is permanently white.
        </p>
        <p>"This spotless robe the same appears</p>
        <p>When ruin'd nature sinks in years;</p>
        <p>No age can change its glorious hue,</p>
        <p>The robe of Christ is ever new."</p>
        <p>
          It is always "whiter than snow." Some of you have to live in smoky,
          grimy London, but the smoke and the grime cannot discolour the
          spotless robe of Christ's righteousness. In yourselves, you are
          stained with sin; but when you stand before God, clothed in the
          righteousness of Christ, the stains of sin are all gone. David in
          himself was black and foul when he prayed the prayer of our text, but
          clothed in the righteousness of Christ he was white and clean. The
          believer in Christ is as pure in God's sight at one time as he is at
          another. He does not look upon the varying purity of our
          sanctification as our ground of acceptance with him; but he looks upon
          the matchless and immutable purity of the person and work of the Lord
          Jesus Christ, and he accepts us in Christ, and not because of what we
          are in ourselves. Hence, when we are once "accepted in the Beloved,"
          we are permanently accepted; and being accepted in him, we are "whiter
          than snow."
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, the whiteness of snow is, after all, only created whiteness.
          It is something which God has made, yet it has not the purity which
          appertains to God himself; but the righteousness which God gives to
          the believer is a divine righteousness, as Paul says, "He hath made
          him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
          righteousness of God in him. "And remember that this is true of the
          very sinner who before was so black that he had to cry to God, "Wash
          me, and I shall be whiter than snow." There may be one who came into
          this building black as night through sin; but if he is enabled now, by
          grace, to trust in Jesus, his precious blood shall at once cleanse him
          so completely that he shall be "whiter than snow." Justification is
          not a work of degrees; it does a progress from one stage to another,
          but it is the work of a moment, and it is instantaneously complete.
          God's great gift of eternal life is bestowed in a moment, and you may
          not be able to discern the exact moment when it is bestowed. Yet you
          may know even that; for, as soon as you believe in the Lord Jesus
          Christ, you are born of God, you have passed from death unto life, you
          are saved to all eternity. The act of faith is a very simple thing,
          but it is the most God-glorifying act that a man can perform. Though
          there is no merit in faith, yet faith is a most ennobling grace, and
          Christ puts a high honour upon it when he says, "Thy faith hath saved
          thee; go in peace." Christ puts the crown of salvation upon the head
          of faith, yet faith will never wear it herself, but lays it at the
          feet of Jesus, and gives him all the honour and glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          There may be one in this place who is afraid to think that Christ will
          save him. My dear friend, do my Master the honour to believe that
          there are no depths of sin into which you may have gone which are
          beyond his reach. Believe that there is no sin that is too black to be
          washed away by the precious blood of Christ, for he has said, "All
          manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men," and "all
          manner of sin" must include yours. It is the very greatness of God's
          mercy that sometimes staggers a sinner. Let me use a homely simile to
          illustrate my meaning. Suppose you are sitting at your table, carving
          the joint for dinner, and suppose your dog is under the table, hoping
          to get a bone or a piece of gristle for his portion. Now, if you were
          to set the dish with the whole joint on it down on the floor, he would
          probably be afraid to touch it lest he should get a cut of the whip;
          he would know that a dog dose not deserve such a dinner as that, and
          that is just your difficulty, poor sinner, you know that you do not
          deserve such grace as God delights to give. But the fact that it is of
          grace shuts out the question of merit altogether. "By grace are ye
          saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of
          God." God's gifts are like himself, immeasurably great. Perhaps some
          of you think you would be content with crumbs or bones from God's
          table. Well, if he were to gives me a few crumbs or a little broken
          meat, I would be grateful for even that, but it would not satisfy me;
          but when he says to me, "Thou art my son, I have adopted thee into my
          family, and thou shalt go no more out for ever;" I do not agree with
          you that it is too good to be true. It may be too good for you, but it
          is not too good for God; he gives as only he can give. If I were in
          great need, and obtained access to the Queen, and after laying my case
          before her, she said to me, "I feel a very deep interest in your case,
          here is a penny for you," I should be quite sure that I had not seen
          the Queen, but that some lady's maid or servant had been making a fool
          of me. Oh, no! the Queen gives as Queen, and God gives as God; so that
          the greatness of his gift, instead of staggering us, should only
          assure us that it is genuine, and that it comes from God. Richard
          Baxter wisely said, "O Lord, it must be great mercy or no mercy, for
          little mercy is of no use to me!" So, sinner, go to the great God,
          with your great sin, and ask for great grace that you may be washed in
          the great fountain filled with the blood of the great sacrifice, and
          you shall have the great salvation which Christ has procured, and for
          it you shall ascribe great praise for ever and ever to Father, Son,
          and Holy Spirit. God grant that it may be so, for Jesus' sake! Amen.
        </p>
        <p>PSALM 51.</p>
        <p>
          It is a Psalm, and therefore it is to be sung. It is dedicated to the
          chief Musician, and there is music in it, but it needs a trained ear
          to catch the harmony. The sinner with a broken heart will understand
          the language and also perceive the sweetness of it; but as for the
          proud and the self-righteous, they will say, "It is a melancholy
          dirge," and turn away from it in disgust. There are times, to one
          under a sense of sin, when there is no music in the world like that of
          the 51st Psalm, and it is music for the chief Musician, for "there is
          joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that
          repenteth;" and this is the Psalm of penitence, and there is joy in
          it, and it makes joy even to the chief Musician himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Verse 1. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
          according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
          transgressions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a man of God, a man of God deeply conscious of his sin, crying
          for mercy, crying with all his heart and soul, and yet with his
          tear-dimmed eyes looking up to God, and spying out the gracious
          attributes of Deity, lovingkindness, and tender mercies, multitudes of
          them. There is no eye that is quicker to see the mercy of God than an
          eye that is washed with the tears of repentance. When we dare not look
          upon divine justice, when that burning attribute seems as if it would
          smite us with blindness, we can turn to that glorious rainbow of grace
          round about the throne, and rejoice in the lovingkindness and the
          tender mercies of our God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If washing will not remove it, burn it out, O Lord; but do cleanse me
          from it; not only from the guilt of it and the consequent punishment,
          but from the sin itself. Make me clean through and through. ' Wash me
          thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          3. For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "As if the record of it were painted on my eyeballs. I cannot look
          anywhere without seeing it. I seem to taste it in my meat and drink;
          and when I fall asleep, I dream of it, for thy wrath has come upon me,
          and now my transgression haunts me wherever I go."
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy
          sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be
          clear when thou judgest.1
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the sting of sin to a truly penitent man, that he has sinned
          against God. The carnal mind sees nothing in that. If ever it does
          repent, it repents of doing wrong to man. It only takes the manward
          side of the transgression; but God's child, though grieved at having
          wronged man, feels that the deluge of his guilt -- that which drowns
          everything else -- is that he has sinned against his God. It is the
          very token and type and mark of an acceptable repentance that it has
          an eye to sin as committed against God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now observe that the psalmist, having thus sinned, and being thus
          conscious of his guilt, is now made to see that, if the evil came out
          of him, it must have been in him at first; he would not have sinned as
          he had done had there not been an unclean fountain within him.
        </p>
        <p>
          5, 6. Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
          conceive me. Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: --
        </p>
        <p>
          Then it is not sufficient for me to be washed outside, and being
          outwardly moral is not enough. "Thou desirest truth in the inward
          parts:" --
        </p>
        <p>6. And in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.</p>
        <p>
          In that part which is even hidden from myself, where sin might lurk
          without my knowing it, there wouldst thou spy it out. I pray thee,
          Lord, eject all sin from me, rid me of the most subtle form of
          iniquity that may be concealed within me.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be
          whiter than snow.
        </p>
        <p>
          This in a grand declaration of faith. I know not of such faith as this
          anywhere else. The faith of Abraham is more amazing; but, to my mind,
          this faith of poor broken-hearted David, when he saw himself to be
          black with sin and crimson with crime, and yet could say, "Wash me,
          and I shall be whiter than snow," is grand faith. It seems to me that
          a poor, trembling, broken-down sinner, who casts himself upon the
          infinite mercy of God, brings more glory to God than all the angels
          that went not astray are ever able to bring to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. "Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast
          broken may rejoice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brothers and sisters in Christ, we cannot sin with impunity.
          Worldlings may do so as far as this life is concerned; but a child of
          God will find that, to him, sin and smart, if they do not go together,
          will follow very closely upon one another's heels. Ay, and our Father
          in heaven chastens his people very sorely, even to the breaking of
          their bones; and it is only when he applies the promises to our hearts
          by the gracious operation of his Holy Spirit, and makes the chambers
          of our soul to echo with the voice of his lovingkindness, that we
          "hear joy and gladness" again. It is only then that our broken bones
          are bound up, and begin to rejoice once more.
        </p>
        <p>9. Hide thy face from my sins,</p>
        <p>David could not bear that God should look upon them.</p>
        <p>9. And blot out all mine iniquities.</p>
        <p>
          "Put them right out of sight. Turn thy gaze away from them, and then
          put them out of everybody's sight."
        </p>
        <p>
          10. Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within
          me."
        </p>
        <p>
          Make me over again; let the image of God in man be renewed in me. Nay,
          not the image only, but renew the very Spirit of God within me."
        </p>
        <p>
          11, 12. Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy
          spirit from me, restore unto me the joy of thy salvation;
        </p>
        <p>
          "Lift me up, and then keep me up. Let me never sin against thee
          again."
        </p>
        <p>
          12,13. And uphold me with thy free spirit. Then will I teach
          transgressors thy ways;
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no such teachers of righteousness as those who have smarted
          under their own personal sin; they can indeed tell to others what the
          ways of God are. What are those ways? His ways of chastisement, -- how
          he will smite the wandering; his ways of mercy, -- how he will restore
          and forgive the penitent.
        </p>
        <p>13. And sinners shall be converted unto thee.2</p>
        <p>
          He felt sure that they would be converted; and if anything can be the
          means of converting sinners, it is the loving faithful testimony of
          one who has himself tasted that the Lord is gracious. If God has been
          merciful to you, my brother or my sister, do not hold your tongue
          about it, but tell to others what he has done for you; let the world
          know what a gracious God he is.
        </p>
        <p>
          14. Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation:
          and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.3
        </p>
        <p>
          I like that confession and that prayer of David. He does not mince
          matters, for he had guiltily caused the blood of Uriah to be shed, and
          here he owns it, with great shame, but with equal honesty and
          truthfulness. As long as you and I call our sins by pretty names, they
          will not be forgiven. The Lord knows exactly what your sin is,
          therefore do not try to use polite terms about it. Tell him what it
          is, that he may know that you know what it is. "Deliver me from
          bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation."
        </p>
        <p>
          "But surely," says someone, "there is nobody here who needs to pray
          that prayer." Well, there is one in the pulpit at least, who often
          feels that he has need to pray it; for what will happen if I preach
          not the gospel, or if I preach it not with all my heart? It may be
          that the blood of souls shall be required at my hands. And my brothers
          and sisters, if anything in your example should lead others into sin,
          or if the neglect of any opportunities that are presented to you
          should lead others to continue in their sin till they perish, will not
          the sin of bloodguiltiness be possible to you? I think you had better
          each one pray David's prayer, "Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God,
          thou God of my salvation." "And then, O Lord, if I once get clear of
          that, 'my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.'"
        </p>
        <p>15. O Lord, open thou my lips;</p>
        <p>
          He is afraid to open them himself lest he should say something amiss.
          Pardoned sinners are always afraid lest they should err again.
        </p>
        <p>
          15, 16. And my mouth shall shew forth thy praise. For thou desirest no
          sacrifice; else would I give it:
        </p>
        <p>
          "Whatever there is in the whole world that thou desirest, I would
          gladly give it to thee, my God."
        </p>
        <p>
          16-18. Thou delightest not in burnt offering. The sacrifices of God
          are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou will
          not despise. Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: --
        </p>
        <p>
          You see that the psalmist loves the chosen people of God. With all his
          faults, his heart is right towards the kingdom under his charge. He
          feels that he has helped to break down Zion, and to do mischief to
          Jerusalem, so he prays, "Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion:" --
        </p>
        <p>
          18, 19. Build thou the walls of Jerusalem. Then shalt thou be pleased
          with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole
          burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once get your sins forgiven, and then God will accept your sacrifices.
          Then bring what you will with all your heart, for an accepted sinner
          makes an accepted sacrifice, through Jesus Christ.
