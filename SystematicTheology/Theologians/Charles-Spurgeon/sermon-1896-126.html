          1. Praise Jehovah, all ye nations; magnify him:, all ye peoples. 2.
          Because his mercy is strengthened towards us: and the truth of Jehovah
          remains for ever. Praise ye Jehovah.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          1 Praise Jehovah, all ye nations. The Holy Spirit having, by the mouth
          of the prophet, exhorted all nations to celebrate the praises of God's
          mercy and faithfulness, Paul, in his Epistle to the Romans, very
          justly considers this as a prediction respecting the calling of the
          whole world, (Romans 15:11.) How can unbelievers be qualified for
          praising God, who, though not entirely destitute of his mercy, yet are
          insensible of it, and are ignorant of his truth? It would therefore
          serve no purpose for the prophet to address the heathen nations,
          unless they were to be gathered together in the unity of the faith
          with the children of Abraham. There is no ground for the censorious
          attempting, by their sophistical arguments, to refute the reasoning of
          Paul. I grant that the Holy Spirit elsewhere calls upon the mountains,
          rivers, trees, rain, winds, and thunder, to resound the praises of
          God, because all creation silently proclaims him to be its Maker. It
          is in a different manner that he is praised by his rational creatures.
          The reason assigned is, that God's mercy and truth furnish materials
          for celebrating his praises. Besides, the prophet does not mean that
          God shall be praised everywhere by the Gentiles, because the knowledge
          of his character is confined to a small portion of the land of Judea,
          but because it was to be spread over the whole world. First, he
          enjoins God to be praised, because his goodness is increased, or
          strengthened, for the Hebrew term admits of both meanings. Secondly,
          because his truth remains steadfast for ever How, then, are those
          qualified to celebrate his praises, who, with brutal insensibility,
          pass over his goodness, and shut their ears against his heavenly
          doctrine?
        </p>
        <p>
          The truth of God, in this passage, is properly introduced as an
          attestation of his grace. For he can be true even when he menaces the
          whole world with perdition and ruin. The prophet, however, has placed
          his mercy first in order that his faithfulness and truth, comprising
          an assurance of his paternal kindness, might encourage the hearts of
          the godly. His power and justice are equally praiseworthy; but as men
          will never cordially praise God until they are drawn by a foretaste of
          his goodness, the prophet very justly selects God's mercy and truth,
          which alone open the mouths of those who are mute to engage in this
          exercise. When his truth is said to be everlasting, it is not set in
          opposition to his mercy, as if it, after flourishing for a season,
          then instantly passed away. The same reason would go to prove, that it
          was small compared with his mercy, which is said to be abundant. The
          meaning is, that God's mercy is rich towards us, flowing in a
          perennial stream, because united to his eternal truth. If we read, his
          mercy is confirmed, all difficulty will be removed, for then both
          constancy and stability will alike adorn his mercy and his truth.
