          TITLE. <b>To the Chief Musician</b>. So glad a song as this becomes
          before it closes, should be in the keeping of the most skilled of all
          the temple minstrels. Altaschith, that is, DESTROY NOT. This petition
          is a very sententious prayer, as full as it is brief, and well worthy
          to be the motto for a sacred song. David had said, "destroy not," in
          reference to Saul, when he had him in his power, and now he takes
          pleasure in employing the same words in supplication to God. We may
          infer from the spirit of the Lord's prayer, that the Lord will spare
          us as we spare our foes. There are four of these "Destroy not" Psalms,
          namely, the 57th, 58th, 59th, and 75th. In all of them there is a
          distinct declaration of the destruction of the wicked and the
          preservation of the righteous, and they all have probably a reference
          to the overthrow of the Jews, on account of their persecution of the
          great Son of David: they will endure heavy chastisement, but
          concerning them it is written in the divine decree, "Destroy them
          not."
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">A Michtam of David</p></b>. For quality this
        Psalm is called golden, or a secret, and it well deserves the name. We
        may read the words and yet not know the secret joy of David, which he
        has locked up in his golden casket.
        <b> <p align="justify">When he fled from Saul in the cave</p></b>. This
        is a song from the affections of the earth, and, like Jonah's prayer
        from the bottom of the sea, it has a taste of the place. The poet is in
        the shadow of the cave at first, but he comes to the cavern's mouth at
        last, and sings in the sweet fresh air, with his eye on the heavens,
        watching joyously the clouds floating therein.
        <p align="justify">
          DIVISION. We have here:<br />
          Prayer, verse 1-6.<br />
          Praise, verse 7-11.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The hunted one takes a long breath of prayer, and when he is fully
          inspired, he breathes out his soul in jubilant song.<br />
           
        </p>
        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 1. Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me.
          </p></b
        >Urgent need suggests the repetition of the cry, for thus intense
        urgency of desire is expressed. If 'he gives twice who gives quickly,'
        so he who would receive quickly must ask twice.
        <p align="justify">
          For mercy the psalmist pleads at first, and he feels he cannot improve
          upon his plea, and therefore returns to it. God is the God of mercy,
          and the Father of mercies, it is most fit therefore that in distress
          he should seek mercy from him in whom it dwells.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">For my soul trusts in you.</p></b> Faith urges
        her suit right well. How can the Lord be unmerciful to a trustful soul?
        Our faith does not deserve mercy, but it always wins it from the
        sovereign grace of God when it is sincere, as in this case where the
        soul of the man believed. "With the heart man believes unto
        righteousness."
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Yes, in the shadow of your wings will I make my refuge.
          </p></b
        >
        Not in the cave alone would he hide, but in the cleft of the Rock of
        ages. As the little birds find ample shelter beneath the parental wing,
        even so would the fugitive place himself beneath the secure protection
        of the divine power.
        <p align="justify">
          The emblem is delightfully familiar and suggestive. May we all
          experimentally know its meaning.
          <i
            >When we cannot see the sunshine of God's face, it is blessed to
            cower down beneath the shadow of his wings.
          </i>
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Until these calamities be overpast.</p></b>Evil
        will pass away, and the eternal wings will abide over us until then.
        Blessed be God, our calamities are matters of time, but our safety is a
        matter of eternity. When we are under the divine shadow, the passing
        over of trouble cannot harm us; the hawk flies across the sky, but this
        is no evil to the chicks when they are safely nestling beneath the hen.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 2. I will cry.</p></b>He is quite safe, but
        yet he prays, for faith is never silent. We pray because we believe. We
        exercise by faith the spirit of adoption whereby we cry.
        <p align="justify">
          He says not I <i>do </i>cry, or I <i>have </i>cried, but I
          <i>will </i>cry, and indeed, this resolution may stand with all of us
          until we pass through the gates of pearl; for while we are here below
          we shall still have need to cry.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Unto God most high.</p></b>Prayers are for God
        only; the greatness and sublimity of his person and character suggest
        and encourage prayer; however high our enemies, our heavenly Friend is
        higher, for he is Most high, and he can readily send from the height of
        his power the support which we need.
        <b> <p align="justify">Unto God that performs all things for me.</p></b>
        He has cogent reason for praying, for he sees God performing. The
        believer waits and God works. The Lord has undertaken for us, and he
        will not draw back, he will go through with his covenant engagements.
        <p align="justify">
          Our translators have very properly inserted the words, "all things,"
          for there is a blank in the Hebrew, as if it were a carte blanche, and
          you might write therein that the Lord would finish anything and
          everything which he has begun.<i>
            Whatever the Lord takes in hand he will accomplish</i
          >; hence past mercies are guarantees for the future, and admirable
          reasons for continuing to cry unto him.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 3. He shall send from Heaven.</p></b> If
        there be no fit instruments on earth, Heaven shall yield up its legions
        of angels for the support of the saints. We may in times of great
        straits expect mercies of a remarkable kind. Like the Israelites in the
        wilderness, we shall have our bread hot from Heaven, new every morning;
        and for the overthrow of our enemies God shall open his celestial
        batteries, and put them to utter confusion. Wherever the battle is more
        fierce than ordinary, there shall come support from headquarters, for
        the Commander in chief sees all.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            And save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up.
          </p></b
        >
        He will be in time, not only to rescue his servants from being swallowed
        up, but even from being reproached. Not only shall they escape the
        flames, but not even the smell of fire shall pass upon them.<i>
          O dog of Hell, I am not only delivered from your bite, but even from
          your bark.
        </i>
        Our foes shall not have the power to sneer at us, their cruel jests and
        taunting gibes shall be ended by the message from Heaven, which shall
        forever save us.
        <b> <p align="justify">Selah.</p></b> Such mercy may well make us pause
        to meditate and give thanks. Rest, singer, for God has given you rest!
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.
          </p></b
        >He asked for mercy, and truth came with it. Thus evermore does God give
        us more than we ask or think. His attributes, like angels on the wing,
        are ever ready to come to the rescue of his chosen.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 4. My soul is among lions.</p></b> He was a
        very Daniel. Howled at, hunted, wounded, but not slain. His place was in
        itself one of extreme peril, and yet faith made him feel himself secure,
        so that he could lie down. The cave may have reminded him of a lion's
        den, and Saul and his band shouting and yelling in their disappointment
        at missing him, were the lions; yet beneath the divine shelter he finds
        himself safe.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            And I lie even among them that are set on fire.
          </p></b
        >
        Perhaps Saul and his band kindled a fire in the cavern while they halted
        in it, and David was thus reminded of the fiercer fire of their hate
        which burned within their hearts.
        <p align="justify">
          Like the bush in Horeb, the believer is often in the midst of flames,
          but never consumed. It is a mighty triumph of faith when we can lie
          down even among firebrands and find rest, because God is our defense.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">

            tongue a sharp sword.
          </p></b
        >Malicious men carry a whole armory in their mouths; they have not
        harmless mouths, whose teeth grind their own food as in a mill, but
        their jaws are as mischievous as if every tooth were a javelin or an
        arrow. They have no molars, all their teeth are canines, and their
        nature is canine, leonine, wolfish, devilish.
        <p align="justify">
          As for that busy member the tongue, in the case of the malicious, it
          is a two edged, keen, cutting, killing sword. The tongue, which is
          here compared to a sword, has the adjective <i>sharp </i>added to it,
          which is not used in reference to the teeth, which are compared to
          spears, as if to show that if men were actually to tear us with their
          teeth, like wild beasts, they could not thereby wound us so severely
          as they can do with their tongues.

            Verse 5. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens.
          </p></b

        This is the chorus of the Psalm. Before he has quite concluded his
        prayer the godly man interjects a verse of praise; and glorious praise
        too, seeing it comes from the lion's den and from amid the coals of
        fire.
        <p align="justify">
          Higher than the heavens is the Most High, and so high ought our
          praises to rise. Above even the power of cherubim and seraphim to
          express it, the glory of God is revealed and is to be acknowledged by
          us.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Let your glory be above all the earth.</p></b>As
        above, so below, let your praises, O you great Jehovah, be universally
        proclaimed. As the air surrounds all nature, so let your praises gird
        the earth with a zone of song.
        <b>

            Verse 6. They have prepared a net for my steps.
          </p></b
        >
        The enemies of the godly spare no pains, but go about their wicked work
        with the coolest deliberation. As for each sort of fish, or bird, or
        beast, a fitting net is needed, so do the ungodly suit their net to
        their victim's circumstances and character with a careful craftiness of
        malice. Whatever David might do, and whichever way he might turn, his
        enemies were ready to entrap him in some way or other.
        <b> <p align="justify">My soul is bowed down.</p></b> He was held down
        like a bird in a trap; his enemies took care to leave him no chance of
        comfort.

          <p align="justify">

            fallen themselves.
          </p></b
        >
        He likens the design of his persecutors to pits, which were commonly dug
        by hunters to entrap their prey; these were made in the usual path of
        the victim, and in this case David says, before me, that is, in my
        ordinary way. He rejoices because these devices had recoiled upon
        themselves. Saul hunted David, but David caught him more than once and
        might have slain him on the spot.<i>
          Evil is a stream which one day flows back to its source. </i

        the truly devout evangelic spirit overleaps the boundaries which bigotry
        sets up. The ordinary Jew would never wish the Gentile dogs to hear
        Jehovah's name, except to tremble at it; but this grace-taught psalmist

        Right up from man's lowliness to Heaven's loftiness mercy reaches.
        Imagination fails to guess the height of Heaven, and even thus
        <i>the riches of mercy exceed our highest thoughts</i>. The psalmist, as
        he sits at the cave's mouth and looks up to the firmament, rejoices that
        God's goodness is more vast and more sublime than even the vaulted
        skies.
        <b> <p align="justify">And your truth unto the clouds.</p></b> Upon the
        cloud he sets the seal of his truth, the rainbow, which ratifies his
        covenant. In the cloud he hides his rain and snow, which prove his truth
        by bringing to us seedtime and harvest, cold and heat.
        <i>Creation is great, but the Creator greater far. </i>Heaven cannot
        contain him; above clouds and stars his goodness far exceeds.

        join in it, you sons of men below, as you say,
        <b>Let your glory be above all the earth.</b> The prophet in the
        previous verse spoke of <i>mercy </i>"unto the heavens," but here his
        song flies "above the heavens" praise rises higher, and knows no bound.
