          1. Since, therefore, this is sure and stedfast, that no other God or
          Lord was announced by the Spirit, except Him who, as God, rules over
          all, together with His Word, and those who receive the Spirit of
          adoption, that is, those who believe in the one and true God, and in
          Jesus Christ the Son of God; and likewise that the apostles did of
          themselves term no one else as God, or name [no other] as Lord; and,
          what is much more important, [since it is true] that our Lord [acted
          likewise], who did also command us to confess no one as Father, except
          Him who is in the heavens, who is the one God and the one Father; --
          those things are clearly shown to be false which these deceivers and
          most perverse sophists advance, maintaining that the being whom they
          have themselves invented is by nature both God and Father; but that
          the Demiurge is naturally neither God nor Father, but is so termed
          merely by courtesy (verbo tenus), because of his ruling the creation,
          these perverse mythologists state, setting their thoughts against God;
          and, putting aside the doctrine of Christ, and of themselves divining
          falsehoods, they dispute against the entire dispensation of God. For
          they maintain that their Ã†ons, and gods, and fathers, and lords, are
          also still further termed heavens, together with their Mother, whom
          they do also call "the Earth," and "Jerusalem," while they also style
          her many other names.

          2. Now to whom is it not clear, that if the Lord had known many
          fathers and gods, He would not have taught His disciples to know
          [only] one God, and to call Him alone Father? But He did the rather
          distinguish those who by word merely (verbo tenus) are termed gods,
          from Him who is truly God, that they should not err as to His
          doctrine, nor understand one [in mistake] for another. And if He did
          indeed teach us to call one Being Father and God, while He does from
          time to time Himself confess other fathers and gods in the same sense,
          then He will appear to enjoin a different course upon His disciples
          from what He follows Himself. Such conduct, however, does not bespeak
          the good teacher, but a misleading and invidious one. The apostles,
          too, according to these men's showing, are proved to be transgressors
          of the commandment, since they confess the Creator as God, and Lord,
          and Father, as I have shown -- if He is not alone God and Father.
          Jesus, therefore, will be to them the author and teacher of such
          transgression, inasmuch as He commanded that one Being should be
          called Father, thus imposing upon them the necessity of confessing the
          Creator as their Father, as has been pointed out.<br />
