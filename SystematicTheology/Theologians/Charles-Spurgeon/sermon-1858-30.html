        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.194)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, May 16, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens</p>
        <p>
          "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now
          they have no cloke for their sin." -- John 15:22.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE PECULIAR SIN of the Jews, the sin which aggravated above
          everything their former iniquities, was their rejection of Jesus
          Christ as the Messiah. He had been very plainly described in the books
          of the prophets, and they who waited for him, such as Simeon and Anna,
          no sooner beheld him even in his infant state, than they rejoiced to
          see him, and understood that God had sent forth his salvation. But
          because Jesus Christ did not answer the expectation of that evil
          generation because he did not come arrayed in pomp and clothed with
          power, because he had not the outward garnishing of a prince and the
          honors of a king, they shut their eyes against him, he was "a root out
          of a dry ground," he was "despised and they esteemed him not." Nor did
          their sin stop there. Not content with denying his Messiahship, they
          were exceeding hot against him in their anger; they hunted him all his
          life, seeking his blood; nor were they content till their fiendish
          malice had been fully glutted by sitting down at the foot of the
          cross, and watching the dying throes and the expiring agonies of their
          crucified Messiah. Though over the cross itself the words were
          written, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews," yet they knew not
          their king, God's everlasting Son; and knowing him not, they crucified
          him, "for had they known him, they would not have crucified the Lord
          of glory."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the sin of the Jews is every day repeated by the Gentiles; that
          which they did once, many have done every day. Are there not many of
          you now present this day, listening to my voice, who forget the
          Messiah? You do not trouble yourself to deny him; you would not
          degrade yourselves, in what is called a Christian country, by standing
          up to blaspheme his name. Perhaps you hold the right doctrine
          concerning him, and believe him to be the Son of God as well as the
          Son of Mary; but still you neglect his claims, and give him no honor,
          and do not accept him as worthy of your trust. He is not your
          Redeemer; you are not looking for his second advent, nor are you
          expecting to be saved through his blood; nay, even worse; ye are this
          day crucifying him; for know ye not, that as many as put away from
          them the gospel of Christ, do crucify the Lord afresh and open wide
          his wounds? As often as ye hear the Word preached and reject it, as
          often as ye are warned, and stifle the voice of your conscience, as
          often as ye are made to tremble, and yet say, "Go thy way for this
          time, when I have a more convenient season, I will send for thee," so
          often do you in effect grasp the hammer and the nail, and once more
          pierce the hand, and make the blood issue from the side. And their are
          other ways by which you wound him through his members. As often as ye
          despise his ministers, or cast stumbling blocks in the way of his
          servants, or impede his gospel by your evil example, or by your hard
          words seek to pervert the seeker from the way of truth, so often do
          you commit that great iniquity which brought the curse upon the Jew,
          and which hath doomed him to wander through the earth, until the day
          of the second advent when he shall come who shall even by the Jew be
          acknowledged the King of the Jews, for whom both Jew and Gentile are
          now looking with anxious expectation, even Messiah, the Prince who
          came once to suffer, but who comes again to reign.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I shall endeavor this morning to show the parallel between
          your case and that of the Jew; not doing so in set phrase, but yet
          incidentally, as God shall help me; appealing to your conscience, and
          making you feel that in rejecting Christ, you commit the same sin and
          incur the same doom. We shall note, first of all, the excellence of
          the ministry, since Christ comes in it, and speaks to men: "If I had
          not spoken to them." We shall notice, secondly, the aggravation of sin
          caused by the rejection of Christ's message: "If I had not spoken to
          them they had not had sin." Thirdly, the death of all excuses, caused
          by the preaching of the Word: "Now they have no cloke for their sin."
          And then, in the last place, we shall briefly, but very solemnly
          announce the fearfully aggravated doom of those who thus reject the
          Saviour, and increase their guilt by despising him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In the first place, then, this morning it is ours to say, and to
          say truly too, that in THE PREACHING OF THIS GOSPEL, THERE IS TO MAN'S
          CONSCIENCE THE COMING OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST, AND THE SPEAKING OF
          THE SAVIOUR THROUGH US. When Israel of old despised Moses and murmured
          against him, Moses meekly said, "Ye have not murmured against us, but
          ye have murmured against the Lord God of Israel." And truly the
          minister may, with Scripture warrant, say the same: he that despiseth
          us, despiseth not us, but him that sent us. he who rejecteth the
          message rejecteth not what we say, but rejecteth the message of the
          everlasting God. The minister is but a man; he has no priestly power,
          but he is a man called out of the rest of mankind, and endowed with
          the Holy Spirit, to speak to his fellow-men; and when he preacheth the
          truth as with power sent down from heaven, God owns him by calling him
          his ambassador. and puts him in the high and responsible position of a
          watchman on the walls of Zion, and he bids all men take heed that a
          faithful message, faithfully delivered, when despised and trampled on,
          amounts to rebellion against God, and to sin and iniquity against the
          Most High. As for what I may say, as a man, it is but little that I
          should say it, but if I speak as the Lord's ambassador, take heed that
          ye slight not the message. It is the Word of God sent down from heaven
          which we preach with the power of the Holy Spirit, earnestly
          beseeching you to believe it, and remember, it is at the peril of your
          own souls that you put it from you, for it is not we that speak, but
          the Spirit of the Lord our God who speaketh in us. With what a
          solemnity does this invest the gospel ministry! O ye sons of men, the
          ministry is not the speaking of men, but the speaking of God through
          men. As many as are the real called and sent servants of God, are not
          the authors of their message; but they first hear it from the Master,
          and they speak it to the people, and they see ever before their eyes
          these solemn words -- "Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine;
          continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and
          them that hear thee," and they hear behind them this awful threatening
          -- "If thou warn them not they shall perish, but their blood will I
          require at thine hand." Oh! that ye might see written in letters of
          fire before you this day the words of the prophet -- "O earth, earth,
          earth, hear the Word of the Lord;" for as far as our ministry is true
          and untainted by error, it is God's Word, and it hath the same right
          and claim to your belief as if God himself should speak it from the
          top of Sinai, instead of speaking it through the humble ministry of
          the Word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now let us pause over this doctrine, and let us ask ourselves this
          solemn question. Have we not all of us grossly sinned against God, in
          the neglect that we have often put upon the means of grace? How often
          have you stayed away from the house of God, when God himself was
          speaking there? What would have been the doom of Israel if, when
          summoned on that sacred day to hear the Word of God from the top of
          the mountain, they had perversely rambled into the wilderness, rather
          than attend to hear it? And yet so have you done. You have sought your
          own pleasure, and listened to the syren song of temptation; but ye
          have shut your ear against the voice of the Most High; and when he has
          himself been speaking in his own house, ye have turned aside unto
          crooked ways, and have not regarded the voice of the Lord your God.
          And when ye have come up to the house of God, how often has there been
          the careless eye, the inattentive ear! Ye have heard as though ye
          heard not. Your ear has been penetrated, but the hidden man of the
          heart has been deaf, and you have been like the deaf adder; charm we
          never so wisely, you would not listen nor regard us. God himself has
          spoken, too, at times in your conscience, so that you have heard it.
          You have stood in the aisle, and your knees have knocked together, you
          have sat in your pew, and while some mighty Boanerges has thundered
          out the word, you have heard it said, as with an angel's voice,
          "Prepare to meet thy God -- consider thy way -- set thine house in
          order, for thou shalt die, and not live." And yet you have gone out of
          God's house, and have forgotten what manner of men you were. You have
          quenched the Spirit, you have done despite to the Spirit of grace; you
          have put far from you the struggles of your conscience; you have
          throttled those infant prayers that were beginning to cry in your
          heart; you have drowned those new-born desires that were just
          springing up; you have put away from you everything that was good and
          sacred; you have turned again to your own ways, and have once more
          wandered on the mountains of sin, and in the valley of iniquity. Ah!
          my friends, just think, then, for a moment, that in all this you have
          despised God. I am certain, if the Holy Spirit would but apply this
          one solemn truth to your consciences this morning, this Hall of Music
          would be turned into a house of mourning, and this place would become
          a Bochim, a place of weeping and lamentation. Oh to have despised God,
          to have trampled under foot the Son of Man, to have passed by his
          cross, to have rejected the wooings of his love and the warnings of
          his grace! How solemn! Did you ever think of this before? You have
          thought it was but despising man, will ye now think of it as despising
          Christ? For Christ has spoken to you. Ah! God is my witness, that
          oftentimes Christ hath wept with these eyes, and spoken to you with
          these lips. I have sought nothing but the winning of your souls.
          Sometimes with rough words have I endeavored to drive you to the
          cross, and at other times with weeping accents have I sought to weep
          you to my Redeemer; and sure I am, I did not speak myself then, but
          Jesus spoke through me, and inasmuch as ye did hear and weep, and then
          went away and did forget, remember that Christ spoke to you. Twas he
          who said, "Look unto me and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth;"
          twas he who said, "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy
          laden;" twas he who warned you, that if you neglected this great
          salvation you must perish; and in having put away the warning and
          rejected the invitation, you have not despised us, but you have
          despised our Master; and woe unto you, except ye repent, for tis a
          fearful thing to have despised the voice of him that speaketh from
          heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now we must notice the second point, namely, that THE
          REJECTION OF THE GOSPEL, AGGRAVATES MEN'S SIN. Now, do not let me be
          misunderstood. I have heard of persons who, having gone to the house
          of God, have been filled with a sense of sin, and at last they have
          been driven almost to despair, for Satan has tempted them to forsake
          the house of God; for says he, "The more you go, the more you increase
          your condemnation." Now I believe that this is an error; we do not
          increase our condemnation by going to the house of God; we are far
          more likely to increase it by stopping away; for in stopping away from
          the house of God there is a double rejection of Christ; you reject him
          even with the outward mind, as well as with the inward spirit; you
          neglect even the lying at the pool of Bethesda, you are worse than the
          man who lay at the pool, but could not get in. You will not lie there,
          and therefore, neglecting the hearing of the Word of God, you do
          indeed incur a fearful doom; but if you go up to the house of God,
          sincerely seeking a blessing, if you do not get comfort -- if you do
          not find grace in the means, still, if you go there devoutly seeking
          it, your condemnation is not increased thereby. Your sin is not
          aggravated merely by the hearing of the gospel, but by the wilful and
          wicked rejection of it when it is heard. The man who listens to the
          sound of the gospel, and after having heard it, turns upon his heel
          with a laugh, or who, after hearing time after time, and being visibly
          affected, allows the cares and the pleasures of this wicked life, to
          come in and choke the seed -- such a man does in a fearful measure
          increase his guilt.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now we will just notice why, in a two-fold measure, he does this.
          Because, in the first place he gets a new sin altogether, that he
          never had before and beside that, he aggravates all his other sins.
          Bring me here a Hottentot, or a man from Kamschatka, a wild savage who
          has never listened to the Word. That man may have every sin in the
          catalogue of guilt except one; but that one I am sure he has not. He
          has not the sin of rejecting the gospel when it is preached to him.
          But you, when you hear the gospel, have an opportunity for committing
          a fresh sin; and if you have rejected it, you have added a fresh
          iniquity to all those others that hang about your neck. I have often
          been rebuked by certain men who have erred from the truth, for
          preaching the doctrine that it is a sin in men, if they reject the
          gospel of Christ. I care for every opprobrious title: I am certain
          that I have the warrant of God's Word in so preaching, and I do not
          believe that any man can be faithful to men's souls and clear of their
          blood, unless he bears his frequent and Solemn testimony upon this
          vital subject. "When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will reprove
          the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin,
          because they believe not on me." "And this is the condemnation, that
          light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than
          light." "He that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath
          not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God." "If I had
          not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not
          had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father."
          "Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty
          works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you,
          they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sack-cloth and ashes.
          But I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at
          the judgment, than for you." "If I had not come and spoken unto them,
          they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin."
          "Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which
          we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. For if the
          word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and
          disobedience received a just recompence of reward. how shall we escape
          if we neglect so great salvation?" "He that despised Moses law died
          without mercy under two or three witnesses; of how much sorer
          punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden
          under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant,
          wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite
          unto the Spirit of grace? For we know him that hath said, Vengeance
          belongeth unto me, I will recompence, saith the Lord. And again, the
          Lord shall judge his people. It is a fearful thing to fall into the
          hands of the living God." I have been quoting, you see, some scripture
          passages, and if they do not mean that unbelief is a sin, and the sin,
          which, above all others, damns men's souls, they do not mean anything
          at all, but they are just a dead letter in the Word of God. Now,
          adultery and murder and theft, and lying -- all these are damning, and
          deadly sins; but repentance can cleanse all these, through the blood
          of Christ. But to reject Christ, destroys a man hopelessly. The
          murderer, the thief, the drunkard, may yet enter the kingdom of
          heaven, if, repenting of his sins, he will lay hold on the cross of
          Christ, but with these sins, a man is inevitably lost, if he believeth
          not on the Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, my hearers, will you consider for one moment what an awful
          sin this is, which you add to all your other sins. Everything lies in
          the bowels of this sin -- the rejecting of Christ. There is murder in
          this; for if the man on the scaffold rejects a pardon, does he not
          murder himself? There is pride in this; for you reject Christ, because
          your proud hearts have turned you aside. There is rebellion in this;
          for we rebel against God when we reject Christ. There is high treason
          in this; for you reject a king; you put far from you, him, who is
          crowned king of the earth, and you incur therefore the weightiest of
          all guilt. Oh! to think that the Lord Jesus should come from heaven --
          to think for a moment that he should hang upon the tree -- that there
          he should die in agonies extreme, and that from that cross he should
          this day look down upon you, and should say, "Come unto me, ye weary
          and ye heavy laden;" that you should still turn away from him, -- it
          is the unkindest stab of all. What more brutish, what more devilish,
          than to turn away from him who gave his life for you? Oh that ye were
          wise, that ye understood this, that ye would consider your latter end!
        </p>
        <p>
          But again, we do not only add a new sin to the catalogs of guilt but
          we aggravate all the rest. You cannot sin so cheap as other people,
          you, who have had the gospel. When the unenlightened and ignorant sin,
          their conscience does not prick them; and there is not that guilt in
          the sin of the ignorant, that there is in the sin of the enlightened.
          Did you steal before? that was bad enough; but hear the gospel and
          continue a thief, and you are a thief indeed. Did you lie before you
          heard the gospel? The liar shall have his portion in the lake; but he
          after hearing it: and it seems as if the fire of Tophet should be
          fanned up to a seven-fold fury. He who sins ignorantly, hath some
          little excuse; but he who sins against light and knowledge, sins
          presumptuously; and under the law there was no atonement for this, for
          presumptuous sins were out of the pole of legal atonement, although
          blessed be God, Christ hath atoned for even these, and he that
          believeth shall be saved, despite even his guilt. Oh! I beseech you,
          recollect that the sin of unbelief blackens every other sin. It is
          like Jeroboam. It is said of him, he sinned and made Israel to sin. So
          unbelief sins itself and leads to every other sin. Unbelief is the
          file by which you sharpen the axe; and the coulter, and the sword,
          which you use in rebellion against the Most High. Your sins become
          more exceeding sinful, the more you disbelieve in Christ, the more you
          know of him, and the longer you reject him. This is God's truth; but a
          truth that is to be spoken with reluctance, and with many groanings in
          our spirits. Oh to have such a message to deliver to you, to you I
          say, for if there be a people under heaven to whom my text applies, it
          is you. If there is one race of men in the world, who have more to
          account for than others, it is yourselves. There are doubtless others,
          who are on an equality with you, who sit under a faithful and earnest
          ministry; but as God shall judge betwixt you and me at the great day,
          to the utmost of my power I have been faithful to your souls. I have
          never in this pulpit sought by hard words, by technical language, to
          magnify my own wisdom. I have spoken to you plainly; and not a word,
          to the best of my knowledge, has escaped these lips, which every one
          of you could not understand. You have had a simple gospel. I have not
          stood here and preached coldly to you. I could say as I came up yon
          stairs, "The burden of the Lord was upon me;" for my heart has come
          here heavy, and my soul has been hot within me, and when I have
          preached feebly, my words may have been uncouth, and the language far
          from proper, but heart never has been wanting. This whole soul has
          spoken to you; and if I could have ransacked heaven and earth to find
          language that might have won you to the Saviour, I would have done so.
          I have not shunned to reprove you, I have never minced matters. I have
          spoken to this age of its iniquities, and to you of your sins I have
          not softened down the Bible to suit the carnal tastes of men. I have
          said damn, where God said damn -- I have not sweetened it into
          "condemn." I have not minced matters, nor endeavored to veil or
          conceal the truth, but as to every man's conscience in the sight of
          God, have I endeavored to commend the gospel, earnestly and with
          power, and with a plain, outspoken, earnest, and honest ministry. I
          have not kept back the glorious doctrines of grace, although by
          preaching them the enemies of the cross have called me an Antinomian;
          nor have I been afraid to preach man's solemn responsibility, although
          another tribe have slandered me as an Arminian. And in saying this, I
          say it not in a way of glorying, but I say it for your rebuke, if you
          have rejected the gospel, for you shall have sinned far above that of
          any other men; in casting away Christ, a double measure of the fury of
          the wrath of God shall fall on you. Sin, then, is aggravated by the
          rejection of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, in the third place, THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL OF
          CHRIST TAKES AWAY ALL EXCUSE FROM THOSE WHO HEAR IT AND REJECT IT.
          "Now have they no cloke for their sin." A cloak is a very poor
          covering for sin, when there is an all-seeing eye to look through it.
          In the great day of the tempest of God's wrath a cloak will be a very
          poor shelter; but still man is always fond of a cloak. In the day of
          cold and rain we see men gathering their cloaks about them, and if
          they have no shelter and no refuge, still they feel a little comforted
          by their garment. And so it is with you; you will gather together, if
          you can, an excuse for your sin, and when conscience pricks you, you
          seek to heal the wound with an excuse. And even in the day of judgment
          although a cloak will be a sorry covering, yet it will be better than
          nothing at all. "But now ye have no cloke for your sin." The traveler
          is left in the rain without his covering, exposed to the tempest
          without that garment which once did shelter him. "Now ye have no cloke
          for your sin," -- discovered, detected, and unmasked, ye are left
          inexcusible, without a cloak for your iniquity. And now let me just
          notice how the preaching of the gospel, when it is faithfully
          performed, takes away all cloaks for sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, one man might get up and say, "I did not know I
          was doing wrong when I committed such and such an iniquity." Now, that
          you cannot say. God has by his law told you solemnly what is wrong.
          There stand the ten commandments; and there stands the comment of our
          Master where he has enlarged upon the commandment, and told us that
          the old law "thou shalt not commit adultery," forbad also all sins of
          the lascivious look and the evil eye. If the Sepoy commits iniquity,
          there is a cloak for it. I doubt not that his conscience tells him
          that he does wrong, but his sacred books teach that he is doing right,
          and therefore he has that cloak. If the Mahommedan commits lust, I
          doubt not his conscience doth prick him, but his sacred books give him
          liberty. But you profess to believe your Bibles, and have them in your
          houses, and have the preachers of them in all your streets; and
          therefore when you sin, you sin with the proclamation of the law upon
          the very wall, before your eyes -- you do wilfully violate a
          well-known law which has come from heaven, and come to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, you might say, "When I sinned, I did not know how great would
          be the punishment." Of this also, by the gospel, you are left without
          excuse; for did not Jesus Christ tell you, and does he not tell you
          every day, that those who will not have him shall be cast into outer
          darkness, where shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth? Hath he not
          said, "These shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the
          righteous into life eternal?" Does he not himself declare that the
          wicked shall be burned up with unquenchable fire? Has he not told you
          of a place where their worm dieth not and where their fire is not
          quenched? And the ministers of the gospel have not shunned to tell you
          this too. You have sinned, though you knew you would be lost by it.
          You have taken the poisonous draught, not thinking that it was
          harmless you knew that every drop in the cup was scalding with
          damnation, and yet you have taken the cup and drained it to its dregs.
          You have destroyed your own souls with your eyes open; you have gone
          like a fool to the stocks, like an ox to the slaughter, and like a
          lamb you have licked the knife of the butcher. In this, then, you are
          left without excuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          But some of you may say, "Ah, I heard the gospel, it is true, and I
          knew that I was doing wrong, but I did not know what I must do to be
          saved." Is there one among you who can urge such an excuse as this?
          Methinks you will not have the impudence to do so. "Believe and live,"
          is preached every day in your hearing. Many of you these ten, twenty,
          thirty, forty, or fifty years have been hearing the gospel, and you
          dare not say, "I did not know what the gospel was." From your earliest
          childhood many of you have listened to it. The name of Jesus was
          mingled with the hush of lullaby. You drank in a holy gospel with your
          mother's milk and yet despite all that, you have never sought Christ.
          "Knowledge is power," men say. Alas! Knowledge, when not used, is
          wrath, WRATH, WRATH to the uttermost, against the man who knows, and
          yet doth that which he knoweth to be wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Methinks I can hear another say, "Well, I heard the gospel preached,
          but I never had a good example set me." Some of you may say that, and
          it would be partially true; but there are others of you, concerning
          whom I may say that this would be a lying excuse. Ah! man; you have
          been very fond of speaking of the inconsistencies of Christians. You
          have said, "They do not live as they ought;" and alas, there is too
          much truth in what you have said. But there was one Christian whom you
          knew, and whose character you were compelled to admire; do not you
          remember her? It was the mother who brought you forth. That has always
          been the one difficulty with you up to this day. You could have
          rejected the gospel very easily, but your mother's example stood
          before you, and you could not overcome that. Do you not remember
          amongst the first early darklings of your recollection, how you opened
          your little eyes in the morning and you saw a mother's loving face
          looking down upon you, and you caught her with a tear in her eye, and
          you heard her say, "God bless the child, may he call the Redeemer
          blessed!" You remember how your father did often chide you; she did
          seldom chide, but she often spoke in tones of love. Recollect that
          little upper room where she took you aside, and putting her arms round
          your neck, dedicated you to God, and prayed that the Lord would save
          you in your childhood. Remember the letter she gave you, and your book
          in which she wrote your name when you left the parental roof to go
          abroad, and the sorrow with which she wrote to you when she heard you
          had begun to plunge in gaiety and mix with the ungodly: recollect that
          sorrowful look with which she did wring your hand the last time you
          left her. Remember how she said to you, "You will bring my hairs with
          sorrow to the grave, if you walk in the ways of iniquity." Well, you
          knew that what she said was not cant; there was reality in that. You
          could laugh at the minister, you could say it was his business, but at
          her you could not scoff; she was a Christian, there was no mistake
          about it. How often did she put up with your angry temper, and bear
          with your rough manners, for she was a sweet spirit, almost too good
          for earth -- and you recollect that. You were not there when she was
          dying, you could not arrive in time; but she said to her friend as she
          was dying, "There is only one thing that I want, then I could die
          happy -- oh, that I could see my children walking in the truth." Now,
          I apprehend such an example leaves you without a cloak for your
          wickedness, and if you commit iniquity after that, how fearful! must
          be the weight of your woe.
        </p>
        <p>
          But others of you can say that you had no such mother; your first
          school was the street, and the first example you ever had was that of
          a swearing father. Recollect, my friend, there is one perfect example
          -- Christ, and that you have read of, though you have not seen him.
          Jesus Christ, the man of Nazareth, was a perfect man; in him was there
          no sin, neither was there guile in his mouth. And if you have never
          seen anything like Christian worth any where else, yet you can see it
          in Christ; and in venturing such an excuse as this, remember you have
          ventured upon a lie, for the example of Christ, the works of Christ,
          as well as the words of Christ, leave you without excuse for your sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah, and I think I hear one more excuse offered, and that is this:
          "Well, I certainly had many advantages, but they were never sent home
          to my conscience so that I felt them." Now, there are very few of you
          here who can say that. Some of you will say, "Yes, I heard the
          minister, but he never made an impression upon me." Ah, young men and
          young women, and all of you this morning, I must be a witness against
          you in the day of judgment that this is untrue. For, but now, your
          consciences were touched; did I not see some soft tears of repentance
          -- I trust they were such -- flowing but just now. No, you have not
          always been unmoved by the gospel you have grown old now, and it takes
          a deal to stir you, but it was not always so There was a time in your
          youth, when you were very susceptible of impressing. Remember, the
          sins of your youth will cause your bones to rot, if you have still
          persevered in rejecting the gospel. Your old heart has grown hard,
          still you are with out excuse; you did feel once, ay, and even now you
          cannot help feeling. I know there are some of you that can scarcely
          keep your seats at the thought of your iniquities; and you have almost
          vowed, some of you, that this day you will seek God, and the first
          thing you will do, will be to climb to your chamber, and shut the
          door, and seek the Lord. Ah, but I remember a story of one, who
          remarked to a minister, what a wonderful thing it was to see so many
          people weeping. "Nay," said he, "I will tell you something more
          wonderful still, that so many will forget all they wept about when
          they get outside the door." And you will do this. Still, when you have
          done it, you will recollect that you have not been without the
          strivings of God's Spirit. You will remember that God has, this
          morning, as it were, put a hurdle across your road, digged a ditch in
          your way, and put up a hand-post, and said, "Take warning! beware,
          beware, beware! you are rushing madly into the ways of iniquity!" And
          I have come before you this morning, and in God s name I have said, "
          Stop, stop, stop, thus saith the Lord, consider your ways, why will ye
          die? Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die O house of Israel?" And, now,
          if ye will put this from you, it must be even so; if you will put out
          these sparks, if ye will quench this first burning torch, it must be
          so! On your own head be your blood; at your own door lay your
          iniquities.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. But now I have one thing more to do. And it is awful work; for I
          have as it were to PUT ON THE BLACK CAP AND PRONOUNCE THE SENTENCE OF
          CONDEMNATION. For those who live and die rejecting Christ there is a
          most fearful doom. They shall perish with an utter destruction. There
          are degrees of punishment; but the highest degree is given to the man
          who rejects Christ. You have noticed that passage, I dare say, that
          the liar and the whoremonger, and drunkards shall have their portion
          -- whom do you suppose with? -- with unbelievers; as if hell was made
          first of all for unbelievers -- as if the pit was digged not for
          whoremongers, and swearers, and drunkards, but for men who despise
          Christ, because that is the A 1 sin, the cardinal vice, and men are
          condemned for that. Other iniquities come following after them, but
          this one goes before them to judgment. Imagine for a moment that time
          has passed, and that the day of judgment is come. We are all gathered
          together, both quick and dead. The trumpet-blast waxes exceeding loud
          and long. We are all attentive, expecting something marvellous. The
          exchange stands still in its business; the shop is deserted by the
          tradesman; the crowded streets are filled. All men stand still; they
          feel that the last great business-day is come, and that now they must
          settle their accounts for ever. A solemn stillness fills the air: no
          sound is heard. All, all is noiseless. Presently a great white cloud
          with solemn state sails through the sky, and then -- hark! the twofold
          clamor of the startled earth. On that cloud there sits one like unto
          the Son of Man. Every eye looks, and at last there is heard a
          unanimous shout -- "It is he! It is he!" and after that you hear on
          the one hand, shouts of "Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Welcome,
          Welcome, Welcome Son of God." But mixed with that there is a deep
          bass, composed of the weeping and the wailing of the men who have
          persecuted him, and who have rejected him. Listen! I think I can
          dissect the sonnet, I think I can hear the words as they come
          separately, each one of them, tolling like a death knell What say
          they? They say, "Rocks hide us, mountains fall upon us, hide us from
          the face of Him that sits upon the throne." And shall you be among the
          number of those who say to the rocks "Hide us?"
        </p>
        <p>
          My impenitent hearer, I suppose for a moment that you have gone out of
          this world, and that you have died impenitent, and that you are among
          those who are weeping, and wailing, and gnashing their teeth. Oh! what
          will then be your terror! Blanched cheeks, and knocking knees are
          nothing, compared to thy horror of heart, when thou shalt be drunken,
          but not with wine and when thou shalt reel to and fro, with the
          intoxication of amazement, and shall fall down, and roll in the dust
          for horror and dismay. For there he comes, and there he is, with
          fierce, fire-darting eye; and now the time is come for the great
          division. The voice is heard, "Gather my people from the four winds of
          heaven, mine elect in whom my soul delighteth." They are gathered at
          the right hand, and there they are. And now saith he, "Gather up the
          tares, and bind them in bundles to burn." And you are gathered, and on
          the left hand there you are, gathered into the bundle. All that is
          wanted is the lighting of the pile. Where shall be the torch that
          shall kindle them? The tares are to be burned: where is the flame? The
          flame comes out of his mouth, and it is composed of words like these
          -- "Depart, ye cursed into everlasting fire, in hell, prepared for the
          devil and his angels." Do you linger? "Depart!" Do you seek a
          blessing? "Ye are cursed." I curse you with a curse. Do ye seek to
          escape? It is everlasting fire. Do ye stop and plead? No, "I called,
          and ye refused; I stretched out my hands, and ye regarded me not,
          therefore I will mock at your calamity, I will laugh when your fear
          cometh. "Depart, again, I say; depart for ever!" And you are gone. And
          what is your reflection? Why, it is this: "Oh! would to God that I
          never had been born! Oh! that I had never heard the gospel preached,
          that I might never have had the sin of rejecting it!" This will be the
          gnawing of the worm in your conscience -- "I knew better but I did not
          do better." -- As I sowed the wind, it is right I should reap the
          whirlwind; I was checked, but I would not be stopped; I was wooed, but
          I would not be invited. Now I see that I have murdered myself Oh!
          thought above all thoughts most deadly. I am lost, lost, lost! And
          this is the horror of horrors: I have caused myself to be lost; I have
          put from me the gospel of Christ; I have destroyed myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shall this be so with thee, my hearer? Shall this be so with thee? I
          pray it may not! O may the Holy Spirit now constrain thee to come to
          Jesus, for I know that thou art too vile to yield, unless he compels
          thee. But I hope for thee. Methinks I hear thee say, "What must I do
          to be saved?" Let me tell you the way of salvation, and then farewell.
          If thou wouldest be saved, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
          shalt be saved;" for the Scripture says, "He that believeth and is
          baptized shall be saved; he that believeth not shall be damned!" There
          he hangs, dying on his cross! look to him and live.
        </p>
        <p>"Venture on him, venture wholly,</p>
        <p>Let no other trust intrude;</p>
        <p>None but Jesus</p>
        <p>Can do helpless sinners good."</p>
        <p>
          Be you wicked, filthy, depraved degraded, you are still invited to
          Christ. The devil's castaways Christ takes in -- the offscouring, the
          dross, the scum, the draff, the sewerage of this world, is now invited
          to Christ. Come to him now, and obtain mercy. But if ye harden your
          hearts,
        </p>
        <p>"The Lord in anger dress'd</p>
        <p>Shall lift his hand and swear,</p>
        <p>'You that despis'd my promis'd rest,</p>
        <p>Shall have no portion there.'"<br /></p>
