        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.272)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, August 28th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>"They limited the Holy One of Israel," -- Psalm 78:41.</p>
        <p>
          MAN IS ALWAYS ALTERING what God has ordained. Although God's order is
          ever the best, yet man will never agree therewith. When God gave forth
          the law it was engraved upon two stones. The first table contained the
          commandments concerning man and God, the second dealt with man and
          man. Sins against God are sins against the first table: sins against
          man are offenses against the second table. Man, to prove constantly
          his perversity, will put the second table before the first, nay, upon
          the first, so as to cover and conceal it. There are few men who will
          not allow the enormity of adultery, fewer still who will dispute the
          wickedness of murder. Men are willing enough to acknowledge that there
          is sin in an offense against man. That which endanger the human
          commonwealth, that which would disturb the order of earthly
          governments -- all this is wrong enough even in man's esteem, but when
          you come to deal with the first table it is hard indeed to extort a
          confession from mankind. They will scarce acknowledge that there is
          any such thing as an offense against God, or if they do acknowledge
          it, yet they think it but a light matter. What man is there among you
          that hath not in his heart often lamented sins against man, rather,
          than sins against God? And which of you hath not felt a greater
          compunction for sins against your neighbor, or against the nation,
          than for sins committed against God and done in his sight? I say that
          such is the perversity of man, that he will think more of the less
          than the greater. An offense against the Majesty of heaven is thought
          to be far more venial than an offense against his fellow-creature.
          There are many transgressions of the first table of which we think so
          little, that perhaps we scarcely ever confess them at all, or if we
          acknowledge them, it is only because the grace of God has taught us to
          estimate them aright. One offense against the first table which seldom
          agitates the mind of an unconvicted sinner is that of unbelief, and
          with it, I may put the want of love to God. The sinner does not
          believe in God, does not trust in him, does not love him. He gives his
          heart to the things of earth, and denies it to his Creator. Of this
          high treason and rebellion he thinks nothing. If you could take him in
          the act of theft, a blush would mantle his cheek; but you detect him
          in the daily omission of love to God, and faith in his Son Jesus
          Christ, and you cannot make him feel that he is guilty of any evil in
          this. Oh! strange contortion of human judgment! Oh! blindness of
          mortal conscience, that this greatest of iniquities -- a want of love
          to the All-Lovely, and a want of faith in him who is deserving of the
          highest trust -- should be thought to be as nothing, and reckoned
          among the things that need not to be repented of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among such sins of the first table is that described in our text. It
          is consequently one of the masterpieces of iniquity, and we shall do
          well to purge ourselves of it. It is full of evil to ourselves, and is
          calculated to dishonor both God and man, therefore let us be in
          earnest to cut it up both root and branch. I think we have all been
          guilty of this in our measure; and we are not free from it even to
          this day. Whether we be saints or sinners, we may stand here and make
          our humble confession that we have all "tempted the Lord our God and
          have limited the Holy One of Israel."
        </p>
        <p>
          What then is meant by limiting the Holy One of Israel? Three words
          will set forth the meaning. We limit the Holy One of Israel, sometimes
          by dictation to him; at other times by distrust of him, and some push
          this sin to its farthest extreme by an utter and entire despair of his
          goodness and his mercy. These three classes all in their degree limit
          the Holy One of Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In the first place, I say we limit the Holy One of Israel by
          DICTATING TO HIM. Shall mortal dare to dictate to his Creator? Shall
          it be possible that man shall lay down his commands, and expect the
          King of heaven to pay homage to his arrogance? Will a mortal impiously
          say, "Not thy will but mine be done?" Is it conceivable that a handful
          of dust, a creature of a day, that knoweth nothing, should set its
          judgment in comparison with the wisdom of the Only Wise? Can it be
          possible that we should have the impertinence to map out the path of
          boundless wisdom, or should decree the footsteps which infinite grace
          should take, and dictate the designs which Omnipotence shall attempt?
          Startle! Startle at your own sin. Let each of us be amazed at our own
          iniquity. We have had the impudence to do this in our thoughts; we
          have climbed to the throne of the Highest; we have sought to take him
          from his throne that we might sit there; we have grasped his scepter
          and his rod; we have weighed his judgments in the balances and tried
          his ways in the scales; we have been impious enough to exalt ourselves
          above all that is called God.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will first address myself to the saint, and with the candle of the
          Lord attempt to show to Israel her secret iniquity, and to Jerusalem
          her grievous sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh heir of heaven, be ashamed and be confounded, while I remind thee
          that thou hast dared to dictate to God! How often have we in our
          prayers not simply wrestled with God for a blessing -- for that was
          allowable -- but we have imperiously demanded it. We have not said,
          "Deny this to me, O my God, if so thou pleasest." We have not been
          ready to play as the Redeemer did, "Nevertheless, not as I will, but
          as thou wilt," but we have asked and would take no denial. Not with
          all humble deference to our Lord's superior wisdom and grace, but we
          have asked and declared that we would not be content unless we had
          that particular blessing upon which we had set our hearts. Now,
          whenever we come to God and ask for anything which we consider to be a
          real good, we have a right to plead earnestly, but we err when we go
          beyond the bounds of earnestness, and come to impudent demand. It is
          ours to ask for a blessing, but not to define what that blessing shall
          be. It is ours to place our head beneath the mighty hands of divine
          benediction, but it is not ours to uplift the hands as Joseph did
          those of Jacob, and say, "Not so, my father." We must be content if he
          gives the blessing cross-handed; quite as content that he should put
          his left hand on our head as the right. We must not intrude into God's
          almonry, let him do as seemeth him good. Prayer was never meant to be
          a fetter upon the sovereignty of God, much less a licensed channel for
          blasphemy. We must always subjoin at the bottom of the prayer this
          heavenly postscript, "Father, deny this if it be most for thy glory."
          Christ will have nothing to do with dictatorial prayers, he will not
          be a partaker with us in the sin of limiting the Holy One of Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oftentimes, too, I think, we dictate to God with regard to the measure
          of our blessing. We ask the Lord that we might grow the enjoyment of
          his presence, instead of that he gives us to see the hidden depravity
          of our heart. The blessing comes to us, but it is in another shape
          from what we expected. We go again to our knees, and we complain of
          God that he has not answered us, whereas the fact has been that he has
          answered the spirit of our prayer, but not the letter of it. He has
          given us the blessing itself, but not in the shape we asked for it. We
          prayed him to give us silver, he has given us gold; but we blind
          creatures cannot understand the value of this new-shaped blessing, and
          therefore we go grumbling to him as if he had never heard us at all.
          If ye ask, especially for temporal mercies, always take care to leave
          the degree of those mercies with God. Ye may say, "Lord, give me food
          convenient for me," but it is not yours to stipulate how many
          shillings you shall have per week, or how many pounds in the year. You
          may ask that your bread may be given you and that your water may be
          sure, but it is not yours to lay down to God out of what kind of
          vessels you shall drink, or on what kind of table your bread shall be
          served up to you. You must leave the measuring of your mercies with
          Him who measures the rain, and weighs the clouds of heaven. Beggars
          must not be choosers, and especially they must not be choosers when
          they have to deal with infinite wisdom and sovereignty.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet further, I fear that we have often dictated to God with regard
          to the time. As a church we meet together, and we pray God to send us
          a blessing. We expect to have it next week: it does not come. We
          wonder that the ministry is not blessed on the very next Sabbath day;
          so that hundreds are pricked in the heart. We pray again, and again,
          and again, and at last we begin to faint. And why is this? Simply
          because that in our hearts we have been setting a date and a time to
          God. We have made up our minds that the blessing must come within a
          certain period; and as it does not come, we do as it were spite our
          God by declaring we will stop no longer; that we have waited time
          enough; we will have no more patience; we will be gone; it is clear
          the blessing will not come. We waste our words we imagine by seeking
          it. Oh, how wrong is this! -- What! is God to be tied to hours, or
          months, or years? Do his promises bear dates? Has he not himself said
          "Though the vision tarry, wait for it, it shall come, it shall not
          tarry." And yet we cannot wait God's time, but we must have our time.
          Let us always remember it is God's part to limit a certain day to
          Israel, saying, "To-day, if ye will hear my voice." But it is not our
          part to say to God, "To day if thou wilt hear my voice." No; let us
          leave time to him, resting assured that when the ship of our prayers
          are long at sea, they bring home all the richer cargo, and if the
          seeds of supplication are long buried, they shall produce the richer
          harvest; for God, honoring our faith which he has exercised by
          waiting, shall multiply his favors and enlarge his bounty. Your
          prayers are out at interest at a great percentage. Let them alone.
          They shall come back -- not only the capital, but with compound
          interest -- if ye will but wait till the time runs out, and God's
          promises becomes due.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, in these matters we cannot acquit ourselves, and I fear that
          much more than this will be necessary before our sin is fully
          unveiled. We have limited the Holy One in other ways, and I may remark
          that we have done this with regard to our prayers and efforts for
          others. A mother has been anxious for her children's conversion. Her
          eldest son has been the object of her fervent prayer. Never a morning
          has passed without earnest cries to God for his salvation; she has
          spoken to him with all a mother's eloquence; she has prayed in private
          with him, she has used every means which love could suggest to make
          him think of a better world. All her efforts at present seem to be
          wasted. She appears to be ploughing upon a rock, and casting her bread
          upon the waters. Year after year has rolled on -- her son has left her
          house; he has commenced business for himself: he begins now to betray
          worldliness; he forsakes the house of prayer which his mother
          frequents. She looks round every Sabbath morning, but John is not
          there. The tear is in her eye. Every allusion in the minister's sermon
          to Gods' answering prayer makes her heart beat again. And at last she
          says, "Lo these many years have I sought God for this one blessing; I
          will seek no longer. I will however, pray another month, and then, if
          he hear me not, I think I can never pray again "Mother, retract the
          words. Blot out such a thought from thy soul, for in this thou art
          limiting the Holy One of Israel. He is trying thy faith. Persevere,
          persevere while life lasts, and if thy prayers be not answered in thy
          lifetime, mayhap from the windows of heaven thou shalt look down and
          see the blessing of thy prayers descend on the head of thy child.
        </p>
        <p>
          This has been the case, too, when we have sought to do good to our
          fellow men. You know a certain man in whose welfare you take an
          extraordinary interest. You have availed yourself occasionally of an
          opportunity of addressing him; you have pressed him to attend the
          house of God, you have mentioned him in your private devotions, and
          often at your family altar. You have spoken to others that they might
          pray with you, for you believed the promise, "If two of you shall
          agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be
          done for them of my Father which is in heaven." But now months have
          rolled on, and your friend seems to be in a more hopeless condition
          than ever. Now he will not go to the house of God at all; perhaps some
          ungodly acquaintance has such power over him that your efforts are
          counteracted by his evil influence. All the good you can do is soon
          undone, and you are ready to say, "I will never use another effort; I
          will turn my attention to someone else. In this man's case, at least,
          my prayers will never be heard. I will withdraw my hand; I will not
          use unprofitable labor." And what is this but limiting the Holy One of
          Israel? What is this but saying to God, "Because thou hast not heard
          me when I wished to be heard -- because thou hast not exactly blessed
          my efforts as I would have them blessed, therefore I will try this no
          more!" Oh impudence! oh impertinence to the majesty of heaven!
          Christian! cast out this demon and say, "Get thee behind me, Satan;
          for thou savourest not the things that be of God." Once again attempt,
          and not once, but though a thousand times thou fairest, try again, for
          God is not unfaithful to forget your work of faith and your labor of
          love. Only continue to exercise your patience and your diligence. In
          the morning sow your seed, and in the evening withhold not your hand,
          for either this or that shall surely prosper in its appointed season.
        </p>
        <p>
          While thus charging the people of God with sin, I have been solemnly
          condemning myself, and if a like conviction shall abide upon all my
          believing hearers, my errand is accomplished. I will address myself
          now to those who cannot call themselves the children of God, but who
          have lately been stirred up to seek salvation. There are many of you
          who are not hardened and careless now. There was a time when you were
          callous and indifferent, but it is not so with you at the present
          moment. You are anxiously saying, "What must I do to be saved?" and
          have been, perhaps, very earnestly in prayer during the last two or
          three months. Every Sunday morning's service sends you home to your
          knees, and you cannot refrain from sighs and tears even in your daily
          business, for you cry as one that cannot be silenced, "Lord, save, or
          I perish!" Mayhap Satan has been putting it into your heart, that
          since your prayers have not been heard it is now of no avail. "Oh,"
          saith the Evil One, "these many months hast thou prayed to God to put
          away thy sin, and he has not heard thee. Give it up; never bend thy
          knees again. Heaven is not for thee, therefore, make the best of this
          world; go and drink its pleasures; suck in its joys, lose not the
          happiness of both worlds; make thyself gay here, for God will never
          bless thee and save thee hereafter." And is this what he has said? Oh!
          listen not to him; he designs thy destruction. Hearken not to his
          voice. There is nothing he desires so much as that thou shouldst be
          his prey; therefore, be thou on thy watch-tower against him, and
          listen not to his cajoling. Hearken to me for a season, and God bless
          thee in the hearing, that thou mayest no longer limit the Holy One of
          Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sinner what hast thou been doing, while thou hast said "I will
          restrain prayer because God has not as yet answered me." I say what
          hast thou been doing? Hast thou not been stipulating with God as to
          the day when he shall save thee? Suppose it is written in the book of
          God's decree, "I will save that man and give him peace after he has
          prayed seven years," would that be hard upon thee? Is not the blessing
          of divine mercy worth waiting for? If he keep thee tarrying at his
          gate day after day -- though shoulder wait fifty years -- if that gate
          opens at the last, will it not well repay thy waiting Knock man, knock
          again and go not away. Who art thou that thou shouldst say to God, "I
          will have peace on such a day or else I will cease to supplicated"
          This is a common offense with all poor trembling seeming souls.
          Confess it now and say unto God, "Lord I leave the time with thee, but
          I will not cease to supplicate, for
        </p>
        <p>'If I perish I will pray,</p>
        <p>And perish only there.'"</p>
        <p>
          And do you not think again that perhaps the cause of your present
          distress is that you have been dictating to God as to the way in which
          he shall save you? You have a pious acquaintance who was converted in
          a very remarkable manner. He was suddenly convicted and as suddenly
          justified in the sight of God. He knows the very day and hour in which
          he obtained mercy, and you have foolishly made up your mind that you
          will never lay hold upon Christ unless you feel the same. You have
          laid it down as in a decree, that God is to save you, as it were, by
          an electric shock, that you must be consciously smitten, and vividly
          illumined, or else you will never lay hold on Christ. You want a
          vision. You dictate to God that he must send one of his angels down to
          tell you he has forgiven you. Now rest assured God will have nothing
          to do with your dictation. With your desire to be saved he will have
          to do, but with your planning as to how he should save you, he will
          have nought to do. Oh, be content to get salvation anyhow if thou dost
          but get it. If thou canst not have it like the prodigal son, who felt
          his father's arms about him, and knew his father's kiss, and had music
          and dancing in the moment that he was restored -- if thou canst not
          come in by the front door, be content to enter at the back. If Mercy
          comes on foot do not despise her, for she is just as fair as when she
          rides in her chariot. Be content to go in sackcloth before God, and
          there to bemoan thy guilt and to lay hold on him who taketh away the
          sin of the world. Sinner, believe in Christ. That is God's command,
          and thy privilege. Cast thyself flat on his atonement; trust thou him
          and him alone and if God choose not to comfort thee in the way in
          which thou hast expected, yet be content to get the blessing anyhow so
          long as thou receivest it at all. Limit not, I beseech thee, the Holy
          One of Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon this point of dictation I might tarry very long and give many
          instances. But I choose rather to close up this first head of my
          discourse by observing once again, what a heinous offense, what an
          unreasonable iniquity it is for any of us to attempt to dictate to
          God. Oh man, know that he is sovereign.
        </p>
        <p>"He everywhere hath sway,</p>
        <p>And all things serve his might."</p>
        <p>
          Wilt thou, a beggar, dictate to the King of kings, the Lord of lords,
          when the angels veil their faces before him, and scarcely dare to look
          upon his brightness? Wilt thou dare to lord it over him, and command
          thy Maker? Shall infinite wisdom stoop to obey thy folly, and shall
          divine goodness be cooped and caged and imprisoned within the bars of
          thy frantic desires. What! dost thou dare to mount the steps of his
          throne, and affront him with thy haughty speeches, when cherubim dare
          not look upon his brightness -- when the pillars of heaven's starry
          roof tremble and start at his reproof! Wilt thou seek to be greater
          than he is? Shall mortal man be greater then his God? Shall be dictate
          to the everlasting -- he who is born of a woman and of few days, and
          full of folly? No go thou to his throne, bow thyself reverently before
          him; give up thy will, let it be bound in golden fetters a bond-slave
          to God. Cry thou this day, "Lord, have mercy on me a sinner, and let
          it be not as I will, but as thou wilt."
        </p>
        <p>Thus, then, I have discoursed on the first part of the subject.</p>
        <p>
          II. In the second place, we limit the Holy One of Israel by DISTRUST.
          And here again I will divide my congregation into the two grand
          classes of saints and sinners. Children of God, purchased by blood and
          regenerated by the Spirit, you are guilty here; for by your distrust
          and fear you have often limited the Holy One of Israel, and have said
          in effect, that his ear is heavy that it cannot hear, and that his arm
          is shortened that it cannot save. In your trials you have done this.
          You have looked upon your troubles, you have seen them roll like
          mountain waves; you have hearkened to your fears, and they have howled
          in your ears like tempestuous winds, and you have said, "My bark is
          but a feeble one, and it will soon be ship-wrecked. It is true that
          God has said that through tempests and tossings he will bring me to my
          desired haven. But alas! such a state as this was never contemplated
          in his promise; I shall sink at last and never see his face with joy."
          What hast thou done, fearful one? O thou of little faith, dost thou
          know what sin thou best committed? Thou hast judged the omnipotence of
          God to be finite. Thou hast said that thy troubles are greater than
          his power, that thy woes are more terrible than his might. I say
          retract that thought; drown it and thou shalt not be drowned thyself.
          Give it to the winds, and rest thou assured that out of all thy
          troubles he will surely bring thee, and in thy deepest distress he
          will not forsake thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          But says one, "I did believe this once, and I had hoped for an escape
          from my present predicament, but that escape has failed me. I did
          think that some friend would have assisted me, and thus, I imagined I
          should have come out of the furnace." Ah! and thou art distrusting God
          because he does not choose to use the means which thou hast chosen;
          because his election and thy election are not the same, therefore thou
          doubtest him. Why man, he is not limited to means -- to any means,
          much less to one of thy choosing. If he deliver thee not by calming
          the tempest, he hath a better way in store; he will send from above
          and deliver thee; he will snatch thee out of the deep waters lest the
          floods overflow thee. What might Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego have
          said? Suppose they had got it into their heads that God would deliver
          them in some particular way. They did have some such idea, but they
          said, as if to prove that they trusted not really to their thought
          about the deliverance -- "Nevertheless, be it known unto thee, O king,
          we will not worship thy gods, nor bow before the image which thou hast
          set up." They were prepared to let God have his will, even though he
          used no means of deliverance. But suppose, I say, they had conferred
          with flesh and blood, and Shadrach had said, "God will strike
          Nebuchadnezzar dead; just at the moment when the men are about to put
          us into the furnace the king will turn pale and die, and so we shall
          escape." O my friends, they would have trembled indeed when they went
          into the furnace if they had chosen their own means of deliverance,
          and the king had remained alive. But instead of this, they gave
          themselves up to God, though he did not deliver them. And, though he
          did not prevent their going into the furnace, yet he kept them alive
          in it, so that not so much as the smell of fire had passed upon them.
          It shall be even so with you. Repose in God. When thou seest him not,
          believe him; when everything seems to contradict thy faith, still
          stagger not at the promise. If HE hath said it, he can find ways and
          means to do it. Rest assured, sinner, he would come from his throne to
          do it himself in person, rather than suffer his promises to be
          unfulfilled. The harps of heaven should sooner lament an absent God
          than thou shouldst have to mourn a broken promise. Trust in him,
          repose constantly on him, and limit not the Holy One of Israel. Do you
          not think that the church as a great body has done this? We do not any
          of us expect to hear that a nation is born in a day. If it should be
          said that in a certain chapel in London this morning some thousand
          souls had been converted under one sermon, we should shake our heads
          incredulously, and say it cannot be. We have a notion that because we
          have only had drops of mercy of late, we are never to have showers of
          it; because mercy seems only to have come in little rills and
          trickling streamlets, we have conceived the idea that it never can
          roll its mighty floods like the huge rivers of the western world. No,
          we have limited the Holy One of Israel; especially as preachers have
          we done it. We do not expect our ministry to be blessed, and therefore
          it is not blessed. If we had learned to expect great things we should
          have them. If we had made up our minds to this, that the promise was
          great, that the Promiser was great, that his faithfulness was great,
          and that his power was great; and if with this for our strength we set
          to work expecting a great blessing, I trow we should not be
          disappointed. But the universal church of Christ hath limited the Holy
          One of Israel. Why, my friends, if God should will it, ye need not ask
          where are to come the successors of such and such a man. Ye need not
          sit down and ask when such and such a one is gone where shall be
          another who shall preach the word with power. When God gives the word,
          great shall be the multitude of them that publish it; and when the
          multitude shall begin to publish, believe me, God can move thousands
          as easily as be can move tens, and where our baptismal pool hath been
          stirred by ones and twos he can bid millions descend to be baptized
          into our holy faith. Limit not, O limit not, thou church of the living
          God, limit not the Holy One of Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I turn to the poor troubled heart, and although I accuse of
          sin, yet I doubt not the Spirit shall bear witness with the
          conscience, and leading to Christ, shall this morning deliver from its
          galling yoke. Poor troubled one, thou hast said in thy heart, "my sins
          are too many to be forgiven." What hast thou done? Repent thee, and
          let the tear roll down thy cheek. Thou hast limited the Holy One of
          Israel. Thou hast put thy sins above his grace. Thou hast considered
          that thy guilt is more omnipotent than omnipotence itself. He is able
          to save unto the uttermost them that come unto God by Christ. Thou
          canst not have exceeded the boundlessness of his grace. Be thy sins
          ever so many, the blood of Christ can put them all away; and if thou
          doubtest this, thou art limiting the Holy One of Israel. Another says,
          I do not doubt his power to save, but what I doubt is his willingness.
          What hast thou done in this? Thou hast limited the love, the boundless
          love of the Holy One of Israel. What, dost thou stand on the shore of
          a love which ever must be shoreless. Was it deep enough and broad
          enough to cover the iniquities of Paul, and doth it stop just where
          thou art? Why thou art the limit, then; thou standest as the limiting
          landmark of the grace of the Holy One of Israel! Out upon thy folly!
          get rid of this thy mistrust. He whom love has embraced the chief of
          sinners, is willing to embrace thee, if now hating thy sin and leaving
          thy iniquity, thou art ready to put thy trust in Jesus. I beseech
          thee, limit not the Holy One of Israel by thinking he is unwilling to
          forgive. Are you really conscious of the sin you are committing when
          you think God unwilling to save? Why you are accusing God of being a
          liar. Does not that alarm you? You have done worse than this, you have
          even accused him of being perjured, for you doubt his oath. "As I
          live, saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of him that
          dieth, but had rather that he should turn unto me and live." You do
          not believe that? then you make God to be perjured. Oh! tremble at
          such guilt as this, "No, but," you say, "I would not accuse him; but
          he would be quite just if he were unwilling to save me." I am glad
          thou sayest that; that proves thou dost not accuse his justice. But I
          still say thou art limiting his love. What doth he say himself? hath
          he limited it? Hath he not himself said, "Ho, every one that
          thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye,
          buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without
          price!" And thou art thirsty, and yet thou thinkest that his love
          cannot reach to thee. Oh! while God assures thee that thou art
          welcome, be not wicked enough to throw the lie in the teeth of mercy.
          Limit not the Holy One of Israel. "But, sir, I am such an old sinner."
          Yea, but limit not God. "But I am such a black sinner." Limit not the
          efficacy of the cleansing blood. "But I have aggravated him so much."
          Limit not his infinite longsuffering. "But my heart is so hard." Limit
          not the melting power of his grace, "But I am so sinful." Limit not
          the potency of the atonement. "But, sir, I am so hard-hearted, and I
          feel so little my need of him." Limit not the influences of the Spirit
          by thy folly or thy stubbornness but come as thou art, and put thy
          trust in Christ, and so honor God and he will not dishonor thy faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you will but now for half a moment consider how faithful God has
          been to his children and how true he has been to all his promises, I
          think that saint and sinner may stand together and make a common
          confession and utter a common prayer: "Lord, we have been guilty of
          doubting thee; we pray that we may limit thee no longer." Oh!
          remember, remember more and more God's Love and goodness to his
          ancient people, remember how he delivered them many a time, how he
          brought them out of Egypt with a high hand and an outstretched arm;
          think how he fed them in the wilderness, how he carried them all the
          days of old; remember his faithfulness to his covenant and to his
          servant Abraham, and say will he leave you, will he forget his
          covenant sealed with blood will he be unmindful of his promise, will
          he be slow to answer or slack to deliver? Scout the thought, drive it
          far away, and now come, and at the foot of the cross renew your faith;
          in the sight of the flowing wounds renew your confidence and say,
          "Jesus, we put our trust in thee; thy Father's grace can never fail,
          thou hast loved us, and thou wilt love us despite our sins, thou wilt
          present us at last before thy Father's face in glory everlasting."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, to conclude, I want your solemn attention while I
          address myself to a very small number of person here present, for
          whose sorrowful state I feel the greatest pity. It has been my
          mournful duty as pastor of so large a congregation, to have to deal
          with desperate cases. Here and there, there are men and women who have
          come into a state which, without meaning to wound them, I am free to
          confess I think, is sullen DESPAIR. They feel that they are guilty;
          they know that Christ is able to save; they also doctrinally
          understand the duty of faith, and its power to bring peace but they
          persevere in the declaration that there is no mercy for them. In vain
          you find out a parallel case; they soon discover some little
          discrepancy and so escape you. The most mighty promises lose all their
          force because they turn their edge by the declaration -- "That does
          not mean me." They read in the Word of God that "Jesus Christ came
          into the world to save sinners;" they are sinners, but they cannot
          think he came to save them. They know right well that he is able to
          save them to the uttermost; they would not say they had gone beyond
          the uttermost, but still they think so. They cannot imagine that free
          grace and sovereign love can ever come to them. They have, it is true,
          their gleams of sunshine, sometimes they believe, but when the
          comfortable presence of God is gone, they relapse into their old
          despair. Let me speak very tenderly, and O that the Spirit of God
          would speak also! My dear brother and sister, what art thou doing? I
          ask thee; what art thou doing? -- if thou art not limiting the Holy
          One of Israel? Wouldst thou dishonor God? "No," sayest thou, "I would
          not." But thou art doing it. Thou art saying that God cannot save
          thee, or if not saying that, thou art implying -- that all the torture
          thou hast felt in thy conscience, and all the anxiety thou hast in thy
          heart, have never yet moved God to look on thee. Why, thou makest God
          to be the most hard-hearted of all beings. If thou shouldst hear
          another groan as thou art groaning, thou wouldst weep over him; but
          thou thinkest that God looks on thee with cold indifference, and will
          never hear thy prayer. This is not only limiting -- it is slandering
          the Holy One of Israel. Oh, come forth, I beseech you, and dare to
          believe a good thing of thy God. Dare to believe this, that he is
          willing now to save thee -- that now he will put away thy sins. "But
          suppose, sir, I should believe something too good?" Nay, that thou
          canst not do. Think of God as being the most loving, the most
          tender-hearted being that can be, and thou hast thought just rightly
          of him. Think of him as having a mother's heart, that mourns over its
          sick babe; think of him as having a father's heart, pitying his
          children; think of him as having a husband's heart, loving his spouse
          and cherishing her, and thou hast just thought rightly of him. Think
          of him as being one who will not look on thy sins, but who casts them
          behind his back. Dare for once to give God a little honor. Come, put
          the crown on his head; say, "Lord, I am the vilest rebel out of hell,
          the most hard-hearted, the most full of blasphemous thoughts; I am the
          most wicked, the most abandoned; Lord let me have the honor now of
          being able to say, Thou art able to save even me; and on thy boundless
          love, thy great, thine infinite grace, do I rely." One of Charles
          Wesley's hymns, which I forget just now, has in it an expression
          something like this -- Lord, if there be a sinner in the world more
          needy than I am, then refuse me; if there be one more undeserving than
          I am, then cast me away; if there be one that needs grace and mercy,
          pity and compassion, more than I, then pass me by. "But, Lord," says
          he in his song, "thou knowest I the chief of sinners am, the vilest of
          the vile, the most hardened, and the most senseless, then, Lord,
          glorify thyself by showing to men, to angels, and to devils, what thy
          right hand can do. May the Holy Ghost enable thee now to come forth
          from the dungeon of despair, and no longer limit the Holy One of
          Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall add no more, but leave the effect of this sermon with my God.
          May every one of us believe him better, and have greater thoughts of
          him, and never let us be guilty henceforth of confining, as it were,
          within iron bonds the limitless One of Israel.<br />
