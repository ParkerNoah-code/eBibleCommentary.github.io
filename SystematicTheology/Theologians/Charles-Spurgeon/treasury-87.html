              TITLE AND SUBJECT. To the Chief Musician upon Gittith. A Psalm for
              the sons of Korah.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              This Psalm well deserved to be committed to the noblest of the
              sons of song. No music could be too sweet for its theme, or too
              exquisite in sound to match the beauty of its language. Sweeter
              than the joy of the wine press, (for that is said to be the
              meaning of the word rendered upon Gittith), is the joy of the holy
              assemblies of the Lord's house; not even the favored children of
              grace, who are like the sons of Korah, can have a richer subject
              for song than Zion's sacred festivals.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              It matters little when this Psalm was written, or by whom; for our
              part it exhales to us a Davidic perfume, it smells of the mountain
              heather and the lone places of the wilderness, where King David
              must have often lodged during his many wars. This sacred ode is
              one of the choicest of the collection; it has a mild radiance
              about it, entitling it to be called The Pearl of Psalms. If the
              twenty-third be the most popular, the one-hundred- and-third the
              most joyful, the one-hundred-and-nineteenth the most deeply
              experimental, the fifty-first the most plaintive, this is one of
              the most sweet of the Psalms of peace.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              Pilgrimages to the tabernacle were a great feature of Jewish life.
              In our own country, pilgrimages to the shrine of Thomas of
              Canterbury, and our Ladye of Walsingham, were so general as to
              affect the entire population, cause the formation of roads, the
              erection and maintenance of hostelries, and the creation of a
              special literature; this may help us to understand the influence
              of pilgrimage upon the ancient Israelites. Families journeyed
              together, making bands which grew at each halting place; they
              camped in sunny glades, sang in unison along the roads, toiled
              together over the hill and through the slough, and as they went
              along, stored up happy memories which would never be forgotten.
              One who was debarred the holy company of the pilgrims, and the
              devout worship of the congregation, would find in this Psalm fit
              expression for his mournful spirit.

              he could not. His expressions show us that his feelings were

              The tabernacle had been pitched in several places, and, moreover,
              was divided into several courts and portions; hence, probably, the
              plural number is here used. It was all and altogether lovely to
              David. Outer court, or inner court, he loved every portion of it.
              Every cord and curtain was dear to him. Even when at a distance,
              he rejoiced to remember the sacred tent where Jehovah revealed
              himself, and he cried out with exultation while he pictured in
              fond imagination its sacred services, and solemn rites, as he had
              seen them in bygone times.

              Because they are your tabernacles, "<b>O Lord Almighty</b>,"
              therefore are they so dear to your people. Your pavilion is the
              center of the camp, around which all your creatures gather, and
              towards which their eyes are turned, as armies look to the tent of
              the king. You rule all the companies of creatures with such
              goodness, that all their hosts rejoice in your dwelling-place, and
              the bands of your saints especially hail you with joyful loyalty
              as Jehovah Almighty.

              It was God himself that he pined for, the only living and true

              in the matter of Sabbath services our weary body sometimes comes
              to the assistance of our longing heart, for it desires the

              <i>Jehovah Almighty</i>; he found in it a sweetness which helped
              him to bear his inward hunger. Probably David himself was with the
              host, and, therefore, he dwelt with emphasis upon the title which
