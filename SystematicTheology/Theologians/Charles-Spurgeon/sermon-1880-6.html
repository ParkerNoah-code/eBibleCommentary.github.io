        <p>
          "And when Jesus saw" ["saw him," so it should be] "that he answered
          discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of
          God." -- Mark 12:34.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS MAN BEGAN with Christ as a foe, and he ended as a friend. It does
          not quite appear from Mark, but it is plainly stated by Matthew, that
          the scribe asked a question of the Savior "tempting him." He was,
          therefore, an enemy. Put the mildest sense you like on the word
          "tempt" and it will retain the idea of an unfriendly testing; yet
          nothing could be more hearty in the end than the verdict with which he
          commended our Lord's answer, "Well, Master, thou hast said the truth."
          Our Lord Jesus Christ has an almighty power over men's minds; he
          possesses irresistible charms by which he turns adversaries into
          advocates. He has a secret key which fits the wards of human hearts,
          and he can open that which seems to be the most securely closed
          against him. "Never man spake like this man," for in his voice, even
          in his humiliation, there were traces of the eternal fiat which of old
          spake the primeval midnight into noon.
        </p>
        <p>
          It strikes me that this scribe was half-hearted in the work of
          tempting our Lord, even at the first. I should imagine him to have
          been a very superior man amongst his fellows, a man of greater light
          and discernment than the rest, and of greater ability in statement and
          discussion. Possibly for this cause his brother scribes selected him,
          and put him forward to ask the testing questions. Now, it will
          sometimes happen that a man is thrust forward by others to do what he
          would never have thought of doing of his own accord, and quite
          unwillingly he acts as the mouthpiece of a set of people whom he half
          despises. Our Lord Jesus Christ is a ready reader of human hearts, and
          he very soon discovers whether what a man does is being done of
          himself or whether he is acted upon by a power behind. He discerns the
          difference between the malicious adversary and the less guilty victim
          of circumstances. These words of mine may be reaching persons who have
          opposed a religious movement, or fought against a gracious truth, not
          because they themselves would have done so if they had been left
          alone, but others have egged them on and made use of them, and thus
          they have been drawn or driven into a false position. The people whom
          they have been accustomed to lead have led them: it is too often the
          fate of leaders. The circle of which they have been the center and the
          head has imprisoned its own apparent master, and made him captive, so
          that he fights against that which in his heart he half suspects to be
          right. If, even now, he could be set free from his surroundings he
          would side with the right. Friend, my blessed Master can read your
          heart, and understand the pressure under which you are acting. I pray
          that as he reads your inmost soul he may see what of good there
          remaineth among the evil, and deliver you out of the false and
          dangerous position into which you have drifted. Jesus can set you
          right, my friend -- can take you away from the entanglements of your
          surroundings, sever you from those who are making a tool of you, but
          who are at the same time sinking you down to their own level: can
          bring you to be his own friend, and lift you up to his own standard,
          so that you too shall be the champion of everything that is good and
          true, and shall go forward with him as your Master, bearing his cross,
          and looking to wear his crown.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the scribe in the narrative before us appeared first under
          the aspect of an antagonist, and tried to tempt our Lord, yet before
          long the great Teacher had put him into such a mental condition that
          he said of him, "Thou art not far from the kingdom of God." At this
          time I shall first notice the commendation which is here expressed;
          and then, in the second place, I shall dwell for a little while upon
          the question which is here suggested -- suggested, I think, by no idle
          curiosity, but very naturally suggested: Did this man, who was so near
          to the kingdom, actually enter it, or did he not?
        </p>
        <p>
          I. May the Holy Spirit instruct and impress us while, first, we
          consider the COMMENDATION EXPRESSED: -- "THOU art not far from the
          kingdom of God." I am not going to use this text after the usual
          fashion. It has been made the heading of a catalogue of characters who
          are supposed to be not far from the kingdom of God. It is a very
          proper thing to address hopeful persons, and to give descriptions of
          conditions about which there is much that is cheering, and yet much to
          create anxiety; but the text itself does not deal with many cases, but
          with one whom Jesus judged to be not far from the kingdom of God, of
          whom it gives us such information that we see why he was thus spoken
          of. It speaks of one particular individual: "Thou art not far from the
          kingdom of God"; and it tells us that Jesus said this because he saw
          that he answered discreetly. We may infer without fear of mistake that
          any man who would answer as this man answered is not far from the
          kingdom of God. Let us read his answer: "Master, thou hast said the
          truth; for there is one God, and there is none other but he; and to
          love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with
          all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as
          himself, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices."
        </p>
        <p>
          With care let us investigate this reply, and see how far it might be
          our own language. The first point in which our Savior saw that the
          scribe was not far from the kingdom of God was this, that he possessed
          candour, and possessed so much of it that he rose superior to party
          considerations. He was a scribe, and naturally he took the side of the
          scribes and pharisees, but still he was not so much a scribe and
          pharisee that he would follow them against the truth. He kept himself
          open to conviction, and as soon as the Savior had given a fitting
          answer to the question, he did not, as other pharisees would have
          done, sneer at him, and continue still to pick fresh holes in his
          coat, but, like a candid man, he said, "Well, master, thou hast
          answered rightly"; and thus he did, as it were, separate himself from
          the unjust and bigoted party for whom he had been the temporary
          spokesman. He did not avow himself to be a disciple of Christ, yet he
          gave the great Teacher his due, and said of him what he felt bound to
          say, namely, that he had answered rightly. Now, my brethren, there is
          always some hope of a man who is candid, and there is more hope still
          of one who, being placed by circumstances amongst the bigoted and
          prejudiced, nevertheless breaks away from bondage, keeps a conscience,
          preserves his eye from total blindness, is willing to see light if
          light is to be had, and is anxious to know the truth if the truth can
          be brought before him. It gives me great delight to meet with such
          persons, even though they confess that they are of a sceptical turn of
          mind, when it is clear that they are ready to yield to evidence, and
          are not mere cavillers. Time is wasted upon men who have made up their
          minds, or who have no minds to make up, but enquirers are worth
          trouble, and those who will admit right and truth when they see it are
          among the most hopeful of hearers. We do not wish people to open their
          mouths and shut their eyes and swallow everything that we may like to
          give them, yet the mouth ought to be open, or at least willing to be
          opened, as well as the eye, or oar service at the gospel feast will be
          a weary task. When hearers are willing to receive the truth as well as
          to examine what they hear, they are in a good state. They will not
          only "prove all things," which a great many will do, but they are
          ready also to "hold fast that which is good," which some will not do:
          among such persons was the scribe.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will suppose that I am addressing one who has been brought up under
          a system which makes little of Christ. Perhaps your form of religion
          makes much of the priest, and of sacraments, but it does not say much
          of the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. There are faiths which make
          more of human things than of our divine Savior, the blessed Redeemer
          of sinners, and it may be that you profess one of these. Or you may
          have hitherto lived under a religion which makes much of your good
          works, and doings, and feelings, and so on. It may be that the Lord
          will enable you to rise superior to the influence of creeds, of
          education, and of association, and to say, "I only wish to know God's
          way of salvation. My desire is to be guided by what the Lord has
          revealed. I am prepared to accept whatever is plainly taught in the
          Word of God, even should it reverse all my former beliefs, and deprive
          me of my most cherished consolations. With sincere heart I ask
          enlightenment from the divine Spirit." Now, when we meet with a man of
          that kind, and see him hearing the gospel, we may say of him, "Thou
          art not far from the kingdom of God." These are the kind of people who
          feel the force of truth, and are converted to the faith of Jesus,
          these straightforward people, these hearty lovers of that which is
          good. The Savior called some men, "honest and good ground," and they
          were such even before the seed of the word fell upon them. Of course,
          even this natural openness and sincerity of character is God's gift,
          but assuredly these are the people upon whom the heavenly work takes
          most effect. Your tricksters, shufflers, players, make-believes, and
          men without principle or heart, are seldom converted. I speak from
          wide observation. I have seen scores of blustering blasphemers, who
          were downright in their profanity, brought to Jesus' feet, but I do
          not remember seeing a deceitful person brought there. Your deeply
          lying character -- I will not say that it is beyond the power of grace
          to save him, but I will say this, it is the rarest thing under heaven
          for a man who has long been a liar ever to be converted. I will say
          nothing in the praise of human nature, nor give any reason for the
          absolutely free election of grace, but still I notice that for the
          most part there is a sort of honest openness and freedom from trickery
          about those whom the Lord calls to himself. I notice that
          characteristic in the first fishermen apostles, who were no doubt
          ignorant and weak, but they were as transparent as glass, and as free
          from guile as Nathanael. Even in their follies, and their sins, and
          their blunders they were always open-hearted, and so, in general, are
          those upon whom the Lord looks with an eye of love. Tricksters come in
          like Judas, but they go out again, for they are not of us. They
          experience no change from their association with godliness, or from
          their knowledge of truth, but would pick the purse of Christ himself,
          and sell their Redeemer for pieces of silver. Far otherwise is it with
          a man of candid and thorough spirit, for he is glad to receive the
          gospel, and it soon displays its gracious power in him. We may say of
          the candid man as Christ did of this scribe, "Thou art not far from
          the kingdom of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          A second point is, perhaps, even more clear. This man also possessed
          spiritual knowledge. It is a great error to suppose that ignorance can
          do anybody any good. There is a religion which prefers to have
          ignorant people to deal with, but we have learned the truth of what
          Solomon said: "That the soul be without knowledge, it is not good." To
          be ignorant of the law of God is to be far off from the kingdom; and
          to be ignorant of the gospel is also to be in a measure far off from
          the kingdom: but this man knew the law, and knew it well. He had a
          spiritual appreciation of its range, meaning, and spirituality. Notice
          how he puts it: he puts it well. He says, "To love God with all the
          heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with
          all the strength, -- this is the first commandment." Here we see,
          first, that he mentions sincere love, in the words "to love him with
          all the heart." God is to be loved, not in name, not with lip
          language, not with mere pretense, but with the heart. God requireth by
          his law the hearty obedience of his creatures. Next, the scribe puts
          it, "With all thy understanding "; that is, God deserves and demands
          the intelligent love of his creatures. He does not ask blind love of
          them: he desires them to know something of him, and of his works, and
          of his claims upon them, so as to love him because he deserves their
          affection. The understanding must justify and impel the affections.
          Then, he puts it, "with all thy soul "; that is, with the emotional
          nature. Love God with feeling -- not coolly, but with the whole force
          of your feeling. Love him with your soul, for soul love is the soul of
          love. And then he adds, "and with all thy strength "; that is to say,
          intensity is to be thrown into our love to God. We are to serve him
          with our might, and throw all our whole energy into his worship. Thus
          he gives us, under four heads, a description of the kind of love which
          the law of God requires of us -- sincere -- "with all thy heart";
          intelligent -- "with all thy understanding"; emotional -- "with all
          thy soul"; intense and energetic -- "with all thy strength." This the
          scribe knew, and it was most valuable knowledge. Beloved, when a man
          begins intelligently to grasp the doctrines of the law and the gospel,
          when we perceive that he is no stranger to divine things, but that he
          can give a reason for his beliefs, and can state them to others,
          although we dare not conclude because of this knowledge that such a
          man is actually in the kingdom of God, we may safely conclude that he
          is not far from it. Give us candor, and let that candour be attended
          with enlightenment, and we are sure that the possessor of these things
          is not far from the kingdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          A third point is more remarkable still, because it is to be feared
          that hundreds of professed Christians are nothing like so near to the
          kingdom of heaven as this man was. This scribe knew the superiority of
          an inward religion over that which is external, for he declares, To
          love him with all thy heart is more than whole burnt offerings and
          sacrifices." Thousands at this hour are publicly teaching us that the
          principal point of religion is that you shall be duly and properly
          baptized and confirmed, and shall reverently and properly receive the
          sacrament. They lay stress upon your receiving before you have your
          breakfast, and upon the breaker of the sacred bread having been duly
          touched on the head by a bishop, and I do not know what else of mere
          outward circumstance. Books have been written about how the service is
          to be performed, and how it is not to be performed, and a great noise
          has been made about a piece of bread which was brought before a court
          of law. I believe a very great dignitary has been so weak as to
          certify that this baked dough has been "reverently consumed": and yet
          this is not a heathen country, nor are we worshippers of fetishes!
          Great importance is attached to the style of garment, which should be
          worn by priests on Holy Monday, or Good Friday. Colours vary according
          to the almanack, and the age of the moon. I must confess I need all my
          gravity when I think of copes, and girdles, and surplices, and gowns
          being matters of serious discussion. Surely these poor dupes of
          superstition are far, very far, from the kingdom of God, which is not
          meat and drink, nor clothing, nor posture, but righteousness and peace
          and joy in the Holy Ghost. Their whole line of thought is alien to the
          mind of God, who is a spirit, and must be worshipped in spirit and in
          truth. In the whole business of exhibitional religion what is there to
          content the soul? What can there be in it to please God? If our God
          were a royal puppet I could conceive of his being pleased with
          ceremonial; or if he were like the heathens' idiotic deities I could
          understand that mummeries, masquerades, postures, processions, robes,
          and round-robins might please him; but seeing that he is God, the only
          wise, be it far from me to dream of such a thing. Such child's play
          can scarce be borne with by full-grown men, but for that glorious mind
          that filleth all immensity to be thought to be particular about the
          cut and color of a vestment seems to me to be little short of
          blasphemy. When the thing was typical of truth yet to be revealed, it
          was important; but now that the true light has risen, and the shadows
          have departed, no such explanation is possible. Can it really be true
          that courts of law and assemblies of the church discuss the question
          of men's turning to the east or to the west when they pray? Is it
          thought to be of some consequence how men shall turn, and twist, and
          bend? What god is this that they serve? What being is this that they
          adore? Certainly not Jehovah, the God of heaven, whom we worship, for
          he "dwelleth not in temples made with hands," that is to say, of this
          building; and he hath abolished all rubrics save this: -- "they that
          worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth." Only spiritual
          worship is worship, and only as the heart adores does God accept the
          homage which is offered to him. This scribe knew that even whole burnt
          offerings, though God had ordained them, and they were therefore
          right, and sacrifices, though the law had settled them, and they were
          therefore due, were nothing when compared with loving God with all the
          heart and with all the soul. He expresses this most plainly that "to
          love God with all the heart is more than all whole burnt offerings and
          sacrifices." And see how broadly he puts it -- "All whole burnt
          offerings and sacrifices" put together. If they could slay all the
          bullocks upon a thousand hills, and set Lebanon's self on fire, making
          it one huge altar upon which the holocaust should smoke, and even if
          they should pour out rivers of oil, and side by side with it ran
          streams of blood of fat beasts, yet all would be nothing. Who hath
          required this at their hands? The Lord's demands are not of this sort.
          "Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not." What God asks is that we
          should love him first of all, and our neighbor as ourselves. Now, a
          man who has come so far as to shake off the superstition of confidence
          in external worship is not far from the kingdom of God. He who knows
          that if saved it will be by a spiritual change, and not by going to a
          place of worship, not by repeating prayers, not by joining a church,
          not by being baptized, not by taking the sacrament, knows more than
          many; and he who also knows that loving God with all his heart is an
          absolutely needful evidence of his being a child of God, and longs to
          feel that love, is not far from the kingdom. A sense of the value and
          necessity of spiritual religion is a most hopeful sign. I do not say
          that it is a sure sign of saving grace; but I am sure it is a token of
          being very near the kingdom. Oh that the man would take the one step
          which is now needed by turning his knowledge into practice! Oh that he
          would believe with all his heart, and live!
        </p>
        <p>
          Another point is manifest in this man's confession; he saw very
          plainly the supremacy of God over the whole of our manhood. It was
          clear to him that there was but one God, and that man was made on
          purpose to be one and undivided in his service. He perceived that man
          should love, honor, and serve that one God with all his heart, with
          all his heart, with all his understanding, with all his soul, and with
          all his strength. Do you know that, dear friend? Come now, if you are
          not a saved man, I will ask you -- do you recognize this to be true,
          that it is your bounden duty to serve your God with all your heart and
          understanding, and soul, and strength? Do you admit this? If you do,
          and if you are an honest man, you are not far from the kingdom of God,
          because honest men earnestly endeavor to pay their debts, and when
          they find that they cannot, they are distressed. If you are in
          distress of mind because you cannot meet your obligations to God, then
          you are not far from the kingdom. I rejoice in your discovery of
          shortcoming, failure, and inability, for these lie near that hearty
          penitence which is the sister of saving faith, and the sure herald of
          joy and peace. When a man feels his own inability to do as he ought,
          when he trembles before the law which, nevertheless, he honors and
          admits to be just and right, then he is not far from
          self-renunciation, and from accepting that matchless righteousness
          which Jesus Christ has come to bring. A consciousness of the supremacy
          of the sovereignty of God over us, so that he ought to have every
          thought, every breath, every pulse, is the work of the Spirit, who
          thereby convinces us of sin, and it is a sweet sign of dawn in the
          once darkened soul. Admit that God ought to be heartily loved, and you
          are not far from loving him; feel that you are guilty for not loving,
          and the seeds of love are in your heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more only. Although this hopeful scribe recognized the value of
          spiritual religion, and the need of heart-work, and of the heart being
          wholly given to God, yet he did not despise outward religion so far as
          it was commanded of God. He says that to love God is better than whole
          burnt offerings and sacrifices; which was an admission that these
          things were good in their places. He was no rejecter of ceremonies
          which are commanded, because of the superstition of will-worshippers
          who invent ceremonies. We are not to give up the baptism of believers
          because of the unscriptural rite of infant sprinkling, nor to forsake
          the Lord's Supper because of the popish mass. Ordinances of God are
          good in their places, and what is to be dreaded is the perversion of
          them by thrusting them into the place of better and more important
          matters. Thus the scribe showed a well-balanced mind all round, and
          proved himself not far from the kingdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dear friend, are you prepared to lay hold of truth wherever you
          find it? Are you prepared to break away from party ties and family
          prejudices? Are you prepared to believe that the inward and spiritual
          part of religion is infinitely superior to the external part of it, be
          it right or be it wrong? Do you also admit the divine supremacy of
          God, and his right to you in all respects? And are you willing to take
          ordinances, such as he has ordained, in their place, and not out of
          it? Then, if all these things be in you, your character resembles that
          of this scribe of whom Jesus said, "Thou art not far from the kingdom
          of God." I am right glad to meet with you, for you are not far from
          submitting to the divine authority, since you are already found
          admitting its right to you. I trust you are not far from entering into
          the realm of spiritual religion, for you already value it. You are not
          far from the privilege of being wholly renewed in heart, since you see
          the need of it. How glad I am that you should be now listening to the
          gospel! Happier still shall I be if God shall help me to say the right
          word to you at this good hour. The Lord send it!
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Our second point is THE QUESTION SUGGESTED -- this man came so
          near to the kingdom: did he ever enter it? We do not know. If anybody
          were to assert that he did not I should be ready to question his
          statement. If anybody were to declare that he did I should at once
          demand his authority for the assertion. We receive no information from
          the Scriptures, and it is always better where the word of God is
          silent to be silent ourselves. We should also observe another very
          good rule if you have to judge of a man's state, and know but little
          of it, always judge it favourably. Judges usually give a prisoner the
          benefit of the doubt; and when a man is not a prisoner, when he has
          come so far towards grace as this scribe, let us at any rate hope that
          he did enter into the kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          I see no reason why he should not have done so; and that is my first
          answer to the question. He should have done so. Having come so far
          there were many doors by which, God's Spirit being with him, he might
          have entered into the kingdom; I mean doors of thought, by which the
          Holy Spirit would readily have led his candid mind into the faith of
          Christ. I will show you one. There was in after years another scribe,
          a rabbi -- you will recollect his name -- who said, "I consent unto
          the law, that it is good; but I see another law in my members, warring
          against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law
          of sin which is in my members. O wretched man that I am! Who shall
          deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God, through Jesus
          Christ our Lord." You see the process of thought. It is a very simple
          one. This scribe sees the law of God to be a spiritual law, demanding
          the obedience of his heart, his understanding, his soul, and his
          strength. If he had thought awhile he would, as a candid man, have
          said, "I have not kept this law. What is more, I cannot keep it. If I
          try to keep it I find a something within me against which I struggle,
          but which, nevertheless, brings me into captivity to another law -- a
          law of selfishness, a law of sin." Then, as a man anxious to be right,
          he would have said, "How can I be delivered? Oh that I might be set
          free to keep the law of God! I cannot abide in this bondage. I ought
          to keep this law, I shall never be happy till I do love God with all
          my heart, for he ought to be so loved, and I perceive that there can
          be no heaven to a heart which does not love God intensely, for this is
          one of the essentials of peace and rest. How can I get at it?" In such
          a condition as that, if he had heard the sweet invitation of our Lord,
          "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give
          you rest," would he not have leaped at the sound? Do you not see the
          simple doorway for such a man as that to become a Christian? He had
          come so far that surely he should come a little farther. Let us trust
          that he did. At any rate, if any of you have come so far, may God's
          sweet Spirit lead you to take those other steps, and to enter into the
          kingdom, submitting to the sweet sovereignty of the Prince Immanuel,
          whose scepter is of silver, and whose servitude is an honor and a
          delight to all his subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is one door; now follow with me another track. Suppose this man
          had really loved God with all his heart, and understanding, and soul,
          and strength -- I will not say perfectly, for that would be supposing
          an impossibility, but supposing that he had truly and sincerely loved
          God, he could not have been an hour in the company of the Lord Jesus
          without feeling the deepest union of heart to him. Would he not have
          exclaimed, "This man, too, loves God with all his heart"? He must have
          perceived it, for the zeal which Christ had for the Father was
          immeasurable; it flashed in every gleam of his eye, it tinctured every
          word that fell from his lips. Jesus lived for God, and glorified the
          Father with all his heart and soul, and any person who truly loved God
          would soon have perceived that fact. "Ah!" he would have exclaimed,
          "here is one who loves God better than I do; here is one who honors
          God more than I do; here is one who is more consecrated, more devoted,
          more godlike than I am." By that door he would have been led to
          admiration of Jesus, to communion with him, and ultimately to belief
          in him as the Messiah. Let us hope that the scribe was so led, for the
          way is plain enough. At any rate, if God in his grace has led any man
          here to love the Father, I am persuaded that he will love the Son; for
          he that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of
          him. My hearer, thou art certainly not far from the kingdom of God if
          thou hast come so far as to love God, even though thou knowest little
          as yet of his only begotten Son. God help you to take that one other
          step.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is another door. You notice that he said that to love God was
          more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices. Now, suppose that with
          that in his mind, he had sat down, and said, "This loving God is the
          main thing; why, then, is the law encumbered with burnt offerings and
          sacrifices? If they really are inferior to the moral precepts, and
          especially to the spiritual precepts, why are they there at all?" Then
          methinks he would have seen that they must be there for a spiritual
          purpose. And suppose he had begun to try and read the meaning of the
          paschal lamb, or of the daily lamb, or of the sin-offering, why,
          methinks, if he turned to that blessed fifty-third chapter of Isaiah,
          and began to read it in order to understand the sacrifices of the old
          law, it would have happened to him as it did to the eunuch when Philip
          opened to him the Scriptures -- he would have seen Jesus in them all.
          He must have seen him. And if you, dear friend, have come to see the
          right place of gospel ordinances through candidly searching out their
          meaning, you have seen that their whole teaching is Christ Jesus, the
          sacrifice for sin. There is nothing in the two great gospel ordinances
          but Christ. Christ's sufferings, death, burial, and resurrection set
          forth in baptism: Christ's death set forth until he come at the
          communion table -- life given us by our Savior's death, and life
          sustained by the same means. Jesus is the body of the ordinances of
          the Old Testament, and the soul of those of the New. If you are but
          candid enough to desire to push through the veil, and get at the real
          meaning of every outward ordinance, you will see Jesus ere long.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is another road by which the scribe might have been led to the
          Savior. Think again. Suppose that he had continued to glow and burn
          with love to God. As that love grew the understanding would also
          become enlightened with it, and the soul would rise towards God. You
          know why that would be. It must be because the Holy Spirit was in the
          man, for no man loveth God or striveth to love God, with all his
          heart, and understanding, and soul, and strength, without there being
          in secret and unknown to him a divine power at the back impelling him
          in that direction. Now, do you think that the Holy Spirit would thus
          work in the man and not reveal Christ to him for his salvation? I
          cannot believe it. I am persuaded that, coming as that man did under
          the gospel of Christ, he would be by his candour, by his love of God,
          by the influence of the divine Spirit, in such a state of mind that,
          as when sparks fall upon dry tinder they ignite at once, so would the
          words of Jesus fall upon a mind prepared of the Spirit of God. That
          scribe was, therefore, not far from the kingdom of God. I do hope that
          there are some such hearts present at this hour. Some of you, I trust,
          can say, "Oh that I had Christ! I would give my eyes for him." If you
          mean that, why do you not have him? He is to be had for nothing. "Oh,"
          says another, "I would die if I might have him and be saved." Why not
          live, and be saved? "Oh, but I would give anything." Why not leave off
          the idea of giving, and take freely what Jesus presents to you? But
          yet that very desire of yours -- that longing of yours -- proves that
          you are not far from the kingdom of God. My heart's desire is that as
          you have come so far you may now yield yourselves up to Jesus. That is
          the way of salvation: have done with self-salvation and let Jesus save
          you. When a man is in the water, if he kicks and struggles he will
          drown, but if he lies still he will float. When another comes to help,
          if he will be passive he will be saved, but all that he can do will
          hinder his deliverance. Be passive in the hands of Christ till he
          gives you life to be active with. Be nothing, and let him be
          everything. Trust him wholly and alone. Drop into his arms, and let
          him bear the weight of your sins and sorrows, and it shall not be said
          of you any longer that you are not far from the kingdom of God, but it
          shall be sung on earth and in heaven -- "He has returned to the
          Shepherd and Bishop of souls, glory be to God!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, as I have said, there is the dark supposition that perhaps the
          scribe never did enter the kingdom. He may have been so near to the
          kingdom, and yet he may have lacked the one thing needful. If it were
          so, it was a grievous fact; and all we can now do is to profit by it.
          What could have been the reason why he did not enter the kingdom? I
          cannot tell, we know so little of him; but if we might infer from the
          little we do know, I should suppose that if he did not enter it was
          from the unworthy motive of being swayed by his fellow-men. We judged
          that when he came to Christ to put the question, he came not of his
          own mind and motion. We began by thinking that he seemed half-hearted
          in his opposition, and that so he the more readily turned from a
          questioner into a candid admirer. It is, however, just possible that,
          being the spokesman for others, he had grown fond of taking the lead;
          and if he did not really enter the kingdom, it may have been because
          he would have lost his place in the front rank of scribe and pharisee,
          and this was too great a price to pay for truth and righteousness. I
          have known a man deeply impressed with religious things, and feeling
          his way aright; but a little company of half a dozen whom he met in
          the evening, of whom he was the leading spirit, have sufficed to hold
          him in bondage. They invite him to come again; they miss his genial
          society, his jest, his song, his merry talk. He cannot face it out,
          and tell them that he has a call elsewhere, a call to nobler things.
          He has not the resolute will to lead them in another direction, and
          dreads even to make the attempt. He wants to be the leading man; and
          so he gives up what his conscience suggests to him rather than not be
          the leader of men whom in his heart he must know to be unworthy of
          such a homage. In his own mind he thinks them fools; but, still, he is
          afraid that they should think him so, and therefore he becomes a
          greater and more guilty fool than they. Oh. that fear of men, that
          fear of men! You may meet with here and there a man of the better sort
          who begins to feel, "Yes, there is the light there: light worth
          having." He breaks away from his party, and its surroundings, and for
          a while is eager for the truth, which he has half discovered; but he
          fears the cold shoulder which society would give him, dreads the jeer
          of "Sir John," and the sneer of "My Lord." The half-opened eye is
          closed with saddest determination from fear ot other children of
          darkness, who would mock at its better sight. This is a sight which
          might make an angel weep. Jesus is sold, but not for so much as
          clinked in the hand of Judas; he is bartered for a fool's smile, and
          for the company of the vain and frivolous. Ah me, that ever the sun
          should behold so dread a sight! Multitudes who know the truth, and are
          not far from the kingdom of God, nevertheless, never enter it, because
          of the fear of man, the love of approbation, the horror of being
          laughed at and jested at. With such vile fetters immortal souls are
          bound for execution, and held back from everlasting blessedness. There
          is something very beautiful about many a young man of enquiring mind,
          and if you could transplant him, and set him in another soil, you
          might make something of him; but not in that shop, where all his
          fellows would make him the butt of their mirth if he were really a
          Christian, not in that work-room, where all the artisans would swear
          and chaff if he were but to avow his half-formed convictions. Want of
          courage, want of self-denial, is that fatal flaw which ruins what else
          had been a gem in the Redeemer's crown. All brave hearts mournfully
          pronounce that he is justly lost who is not bold enough to own his
          Savior, and the truth.
        </p>
        <p>"I had as lief not be, as live to be</p>
        <p>In awe of such a thing as I myself."</p>
        <p>
          Afraid of another man! Am I then myself a man? Or am I but the mere
          mockery of manhood? Oh, sirs, let your manhood come to the rescue. God
          grant you grace to say, "What can it matter to me what men say as long
          as I am right?" They cannot break bones with their jests; and if they
          did, there have been Christians who have not only suffered the
          breaking of their bones, but the burning of their whole bodies for
          Christ's sake sooner than deny his sacred claims. What did Jesus say?
          "He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it." He who, to gain
          the whole world, would keep back a solitary truth, is a huge loser for
          his pains. He is mean and base, and not worthy to be numbered amongst
          those who follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. Oh! if I speak to
          one who hesitates, let me remind him that, however it may look
          to-night to be a daring step to be decided for Christ, it will look
          very differently soon when the great trumpet shall sound, and ring
          o'er earth and sea, and the dead shall rise, and the judgment-seat
          shall be set, and the great white throne shall be unveiled. Then it
          will be seen to be a far more desperate daring to deny the Lord even
          to save life itself. What will the cowards do in that day who, to
          please men, forsook their Lord? What will they do who suppressed truth
          and stifled conscience when the Shepherd begins to divide the goats
          and the sheep from each other? Ay, what will they do who find
          themselves driven with the goats, though once they half decided to be
          numbered with the sheep? They were near the fold, but never entered.
          What will they feel when he shall say, "Depart! Depart! I know you
          not. You knew not me in the day of my humiliation. You were ashamed of
          me in the world. You blushed at. my name. You covered up what was in
          your conscience in order to avoid man's laughter and rebuke. You knew
          not me, and now I know not you. Depart! Depart!" In proportion to the
          light against which you have shut your eyes will be your horror when
          that light shall blind you into eternal night. In proportion to the
          violence which you have done to your consciences will be the terror
          which your awakened consciences will work in you. In proportion to the
          nearness of the kingdom within which you came shall be the dreadful
          distance to which you will be driven.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was thinking that, if the Lord were to pay men in their own coin,
          what an awful thing it would be if those who are now not far from the
          kingdom were told by the Lord, "You shall stay there for ever. You,
          who heard the gospel, and did not accept it, must stop where you are."
          Halt, sir! not a step more! Close to the gates of heaven -- you stop
          there! To hear its music for ever, and to gnash your teeth for ever,
          because you cannot join in it! To hear the songs of the righteous,
          while you wail for ever! To know the brightness of bliss, but to be
          yourself in the black darkness for ever! To be within an inch of
          heaven, and yet in hell! The living water flowing at your feet, and
          yet your tongue for ever parched! The bread of life nigh at hand, and
          yet you cannot eat! Oh, think of it! Eternally not far from the
          kingdom! If you would not wish to be so, oh, be not out of Christ
          another minute! May God's Spirit enable you to leap right away from
          your undecided condition into living faith and loving obedience to
          Christ.

        <p>LETTER FROM MR. SPURGEON.</p>
        <p>
          DEAR FRIENDS, -- Nothing remains to report to you but my hope of being
          in my own pulpit on Feb.8. I beg you to join with me in thanks to the
          healing Lord for this restoration. The Lord bringeth down to the grave
          and raiseth up again, and to him be praise for ever.

        <p>
          It would be a great favor to me personally, and a means of good to
          many, if the readers of the sermons would aid in increasing their
          circulation. They are already very widely scattered, but if twice the
          number could be sent abroad we might look for double fruit. After
          standing the test of twenty-five years the Metropolitan Tabernacle
          Pulpit may be pardoned if it asks those who profit by the sermons to
          introduce them to others.

          May future discourses be more full of unction and power, and so may
          you, dear readers, reap a harvest from my pains and sicknesses.

        <p>Yours ever heartily,</p>
