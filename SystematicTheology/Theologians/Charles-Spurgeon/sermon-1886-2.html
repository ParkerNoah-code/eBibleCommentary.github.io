        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1889)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Evening, February 28th, 1886, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "Ye are come . . .. to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to
          the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of
          Abel. See that ye refuse not him that speaketh." -- Hebrews 12:24, 25.
        </p>
        <p>
          IN THE FORMER part of this sermon the text grew upon me so largely
          that it was quite impossible to express all its meaning. In as
          condensed a manner as possible I explained what was meant by "the
          blood of sprinkling," and I also enlarged upon the high position which
          this precious blood occupies in the gospel dispensation; but I was
          obliged to leave for this second occasion two practical questions
          which the text is sure to raise if it be carefully thought upon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctrinal portion of our meditation was greatly blest to our
          hearts, for God the Holy Ghost refreshed us thereby: may he now
          fulfill his sacred office with equal power, by revealing the things of
          Christ to us in a way which shall cause self-examination, and arouse
          us to give more earnest heed than ever to the voice of him that
          speaketh from heaven. No theme can excel in value and excellence that
          of the precious blood of Jesus. Unless the Holy Spirit shall prepare
          our hearts, even with such a topic as this before us, we shall be
          nothing profited; but if he will show these choice truths unto us, we
          shall be comforted, quickened, edified, and sanctified by them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a considerable disadvantage to some of you that you have not
          heard the former part of the sermon; but I hope you will read it at
          your leisure, and then, if you read this in connection with it, the
          whole subject will be before you. Not that I can set it all out in
          words: I only mean that it will be before you as the ocean is before
          us when we sit on the beach, or as the heavens are before us when we
          gaze upon Arcturus with his sons. Finite language fails to convey the
          infinite; and if ever there was a text which deserved to be called
          infinite, it is that which is now before us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having touched, as with a swallow's wing, the surface of our great
          theme under the first division of the sermon, I have now to speak with
          you upon the second, which is this: Where are we with reference to
          this blood of sprinkling? The text says, "Ye are come." We are not
          come to Mount Sinai, but we are come to Mount Zion; to angels and
          their God; to saints and their Mediator, and to the blood of
          sprinkling. This having had its share of our thoughts, we are to
          conclude with the question, What then? If we have come to this blood
          of sprinkling, what then? The answer is, "See that ye refuse not him
          that speaketh." Let us give to the wondrous truths revealed to us by
          the sacrifice of Jesus the most earnest heed, that our souls may hear
          and live. May the Holy Spirit enable us to hear the heavenly voice at
          this hour! "Faith cometh by hearing; may it come at this time by our
          reverently hearing the voice of the blood of sprinkling!
        </p>
        <p>
          II. My business under the second head of my discourse is to answer the
          question, WHERE ARE WE? I have to explain what is meant by the
          expression which is found in the twenty-second verse of the chapter
          "Ye are come." Link the twenty-second verse with this twenty-fourth,
          and read, "Ye are come to the blood of sprinkling."
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, first, ye are come to the hearing of the gospel of the atoning
          sacrifice. The Israelites left Egypt, and, having passed the Red Sea,
          they entered the desert, and at length came to the mount of God, even
          to Sinai, that terrible mountain. In the valley around that throne of
          God they were gathered together in their thousands. What a sight that
          vast multitude must have been! Probably two millions or more were
          encamped before the mount. Then, "The Lord came from Sinai, and rose
          up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from Mount Paran; and he came
          with ten thousands of his saints; from his right hand went a fiery law
          for them." Israel crouched in the valley below, subdued by the
          terrible majesty of the scene, and overawed by the trumpet voice which
          pealed forth from the midst of the thick darkness. The Lord spake with
          them, but their uncircumcised ears could not bear his glorious voice,
          and they entreated that Moses might act as mediator, and speak in
          God's stead.
        </p>
        <p>
          You and I have not come to such a terrible sight at this hour. No
          quivering mountain smokes before you, no terrible lightnings appall
          you, no thunders distress you.
        </p>
        <p>"Not to the terrors of the Lord,</p>
        <p>The tempest, fire, and smoke;</p>
        <p>Not to the thunder of that word</p>
        <p>Which God on Sinai spoke:</p>
        <p>"But we are come to Sion's hill</p>
        <p>The city of our God,</p>
        <p>Where milder words declare his will,</p>
        <p>And spread his love abroad."</p>
        <p>
          Among the great things which you are called upon to consider under the
          gospel is "the blood of sprinkling." Count yourselves happy that you
          are privileged to hear of the divinely appointed way of reconciliation
          with God. You are come to hear, not of your sin and its doom, not of
          the last judgment and the swift destruction of the enemies of God; but
          of love to the guilty, pity for the miserable, mercy for the wicked,
          compassion for those who are out of the way. You are come to hear of
          God's great expedient of wisdom, by which he, by the same act and
          deed, condemns sin, and lets the sinner live; honors his law, and yet
          passes by transgression, iniquity, and sin. You are come to hear, not
          of the shedding of your own blood, but of the shedding of his blood
          who, in his infinite compassion, deigned to take the place of guilty
          men -- to suffer, that they might not suffer, and die, that they might
          not die. Blessed are your ears, that they hear of the perfect
          sacrifice! Happy are your spirits, since they are found where free
          grace and boundless love have set forth a great propitiation for sin!
          Divinely favored are you to live where you are told of pardon freely
          given to all who will believe on the name of the Lord Jesus, as the
          Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world. You hear at this
          hour not law, but gospel; not the sentence of judgment, but the
          proclamation of grace. "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh." It
          is no small thing for the kingdom of God to have come so nigh unto
          you. Awake to a sense of your privilege: you do not sit in heathen
          midnight, nor in Popish gloom, nor in Jewish mist; but day has dawned
          on you: do not refuse the light.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a better sense, going a little further, we have not only come to
          the blood of sprinkling by hearing about it, but we have come to it
          because the great God now deals with us upon methods which are founded
          and grounded upon the atoning sacrifice of Christ. If God were to deal
          with us upon the terms laid down at Sinai, he need not be long in
          finding the "two or three witnesses" to prove that we have broken his
          law. We should be ourselves compelled to plead guilty; no witnesses
          would be required. Truly, he hath not dealt with us after our sins. We
          are so faulty that we can draw no comfort from the prospect of
          judgment by law; we appeal to mercy alone; for on any other ground our
          case is hopeless. "This do, and thou shalt live" is a covenant which
          brings us no ray of comfort; for its only word to us is that
          thunderbolt -- "The soul that sinneth, it shall die."
        </p>
        <p>
          By the works of the law none can be justified, for by that law we are
          all condemned. Read the Ten Commandments, and pause at each one, and
          confess that you have broken it either in thought, or word, or deed.
          Remember that by a glance we may commit adultery, by a thought we may
          be guilty of murder, by a desire we may steal. Sin is any want of
          conformity to perfect holiness, and that want of conformity is justly
          chargeable upon every one of us. Yet the Lord does not, under the
          gospel dispensation, deal with us according to law. He does not now
          sit on the throne of judgment, but he looks down upon us from the
          throne of grace. Not the iron rod, but the silver scepter, is held
          over us. The long-suffering of God rules the age, and Jesus the
          Mediator is the gracious Lord-lieutenant of the dispensation. Instead
          of destroying offending man from off the face of the earth, the Lord
          comes near to us in loving condescension, and pleads with us by his
          Spirit, saying, "You have sinned, but my Son has died. In him I am
          prepared to deal with you in a way of pure mercy and unmingled grace."
        </p>
        <p>
          O sinner, the fact that you are alive proves that God is not dealing
          with you according to strict justice, but in patient forbearance;
          every moment you live is another instance of omnipotent
          long-suffering. It is the sacrifice of Christ which arrests the axe of
          justice, which else must execute you. The barren tree is spared
          because the great Dresser of the vineyard, who bled on Calvary,
          intercedes and cries, "Let it alone this year also." O my hearer, it
          is through the shedding of the blood and the mediatorial reign of the
          Lord Jesus that you are at this moment on praying ground and pleading
          terms with God! Apart from the blood of atonement you would now be
          past hope, shut up for ever in the place of doom. But see how the
          great Father bears with you! He stands prepared to hear your prayer,
          to accept your confession of sin, to honor your faith, and to save you
          from your sin through the sacrifice of his dear Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through our Lord Jesus sovereign grace and infinite love find a free
          way to the most undeserving of the race. Through the divine sacrifice
          the Lord saith, "Come now and let us reason together: though your sins
          be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;" "Believe on the Lord
          Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." Thus the rebel is treated as a
          child, and the criminal as a beloved one. Because of yonder death on
          Calvary's cruel tree, God can invite guilty men to come to him, and he
          can receive them to the bosom of his love. O my dear hearers, do
          remember this! I am not sent to scold you, but to woo you, not sent to
          thunder at you, but to let the soft cleansing drops from the heart of
          Jesus fall upon you. I beg you not to turn away, as men may well do
          when the tidings are heavy; but hearken diligently, for the message is
          full of joy. You are now in the house of prayer, addressed by one of
          the Lord's ambassadors, and the tidings are of peace through a
          propitiation which God himself has provided and accepted. We cry not
          to you, "Prepare for vengeance;" but we proclaim, "a God ready to
          pardon." We do not threaten that he will no more have mercy upon you;
          but we tell you that he waiteth to be gracious. If I had to say, "You
          have provoked him past bearing, and he now means to destroy you," what
          a miserable man should I be! How could I bring such evil tidings to my
          fellow-creatures? Then would it have been woe to me that my mother
          bare me for so hard a fate. Thank God, it is not so. By virtue of the
          blood of sprinkling the language of boundless love is heard among our
          apostate race, and we are entreated to acquaint ourselves with God,
          and be at peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          No, my hearer, the day of grace is not over: you are not come to
          Sinai. No, you are not yet condemned past all hope; for you are still
          within reach of Jesus the Mediator. There is forgiveness. The fountain
          which was opened of old for sin and for uncleanness is open still. If
          you have sinned like David, if you will but accept the sprinkling of
          the blood of Jesus, I am able to speak to you as Nathan did to the
          guilty king, and say, "The Lord hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not
          die." At any rate, God is dealing with you now on gospel terms; he
          sits on Zion, not on Sinai; he pronounces invitations of grace, and
          does not utter the stern sentence of justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, there is a far more effectual way of coming to the blood of
          sprinkling than this -- when by faith that blood is sprinkled upon our
          souls. This is absolutely needed: the blood shed must become to each
          one of us the blood sprinkled. "How can I know," says one, "that the
          blood of Christ is upon me?" Dost thou trust thyself with Christ? Dost
          thou believe that he made an atonement on the cross; and wilt thou
          venture thy eternal destiny upon that fact, trusting in what Jesus
          did, and in that alone? If thou dost thus trust, thou shalt not trust
          in vain. Dost thou apply thy heart to the precious blood of Jesus?
          Then that precious blood is applied to thy heart. If thine heart
          bleeds for sin, bring it to the bleeding heart of Jesus, and it shall
          be healed. I showed, in the early part of this discourse, that the
          blood sprinkled on the lintel and the two side-posts of the door
          preserved the Israelites on the night of the Passover: it shall also
          preserve you. The blood sprinkled upon the defiled made them
          ceremonially clean: it shall cleanse you. Have I not often quoted
          those blessed words: "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us
          from all sin?" That blood put upon the sons of Aaron dedicated them to
          God; and if it be applied to you, it shall consecrate you to God, and
          you shall become the accepted servant of the Most High. Oh, what a
          blessed thing to know assuredly that we have come to the blood of
          sprinkling by a true and humble faith! Canst thou say that thou dost
          alone rely on Jesus for salvation? Canst thou call heaven and earth to
          witness that thou hast no other confidence? Then remember the word of
          the Lord: "He that believeth in him hath everlasting life. He that
          believeth in him is not condemned." "Therefore being justified by
          faith, we have peace with God." Are not these words full of strong
          assurance? Indeed, we have not come to Mount Sinai, the place of
          trembling; but to Zion, the place which is beautiful for situation,
          the joy of the earth; the vision of peace, the home of infinite
          blessedness. Conscience no longer thunders at you for your sins, for
          your sins are gone. The expiation has covered them: the sprinkling of
          the blood has put them all away. Your iniquities are cast into the
          depths of the sea; God has cast them behind his back. The handwriting
          of ordinances that was against you Christ has taken away, nailing it
          to his cross, as a record in which there is no more condemning force.
          The debt is paid, the bill is receipted. Who can lay anything to the
          charge of God's elect? O beloved! it is a most blessed thing to come
          to the blood of sprinkling.
        </p>
        <p>"The terrors of law and of God</p>
        <p>With me can have nothing to do;</p>
        <p>My Savior's obedience and blood</p>
        <p>Hide all my transgressions from view."</p>
        <p>
          The act of faith, whereby we accept and trust in the Lord Jesus as our
          Mediator and Sacrifice, is the true and effectual coming to the blood
          of sprinkling. May none of us forget thus to come! He is the Lamb of
          God, which taketh away the sin of the world, and those who come to him
          shall be led into full salvation. Have you thus come? If you have not,
          why do you delay? He saith, "Him that cometh to me I will in no wise
          cast out." Come to him, for he is calling you; come to him, even as
          you now are, and he will receive you without fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, to come to this blood of sprinkling means thankfully to enjoy
          all that comes to us through the blood of sprinkling. I have intruded
          upon this somewhat already. Brothers and sisters, if you have come to
          the blood of sprinkling, believe in the full pardon which God has
          given you, and in your consequent peace with God. It is a blessed word
          in the Creed, "I believe in the forgiveness of sins." Do you believe
          in the forgiveness of sins? I have seen some of the children of God
          who have believed in Jesus, but it has been with a faith which did not
          realize the full blessing promised to it; for they were as troubled
          about their sins as if they had never been forgiven. Now, a man who
          receives a free pardon from the Queen, and goes his way out of prison,
          rejoices in that pardon as a reality, and therefore walks abroad
          without fear. You must believe in the pardon of God as a reality, and
          act accordingly. If he has absolved you for Jesus' sake, then you are
          absolved. Why tremble like a guilty wretch waiting for the verdict?
          Why talk about fearing divine wrath? If you are pardoned, the deed of
          grace is done, and can never be undone; for the gifts and calling of
          God are without repentance on his part. His remission of sin is a
          clear gaol delivery, a sure plea, a full quittance.
        </p>
        <p>"Oh! how sweet to view the flowing</p>
        <p>Of our Lord's atoning blood,</p>
        <p>With divine assurance knowing</p>
        <p>He has made my peace with God!"</p>
        <p>
          I want every child of God in his inmost soul to come to the blood of
          sprinkling by full assurance of his justification, and then to go on
          to enjoy constant access to the mercy-seat, and communion with the
          Lord God. We may now with holy boldness speak with God in prayer, for
          the mercy-seat is sprinkled with the blood. O pardoned one, be not
          backward to enjoy thy liberty of fellowship! Thou art clean through
          the blood, and therefore thou mayest enter into the closest communion
          with the divine Father; thou art consecrated by the blood, and
          therefore thou mayest abound in the service of thy God. Treat thy God
          as a child should treat a father, and be not so awed by his majesty as
          to be cast down and distressed because of past sin, seeing it is
          pardoned. Take the good that God provides thee; enjoy the peace the
          blood has bought thee; enter into the liberty that thy ransom price
          has ensured thee. Do not stand in feelings, and fears, and dreams; but
          come unto this blood of sprinkling, and rest there, and be filled with
          joy and peace through believing. With such a ransom found for thee,
          dream not of going down into the pit, but ascend with gladness into
          the hill of the Lord, and stand in his holy place.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think, once more, that this coming to the blood of sprinkling means
          also that we feel the full effect of it in our lives. The man who
          knows that Jesus shed his blood for him, and has had that blood
          applied to his conscience, becomes a sin-hating man, consecrated to
          him who has cleansed him. "The love of Christ constraineth us; because
          we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that
          he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto
          themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again." I
          believe that there is no fruitful source of virtue like faith in the
          precious blood of Jesus. I hope your conduct will always support me in
          this assertion. Those who are debtors for salvation to their dying
          Lord should be the most holy of men. You people who think that you
          will get to heaven by some other way than by "the blood of sprinkling"
          have no sure bonds to hold you to holiness. You trust partly to your
          own works, and partly to what Jesus has done. Well, you do not owe him
          much, and therefore you will not love him much, and therefore you will
          not feel bound to live strict, holy, gracious lives. But the man who
          knows that his many sins are all washed away through the blood of
          Jesus, and that thus he is saved, he is the man who will serve the
          Lord with all his heart. He who has received a finished righteousness
          and complete salvation is under boundless obligations of gratitude,
          and the force of these obligations will urge him to a consecrated
          life. Over him the supreme power of gratitude will exert its sacred
          influence, and he will be not only carefully obedient, but ardently
          zealous in the service of his Redeemer. We know it is so, and we mean
          to prove it by our daily conduct. Brethren, I would have you exhibit
          more and more the influence of the precious blood in sanctifying your
          lives. Are there not Christians who hold the doctrine of the atoning
          blood, and yet are no better than others? Alas! it is so. But it is
          one thing to hold a doctrine, and another thing for that doctrine to
          take hold upon your heart and influence your life. Oh, if we believed
          practically what we believe professionally, what manner of persons
          should we be in all holy conversation and godliness! Hear me, my
          brother, and answer the appeals I make to thee as in the presence of
          the Lord. Blood-bought; canst thou live for thyself? Blood-washed;
          canst thou defile thy garments? Marked with the King's own name, in
          the King's own blood; how canst thou yield thyself to other rulers?
          God grant that we may come unto the blood of sprinkling till it shall
          purify our nature, and fill us with an all-consuming enthusiasm for
          him whose heart was pierced for us!
        </p>
        <p>
          I ask you, then, to put the question closely home, "Have I come unto
          this blood of sprinkling? If not, why should I not come at once?" I
          read the other day an imaginary story, which describes the need of
          looking well to this great business. Receive it as a parable: -- A
          little daughter of the house of Israel, had heard the commandment
          concerning the Passover night, and as she lay ill in her bed she
          cried, "Father, have you sprinkled the blood upon the lintel and the
          two side-posts?" Her father answered, "Not yet, my child. It shall be
          done." The daughter was distressed, and filled with fear. After
          waiting a little while she again cried, "Father, father, have you
          sprinkled the blood upon the door?" He answered carelessly, "Child, I
          have told Simeon to sprinkle it, and I have no doubt it is done."
          "But, father," cried she, "it is near midnight, and the destroying
          angel will soon be abroad; are you sure that the blood is over the
          door? Jehovah our God hath said that we must sprinkle the blood upon
          the lintel and the two side-posts, or else the destroyer will not pass
          over us. Father, are you sure it is done?" The father passed over her
          enquiry: he had been eating of the lamb with his friends, and thought
          that this was sufficient; he did not care to give too much prominence
          to the ghastly idea of blood. He was of a liberal mind, and would not
          believe that a merciful God would smite his household for so small an
          omission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then his daughter arose from her bed, made strong by the God of
          Israel. Nothing would content her until she had been outside into the
          street, and seen for herself whether the saving mark was over the door
          of her father's house. It was almost midnight, but by the light of the
          moon she looked, and no blood-mark was there! How great was her
          distress! "Father," she cried, "make haste and bring the basin." There
          it stood, filled with blood; for the Paschal Lamb had been slain. The
          father, at her entreaty, dashed the hyssop into it, struck the lintel
          and the two side-posts and shut the door, and as he did so, the
          midnight hour arrived. They were saved so as by fire. The daughter's
          obedient care and reverence of the Lord had warded off the sword of
          the destroyer. Oh that the holy anxiety of some one now present would
          work the like blessing for other households! Ask, dear child, ask the
          question, "Father, have you come to the blood of sprinkling? Is the
          blood of the Lamb above your head, between you and God? Is it on both
          sides of you, when you come in and go out?" O soul, be thus anxious
          about thyself, and rest not till thou hast by faith been purged with
          hyssop, and cleansed by the blood of the one sacrifice for sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The last part of our subject is this: WHAT THEN? According to our
          text, the blood of Jesus is the voice of the new dispensation. It is
          the blood which speaks, and it speaks better things than the blood of
          Abel. What then is our duty? How doth the apostle express our
          obligation? "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh."
        </p>
        <p>
          I would have a quarter of an hour's very quiet talk with you, without
          excitement or quibbling debate. Lend me your ears, for I speak in all
          love for your souls. I want, dear friends, that this great truth of
          atonement which I so often preach may have a fair hearing, and not be
          left to lie among the number of forgotten things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not refuse the voice of Jesus by cold indifference. God was made
          flesh, and dwelt among men, and in due time he took upon himself our
          sin, and suffered for it in his own body on the tree, that sin might
          be put away by the sacrifice of himself. By his death upon the cross
          our Lord made atonement for the sin of man, and those who believe in
          him are delivered from evil and its consequences. The main point is
          that Jesus died for us, the just for the unjust. His atoning blood has
          a voice: "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh." The text says:
          See to it; look to it; make sure of it; be careful about it. Do not
          miss the salvation of your Lord through neglect; for he who dies by
          neglecting the healing medicine will as surely perish as he who stabs
          himself. Be in earnest to accept the Savior: I beseech you so to do,
          for I am afraid that many refuse him that speaketh, because they never
          think of him, or of his sacrifice. It seems to me that if I were a
          young man I would give this matter very early notice. However deeply I
          might be engaged in business, I should feel that my first concern
          ought to be to set myself right with God. Other matters would be sure
          to drop into order if I could be right with the Lord of all. If I
          heard it said that salvation came by the blood of Christ, I think I
          should pull myself together and resolve to understand this singular
          statement. I would not let it go by me, but would endeavor to reach
          the bottom of it, and practically understand it. I would meditate much
          upon teaching so wonderful as this -- that the Son of God in man's
          stead honored the justice of God by death, and so put away sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was a youth I had a great longing to begin life on right
          principles: I longed to find deliverance from sin. I would wake up
          with the sun in summer time to read my Bible, and such books as
          Bunyan's "Grace Abounding," Baxter's "Call to the Unconverted,"
          Alleine's "Alarm," and Doddridge's "Rise and Progress of. Religion in
          the Soul." In these books I tried to spell out the way of salvation;
          but the chief thing I longed to know was, "How can man be just with
          God? How can God be just with man, and yet put away his sin?" Do you
          not think that these questions are of high importance? I beg that they
          may not have the cold shoulder from you. Give this question due space.
          I know that a great many things demand your attention nowadays; but I
          claim for this, which is the innermost revelation of God that it
          should have an early and earnest hearing. God incarnate in Christ
          Jesus bleeding and dying for human sin is a marvel of love too great
          to be passed over without thought. I pray you, therefore, "refuse not
          him that speaketh." Do not say, "I pray thee, have me excused." I do
          not suppose that you will become an infidel or act as a blasphemer
          towards this grand truth. I will not accuse you of denying the fact of
          the atonement; but my great fear is lest you should be indifferent to
          it. If it be so, that God himself has come to earth to bleed and die
          to save guilty man, it is the greatest, gladdest news that ever came
          to our poor erring race, and every member of that race should receive
          it with hopeful attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you resolve to study the doctrine, do not approach it with
          prejudice through misapprehension. Those that hate the gospel of
          Christ are very busy in caricaturing the doctrine of the atonement.
          They assert that we preach that God was not merciful by nature, but
          must needs be appeased by the blood of his own Son. They charge us
          with saying that Jesus by his death made God loving. We distinctly
          teach the very opposite of that statement. What we do say is this,
          that God is infinitely loving -- that, in fact, God is love; but that
          love does not cause him to be unjust or unholy; for that in the long
          run would not be love. God is the Judge of all the earth, and he must
          do right. The Lord, as the great moral governor, if he makes a law,
          and threatens a penalty, must execute that penalty, or else his law
          will lose its authority. If the penalty threatened be not executed,
          there is a tacit acknowledgment that it was threatened in error. Could
          you believe in a fallible God? The Lord has made a law which is
          perfect, and just, and good. Would you rather be without law? What
          reasonable person desires anarchy? He has backed up that law with a
          threatening. What is the use of a law if to break it involves no evil
          consequences? A government that never punishes offenders is no
          government at all. God, therefore, as moral ruler, must be just, and
          must display his indignation against wrong and evil of every kind. It
          is written on the conscience of men that sin must be punished. Would
          you have it go unpunished? If you are a just man, you would not. To
          meet the case, therefore, the Lord Jesus Christ, by himself bearing
          the penalty of death, has honored the divine law. He has shown to all
          intelligences that God will not wink at sin, that even his infinite
          mercy must not come in the way of his justice. This is the doctrine:
          do not listen to those who twist and pervert it. It is the love of God
          which has provided the great atonement by which, in a judgment better
          than ours, the law finds a glorious vindication, and the foundation of
          moral government is strengthened. Do consider this matter, and judge
          it fairly, with candid minds. We do assure you from God's Word that
          apart from the atonement of our Lord Jesus you can never be saved
          either from the guilt or power of evil. You will find no peace for
          your conscience that is worth having, no thorough and deep peace,
          except by believing in this atoning sacrifice; neither will you meet
          with a motive strong enough to rescue you from the bonds of iniquity.
          Therefore "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh." Hear, and your
          soul shall live. Cavil, and you will die in your sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not refuse the voice of the Lord Jesus by rejecting the principle
          of expiation. If God is content with this principle, it is not for us
          to raise objection. The Lord God is infinitely more concerned to fix
          matters on a right foundation than ever we can be, and if he feels
          that the sacrifice of Jesus meets the case at all points, why should
          we be dissatisfied with it? If there were a flaw in the proceedings
          his holy eyes would see it. He would not have delivered up his own Son
          to die unless that death would perfectly fulfill the design intended
          by it. A mistake so expensive he would never have perpetrated. Who are
          you to raise the question? If God is satisfied, surely you should be?
          To refuse the atonement because we are too wise to accept so simple a
          method of mercy is the utmost height of folly. What! will ye refuse
          him that speaketh because the present phase of human madness dares to
          dispute the divine way of human redemption? I pray you, do not so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more. Do not refuse this voice of mercy by preferring your own
          way of salvation. You have, no doubt, a way of salvation in your own
          mind, for few men have given up all hope. Perhaps your chosen hope is
          that you will be saved by doing your best. Alas! no man does his best;
          and the best acts of a rebel must be unaccepted of his king. So long
          as he is a rebel his acts are those of a rebel, and of no esteem with
          his prince. Perhaps your hope lies in saying so many prayers, and
          going to church, or attending chapel; or you are so unwise as to trust
          to a minister or priest. Now, we beseech you, hear the witness of God
          which he has given us in this book, and learn that other foundation
          can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ the
          righteous. There is one salvation, and there can be no other; all
          other hopes are lying vanities, and arrogant insults to Jesus. God
          hath set forth Christ to be a propitiation for sin. There is no other
          propitiation, or atonement, or way of acceptance; and if you reject
          this way, you must die in your sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot help it if you do not like this teaching, although I shall be
          grieved if you refuse it. I can only tell you the truth, and leave it
          with your own hearts. Do not wilfully refuse it. When I meet you face
          to face in that last day, to which we all must come, I shall not be
          clear of your blood unless I tell you what is assuredly the truth --
          that in the precious blood of Christ is the only cleansing from sin,
          and the only acceptance with God. By believing in Jesus, as slain for
          you, you shall be saved; but do what you may, pray as you may, fast as
          you may, give alms as you may, you shall not enter heaven by any other
          road. The way to glory is by the way of the cross. "Without shedding
          of blood there is no remission." Look to him whom you have pierced,
          and mourn for your sins. Look not to any other, for no other is
          needed, no other is provided, no other can be accepted. Jesus is the
          sole messenger of the covenant of life and peace. "See that ye refuse
          not him that speaketh."
        </p>
        <p>
          "See that ye refuse not." Then there is a choice about it. If you had
          never heard the gospel, you could not have refused it; but now that
          you have heard the message, it lies within your power, and it is an
          awfully dangerous power, to refuse him that speaketh. Oh, can you,
          will you, dare you refuse my bleeding Savior -- refuse the Lord of
          love? I see him now. The thorn-crown is about his brow. He is hanging
          on his cross expiring in unutterable pangs! Can you refuse him while
          he presents such a spectacle of sacrifice? His eyes are red with
          weeping; have you no tears for such sorrow? His cheeks are all
          distained with the brutal soldiers' spittle: have you no love and
          homage for him? His hands are fastened to the wood -- his feet the
          same: and there he hangs to suffer in the sinner's stead. Will you not
          yield yourselves to him? I could joyfully bow before that cross-foot
          to kiss his dear feet distained with blood. What a charm he has for
          me! And you -- do you refuse him?
        </p>
        <p>
          He is no mere man. It is God himself who hangs upon the cross. His
          body is that of a man, but it is in union with the Godhead. He who
          died at Calvary is God over all, and this makes his death so
          effectual. He whom you have offended, in order to be justly able to
          pardon you, hangs there and dies for you: and do you turn your back on
          him? O sirs, if you be wise you will come, as I said I fain would
          come, and kiss those bleeding feet, and look up and say, "My Lord, I
          am reconciled to thee -- how could I be otherwise? My enmity is dead.
          How can I be an enemy to him that died for me? In shame, and scorn,
          and misery, Jesus dies that I may live. O Lord Jesus, thou hast
          wrought in me, not reconciliation merely, but full submission and
          hearty love. I joy to sink myself in thee, and to be thine for ever."
          See that ye refuse not my Lord. May the sweet Spirit who loves the
          cross, and, like a dove, hovers round it now, descend upon you all who
          hear my message! May the Holy Ghost apply the blood of sprinkling to
          you; and may you feel that, instead of refusing him that speaketh, you
          rejoice in his name!
        </p>
        <p>
          When the text says, "See that ye refuse not," it tacitly and
          pleadingly says, "See that ye accept him." Dear hearers, I trust you
          will receive my Lord into your hearts. When we read of refusing, or
          receiving, we perceive an action of the will. Jesus must be willingly
          received: he will not force himself upon any man. Whosoever accepts
          Jesus is himself accepted of Jesus. Never was there a heart willing to
          receive him to whom Jesus denied himself. Never! But you must be
          willing and obedient. Grace works this in you; but in you this must
          be. Till the heart entertains Jesus gladly nothing is done. All that
          is short of a willing hearing of Jesus, and a willing acceptance of
          his great atonement, is short of eternal life. Say, wilt thou have
          this Savior, or dost thou decline his love? Wilt thou give him a cold
          refusal? Oh, do not so; but, on the contrary, throw open the doors of
          thy heart, and entreat thy Lord and Savior to come in.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not wonder that the Israelites asked that they might no longer
          hear the voice of thunder from the top of Sinai; it was too terrible
          for human ear; but you have no such excuse if you refuse him that
          speaketh; for Jesus speaks in notes more sweet than music, more tender
          than a mother's sonnet to her babe. Let me remind you, that he was
          wont to say, "come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and
          I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am
          meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls." He
          declared that all manner of sin and of blasphemy should be forgiven
          unto men. He stood and cried, on the last day of the feast, "If any
          man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink." I am telling you no
          fables; for Christ, who was born at Bethlehem and died on Calvary, by
          his own blood which he shed for many, assures you that there is
          forgiveness for every man of you who, confessing his sin, will come
          and put his trust in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh;" for though you hear only
          my poor feeble voice pleading with you, with an honest, loving heart
          at the back of it, yet God the Holy Ghost is speaking, and Jesus
          Christ himself is speaking to you. Refuse me if you please, but do not
          refuse my Lord. The blood of Jesus says, "I was poured out for the
          guilty. I was shed to manifest divine love. I am sprinkled to cleanse
          from sin." Each drop as it falls creates peace of heart. Stand where
          that blood is falling. Let it sprinkle you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the blood speaks. Will you not answer, "Lord, we come to thee,
          for thou hast drawn us. Thy wounds have wounded our hearts. Thy death
          has killed our enmity. Sprinkle us unto thyself. Bedew us with thy
          blood. Let us be accepted in the Beloved?" Amen. So may God hear us!
