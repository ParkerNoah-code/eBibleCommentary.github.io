          Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle; Harness the
          horses, and get up ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets;<br />Furbish
          the spears, put on the coats of mail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wherefore have I seen it? they are dismayed,<br />And are turned
          backward, and their mighty ones are beaten down, And are fled apace,
          and look not back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Terror is on every side, saith the LORD,<br />Let not the swift flee
          away, nor the mighty man escape: In the north by the river Euphrates
          have they stumbled and fallen.
        </p>
        <p>2</p>
        <p>
          Who is this that riseth up like the Nile,<br />Whose waters toss
          themselves like the rivers?<br />Egypt riseth up like the Nile,<br />And
          his waters toss themselves like the rivers;<br />And he saith, I will
          rise up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the
          inhabitants thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
          Go up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men go
          forth: Cush and Put, that handle the shield;<br />And the Ludim, that
          handle and bend the bow.
        </p>
        <p>
          For that day is a day of the Lord, the LORD of hosts, A day of
          vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: And the sword
          shall devour and be satiate,<br />And shall drink its fill of their
          blood:<br />For the Lord, the LORD of hosts hath a sacrifice<br />In
          the north country by the river Euphrates.
        </p>
        <p>3</p>
        <p>
          Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt: In vain
          dost thou use many medicines;<br />There is no healing for thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          The nations have heard of thy shame, and the earth is full of thy cry:
          For the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, They are fallen
          both of them together.
