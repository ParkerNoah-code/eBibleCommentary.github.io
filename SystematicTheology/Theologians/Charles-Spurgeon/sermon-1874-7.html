        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1190)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, August 30th, 1874, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies." --
          Song of Solomon 2:16.
        </p>
        <p>
          LAST SABBATH, in our morning's sermon, we began at the beginning and
          described the turning point in which the sinner sets his face towards
          his God, and for the first time gives practical evidence of spiritual
          life in his soul. He bestirs himself, he goes to his Father's house,
          and speedily is pressed to his Father's bosom, forgiven, accepted, and
          rejoiced over. This morning we are going far beyond that stage, to a
          position which I may call the very crown and summit of the spiritual
          life. We would conduct you from the door-step to the innermost
          chamber, from the outer court to the Holy of Holies, and we pray the
          Holy Spirit to enable each one of us who have entered in by Christ
          Jesus, the door, to pass boldly into the secret place of the
          tabernacles of the Host High, and sing with joyful heart the words of
          our text, "My beloved is mine, and I am his."
        </p>
        <p>"For he is mine and I am his,</p>
        <p>The God whom I adore;</p>
        <p>My Father, Savior, Comforter,</p>
        <p>Now and for evermore."</p>
        <p>
          The passage describes a high state of grace, and it is worthy of note
          that the description is full of Christ. This is instructive, for this
          is not an exceptional case, it is only one fulfillment of a general
          rule. Our estimate of Christ is the best garage of our spiritual
          condition; as the thermometer rises in proportion to the increased
          warmth of the air, so does our estimate of Jesus rise as our spiritual
          life increases in vigor and fervency. Tell me what you think of Jesus
          and I will tell you what to think of yourself. Christ us, yea, more
          than all when we are thoroughly sanctified and filled with the Holy
          Ghost. When pride of self fills up the soul, there is little room for
          Jesus; but when Jesus is fully loved, self is subdued, and sin driven
          out of the throne. If we think little of the Lord Jesus we have very
          great cause to account ourselves spiritually blind, and naked, and
          poor, and miserable. The rebel despises his lawful sovereign, but the
          favored courtier is enthusiastic in his praise. Christ crucified is
          the revealer of many hearts, the touchstone by which the pure gold and
          the counterfeit metal are discerned; his very name is as a refiner's
          fire and like fuller's soap; false professors cannot endure it, but
          true believers triumph therein. We are growing in grace when we grow
          in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Let everything
          else be gone, and let Christ fill up the entire space of our soul,
          then, and only then, are we rising out of the vanity of the flesh into
          the real life of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, the grandest facts in all the world to a truly spiritual man
          are not the rise and fall of empires, the marches of victory, or the
          desolations of defeat; he cares neither for crowns nor mitres, swords
          nor shields; his admiring gaze is wholly fixed upon Christ and his
          cross and cause. To him Jesus is the center of history, the soul and
          core of providence. He desires no knowledge so much as that which
          concerns his Redeemer and Lord; his science deals with what Jesus is
          and what he is to be, what he has done, what he is doing, and what he
          will do. The believer is mainly anxious as to how Jesus can be
          glorified, and how sinners can be brought to know him. That which
          concerns the honor of Jesus is our chief concern from day to day; as
          for other matters let the Lord do as he wills with them, only let
          Jesus Christ be magnified, and all the rest of the world's story has
          small significance for us. The Beloved is the head and front, the
          heart and soul of the Christian's delight when his heart is in its
          best state. Our text is the portrait of a heavenly-minded child of
          God, or rather, it is the music of his well stringed harp when love as
          minstrel touches the tenderest chords: "My beloved is mine, and I am
          his; he feedeth among the lilies."
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall note then, first, that here is a delighting to have Christ;
          secondly, a delighting to belong to Christ; and thirdly, a delighting
          at the very thought of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, here is A DELIGHTED TO HAVE CHRIST. "My beloved is mine."
          The spouse makes this the first of her joy notes, the cornerstone of
          her peace, the fountain of her bliss, the crown of her glory. Observe
          here that where such an expression is truthfully used the existence of
          the Beloved is matter of fact. Scepticism, and questioning have no
          place with those who thus sing. There are dreamers now-adays who cast
          doubt on everything; taking to themselves the name of philosophers,
          and professing to know something of science, they make statements
          worthy only of idiots, and demand for their self-evidently false
          assertions the assent of rational men. The word "philosopher" will
          soon come to mean a lover of ignorance, and the term "a scientific
          man" will be understood as meaning a fool, who has said in his heart
          there is no God. Such attacks upon the eternal verities of our holy
          faith can have no effect upon hearts enamoured of the Son of God, for,
          dwelling in his immediate presence, they have passed the stage of
          doubt, left the region of questioning far behind, and in this matter
          have entered into rest. The power of love has convinced us; to
          entertain a doubt as to the reality and glory of our Well-beloved
          would be torment to us, and therefore love has cast it out. We use no
          perhapses, buts, or ifs concerning our Beloved, but we say positively
          that he is, and that he is ours. We believe that we have better
          evidence of his being, power, Godhead, and love to us than can be
          given for any other fact. So far from being abashed by the cavils of
          sceptics, or quailing beneath the question, "Is there such a Beloved?"
          we are not careful to answer in this matter, for we know that there
          is; our love laughs at the question, and does not condescend to answer
          it save by bidding those who seriously inquire to "come and see" for
          themselves. We have ever found, beloved, that when a time of chilling
          doubt has come over us -- and such ague fits will come -- we have only
          to return to meditations upon Jesus and he becomes his own evidence by
          making our hearts burn within us with love of his character and
          person, and then doubt is doomed. We do not slay our unbelief by
          reason, but we annihilate it by affection. The influence of love to
          Jesus upon the soul is so magical -- I wish I had a better word -- so
          elevating, so ravishing, so transporting, it gives such a peace, and
          withal inspires such holy and lofty aspirations, that the effect
          proves the cause. That which is holy is true, and that which is true
          cannot rise out of that which is false. We may safely judge a tree by
          its fruit, and a doctrine by its result: that which produces in us
          self-denial, purity, righteousness, and truth, cannot itself be false,
          and yet the love of Jesus does this beyond everything else. There must
          be truth for a cause where truth is the effect; and thus love, by the
          savor which it spreads over the soul by contemplation of Christ, puts
          its foot upon the neck of doubt and triumphantly utters bold,
          confident declarations, which reveal the full assurance of faith.
          New-born love to Jesus, while yet in its cradle, like a young
          Hercules, takes the serpents of doubt and strangles them. He who can
          say from his heart "My Beloved," is the man who is in the way to
          confirmed faith. Love cannot, will not doubt; it casts away the
          crutches of argument and flies on the wings of conscious enjoyment,
          singing her nuptial hymn, "My Beloved is mine, and I am his."
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case before us the love of the heavenly-minded one is perceived
          and acknowledged by herself. "My beloved," saith she; it is no latent
          affection, she knows that she loves him, and solemnly avows it. She
          does not whisper, "I hope I love the peerless one," but she sings, "My
          beloved." There is no doubt in her soul about her passion for the
          altogether lovely one. Ah, dear friends, when you feel the flame of
          love within your soul, and give it practical expression, you will no
          longer inquire, "Do I love the Lord or no? "Then your inner
          consciousness will dispense with evidences. Those are dark days when
          we require evidences; well may we then fast, for the Bridegroom is not
          with us; but when he abides with us, enjoyment of his fellowship
          supersedes all evidences. I want no evidence to prove that food is
          sweet when it is still in my month; I want no evidence of the
          existence of the sun when I am basking in his beams, and enjoying his
          light, and even so we need no evidence that Jesus is precious to us
          when, like a bundle of myrrh, he perfumes our bosom. We are anxious
          doubters as to our safety, and questioners of our own condition,
          because we are not living with Jesus as we ought to be; but when he
          brings us to his banqueting house, and we walk in the light as he is
          in the light, we have fellowship with him and with the Father, and
          then we believe and are sure, and our love to Jesus is indisputable,
          because it burns within too fervently to be denied. Why, when a
          Christian is in a right state, his love to Jesus is the mightiest
          force in his nature, it is an affection which, like Aaron's rod,
          swallows up all other rods; it is the mainspring of his action, and
          sways his whole body, soul, and spirit. As the wind sweeps over all
          the strings of the Alolian harp, and causes them all to vibrate, so
          does the love of Jesus move every power and passion of our soul, and
          we feel in our entire being that our Beloved is indeed ours, and that
          we love him with all our hearts. Here, then, is the Beloved realized,
          and our love realised too.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the pith of the text lies here, our possession of him is proven,
          we know it, and we know it on good evidence -- "My beloved is mine."
          You know it is not a very easy thing to reach this point. Have you
          ever thought of the fact that to claim the Lord and call him "my God,"
          is a very wonderful thing? Who was the first man in the Old Testament
          who is recorded as saying "My God"? Was it not Jacob, when he slept at
          Bethel, and saw the ladder which reached to heaven? Even after that
          heavenly vision it took him touch effort to reach to "My God." He said
          "If God will be with me and will keep me in the way that I go, and
          will give me bread to eat and raiment to put On, so that I come again
          to my father's house in peace, then shall the Lord be my God." Only
          after long experience of divine goodness could he climb up to the
          height of saying "My God." And who is the first man in the New
          Testament that calls Jesus "My Lord and My God"? It was Thomas, and he
          must needs have abundant proofs before he can speak thus: "Except I
          see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the
          print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not
          believe." Only when he had received such proofs could he exclaim "My
          Lord and my God." Blessed are they who reach it by simpler faith, who
          have not seen and yet have believed. "My Beloved" is a strong
          expression. "Beloved" is sweet, but "MY Beloved" is sweetest of all.
          If you think of it, it is no little thing to claim God as ours, to
          claim Jesus the Beloved as ours, yea, to put it in the singular, and
          call him mine; and yet, when the believer's heart is in the right
          condition, he makes the claim, and is warranted in so doing; for Jesus
          Christ is the portion of all believers. His Father gave him to us, and
          he has given himself to us. Jesus was made over to every believing
          soul, as his personal possession, in the eternal covenant ordered in
          all things and sure; Jesus actually gave himself for us in his
          incarnation, becoming bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh; he has
          made himself ours by his passion and death, loving us and giving
          himself for us, to save us from our sins; he has also given us power
          to appropriate him by the gracious gift of faith, by which we are in
          very deed married to him, and are enabled to call him the husband of
          our souls, who is ours to have and to hold, for better for worse, for
          life and for death, by a bond of marriage union which neither death
          nor hell, time nor eternity, can break. Jesus is ours by the promise,
          the covenant, and oath of God; a thousand assurances and pledges,
          bonds and seals, secure him to us as our portion and everlasting
          heritage.
        </p>
        <p>
          This precious possession becomes to the believer his sole treasure.
          "My beloved is mine," saith he, and in that sentence he has summed up
          all his wealth. He does not say "My wife, my children, my home, my
          earthly comforts are mine." He is almost afraid to say so, because
          while he is yet speaking, they may cease to be his: the beloved wife
          may sicken before his eyes, the child may need a tiny coffin, the
          friend may prove a traitor, and the riches may take to themselves
          wings, therefore the wise man does not care to say too positively that
          anything here below is his; indexed, he feels that in very truth they
          are not his, but only lent to him "to be returned anon"; but the
          Beloved is his own, and his possession of him is most firm. Neither
          doth the believer when his soul is in the best state so much rejoice
          even in his spiritual privileges as in the Lord from whom they come.
          He has righteousness, wisdom, sanctification and redemption; he has
          both grace and glory secured to him, but he prefers rather to claim
          the fountain than the streams. He clearly sees that these choice
          mercies are only his because they are Christ's, and only his because
          Christ is his. Oh, what would all the treasures of the covenant be to
          us if it were possible to have them without Christ? Their very sap and
          sweetness would be gone. Having our Beloved to be ours, we have all
          things in him, and therefore our main treasure, yea, our sole
          treasure, is our Beloved. O ye saints of God, was there ever
          possession like this? You have your beloveds, ye daughters of earth,
          but what are your beloveds compared with ours? He is the Son of God
          and the Son of Man! The darling of heaven and the delight of earth!
          The lily of the valley and the rose of Sharon! Perfect in his
          character, powerful in his atoning death, mighty in his living plea!
          He is such a lover that all earthly loves put together are not worthy
          to touch the hem of his garment, or loose the latchet of his shoes. He
          is so dear, so precious, that words cannot describe him nor pencil
          depict him, but this we will say of him, he is "the chief among ten
          thousand, and the altogether lovely," and he is ours. Do you wonder
          that we glory in this fact, and count this the crowning delight of our
          lives, "My beloved is mine"?
        </p>
        <p>
          The very tenure upon which we hold this priceless possession is a
          matter to glory in. O worldlings, you cannot hold your treasures as we
          hold ours. If you knew all, you would never say of anything, "It is
          mine," for your holding is too precarious to constitute possession. It
          is yours till that frail thread of life shall snap, or that bubble of
          time shall burst. You have only a leasehold of your treasures,
          terminable at the end of one frail life; whereas ours is an eternal
          freehold, an everlasting entail. "My beloved is mine," -- I cannot
          lose him, nor can he be taken from me; he is mine for ever, for "who
          shall separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
          Lord? "So that, while the possession is rare, the tenure is rare also,
          and it the life of our life, and the light of our delight that we can
          sing --
        </p>
        <p>"Yea, thou art mine, my blessed Lord,</p>
        <p>O my Beloved, thou art mine!</p>
        <p>And, purchased with thy precious blood,</p>
        <p>My God and Savior, I am thine.</p>
        <p>"MY CHRIST! Oh, sing it in the heavens,</p>
        <p>Let every angel lift his voice;</p>
        <p>Sound with ten thousand harps his praise,</p>
        <p>With me, ye heavenly hosts, rejoice.</p>
        <p>"The gift unspeakable is given,</p>
        <p>The grace of God has made him mine;</p>
        <p>And, now, before both earth and heaven,</p>
        <p>Lord, I will own that I am thine."</p>
        <p>
          Now, beloved friends, I cannot talk about this as I feel, I can only
          give you hints of that which fills me to the full with joy. I beg you
          to contemplate for a single moment the delight which is stored up in
          this fact, that the blessed Son of God, the "brightness of the
          Father's glory," is all our own. Whatever else we may have, or may not
          have, he is ours. I may not exhibit in my character all the grace I
          could wish, but "My beloved is mine"; I may have only one talent, but
          "My beloved is mine"; I may be very poor and very obscure, but "My
          beloved is mine"; I may have neither health nor wealth, but "My
          beloved is mine"; I may not be what I want to be, but "My beloved is
          mine." Yea, he is altogether mine, his Godhead and his manhood, his
          life, his death, his attributes, and prerogatives, yea, all he is, all
          he was, all he ever will be, all he has done, and all he ever will do,
          is mine. I possess not a portion in Christ, but the whole of him. All
          his saints own him, but I own him as much as if there were never
          another saint to claim him. Child of God, do you see this? In other
          inheritances, if there are many heirs, there is so much the less for
          each, but in this great possession every one who has Christ has a
          whole Christ all to himself, from the head of much fine gold, down to
          his legs, which are as pillars of marble. The whole of his boundless
          heart of love, his whole arm of infinite might, and his whole head of
          matchless wisdom, -- all is for thee, beloved. Whoever thou mayst be,
          if thou dost indeed trust in Jesus, he is all thine own.
        </p>
        <p>
          My beloved is all mine, and absolutely mine; not mine to look at and
          talk about merely, but mine to trust in, to speak to, to depend upon,
          to fly to in every troublous hour, yea, mine to feed upon, for his
          flesh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed. Our beloved is
          not ours only to use in certain ways, but ours outright, without
          restriction. I may draw what I will from him, and both what I take and
          what I leave are mine. He himself in his ever glorious person is mine,
          and mine always; mine when I know it, and mine when I do not know it,
          mine when I am sure of it, and mine when I doubt it; mine by day, and
          mine by night; mine when I walk in holiness, ay, and mine when I sin,
          for "if any man sin we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
          the righteous." He is mine on the hill Mizar, and mine in the
          swellings of Jordan; mine by the grave where I bury those I love, mine
          when I shall be buried there myself, mine when I rise again; mine in
          judgment, and mine in glory; for ever mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note well that it is written, "My beloved is mine," in the singular.
          He is yours, I am glad of it; but still to me it is most sweet that he
          is mine. It is well to bless God that others have a possession in
          Christ, but what would that avail if we were strangers to him
          ourselves? The marrow and the fatness lie in the personal pronoun
          singular, "My beloved is mine. "I am so glad that Jesus loves me." Oh
          for a blessed grip with both hands on such a Christ as this! Observe
          well that he is ours as our Beloved, so that he is ours as whatever
          our love makes of him. Our love can never praise him enough, or speak
          well enough of him, she thinks all descriptions fall short of his
          deservings; well, then, Jesus is ours at his best; if we think him so
          glorious, he is ours in all that glory. Our love says that he is a
          fair, lovely, sweet, and precious Christ, and let us be sure that,
          however lovely, sweet, and precious he is, he is all ours. Our love
          says there is none like him, he is King of kings and Lord of lords, he
          is the ever blessed; well, as the King of kings and Lord of lords he
          is yours. You cannot think too much of him, but when you think your
          best he is yours at that best. He has not a glory so high that it is
          not yours, nor a lustre so brilliant that it is not yours. He is my
          beloved, and I would fain extol him, but never can I get beyond this
          golden circle, when I most extol him he is still mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, then, is the basis of Christian life, the foundation on which it
          rests: to know that most surely Christ is altogether ours is the
          beginning of wisdom, the source of strength, the star of hope, the
          dawn of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second portion of the text deals with DELIGHTING TO BELONG TO
          CHRIST. "I am his." This is as sweet as the former sentence. I would
          venture to put a question to each loving wife here present -- when you
          were married which was the sweetest thought to you, that you were your
          husband's, or that he was yours? Why, you feel that neither sentence
          would be sweet alone: they are necessary to each other. Ask any fond,
          loving heart which of these declarations could best be parted with,
          and they will tell you that neither can be given us. Christ is mine,
          but if I were not his it would be a sorry case, and if I were his and
          he were not mine it would be a wretched business. These two things are
          joined together with diamond rivets -- "My beloved is mine, and I am
          his." Put the two together, and you have reached the summit of
          delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          That we are his is a fact that may be prove -- yea, it should need no
          proving, but be manifest to all that "I am his." Certainly we are his
          by creation: he who made us should have us. We are his because his
          Father gave us to him, and we are his because he chose us. Creation,
          donation, election are his triple hold upon us. We are his because he
          bought us with his blood, his because he called us by his grace, his
          because he is married to us, and we are his spouse. We are his,
          moreover, to our own consciousness, because we have heartily, from the
          inmost depths of our being, given ourselves up to him, bound by love
          to him for ever. We feel we must have Christ, and be Christ's, or die
          -- "For me to live is Christ." Brethren and sisters, mind you attend
          to this clause, I am sure you will if the former one is true to you.
          If you can say, "My beloved is mine," you will be sure to add, "I am
          his, I must be his, I will be his: I live not unless I am his, for I
          count that wherein I am not his I am dead, and I only live wherein I
          live to him." My very soul is conscious that I am his.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now this puts very great honor upon as. I have known the time when I
          could say "My beloved is mine" in a very humble trembling manner, but
          I did not dare to add "I am his" because I did not think I was worth
          his having. I dared not hope that "I am his" would ever be written in
          the same book side by side with "My beloved is mine." Poor sinner,
          first lay hold on Jesus, and then you will discover that Jesus values
          you. You will prize him first, and then you will find out that he
          prizes you, and that though you do not feel worthy to be flung on a
          dunghill, yet Jesus has put a value upon you, saying "Since thou wert
          precious in my sight thou hast been honorable, and I have loved thee."
          It is no small joy to know that we poor sinners are worth Christ's
          having, and that he has even said, "They shall be mine in the day when
          I make up my jewels."
        </p>
        <p>
          This second part of the text is true as absolutely as the first. "I am
          his" -- not my goods only, nor my time, nor my talents, nor what I can
          spare, but "I am his." I fear that some Christians have never
          understood this. They give the Lord a little of their surplus, which
          they never miss. The poor widow who gave all her living, had the true
          idea of her relation to her Lord. She would have put herself into the
          treasury if she could, for she felt "I am his." As for myself, I wish
          I could be dropped bodily through the little slit of Christ's treasure
          box, and be in his casket for ever, never to be heard of any more as
          my own, but to be wholly my Lord's. Paul desired to spend and be
          spent. It is not easy to do those two things distinctly with money,
          for when you spend a thing it is spent at one and the same time, but
          the apostle meant that he would spend himself by activity, and then
          when he could do no more, he would be glad to be spent by passive
          endurance for Christ's sake. The believer feels that he belongs to
          Jesus absolutely; let the Lord employ him as he may, or try him as he
          pleases; let him take away all earthly friends from him or surround
          him with comforts; let him either depress him or exalt him, let him
          use him for little things or great things, or not use him at all, but
          lay him on the shelf; it is enough that the Lord does it, and the true
          heart is content, for it truthfully confesses, "I am his. I have no
          mortgage or lien upon myself, so that I can call a part of my being my
          own, but I am absolutely and unreservedly my Lord's sole property." Do
          you feel this, brethren and sisters? I pray God you may.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blessed be God, this is true evermore -- "I am his," his to-day, in
          the house of worship, and his to-morrow in the house of business; his
          as a singer in the sanctuary, and his as a toiler in the workshop; his
          when I am preaching, and equally his when I am walking the streets;
          his while I live, his when I die; his when my soul ascends and my body
          lies mouldering in the grave; the whole personality of my manhood is
          altogether his for ever and for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          This belonging to the Well-beloved is a matter of fact and practice,
          not a thing to be talked about only, but really to be acted on. I am
          treading on tender ground now, but I would to God that every Christian
          could really say this without lying: "I do live unto Christ in all
          things, for I am his. When I rise in the morning I wake up as his,
          when I sit down to a meal I eat as his, and drink as his. I eat, and
          drink, and sleep unto the Lord, in everything giving thanks unto him.
          It is blessed even to sleep as the Lord's beloved, to dream as his
          Abrahams and Jacobs do, to awake at night and sing like David, and
          then drop off to "sleep in Jesus." "It is a high condition," say you.
          I grant it, but it is where we ought to abide. The whole of our time
          and energy should be consecrated by this great master principle, "I am
          his." Can you say it? Never rest till you can. And if you can,
          beloved, it involves great privilege. "I am his," then am I honored by
          having such an owner. If a horse or a sheep is said to belong to the
          Queen, everybody thinks much of it: now you are not the Queen's, but
          you are the Lord's, and that is far more. Through belonging to Christ
          you are safe, for he will surely keep his own. He will not lose his
          own sheep, he paid too dear a price for them to lose them. Against all
          the powers of earth and hell the Redeemer will hold his own and keep
          them to the end. If you are his he will provide for you. A good
          husband careth for his spouse, and even thus the Lord Jesus Christ
          cares for those who are betrothed unto him. You will be perfected too,
          for whatever Christ has he will make worthy of himself and bring it to
          glory. It is because we are his that we shall get to heaven, for he
          has said, "Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me be
          with me where I am." Because they are his he would have them with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, give your thoughts licence to wonder that any one of us should be
          able to say, "I am his." "I who used to be so giddy and thought" less,
          So sceptical, and perhaps profane, I am his." Ay, and some of you can
          say, "I who used to be passionate and proud, I who was a drunkard, I
          whose lips were black with blasphemy, I am his." Glory he unto thee, O
          Jesus Christ, for this, that thou hast taken up such worthless things
          as we are and made us thine. No longer do we belong to this present
          evil world, we live for the world to come. We do not even belong to
          the church, so as to make it our master; we are part of the flock, but
          like all the rest we belong to the Great Shepherd. We will not give
          ourselves up to any party, or become the slave of any denomination,
          for we belong to Christ. We do not belong to sin, or self, or Satan;
          we belong entirely, exclusively, and irrevocably to the Lord Jesus
          Christ. Another master waits upon us and asks us to give our energies
          to his services, but our answer is, "I am already engaged." "How is
          that?" "I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus, and therefore
          from henceforth trouble me no more." "But can you not serve me in
          part?" "No, sir, I cannot serve two masters; I am not like a man who
          can do as he pleases, I have no time to call my own." "How is that?"
          "I belong to Christ, I am wholly his. If there is anything to be done
          for him I am his man to the best of my ability; I decline no service
          to which he calls me, but I can serve no other Lord." Lord Jesus, help
          each one of us now to say --
        </p>
        <p>"I am thine, and thine alone,</p>
        <p>This I gladly, fully own;</p>
        <p>And in all my works and ways,</p>
        <p>Only now would seek thy praise."</p>
        <p>
          III. To conclude: the saint feels DELIGHT IN THE VERY THOUGHT OF
          CHRIST. "He feedeth among the lilies." When we love any persons, and
          we are away from home, we delight to think of them, and to remember
          what they are doing. You are a husband travailing in a foreign land;
          this morning you said to yourself, "At this time they are just getting
          up at home." Perhaps the time is different, for you are in another
          longitude, and you say to yourself, "Ah, now the dear children are
          just getting ready to go to the Sabbath-school;" and by-and-by you
          think they are at dinner. So delight in the thought of Christ made the
          church say, "He feedeth among the lilies." She was pleased to think of
          where he was and what he was doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, where is Jesus? What are these lilies? Do not these lilies
          represent the pure in heart, with whom Jesus dwells? The spouse used
          the imagery which her Lord had put into her mouth. He said "As the
          lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters," and she
          appropriates the symbol to all the saints. A preacher who is great at
          spiritualizing has well said on this verse, "The straight stalk,
          standing up erect from the earth, its flowers as high from the ground
          as possible, do they not tell us of heavenly-mindedness? Do they not
          seem to say, set your affection on things above, not on things on the
          earth'? And if the spotless snow of the leaves teaches us of grace,
          then the gold of the anthers tells us of that crown which shall be the
          reward of grace." The violet and the primrose in spring nestle close
          to the earth, as if in sympathy with her chill condition, but the lily
          lifts up itself towards heaven in sympathy with the summer's light and
          splendor. The lily is frail, and such are the saints of God; were not
          Jesus among them to protect them the wild beast would soon tread them
          down. Frail as they are, they are surpassingly lovely, and their
          beauty is not that which is made with hands. It is a beauty put upon
          them by the Lord, for "they toil not, neither do they spin, yet
          Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these." The
          saints work not for life, and spin no righteousness of their own, and
          yet the royal righteousness which adorns them far surpasses all that
          wisdom could devise or wealth procure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where, then, is my Lord to-day? He is up and away, among the lilies of
          Paradise. In imagination I see those stately rows of milkwhite lilies
          growing no longer among thorns: lilies which are never soiled with the
          dust of earth, which for ever glisten with the eternal dews of
          fellowship, while their roots drink in unfading life from the river of
          the water of life which waters the garden of the Lord. There is Jesus!
          Can you see him? He is fairer even than the lilies which bow their
          heads around him. But he is here too where we are, like lilies which
          have scarce opened yet, lily buds as yet, but still watered by the
          same river, and yielding in our measure the same perfume. O ye lilies
          of Christ's own planting, he is among you; Jesus is in this house
          to-day, the unction which has made his garments so fragrant is
          discerned among us.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what is he doing among the lilies? It is said, "He feedeth among
          the lilies." He is feeding himself, not on the lilies, but among them.
          Our Lord finds solace among his people. His delights are with the sons
          of men; he joys to see the graces of his people, to receive their
          love, and to discern his own image in their faces. As he said to the
          woman of Samaria, "Give me to drink," so does he say to each one of
          his people, "Give me to drink," and he is refreshed by their loving
          fellowship. But the text means that he is feeding his people. He
          feedeth that part of his flock redeemed by blood of which we read that
          "the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and
          shall lead them into living fountains of waters." Nor does he forget
          that part of his bock which is in the low lands of earth, but he gives
          them also their portion of food. He has fed us this morning, for he is
          the good Shepherd, and leaves none of his sheep to famish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then what shall I do? Well, I will abide among the lilies. His saints
          shall be my companions. Where they flourish I will try to grow. I will
          be often in their assemblies. Ay, and I will be a lily too. By faith I
          will neither toil nor spin in a legal fashion, but I will live by
          faith upon the Son of God, rooted in him. I would be pure in life, and
          I would have the golden anther of looking to the recompense of the
          reward. I would lift up my soul aloft" towards heaven as the lily
          lifts up its flower. Jesus will come and feed by my side if I am a
          lily, and even I may yield him some pleasure by my humble gratitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, this is a choice subject, but it is more sweet as a matter of
          fact than mere hearing can make it. "He feedeth among the lilies."
          This is our joy, that Christ is in his church, and the pith of all I
          want to say is this; never think of yourself or of the church apart
          from Jesus. The spouse says, "My beloved is mine, and I am his", she
          weaves the two into one. The cause of the church is the cause of
          Christ; the work of God will never be accomplished by the church apart
          from Christ, her power lies in his being in her midst. He feedeth
          among the lilies, and therefore those lilies shall never be destroyed,
          but their sweetness shall make fragrant all the earth. The church of
          Christ, working with her Lord, must conquer, but never if she tries to
          stand alone or to compass any end apart from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for each one of us personally, let us not think of ourselves apart
          from Christ, nor of Christ apart from us. Let George Herbert's prayer
          be ours.
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, be mine still, still make me thine,</p>
        <p>Or rather make nor mine nor thine."</p>
        <p>
          Let mine melt into thine. Oh, to have joint stock with Christ, and to
          trade under one name; to be married to Christ and lose our old name,
          and wast his name, and say, "I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in
          me." As the wife is lost in the husband, and the stone in the
          building, and the branch in the vine, and the member in the head, we
          would be so amalgamated with Christ, and have such fellowship with him
          that there shall be no more mine nor thine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last of all, poor sinner, you will say, "There is nothing in all this
          for me," and I should not like to send you away without a word. You
          are saying "This is a day of good tidings, but it is only for God's
          own people." I beg you to read through the first and second chapters
          of the Song, and see who it was that said, "My beloved is mine,"
          because I should not wonder but what you are very like her. She was
          one who confessed, "I am black", and so are you. Perhaps grace will,
          one of these days, help you to say, "I am comely." She was one with
          whom her mother's children were angry -- perhaps you, too, are a
          speckled bird. She had done servile work, for they made her a keeper
          of the vineyards. I should not wonder but what you are doing servile
          work, too, trying to save yourself instead of accepting the salvation
          which Jesus has already wrought out for sinners. So it came to pass
          that she became very sorrowful and passed through a winter of rain and
          cold. Perhaps you are there; and yet you know she came out of it her
          winter was past, and the birds began to sing. She had been hidden in
          the secret places of the stairs, as you are now; but she was called
          out from the dust and cobwebs to see the face of her Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing I wish to whisper in your ears -- she was in the clefts of
          the rock. O soul, if thou canst but get there, if thou canst shelter
          in the riven side of our Beloved, that deep gash of the spear from
          which flowed blood and water, "to be of sin the double cure"; if thou
          canst get there, I say, though thou be black and grimed with sin, and
          an accursed sinner, only fit to be a firebrand in hell, yet shalt
          thou, even thou, be able to sing with all the rapture of the liveliest
          saint on earth, and one day with all the transport of the brightest
          ones above, "My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the
          lilies." There, go your way with those silver bells ringing in your
          ears; they ring a marriage peal to saints, but they ring also a cheery
          invitation to sinners, and this is the tune they are set to -- Come
          and welcome! Come and welcome! Come and welcome! Sinner, come! God
          bless you, for Jesus' sake. Amen.
