        <p>A Sermon</p>

          "Jesus saith unto them, my meat is to do the will of him that sent me,
          and to finish his work." -- John 4:34.
        </p>
        <p>
          IT IS PECULIARLY PLEASING to the Christian to observe the interest
          which God the Father takes in the work of salvation. In our earlier
          days of childhood in grace, we conceived the idea that God the Father
          was only made propitious to us through the atonement of Christ that
          Jesus was the Savior, and that the Father was rather an austere Judge
          than a tender friend. But since then, we have learned the Father
          through the Son: for it was not possible we could come unto the Father
          except through Jesus Christ. But, now, having seen Christ, we have
          seen the Father also, and from henceforth, we both know the Father,
          and have seen him, since we know the love of Christ, and have felt it
          shed abroad in our hearts. It is always refreshing then, to the
          enlightened Christian, to call to mind the intense interest which the
          Father takes in the work of salvation. Here you find in this verse it
          is three times hinted at. Salvation-work is called the Father's will.
          "It is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of
          these little ones should perish;" but more, it is his will that his
          chosen, the blood-bought ones of Christ, should every one of them be
          redeemed from the ruins of the fall, and brought safely home to their
          Father's house. Note, again, we are told that Jesus was sent of the
          Father. Here, again, you see the Father's interest. It is true that
          Jesus rent himself away from the glories of heaven, from the
          felicities of blessedness, and voluntarily descended to the scorn, the
          shame, and spitting of this lower world. But, yet his Father had a
          part therein. He gave up his only begotten Son; he withheld not the
          darling of his bosom, but sent away his well-beloved, and sent him
          down with messages of love to man. Jesus Christ comes willingly, but
          still he comes by his Father's appointment and sending. A third hint
          is also given us. Salvation is here called God's work: "It is my meat
          to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work." We know
          that when this world was made, the Father did not make it without
          reference to the Spirit, for "the Spirit of God moved upon the face of
          the waters," brooded over chaos, and brought order out of confusion.
          Nor did he make it without the Son; for we are told by John the
          Apostle, "Without him was not anything made that was made." Yet, at
          the same time, creation was the Father's work. So also is it in
          salvation; the Father does not save without the Spirit, for "the
          Spirit quickeneth whom he will." He doth not save without the Son, for
          it is through the merit of the Redeemer's death that we are delivered
          from the demerit of our iniquity. But, notwithstanding this, God the
          Father is the worker of salvation as much as he is the worker of
          creation. Let us look up then, with eyes of delight, to our reconciled
          God and Father. O Lord our GOD, thou art not an angry one! Thou art
          not an austere ruler! "Thou art not merely the Judge but thou art the
          grand patriarch of thy people! Thou art their great friend! Thou
          lovest them better than thou didst thy Son! For thou didst not spare
          him -- thou didst send him down to suffer and to die, that thou
          mightest bring thy children home. "Glory be unto the Father, and to
          the Son, and to the Holy Ghost; as it was in the beginning, is now,
          and ever shall be, world without end."
        </p>
        <p>
          The particular contemplation of this morning will be however, to
          describe Christ Jesus as he manifests himself as doing his Father's
          will, and finishing his Father's work. Our Lord and Master had but one
          thought, but one wish, but one aim. He concentrated his whole soul,
          gathered up the vast floods of his mighty powers, and sent them in one
          channel, rushing towards one great end: "My meat is to do the will of
          him that sent me, and to finish his work."
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In bringing out the great truth of Christ's entire devotedness to
          the work of salvation -- a devotedness so great that he could say,
          "The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up," -- I shall want to call
          your attention first of all to the fact, verified be the gospels, that
          his soul was in all that he did. Mark our Master when he goes about
          doing good. The task is not irksome to him. There are some men who if
          they distribute to the poor, or if they comfort the fatherless, do it
          with such reserve with such coldness of spirit, that you can perceive
          that it is but the shell of the man that acts, and not the man's whole
          soul. But see our divine Lord. Wherever he walks, you see his whole
          self in flame. his whole being at work. Not a single power slumbers,
          but the whole man is engaged. How much at ease he seems among his poor
          fishermen! You do not discover that his thoughts are away in the halls
          of kings; but he is a fellow with them, bone of their bone and flesh
          of their flesh. He walks in the midst of publicans and harlots, and he
          is not ill at ease; not like one who is condescending to do a work
          which he feels to be beneath him; he is pleased with it, his whole
          soul is in it. Mark how he takes the little children on his knee, and
          though his disciples would put them away, yet his whole spirit is set
          truly with the poor, with the sinful, whom he came to save, that he
          says, "Suffer the little children to come unto me, for of such is the
          kingdom of heaven." Look up into that face, and there is a
          whole-soured man there; not one whose thoughts are set on dignity and
          power, and who is schooling himself down, toning down his mind to the
          circle in which he moves, as a matter of constraint and duty. His
          vocation becomes his delight. His Father's service is his element. He
          is never happy when he is out of it. He casts his whole being, his
          whole spirit, into the work of man's redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. As a further proof of his devotedness, you will observe that
          whatever a man takes to heart as being the object of his life, it
          always makes him glad when he sees it succeeding. How you notice in
          our Savior's life, that when he goes into a pharisee's house to eat
          bread he always seems under constraint. In any chapter which records
          what Jesus said in the house of a pharisee there is a want of
          vivacity. He speaks solemnly, but evidently his spirit is spell-bound,
          he is unhappy. He knows that he is watched by cavillers who resist his
          good work, and he there saith but very little, or else his discourse
          hath but little joy and brilliance therein. But see him among
          publicans; when he is sitting down with Zaccheus, or when he is come
          into some poor man's house and is sitting down to his ordinary meal;
          there is Jesus Christ with His eyes flashing, his lips pouring forth
          eloquence, and his whole soul at ease. "Now," says he, "I am at home;
          here is my work; here are the people among whom I shall succeed." How
          the man snaps his chain! You see the Lord Jesus Christ as the
          child-man, no more restraining himself before the watchers, but
          speaking out of his full soul all that his heart thinks and feels. Now
          you generally know when a man's heart is in his work, by the joy he
          feels in it. You see some preachers go up into their pulpits as though
          they were going to be roasted at the stake; and they read their
          sermons through as if they were making their last dying speech and
          confession. What do you think they call it? -- why, doing their duty.
          True ministers call preaching pleasure, not duty. It is a delight to
          stand up to tell to others the way of salvation and to magnify Christ.
          But mere hirelings cannot go higher than the idea of doing their duty
          when they are telling out this glorious tale. Jesus Christ was none of
          these. "My meat is" he said, "to do the will of him that sent me." The
          only times that Jesus ever smiled and rejoiced are the times when he
          was in the midst of poor sinners. At that time "Jesus rejoiced in
          spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
          that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast
          revealed them unto babes." Let him see a penitent, let him hear the
          groan of a sinner mourning over his evil way, let him discern a tear
          trickling down the cheek of one of his hearers, and Jesus Christ
          begins to be glad, and the Man of Sorrows wears a smile for a moment
          upon that pale and sorrowful face. At all times there is a travailing
          in birth for souls: he is only happy when he sees the family of God
          enlarged.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. There is another test by which you may know when a man's spirit is
          in his work. When a right noble lord, some little time ago, stood up
          in the House of Lords to speak against the infamous productions and
          prints of Holywell Street, I felt quite sure that his lordship was
          thoroughly in earnest, because he grew angry. After some person had
          ventured to defend the filth that comes forth from that street, as if
          it had some connection with the glories of art, his lordship replied
          in a very tart speech, which at once let you see that he meant what he
          said, and that he felt the work upon which he had entered to be an
          important one. Now, our Lord Jesus Christ sometimes grew warm in
          speech, but he was never angry except with men who opposed the good
          work with which he came, and not even with them if he saw that they
          opposed it through ignorance, but only with those who stood up against
          him on account of pride and vain glory. Did ye ever read such a mighty
          tirade of threatening as that which roars from Christ when he is
          speaking against the Pharisees? "But woe unto you, Scribes and
          Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against
          men: for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are
          entering to go in. Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
          for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayer:
          therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. Woe unto you,
          Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make
          one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him two-fold more the
          child of hell than yourselves. Ye blind guides, which strain at a
          gnat, and swallow a camel. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how
          can ye escape the damnation of hell? "Methinks I see his holy cheeks
          glowing with a divine furore, when he hurls his thunderbolts about
          him, and denounces the men who shut up the gates of heaven, and will
          not enter in themselves, and they that would enter in they hinder.
          Now, you can see that his soul is in it, because the man grows warm.
          The loving spirit of Jesus, who was trodden on like a worm, who would
          never defend himself who had not a spark of resentment towards his
          persecutors, but "when he was reviled, reviled not again," who gave
          blessings for curses -- oh! how he kindles into a flame when he sees
          enemies! in the way of his poor people whom he has come to save! Then,
          indeed, he spares no words. Then can he ply the lash with a mighty
          hand, and let them see that the voices of Jesus can be as terrible as
          thunder, while, at other times, it can be sweet as harpers harping
          with their harps.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. A sure evidence that a man has espoused some mighty purpose, and
          that his purpose has saturated his whole soul, and steeped him in its
          floods, is, that if he be unsuccessful, he will weep. Now, see our
          Lord. Were there ever such tears shed as those which he poured forth
          over Jerusalem? Standing on the hilltops, he saw its towers and its
          glittering temple, and he discerned in the dim future the day when it
          should be burned with fire, and the ploughshare of destruction should
          be driven o'er its once fair, but then desolate, foundations and he
          cries, "O Jerusalem! Jerusalem I how often would I have gathered thy
          children together as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, end
          ye would not!" Oh that wail of his, -- "O Jerusalem! Jerusalem!" Does
          it not remind you of those words of God in one of the old prophets,
          where weeping over Ephraim, he saith "How shall I give thee up,
          Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee Israel? how shall I make thee as
          Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? Mine heart is turned within me,
          my repentings are kindled together." Jehovah's bowels yearned to clasp
          his Ephraim to his breast. And so with Jesus. They may spit in his
          face, and he weeps not. They may drag him out of the synagogue and
          seek to cast him headlong down the brow of the hill, but I find not
          that he sighs. They may nail him to the cross, and yet there shall be
          ne'er a tear. The only thing that can make him weep is to see that
          they reject their own mercy, that they put away from them their only
          hope, and refuse to walk in that only way of peace. This alone might
          serve as a proof of the intensity of Jesus' soul in his great purpose.
          He must save others; and if they be not saved, he will weep. If others
          oppose their salvation he will grow angry; not for himself but for
          them. Careless of what happens to himself, he has no fear, no anger
          for injuries that are poured on him, but his whole spirit is given up
          to the one great work of rescuing souls from sin, and sinners from
          going down into the pit.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. It often happens, however, that when we are really earnest about
          some purpose, some enemy will rise up. Unconscious, perhaps, of the
          nobility of our purpose, he will misconstrue our motives, vilify our
          character, and tread our fair name in the dust. There is a strong
          temptation at such seasons to defend one's self. We want to say just a
          word about one's own sincerity and heartiness of purpose. The
          temptation comes very strongly on us, because we think that we
          ourselves are so wrapped up, so intimately connected with the work,
          that perhaps, if our name be injured that work may suffer also. How
          many good and great men have fallen into this snare, so that they have
          left their work in order to take care of themselves, and have at least
          diminished some little of their ardor, or commingled the ardor which
          they feel for those objects with another fervency of spirit -- the
          fervency of self-defense. Now, in our Lord Jesus Christ you see
          nothing of this. He is so set upon his purpose that when they call him
          a drunkard he doth not deny it; when they say he is a Samaritan and is
          mad, he takes it silently and seems to say, "Be it so; think so, if
          you will." Now and then there is a word of complaint, but not of
          accusation. When it is really for their good he will rebuke them, and
          say, "How can Beelzebub cast out Beelzebub?" But there is no elaborate
          defense of his character. Christ has left on record, in his sermons,
          no apology for anything he said. He just went about his work and did
          it, and left men to think what they pleased about him. He knew right
          well that contempt and shame from some men are but another phase of
          glory, and that to suffer the despite of a depraved race was to be
          glorified in the presence of his Father, and in the midst of his holy
          angels. Yet we might wonder (if we did not know who he was) that some
          little personal animosity did not sometimes creep in; but you never
          detect a shade of it. Many there were, I dare say, whom he knew to be
          his dire enemies; he has not a word to say against them. Some would
          come up in the street to insult him; I do not find that he took the
          slightest notice of them. Many there were, too, that spread all manner
          of ill reports, but he never told his disciples to try and stop the
          ill tale that was abroad. He treated with silent pity the calumnies of
          men, and walked on in the majesty of his goodness, defying all men to
          say what they pleased, for all their devices could no more make him
          turn aside from his course than the baying of the dog can make the
          moon stand still in her orbit. And so, too good to be selfish, too
          glorious to care for any one's esteem, he could not and would not turn
          aside, bus as an arrow from the bow of some mighty archer, he sped on
          his way towards his destined) target.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Then, mark again, another proof qf the full devotedness of Christ
          to his ministry namely, that you always see him laboring. The three
          years of Christ's ministry were three years of ceaseless toil. He
          never rested: one wonders how he lived at all. It is but little marvel
          that his poor body was emaciated, and that his visage was more marred
          than that of any man. What with stern conflicts with Satan in the
          desert -- conflicts so severe, that, if you and I were to undergo
          them, they might make our hairs turn grey in a single night; what with
          conflicts with the crowd of men who all seemed to rise up at once
          against him, like warriors armed to the teeth, while he stood like a
          defenseless lamb in the midst of cruel wolves -- what with preaching,
          with more private teaching, with healing the sick and the lepers,
          restoring the maimed, the deaf, the blind; going about everywhere
          doing good, and never ceasing in his journeys, walking every inch of
          his way on foot, save when he was tossed on the stormy bosom of the
          lake, in some small boat which belonged to his disciples -- never
          having a home wherein to dwell, crying, "the foxes have holes, and the
          birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay
          his head" -- surely never man labored like this man. That three years
          of our Savior's ministry reads like the history of three centuries. It
          is the life of a man who is living at a matchless rate. His minutes
          are all hours; his hours all months; his months all years; or longer
          still than that. He does enough in one day to give a man eternal fame,
          and yet, thinking nothing of it, he goes to something yet more
          arduous; and on, and on, and on, he toils his whole life through. The
          most hard working man among us has his hours of sleep. Give us but
          sleep and we can do anything, we rise up from our beds like giants
          refreshed with new wine, to run our course anew. But Jesus sleeps not.
        </p>
        <p>"Cold mountains and the midnight air,</p>
        <p>Witness the fervor of his prayer."</p>
        <p>
          He has stood up to preach all day long; he has fed thousands. and at
          last he faints. His disciples take him even as he is, for he cannot
          walk, his strength is gone; and they carry him down to the boat and
          lay him there. He shuts his eyes, he is about to have some little
          repose but they come to him, and cry, "Master, why sleepest thou?
          Awake! we perish." And he arises to rebuke the waves, and finds
          himself on another shore, and in another field of labor, upon which he
          enters at once without delay. He seems to have known no moment of
          repose. He preaches day by day, he prays by night. He seemed to be a
          sun that never had a setting, always shining always progressing in his
          mighty course. Oh! there never was such a worker never such a toiler
          as this Lord Jesus, who toiled not for himself but for others.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. And here let me remark, again, that I may give you another proof
          that his meat was to do the will of him that sent him, namely, that at
          many times when he was in full labor he does not seem to have felt
          fatigue at all. He had been walking one hot day along the dusty road,
          under the burning sun; and he comes at last to the well of Sychar.
          Being very weary, he sat down on the well. He was hungry, too, for his
          disciples had gone away to buy meat. That little wallet which Judas
          carried was not often full enough to afford meat for luxury; they
          could only buy for mere necessity. They doubtless had enough in that
          little bag, which was filled by the voluntary gifts of those among
          whom he labored, to keep those twelve men with daily bread, but they
          had none to spare. I conclude, then, that our Savior needed meat, or
          they would not have gone away to buy it. They come back after they
          have bought their meat, and they find their Master sitting on the well
          preaching to a woman. She goes away and they wonder how it is he does
          not eat. He tells them he needs no food, he has been refreshed, he had
          seen that woman converted. A woman who had had five husbands, and was
          then living with one who was not her husband, had listened to his
          voice, and she had been saved, and he saw her go away to bring the men
          to hear. He expected a harvest; he saw the fields white and ready for
          it; and this so refreshed his spirit that he did not need to eat. And
          we read at another time he forgot to eat bread, and at another season
          we read they thronged him in, "insomuch that he was not able to eat."
          Yet he could say, "I have meat to eat that ye know not of." He seemed
          to get refreshed in his work to grow stronger amid his toils; instead
          of growing tired, he renewed his strength; as he went on with his
          sacred labors. Now, this could not have happened to Christ, unless his
          whole soul was in it. Those of you who have ever undertaken an
          enterprise with all your might, know that as that has been going on
          you have been so absorbed that you did hot know when it was time for
          you to eat, and when at last you have seen success dawning upon you,
          if any one had hinted that you needed bread, you would put him by and
          say, "Don't disturb me; let me watch; let me see this light come to
          its full blaze of noon day." You have needed no other refreshment than
          that which success, has given you. I could myself give an illustration
          of this, which occurred to me a little while ago, to prove that fact.
          Coming from home early in the morning, I went to the chapel, sat there
          all day long seeing those who had been brought to Christ through the
          preaching of the Word. Their stories were so interesting to me that
          the day went on. I may have seen some thirty or more during the day,
          one after the other, as they came up to me. I was so delighted with
          the tales they told me, and the wonders of grace that God had wrought
          in them, that I did not know anything about how the day went. Seven
          o'clock came for prayer-meeting. I went in and prayed with the
          brethren. After that came the church-meeting. A little before ten
          o'clock I felt faint, and I began to think at what hour I had had my
          dinner, and I found that I had had none; I never thought of it, I
          never felt hungry, because God had made me so glad with success. I
          think we could live right on, almost without food, if God would
          sustain us daily with this divine manna -- this heavenly food of
          success -- in winning souls. This showed that our Master's heart was
          in it: for the toil needed no refreshment.

          8. Then, again, if I have not said enough to convince you that he gave
          his whole spirit to the work; let me remark that many a man has
          espoused a purpose, and, as he imagined, has betrothed himself to it
          by eternal nuptials, yet at last he has been divorced from the darling
          object. He has seen some path of brightness opening to him with some
          glittering honor at the end, and he has turned aside to
          selfaggrandisement and glory. But our Lord had a prospect before him,
          such as no man ever had. Satan took him to the brow of a hill, and
          offered him all the kingdoms of this world a mightier dominion even
          than Caesar had -- if he would bow down and worship him. That
          temptation was substantially repeated in Christ's life a thousand
          times. You remember one practical instance as a specimen of the whole.
          "They would have taken him by force and would have made him a king."
          And if he had but pleased to accept that offer, on the day when he
          rode into Jerusalem upon a colt, the foal of an ass when all cried
          "Hosanna!" when the palm branches were waving, he had needed to have
          done nothing but just to have gone into the temple, to have commanded
          with authority the priest to pour the sacred chrism publicly upon his
          head, and he would have been king of the Jews. Not with the mock title
          which he wore upon the cross, but with a real dignity he might have
          been monarch of nations. As for the Romans, his omnipotence could have
          swept away the intruders. He could have lifted up Judea into a glory
          as great as the golden days of Solomon: he might have built Palmyras
          and Tadmors in the desert: he might have stormed Egypt and have taken
          Rome. There was no empire that could have resisted him. With a band of
          zealots such as that nation could have furnished, and with such a
          leader capable of working miracles walking in the van, the star of
          Judea might have risen with resplendent light, and a visible kingdom
          might have come, and his will might have been done on earth, from the
          river unto the ends of the earth. But he came not to establish a
          carnal kingdom upon earth, else would his followers fight: he came to
          wear the thorn-crown, to bear our griefs and to carry our sorrows. And
          from that single object the most splendid temptation could not make
          him diverge. You may heap together the glittering pomps and the gaudy
          jewels, but he treads them all beneath his feet. The Cross to him is
          brighter than a crown, the suffering more dear than wealth and honor.
          So then, in this too, we may see how full was his purpose, and how
          firmly he was set on the salvation of man.
        </p>

          9. One other thought here. If we knew that some purpose which we had
          undertaken could never be achieved unless by our death, supposing that
          we could bring our mind to give up our blood as the price of success
          -- if we knew that after the most toilsome effort, though the walls of
          the structure might rise, yet our own tomb must furnish the topstone
          -- if we resolve to die for it, yet I can well conceive that firmly as
          our purpose might be set, we should dread the hour. Let it be at a
          distance, we should say. And if we were told it was drawing near, we
          should sigh, and our spirit would sink. But not so, Christ. Do you
          observe throughout his life in what a hurry he is? Read the gospel
          according to St. Mark. The gospel of St. Mark is the gospel of the
          servant. The chosen emblem in the old church windows represents St.
          Mark as the ox, the laborious ox. Each of the evangelists had his own
          particular idiom, and the idiomatic expression of St. Mark is the
          word, Eutheos, which we translate "straightway," "immediately." You
          will see if you read the evangelist through, that the word
          "straightway," "immediately," occurs more frequently in that book than
          in any other, perhaps more times than in all the rest of the Word of
          God besides, to teach us this lesson, that Christ as a servant was in
          haste to fulfll his mission; never loitering, but always doing it
          straightway. He seems to me to be always stretching out his hands
          after the cross; not standing back from it, as if he knew it must come
          to him by necessity. No, he said, "I have a baptism to be baptized
          with, and how am I straitened till it be accomplished." His soul was
          speeding towards the cross, and his body seemed to be straitened,
          encaged, imprisoned, that it could not get to the end of this three
          years of labor. His soul was panting after suffering; groaning, crying
          out to be permitted to drink of the cup of our redemption even to the
          dregs. Now, this majesty of purpose, not merely to die, but to pant
          for death -- not simply to climb the wall, to lead the forlorn hope
          and to long to do it, to be panting for the battle, desiring the
          fight, longing for the suffering -- this is heroic ardor, self
          devotion entirely unexampled! I could hardly imagine a man panting for
          the fight an hour before it begins, but all his life long to be
          desiring to enter upon It, to be panting for that bloody sweat, to be
          sighing for those nails, that shame, that spitting, this showed how
          strongly our Lord Jesus Christ had bent all his thoughts to the divine
          purpose of doing his Father's will, and finishing his Father's work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I shall say no more upon this subject by way of proof. I come
          very briefly to make the practical we thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first practical inference is addressed to the timid, agonized
          soul, who desires salvation, but who thinks that Christ is unwilling
          to give it to him. Timid spirit, timid spirit, put away the thought
          that he is unwilling to save. It is a lie against thy own soul; it is
          a libel against his character. What! He unwilling to distribute that
          which he so freely bought at so immense a price! Do you see in any one
          period of his life an unwillingness to save? There might be once a
          shrinking of the flesh, but that is over now. No more the crown of
          thorns; the cross and nails no more. The flesh has nothing more to
          shrink at. It is done; redemption is accomplished, and think you he
          was so earnest and so intent on the work of redemption, and now is
          unwilling to reap the fruits of it? Why, do you not know, poor
          penitent, that he died to save you, and think you that it needs much
          argument to move the heart that once was pierced to pity and
          compassion? Scout the thought once for all. He is able to forgive;
          that thou knowest. He is as willing as he is able. Infinite is his
          ability, and as infinite his willingness. I beseech thee, distrust him
          not. Come as thou art, with all thy sins about thee. Come, now and put
          thy trust in him. Thou shalt find the door of heaven's gate not
          creaking on its hinges, but standing on jar and opening easily. John
          Bunyan says the posts of the gates of the temple were made of olive
          tree; and he allegorized it thus: -- They were made of that fat and
          oily tree, that so the hinges might move readily and smoothly, that
          there might be no difficulty in opening the temple-gates when timid
          souls came flying in. When mothers are unwilling to receive their
          children, when fathers are unwilling to give food to their own
          offspring, then -- nay, not even then, will Jesus be unwilling to
          forgive. When the hard-working man is unwilling to take his wage, when
          the toiling politician is unwilling to grasp the honor which he has
          achieved, then -- nay, not even then, may Christ be unwilling to lay
          hold upon the sheep which is his own purchased with his own blood, and
          to pluck that jewel from a dung-hill which he has redeemed with his
          own suffering. He is not unwilling; thou art unwilling. If there be
          any hardness of heart, it lies with thee, and not with him. If there
          be difficulties in the way of thy salvations they are difficulties in
          thyself, not in him. Come and welcome. This is the invitation which
          reaches thee to day from heaven's festal board. Come and welcome. Come
          and welcome. Come and welcome, sinner, come! Let nothing make thee
          linger. He thirsts to save; he pants to bless. He longs to redeem and
          ransom. Only trust him; and if thou be made glad when thou trustest,
          he will be glad too. If the prodigal is glad when he returns, the
          father's joy is not an atom less. If there be mirth in the heart of
          the returning one, there is as much mirth in the heart of the parent
          to whom he returns. So come, and make thy Savior glad. Come and make
          him see of the travail of his soul that he may be abundantly
          satisfied. This is my first practical inference.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is yet another. Christian men, it is but fair that we should
          give you one lesson from such a subject as this. Let this mind be in
          you which was in Christ Jesus. I would not be censorious, but solemnly
          and seriously, I fear there are not very many whose whole heart is set
          on Christ's glory. We have church members, men of wealth; do they not
          spend more upon themselves than upon Christ? And may I not infer from
          this that they love themselves better than Christ? We have other
          members of our churches, men who are but comparatively well-to-do.
          These spend more on their mere pleasures than on Christ. What am I to
          suppose, but that they find more pleasure in the enjoyments of the
          flesh than they do in serving Christ? Oh, have we not tens of
          thousands in the army of the Lord, that strike for themselves in their
          own battles with an arm as strong as that of king Arthur of our table,
          but when they come to fight for Christ their arm drops nerveless at
          their side? We have men who are all eye, all ear, all hand in
          business, but they are blind, and deaf, and impotent when they come
          into Christ's church. The fact is, we have in too many of our churches
          the chrysalis of men, but not the real body. They give us their names,
          but they keep their whole influence for the world. Ah! and is this
          what Christ deserves of you? Is this the reward of his self-devotion?
          Do you thus repay him who saved others but could not save himself. And
          you profess to be a follower of the Lamb, is this your following? An
          imitator of Jesus, and is this the imitation? Oh, sirs, the likeness
          is marred and blotted. Ye are poor sculptors indeed, if ye imagine
          yourselves to be sculptured in the image of Christ. Brothers and
          sisters, this matter may not seem to be of interest to you, but I feel
          it to be a subject of the most intense importance to the world that
          lieth in the wicked one. If we were more like Jesus it would be a
          happy day for the poor dying sons of men. Oh, if our divided aims
          could but be exchanged for singleness of heart; if our littleness of
          zeal could be consumed in the intensity of love to Christ, what better
          men should we be, and what a happier world would be this. Do you
          imagine that you are pleasing to God when you are living for fifty
          aims instead of one? When you bring to Christ your lukewarm love, your
          lukewarm zeal, do you think he is pleased with you, and that he
          accepts your offer? Oh, church of Laodicea, thou hast moved from Asia,
          thou hast come to England, and taken up thy abode in London! Truly
          might the Lord say to many of our London churches, "You are neither
          cold nor hot, you are lukewarm, and I will spue thee out of my mouth."
          There is nothing God abhors more than our cold Christianity, such as
          we have in these modern times -- a religion which professes to live,
          but which lives like a gasping, fainting, trembling creature, that is
          on the verge of death. And you think to shake the world while you are
          shaking yourself with the ague of your cold indifference! You cry to
          God, "Arise!" and yet you rise not yourself! You ask a blessing and
          yet you will not win it! You crave for victory, and yet your swords
          rust in their scabbards! Out with you, sirs, be rid of this hypocrisy;
          begin first to ask for singleness of soul, and devotedness of purpose;
          and when this is given you, then shall there come days of refreshing
          from the presence of the Lord. Then shall sinners be converted, and
          Christ shall see of the travail of his soul. But for all this we want
          the influence of the Holy Spirit, for without that we shall never give
          our whole hearts up to the sacred mission of winning souls for Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spirit of the living God! descend upon us now; rest on thy saints, and
          fill them with love to perishing souls, and rest thou on the sinner,
          to bring him to this willing Savior, and make him willing in the day
          of thy power.<br />
