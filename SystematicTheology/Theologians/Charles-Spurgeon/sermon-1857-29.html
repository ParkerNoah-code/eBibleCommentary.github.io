        <p>A Sermon</p>

        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, June 7, 1857, by the</p>

          "Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins." -- Psalm 19:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          ALL SINS are great sins, but yet some sins are greater than others.
          Every sin has in it the very venom of rebellion, and is full of the
          essential marrow of traitorous rejection of God. But there be some
          sins which have in them a greater development of the essential
          mischief of rebellion, and which wear upon their faces more of the
          brazen pride which defies the Most High. It is wrong to suppose that
          because all sins will condemn us, that therefore one sin is not
          greater than another. The fact is, that while all transgression is a
          greatly grievous sinful thing, yet there are some transgressions which
          have a deeper shade of blackness, and a more double scarlet-dyed hue
          of criminality than others. Now the presumptuous sins of our text are
          just the chief of all sins: they rank head and foremost in the list of
          iniquities. It is remarkable, that though an atonement was provided
          under the Jewish law for every kind of sin, there was this one
          exception: "But the soul that sinneth presumptuously shall have no
          atonement; it shall be out off from the midst of my people." And now,
          under the Christian dispensation, although in the sacrifice of our
          blessed Lord there is a great and precious atonement for presumptuous
          sins, whereby sinners who have sinned in this manner are made clean,
          yet, without doubt, presumptuous sinners, dying without pardon, must
          expect to receive a double portion of the wrath of God, and a more
          wonderful manifestation of the unutterable anguish of the torment of
          eternal punishment in the pit that is digged for the wicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall this morning, first of all, endeavor to describe presumptuous
          sins; then, secondly, I shall try, if I can, to show by some
          illustrations, why the presumptuous sin is more heinous than any
          other; and then thirdly, I shall try to press the prayer upon your
          notice -- the prayer, mark you, of the holy man -- the prayer of
          David: "Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins. "
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, WHAT IS PRESUMPTUOUS SIN? Now, I think here must be
          one of four things in a sin in order to make it presumptuous. It must
          either be a sin against light and knowledge, or a sin committed with
          deliberation, or a sin committed with a design of sinning, merely for
          sinning's sake, or else it must be a sin committed through hardihood,
          from a man's rash confidence in his own strength. We will mark these
          points one by one.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. A sin that is committed willfully against manifest light and
          knowledge is a presumptuous. sin. A sin of ignorance is not
          presumptuous, unless that ignorance also be willful, in which case the
          ignorance itself is a presumptuous sin. But when a man sins for want
          of knowing better -- for want of knowing the law, for want of
          instruction, reproof, advice, and admonition, we say that his sin, so
          committed, does not partake to any great extent of the nature of a
          presumptuous sin. But when a man knows better, and sins in the very
          teeth and face of his increased light and knowledge, then his sin
          deserves to be branded with this ignominious title of a presumptuous
          sin. Let me just dwell on this thought a moment. Conscience is often
          an inner light to men, whereby they are warned of forbidden acts as
          being sinful. Then if I sin against conscience, though I have no
          greater light than conscience affords me, still my sin is
          presumptuous, if I have presumed to go against that voice of God in my
          heart, an enlightened conscience. You, young man, were once tempted
          (and perhaps it was but yesterday) to commit a certain act. The very
          moment you were tempted, conscience said, "It is wrong, it is wrong"
          -- it shouted murder in your heart, and told you the deed you were
          about to commit was abominable in the sight of the Lord. Your
          fellow-apprentice committed the same sin without the warning of
          conscience; in him it was guilt -- guilt which needs to be washed away
          with the Saviour's blood. But it was not such guilt in him as it was
          in you, because your conscience checked you; your conscience told you
          of the danger, warned you of the punishment, and yet you dared to go
          astray against God, and therefore you sinned presumptuously. You have
          sinned very grievously in having done so. When a man shall trespass on
          my ground, he shall be a trespasser though he have no warning, but if
          straight before his face there stands a warning, and if he knowingly
          and willingly trespasses, then he is guilty of a presumptuous
          trespass, and is to be so far punished accordingly. So you, if you had
          not known better; if your conscience had been less enlightened, you
          might have committed the deed with far less of the criminality which
          now attaches to you, because you sinned against conscience, and
          consequently sinned presumptuously.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, O! how much greater is the sin, when man not only has the light
          of conscience, but has also the admonition of friends, the advice of
          those who are wise and esteemed by him. If I have but one check, the
          check of my enlightened conscience, and I transgress against it, I am
          presumptuous; but if a mother with tearful eye warns me of the
          consequence of my guilt, and if a father with steady look, and with
          affectionate determined earnestness, tells me what will be the effect
          of my transgression -- if friends who are dear to me counsel me to
          avoid the way of the wicked, and warn me what must be the inevitable
          result of continuing in it, then I am presumptuous, and my act in that
          very proportion becomes more guilty. I should have been presumptuous
          for having sinned against the light of nature, but I am more
          presumptuous when, added to that, I have the light of affectionate
          counsel and of kind advice, and therein I bring upon my head a double
          amount of divine wrath. And how much more is this the case, when the
          transgressor has been gifted with what is usually called a religious
          education; in childhood he has been lighted to his bed by the lamps of
          the sanctuary, the name of Jesus was mingled with the hush of lullaby,
          the music of the sanctuary woke him like a matin hymn at morning; he
          has been dandled on the knee of piety and has sucked the breasts of
          godliness; he has been tutored and trained in the way he should go;
          how much more fearful I say, is the guilt of such a man than that of
          those who have never had such training, but have been left to follow
          their own wayward lusts and pleasures without the restraint of a holy
          education and the restraints of an enlightened conscience!
        </p>
        <p>
          But, my friends, even this may become worse still. A man sins yet more
          presumptuously, when he has had most special warning from the voice of
          God against sin. "What mean you?" say you. Why, I mean this. You saw
          but yesterday a strong man in your neighborhood brought to the grave
          by sudden death; it is but a month ago that you heard the bell toll
          for one whom once, you knew and loved, who procrastinated and
          procrastinated until he perished in procrastination. You have had
          strange things happen in your very street, and the voice of God has
          been spoken loudly through the lips of Death to you. Ay, and you have
          had warnings too in your own body; you have been sick with fever, you
          have been brought to the jaws of the grave, and you have looked down
          into the bottomless vault of destruction. It is not long ago since you
          were given up; all said they might prepare a coffin for you, for your
          breath could not long be in your body. Then you turned your face to
          the wall, and prayed; you vowed that if God would spare you, you would
          live a godly life, that you would repent of your sins; but to your own
          confusion you are now just what you were. Ah! let me tell you, your
          guilt is more grievous than that of any other man, for you have sinned
          presumptuously, in the very highest sense in which you could have done
          so. You have sinned against reproofs, but what is worse still, you
          have sinned against your own solemn oaths and covenants, and against
          the promises that you made to God. He who plays with fire must be
          condemned as careless; but he who has been burned out once, and
          afterward plays with the destroying element, is worse, than careless;
          and he who has himself been scorched in the flame, and has had his
          locks all hot and crisp with the burning, if he again should rush
          headlong into fire, I say he is worse than careless, he is worse than
          presumptuous, he is mad. But I have some such here. They have had
          warnings so terrible that they might have known better; they have gone
          into lusts which have brought their bodies into sickness, and perhaps
          this day they have crept up to this house, and they dare not tell to
          their neighbor who stands by their side what is the loathsomeness that
          even now doth breed upon their frame. And yet they will go back to the
          same lusts; the fool will go again to the stocks, the sheep will lick
          the knife that is to slay him. You will go on in your lust and in your
          sins, despite warnings, despite advice, until you perish in your
          guilt. How worse than children are grown-up men! The child who goes
          for a merry slide upon a pond, if he be told that the ice will not
          bear him, starteth back affrighted, or if he daringly creepeth upon it
          how soon he leaves it, if he hears but a crack upon the slender
          covering of the water! But you men have conscience, which tells you
          that your sins are vile, and that they will be your ruin; you bear the
          crack of sin, as its thin sheet of pleasure gives way beneath your
          feet; ay, and some of you have seen your comrades sink in the flood,
          and lost; and yet you go sliding on, worse than childish, worse than
          mad are you, thus presumptuously to play with your own everlasting
          state. O my God, how terrible is the presumption of some! How fearful
          is presumption in any! O! that we might be enabled to cry, "Keep back
          thy servant also from presumptuous sins."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. I said again, that another characteristic of a presumptuous sin was
          deliberation. A man, perhaps, may have a passionate spirit, and in a
          moment of hot haste he may utter an angry word of which in a few short
          minutes he will sincerely repent. A man may have a temper so hot that
          the least provocation causes him at once to be full of wrath. But he
          may also have a temperament which has this benefit to balance it, that
          he very soon learns to forgive, and cools in a moment. Now, such a man
          does not sin presumptuously, when suddenly overcome by anger, though,
          without doubt, there is presumption in his sin, unless he strives to
          correct that passion and keep it down. A man, again, who is suddenly
          tempted and surprised into a sin which is not his habit, but which he
          commits through the force of some strong temptation, is guilty, but
          not guilty of presumption, because he was taken unawares in the net
          and caught in the snare. But there are other men who sin deliberately;
          there are some who can think of a lust for weeks beforehand and dote
          upon their darling crime with pleasure. They do, as it were, water the
          young seedling of lust until it grows to the maturity of desire, and
          then they go and commit the crime. There are some to whom lust is not
          a passer-by, but a lodger at home. They receive it, they house it,
          they feast it; and when they sin they sin deliberately, walk coolly to
          their lusts, and in cold blood commit the act which another might
          haply do in hot and furious haste. Now, such a sin has in it a great
          extent of sinfulness, it is a sin of high presumption. To be carried
          away, as by a whirlwind of passion, in a moment is wrong; but to sit
          down and deliberately resolve upon revenge is cursed and diabolical.
          To sit down and deliberately fashion schemes of wickedness is heinous,
          and I can find no other word fitly to express it. To deliberate
          carefully how the crime is to be done, and, Haman-like, to build the
          gallows, and to set to work to destroy one's neighbor, to get the pit
          digged that the friend may fall into it and be destroyed, to lay
          snares in secret, to plot wickedness upon one's bed -- this is a high
          pitch of presumptuous sin. May God forgive any of us, if we have been
          so far guilty!
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, when a man continues long in sin, and has time to deliberate
          about it, that also is a proof that it is a presumptuous sin. He that
          sins once, being overtaken in a fault, and then abhors the sin, has
          not sinned presumptuously; but he who transgresses to-day, to-morrow,
          and the next day, week after week, and year after year, until he has
          piled up a heap of sins that are high as a mountain, such a man, I
          say, sins presumptuously, because in a continued habit of sin there
          must be a deliberation to sin; there must be at least such a force and
          strength of mind as could not have come upon any man if his sin were
          but the hasty effect of sudden passion. Ah! take heed, ye that are
          sodden in sin, ye that drink it down as the greedy ox drinketh down
          water, ye who run to your lust as the rivers run to the sea, and ye
          who go to your passions as the sow to her wallowing in the mire. Take
          heed! your crimes are grievous, and the hand of God shall soon fall
          terribly on your heads, unless by divine grace it be granted to you to
          repent and turn unto him. Fearful must be your doom if unpardoned, God
          should condemn you for presumptuous sin. O "Lord, keep back thy
          servant also from presumptuous sin."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Again: I said that a presumptuous sin must be a matter of design,
          and have been committed with the intention of sin. If at your leisure
          at home you will turn to that passage in the book of Numbers, where it
          says there is no pardon for a presumptuous sin under the Jewish
          dispensation, you will find immediately afterward a case recorded. A
          man went out on the Sabbath-day to gather sticks; he was taken in the
          act of Sabbath-breaking, and the law being very stringent under the
          Jewish dispensation, he was ordered at once to be put to death. Now,
          the reason why he was put to death was not because he gathered sticks
          on the Sabbath merely, but because the law had just then been
          proclaimed, "In it thou shalt do no manner of work." This man
          willfully, out of design, in order, as it were, to show that he
          despised God -- to show that he did not care for God -- without any
          necessity, without any hope of advantage, went straight out, in the
          very teeth of the law, to perform, not an act which he kept in his own
          house, which might perhaps have been overlooked, but an act which
          brought shame upon the whole congregation, because, infidel-like, he
          dared to brazen it out before God; as much as to say, "I care not for
          God. Has God just commanded, Ye shall do no manner of work?' Here am
          I; I do not want sticks to-day; I do not want to work; not for the
          sake of sticks, but with the design of showing that I despise God, I
          go out this day and gather sticks." "Now," says one, "surely there are
          no people in the world that have ever done such a thing as this." Yes,
          there are; and there are such in the Surrey Music Hall this day. They
          have sinned against God, not merely for the pleasure of it, but
          because they would show their want of reverence to God. That young man
          burned his Bible in the midst of his wicked companions -- not because
          he hated his Bible, for he quivered and looked pale at the ashes on
          the hearth when he was doing it; but he did it out of pure bravado, in
          order to show them, as he thought, that he really was far gone from
          any thing like a profession of religion. That other man is accustomed
          sometimes to stand by the wayside, when the people are going to the
          house of God; and he swears at them, not because he delights in
          swearing, but because he will show that he is irreligious, that he is
          ungodly. How many an infidel has done the same -- not because he had
          any pleasure in the thing itself, but because out of the wickedness of
          his heart he would spit at God, if it were possible, having a design
          to let men know that though the sin itself was cheap enough, he was
          determined to do something which would be like spitting in the face of
          his Maker, and despising God who created him! Now, such a sin is a
          masterpiece of iniquity. There is pardon for such a one -- there is
          full pardon to those who are brought to repentance; but few of such
          men ever receive it; for when they are so far gone as to sin
          presumptuously, because they will do it -- to sin merely for the sake
          of showing their disregard of God and of God's law, we say of such,
          there is pardon for them, but it is wondrous grace which brings them
          into such a condition that they are willing, to accept it. O that God
          would keep back his servants here from presumptuous sins! And if any
          of us here have committed them, may he bring us back, to the praise of
          the glory of his grace!
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But one more point, and I think I shall have explained these
          presumptuous sins. A presumptuous sin also is one that is committed
          through a hardihood of fancied strength of mind. Says one, "I intend
          to-morrow to go into such-and-such a society, because I believe,
          though it hurts other people, it does me no hurt." You turn round and
          say to some young man, "I could not advise you to frequent the Casino
          -- it would be your ruin." But you go yourself sir? "Yes." But how do
          you justify yourself? Because I have such strength of principle that I
          know just how far to go, and no further. Thou liest, sir; against
          thyself thou liest; thou liest presumptuously in so doing. Thou art
          playing with bombshells that shall burst and destroy thee; thou art
          sitting over the mouth of hell with a fancy that thou shalt not be
          burned. Because thou hast gone to haunts of vice and come back
          tainted, much tainted, but because thou art so blind as not to see the
          taint, thou thinkest thyself secure. Thou art not so. Thy sin, in
          daring to think that thou art proof against sin, is a sin of
          presumption. "No, no," says one; "but I know that I can go just so far
          in such-and-such a sin, and there I can stop." Presumption, sir;
          nothing but presumption. It would be presumption for any man to climb
          to the top of the spire of a church, and stand upon his head. "Well,
          but he might come down safe, if he were skilled in it." Yes, but it is
          presumptuous. I would no more think of subscribing a farthing to a
          man's ascent in a balloon, than I would to a poor wretch cutting his
          own throat. I would no more think of standing and gazing at any man
          who puts his life in a position of peril, than I would of paying a man
          to blow his brains out. I think such things, if not murders, are
          murderous. There is suicide in men risking themselves in that way; and
          if there be suicide in the risk of the body, how much more in the case
          of a man who puts his own soul in jeopardy just because he thinks he
          has strength of mind enough to prevent its being ruined and destroyed.
          Sir, your sin is a sin of presumption; it is a great and grievous one;
          it is one of the masterpieces of iniquity.
        </p>
        <p>
          O! how many people there are who are sinning presumptuously to-day!
          You are sinning presumptuously in being to-day what you are. You are
          saying, "In a little time I will solemnly and seriously think of
          religion, In a few years, when I am a little more settled in life, I
          intend to turn over a new leaf, and think about the matters of
          godliness." Sir, you are presumptuous. You are presuming that you
          shall live; you are speculating upon a thing which is as frail as the
          bubble on the breaker; you are staking your everlasting soul on the
          deadly odds that you shall live for a few years, whereas, the
          probabilities are, that you may be cut down ere the sun shall set: and
          it is possible, that ere another year shall have passed over your
          head, you may be in the land where repentance is impossible, and
          useless were it possible. O! dear friends, procrastination is a
          presumptuous sin. The putting off a thing which should be done to-day,
          because you hope to live to-morrow, is a presumption. You have no
          right to do it -- you are, in so doing, sinning against God, and
          bringing on your heads the guilt of presumptuous sin. I remember that
          striking passage in Jonathan Edwards' wonderful sermon, which was the
          means of a great revival, where he says, "Sinner, thou art this moment
          standing over the mouth of hell, upon a single plank, and that plank
          is rotten; thou art hanging over the jaws of perdition, by a solitary
          rope, and the strands of that rope are creaking now." It is a terrible
          thing to be in such a position as that, and yet to say, "to-morrow,"
          and to procrastinate. You remind me, some of you, of that story of
          Dionysius the tyrant, who, wishing to punish one who had displeased
          him, invited him to a noble feast. Rich were the viands that were
          spread upon the table, and rare the wines of which he was invited to
          drink. A chair was placed at the head of the table, and the guest was
          seated within it. Horror of horrors! The feast might be rich, but the
          guest was miserable, dreadful beyond thought. However splendid might
          be the array of the servants, and however rich the danties, yet he who
          had been invited sat there in agony. For what reason? Because over his
          head, immediately over it, there hung a sword, a furbished sword,
          suspended by a single hair. He had to sit all the time with this sword
          above him, with nothing but a hair between him and death. You may
          conceive the poor man's misery. He could not escape; he must sit where
          be was. How could he feast? How could be rejoice? But O, my
          unconverted hearer, thou art there this morning, man, with all thy
          riches and thy wealth before thee, with the comforts of a home and the
          joys of a household; thou art there this day, in a place from which
          thou canst not escape; the sword of death above thee, prepared to
          descend; and woe unto thee, when it shall cleave thy soul from thy
          body! Canst thou yet make mirth, and yet procrastinate? If thou canst,
          then verily thy sin is presumptuous in a high degree. "Keep back thy
          servant also from presumptuous sins."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now I come to the second part of the subject, with which I
          shall deal very briefly. I am to try and show WHY IT IS THAT THERE IS
          GREAT ENORMITY IN A PRESUMPTUOUS SIN.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me take any one of the sins; for instance, the sin against light
          and knowledge. There is greater enormity in such a presumptuous sin
          than in any other. In this our happy land it is just possible for a
          man to commit treason. I think it must be rather difficult for him to
          do it; for we are allowed to say words here which would have brought
          our necks beneath the guillotine if they had been spoken on the other
          side the Channel; and we are allowed to do deeds here which would have
          brought us long years of imprisonment if the deed had been done in any
          other land. But I suppose it is just possible to commit treason here.
          Now, if two men should commit treason -- if one of them should
          wantonly and wickedly raise the standard of revolt to-morrow, should
          denounce the rightful sovereign of this land in the strongest and most
          abominable language, should seek to entice the loyal subject of this
          country from their allegiance, and should draw some of them astray, to
          the hurt and injury of the common weal; he might have in his
          rebellious ranks one who had joined incautiously, not knowing
          whereunto the matter might tend, who might come into the midst of the
          rebels, not understanding the intention of their unlawful assembling,
          not even knowing the law which prohibited them from being banded
          together, I can suppose these two men brought up upon a charge of high
          treason: they have both, legally, been guilty of it; but I can suppose
          that the one man who had sinned ignorantly would be acquitted, because
          there was no malignant intent; and I can suppose that the other man,
          who had willfully, knowingly, maliciously and wickedly raised the
          standard of revolt, would receive the highest punishment which the law
          could demand. And why? Because in the one case it was a sin of
          presumption, and in the other case it was not so. In the one case the
          man dared to defy the sovereign, and defy the law of the land,
          willfully, out of mere presumption. In the other case not so. Now,
          every man sees that it would be just to make a distinction in the
          punishment, because there is -- conscience itself tells us -- a
          distinction in the guilt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: some men, I have said, sin deliberately, and others do not do
          so. Now, in order to show that there is a distinction here, let me
          take a case. To-morrow the bench of magistrates are sitting. Two men
          are brought up. They are each of them charged with stealing a loaf of
          bread. It is clearly proved, in the one case, that the man was hungry,
          and that he snatched the loaf of bread to satisfy his necessities. He
          is sorry for his deed, he grieves that he has done this act; but most
          manifestly he had a strong temptation to it. In the other case the man
          was rich, and he willfully went into the shop merely because he would
          break the law and show that he was a law-breaker. He said to the
          policeman outside, "Now, I care neither for you nor the law; I intend
          to go in there, just to see what you can do with me." I can suppose
          the magistrate would say to one man, "You are discharged; take care
          not to do the like again; there is something for your present
          necessities; seek to earn an honest living." But to the other I can
          conceive him saying, "You are an infamous wretch; you have committed
          the same deed as the other, but from very different motives; I give
          you the longest term of imprisonment which the law allows me, and I
          can only regret that I can not treat you worse than I have done." The
          presumption of sin made the difference. So when you sin deliberately
          and knowingly, your sin against Almighty God is a higher and a blacker
          sin than it would have been if you had sinned ignorantly, or sinned in
          haste.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let us suppose one more case. In the heat of some little dispute
          some one shall insult a man. You shall be insulted by a man of angry
          temper; you have not provoked him, you gave him no just cause for it;
          but at the same time he was of a hot and angry disposition; he was
          somewhat foiled in the debate, and he insulted you, calling you by
          some name which has left a stain upon your character, so far as
          epithets can do it. I can suppose that you would ask no reparation of
          him, if by to-morrow you saw that it was just a rash word spoken in
          haste, of which he repented. But suppose another person should waylay
          you in the street, should week after week seek to meet you in the
          market-place, and should, after a great deal of toil and trouble, at
          last meet you, and there, in the center of a number of people,
          unprovoked, just out of sheer, deliberate malice, come before you and
          call you a liar in the street; I can suppose that, Christian as you
          are, you might find it necessary to chastise such insolence, not with
          your hand, but with the arm of that equitable law which protects us
          all from insulting violence. In the other case I can suppose it would
          be no trouble to forgive. You would say, "My dear fellow, I know we
          are all hasty sometimes -- there, now, I don't care at all for it; you
          did not mean it." But in this case, where a man has dared and defied
          you without any provocation whatever, you would say to him, "Sir, you
          have endeavored to injure me in respectable society; I can forgive you
          as a Christian, but as a man and a citizen I shall demand that I am
          protected against your insolence."
        </p>
        <p>
          You see, therefore, in the cases that occur between man and man, how
          there is an excess of guilt added to a sin by presumption. O! ye that
          have sinned presumptuously -- and who among us has not done so? -- bow
          your heads in silence, confess your guilt, and then open your mouths,
          and cry, "Lord have mercy upon me, a presumptuous sinner."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now I have nearly done -- not to weary you by too long a
          discourse -- we shall notice THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THIS PRAYER --
          "Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins."
        </p>
        <p>
          Will you just note, that this prayer was the prayer of a saint, the
          prayer of a holy man of God? Did David need to pray thus? Did the "man
          after God's own heart" need to cry, "Keep back thy servant?" Yes, he
          did. And note the beauty of the prayer. If I might translate it into
          more metaphorical style, it is like this: "Curb thy servant from
          presumptuous sin." "Keep him back or he will wander to the edge of the
          precipice of sin. Hold him in, Lord; he is apt to run away; curb him;
          put the bridle on him; do not let him do it; let thine overpowering
          grace keep him holy; when he would do evil, then do thou draw him to
          good, and when his evil propensities would lead him astray, then do
          thou check him." "Check thy servant from presumptuous sins."
        </p>
        <p>
          What then? Is It true that the best of men may sin presumptuously? Ah!
          it is true. It is a solemn thing to find the Apostle Paul warning
          saints against the most loathsome of sins. He says, "Mortify therefore
          your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness,
          idolatry, inordinate affection," and such like. What! do saints want
          warning against such sins as these? Yes, they do. The highest saints
          may sin the lowest sins, unless kept by divine grace. You old
          experienced Christians, boast not in your experience; you may trip
          yet, unless you cry, "Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe." Ye whose
          love is fervent, whose faith is constant, whose hopes an bright, say
          not "I shall never sin," but rather cry out, "Lord, lead me not into
          temptation, and when there leave me not there; for unless thou hold me
          fast I feel I must, I shall decline, and prove an apostate after all."
          There is enough tinder in the hearts of the best men in the world to
          light a fire that shall burn to the lowest hell, unless God should
          quench the sparks as they fall. There is enough corruption, depravity,
          and wickedness in the heart of the most holy man that is now alive to
          damn his soul to all eternity, if free and sovereign grace does not
          prevent. O Christian, thou hast need to pray this prayer. But I think
          I hear you saying, "Is thy servant a dog, that I should do this
          thing?" So said Hazael, when the prophet told him that he would slay
          his master; but he went home and took a wet cloth and spread it over
          his master's face and choked him, and did the next day the sin which
          he abhorred before. Think it not enough to abhor sin, you may yet fall
          into it. Say not, "I never can be drunken, for I have such an
          abhorrence of drunkenness;" thou mayest fall where thou art most
          secure. Say not, "I can never blaspheme God, for I have never done so
          in my life;" take care; you may yet swear most profanely. Job might
          have said, "I will never curse the day of my birth;" but he lived to
          do it. He was a patient man; he might have said, "I will never murmur;
          though he slay me, yet will I trust in him;" and yet he lived to wish
          that the day were darkness wherein he was brought forth. Boast not,
          then, O Christian; by faith thou standest. "Let him that thinketh he
          standeth take heed lest he fall."
        </p>
        <p>
          But if this need to be the prayer of the best, how ought it to be the
          prayer of you and me? If the highest saint must pray it, O mere
          moralist, thou hast good need to utter it. And ye who have begun to
          sin, who make no pretensions to piety, how much need is there for you
          to pray that you may be kept from presumptuously rebelling against
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, however, of enlarging upon that point, I shall close my few
          remarks this morning by just addressing myself most affectionately to
          such of you as are now under a sense of guilt by reason of
          presumptuous sins. God's Spirit has found some of you out this
          morning. I thought when I was describing presumptuous sin that I saw
          here and there an eye that was suffused with tears; I thought I saw
          here and there a head that was bowed down, as much as to say, "I am
          guilty there." I thought there were some hearts that palpitated with
          confession, when I described the guilt of presumption. I hope it was
          so. If it was I am glad of it. If I hit your consciences, it was that
          I meant to do. Not to your ears do I speak, but to your hearts. I
          would not give the snap of this my finger to gratify you with mere
          words of oratory, with a mere flow of language. No, God is my witness.
          I never sought effect yet, except the effect of hitting your
          consciences. I would use the words that would be most rough and vulgar
          in all our language, if I could get at your heart better with them
          than with any other; for I reckon that the chief matter with a
          minister is to touch the conscience. If any of you feel, then, that
          you have presumed against God in sinning, let me just bid you look at
          your sin, and weep over the blackness of it; let me exhort you to go
          home and bow your heads with sorrow, and confess your guilt, and weep
          over it with many tears and sighs. You have greatly sinned, and if God
          should blast you into perdition now, he would be just; if now his
          fiery thunderbolt of vengeance should pierce you through, if the arrow
          that is now upon the string of the Almighty should find a target in
          your heart, he would be just. Go home and confess that, confess it
          with cries and sighs. And then what next wilt thou do? Why, I bid thee
          remember that there was a man who was a God. That man suffered for
          presumptuous sin. I would bid thee this day, sinner, if thou knowest
          thy need of a Saviour, go up to thy chamber, cast thyself upon thy
          face, and weep for sin; and when thou hast done that, turn to the
          Scriptures, and read the story of that man who suffered and died for
          sin. Think you see him in all his unutterable agonies, and griefs, and
          woes, and say this --
        </p>
        <p>"My soul looks back to see</p>
        <p>The burdens thou didst bear</p>
        <p>When hanging on the accursed tree,</p>
        <p>And hopes her guilt was there."</p>
        <p>Lift up your hand, and put it on his head who bled, and say,</p>
        <p>"My faith would lay its hand</p>
        <p>On that dear head of thine,</p>
        <p>While, like a penitent, I stand,</p>
        <p>And there confess my sin."</p>
        <p>
          Sit down at the foot of his cross, and watch him till your heart is
          moved, till the tears begin to flow again, until your heart breaks
          within you; and then you will rise and say --
        </p>
        <p>"Dissolved by his mercy, I fall to the ground,</p>
        <p>And weep to the praise of the mercy I found."</p>
        <p>
          O sinner, thou canst never perish, if thou wilt cast thyself at the
          foot of the cross. If thou seekest to save thyself thou shalt die; if
          thou wilt come, just as thou art, all black, all filthy, all
          hell-deserving, all ill-deserving, I am my Master's hostage, I will be
          answerable at the day of judgment for this matter, if he does not save
          thee, I can preach on this subject now, for I trust I have tried my
          Master myself. As a youth I sinned, as a child I rebelled, as a young
          man I wandered into lusts and vanities: my Master made me feel how
          great a sinner I was and I sought to reform, to mend the matter; but I
          grew worse. At last I heard it said, "Look unto me, and be ye saved,
          all the ends of the earth;" and I looked to Jesus. And O! my Saviour,
          thou hast eased my aching conscience, thou hast given me peace; thou
          hast enabled me to say#151;
        </p>
        <p>"Now, freed from sin I walk at large;</p>
        <p>My Saviour's blood's a full discharge</p>
        <p>At his dear feet my soul I lay,</p>
        <p>A sinner saved, and homage pay."</p>
        <p>
          And O! my heart pants for you. O that you who never knew him could
          taste his love now. O that you who have never repented might now
          receive the Holy Ghost who is able to melt the heart! And O that you
          who are penitents would look to him now! And I repeat that solemn
          assertion -- I am God's hostage this morning; ye shall feed me on
          bread and water to my life's end, ay, and I will bear the blame for
          ever, if any of you seek Christ and Christ rejects you. It must not,
          it can not be. "Whosoever cometh," he says, "I will in no wise cast
          out." "He is able to save to the uttermost them that come unto God by
          him." May God Almighty bless you; and may we meet again in yonder
          Paradise; and there will we sing more sweetly of redeeming love and
          dying blood, and of Jesus' power to save#151;
        </p>
        <p>"When this poor lisping, stammering tongue</p>
        <p>Lies silent in the grave."<br /></p>
