        <p>A Sermon</p>

          |Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his
          fierce anger, that we perish not?| -- Jonah 3:9.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS WAS THE FORLORN HOPE of the Ninevites: |Who can tell if God will
          turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish
          not?| The book of Jonah should be exceedingly comfortable to those who
          are despairing because of the wickedness of their times. Nineveh was a
          city as great in its wickedness as in its power. If any of us with
          little faith had been bidden to go round about her, and |tell the
          towers thereof, and mark well her bulwarks;| if we had been commanded
          to go through her streets and behold her both in the blaze of the sun
          and in the light of the moon as her inhabitants indulged in vice, we
          should have said. |Alas! Alas! the city is wholly given into idolatry,
          and it is girt about with a wall of sin, as stupendous as its wall of
          stone.| Suppose that the problem had been given to us to solve -- how
          shall this city be moved to repentance? How shall its vice be forsaken
          and the God of Israel worshipped by all its inhabitants from the
          highest to the lowest? If we had not been paralyzed with despair,
          which is the most probable, we should, nevertheless, have sat down
          carefully to consider our plans. We should have parcelled it out into
          missionary districts; we should have needed at least several hundreds,
          it not thousands, of able ministers; at once, expenses would have to
          be incurred, and we should have considered ourselves bound to
          contemplate the erection of innumerable structures in which the Word
          of God might be preached. Our machinery would necessarily become
          cumbrous; we should find that we, unless we had the full resources of
          an empire, could not even begin the work. But what saith the Lord
          concerning this? Putting aside the judgments of reason, and all the
          plans and schemes which flesh and blood so naturally do follow, he
          raises up one man. By a singular providence he qualifies that one man
          for his mission. He sends him down into the very depths of the sea,
          where the weeds are wrapped about him, he comes up from the great
          deep, and the awful descent has steeled his soul and completely
          covered him with the armor of courageous faith. Who need tremble at
          anything on shore who has passed the bowels of a fish and yet
          survived? He comes into the city, his eyes almost starting from their
          sockets with the recollection of the great judgment which had passed
          over his head, and in stern inflexible manner, with shrill monotonous
          voice, he begins to cry, |Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be
          overthrown!| Is this, O God! is this thy way? Is this the means with
          which thou wilt accomplish the great event? Wilt thou make Nineveh
          repent at the bidding of one man? Shall yon sallow man fresh from the
          sea -- shall his voice be sufficient to stir this great city? O God!
          if thou hadst come forth in thy fiery chariot, if thou hadst spoken
          with thy thunder, if thou hadst shaken the earth with thine
          earthquakes then might Nineveh feel, but surely this one man is not
          sufficient for the deed. But as high as the heaven is above the earth,
          so high are his ways above our ways, and his thoughts above our
          thoughts. So skillful is he that with the weakest instrument he can
          produce the mightiest workmanship. That one man begins his journey.
          Already the inhabitants flock to listen to him. He proceeds -- the
          crowd multiplies. As he stands at the corner of the alleys, and the
          lanes, every window is thrown up to listen, and the streets are
          thronged as he walks along. Still on he goes till the whole city has
          begun to shake with his terrible voice. And now the King himself bide
          him come into his presence, and the fearless still propounds the
          threatening of God. Then comes the effect. All Nineveh is wrapped in
          sackcloth; the cry of man and beast go up in one terrible wailing to
          God. Jehovah is honored and Nineveh repents. Ah! My brethren, we see
          in this rich grounds for hope. What cannot God do? Think not that he
          needs to wait for us. He can accomplish the greatest deeds by the
          meanest instrumentality. One man, if he willed it, would be sufficient
          to stir this giant city. One man, if God decreed it, might be the
          means of the conversion of a nation, nay, a continent should shake
          beneath the tramping of one man. There is no palace so high that this
          one man's voice should not reach it, and there is no den of infamy so
          deep that his cry should not be heard therein. All we need is that God
          should |make bare his arm,| and who can withstand his might. What
          though he grasp but the jaw-bone of an ass yet is his arm mightier
          than Samson's, and not only would it be heaps upon heaps, but city
          upon city, continent upon continent. With the meanest instrument would
          God slay his thousands and overcome his myriads. Oh church of God,
          never fear; remember the men that God has given thee in the days of
          yore. Look back to Paul; remember Augustine; think ye well of Luther,
          and of Calvin; talk ye of Whitfield, and of Wesley, and remember these
          were but separate individual men, and yet through them God did a work,
          the remembrance whereof still rolleth on and shall never cease while
          this earth endures.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this by way of preface, I shall now somewhat turn aside from the
          narrative, to address myself to those who are trembling on account of
          sin and who are in the same position as the men of Nineveh, and like
          them anxiously desiring mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall notice briefly this morning three things. First, the miserable
          plight in which the men of Nineveh found themselves; secondly, the
          scanty reasons which they had for hope; and then, thirdly, I shall
          observe that we have stronger reasons to compel us to pray, and more
          comfortable arguments to urge us to trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First then, I shall consider the men of Nineveh, as representing
          many here present, as to THE DOLEFUL PLIGHT IN VICE THEY FOUND
          THEMSELVES. The men of Nineveh were like those in the days of Noah.
          They were married and given in marriage: they ate and they drank: they
          builded and they planted. The whole world was their granary, and the
          kingdoms of the earth their hunting ground. They were rich and mighty
          above all people, for God had greatly increased their prosperity; and
          they had become the greatest nation upon the face of the earth. Locked
          in security they fell into great and abominable sins. Their vices
          probably rivalled those of Sodom. If they were not worse even than the
          Eastern cities of the present day, they were abominable beyond
          description. How suddenly were they however startled from their
          security and convinced of their sin? The preaching of that one strange
          man had brought them from the height of their splendor to the depths
          of sorrow. Now was their boasting cut off; the sound of their mirth
          had ceased; and they began to weep and lament. What was their
          miserable plight? I take it, it consisted in three discoveries; they
          now discovered their great sin; then again, the shortness of their
          time, and in the next place, the terrible character of their
          destruction. Would that ye would discover the like ye careless
          sinners, ye that slumber in Zion, ye that fear not God, neither turn
          from your evil ways. Would I say that in the first place, some
          prophet-voice would stir you to remember your sins, for are they not
          many and exceeding great? Let each man among us look to his life, and
          who is there here that need not blush? Some of us have been moral. We
          have by the training of our youth and by the restraints of grace been
          kept from the immoralities of others, but even we are compelled to lay
          our mouths in the dust. While looking into our heart, we discover it
          to be a nest of unclean birds, full of all manner of evil and
          loathsome things. We have been as visions in our hearts as the worst
          of men have been in their acts. But there are too many who cannot even
          plead that they have been moral, though this would be but a poor
          excuse for the want of love to God. Look, men and brethren, look to
          your lives; who among us hath been free from murmuring against God?
          Who is he that hath loved his neighbor as himself? Who is it that has
          never been angry without a cause? Who has never cursed God in his
          heart, even if he hath not done so with his lips? Who among us have
          always scrupulously kept our eye from lust and our heart from
          covetousness? Have we not all sinned? If our iniquities could now be
          revealed; if on every man's brow were written his sin, which of you
          would not put his hand upon his forehead to hide his iniquity from his
          fellows? It will be of essential service to many of you if you will
          read over your lives. Turn, I beseech you, to the pages of your
          memory, and let the black, blotted, misspelled pages now be read
          again. Think not that the preacher understands how to flatter his
          congregation. It has become fashionable in these times to look upon
          our hearers as all being good and excellent -- would not this be a lie
          and a falsehood before Almighty God? Are there not here those that can
          indulge secretly in vices which we must not mention? Are there not
          those who do that to their fellows in trade which they would despise
          in others? What! are none of you covetous? Do none of you over-reach
          or defraud your neighbors? Do none of ye practice the common frauds
          and tricks in trade? Are none of ye liars, and none deceivers, none
          slanderers who bear false witness against your neighbors? Am I so
          happy as to have a spotless congregation here? I cannot flatter myself
          that such can be the truth. No, our iniquities are great and our sins
          are hideous. Oh, that we were all ready to confess, each man for
          himself, the iniquities which we have done! Surely, if the Spirit of
          God shall but shine into our hearts and show us the evil of our ways,
          we shall find ourselves in a sorrowful condition indeed, and shall be
          ready to cry out before God, oven as Nineveh did of old.
        </p>
        <p>
          Added to this however the Ninevites had information as to the
          shortness of their days. |Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be
          overthrown.| How fixed and definite the date! Six weeks shall scarcely
          run their round,| says the Prophet, |ere ye must die, and perish
          miserably.| To an hour was the time described, |yet forty days.| How
          would the Ninevites count the days with terror, and watch each rising
          and setting sun as if these were the black milestones upon their
          dreary road to death! |Ah,| saith one, |but ye will not tell us that
          our days are only forty.| Nay, men and brethren I am no prophet. I
          cannot tell how many your days may be, but this one thing I can say,
          it is possible that there are some here who have not forty days to
          live! There may be some among you who have not so long a respite as
          even Nineveh itself. Suppose now I should be able to take you to that
          great city. If I could have shown you its massive ramparts and its
          stupendous fortresses; if like Jonah I could point to them and say,
          |In forty days this city will be an overthrown,| which would require
          the greatest stretch of credulity to believe this prophecy or that
          which follows, |In forty days your body shall crumble back to dust?|
          Which I say would require the greatest stretch of faith? whether is
          the easier of these twain, to send you to death, or to uproot a city?
          What art thou, man, but a heap of animated dust? A worm may destroy
          thee, a grain of sand may be sufficient to take away thy life. Feeble
          is the thread of life, a spider's web is a cable compared therewith.
          It is but a dream, a child's whisper may break it, and we may awake in
          another world. |Forty days!| surely that was a long and distant period
          compared with what may be the date of your death. I have been long
          enough preaching in this place to look back now on many who have gone
          from this spot to the place appointed to all firing. Many, many are
          the faces which this day I miss as I look along your ranks and cast my
          eye around this gallery. There are not a few who I remember to have
          passed from the land of the living and to have gone to another world
          -- and some how suddenly, how rapidly! I have been startled at it
          often myself. I have seen some here on the Sabbath, and by the Tuesday
          or by the Thursday the message has come, |On what day can you bury
          such-and-such a one?| |Bury her!| |Yes sir, bury her, she is gone;|
          and I have said, |How strange it seems that she should be dead who so
          lately was living in our midst!|
        </p>
        <p>
          Forty days I add is a long lease compared with that which you have any
          reason to conclude that God has bestowed on you. But what if it were
          forty years, how short a time even then. If ye will but look with the
          eye of wisdom, how rapidly our years revolve. Are you not startled
          even now to see the sear leaf in your path? It was but yesterday that
          the fresh green buds were seen. It seemeth but a month ago since first
          we saw the wheat starting up from the ground, and lo the harvest is
          over and gone and many of the birds have disappeared and the tints of
          autumn are succeeding the verdure of summer. Years seem but months now
          and months but days, and days pass so rapidly that they flit like
          shadows before us. O! men and women, if we could but measure life it
          is but a span, and in a time how short, how brief every one of us must
          appear before his God. The shortness of time should help to arouse us,
          and then, let me add the third thing which startled the Ninevites was
          this, the terrible character of the judgment. Doubtless one part of
          the effect of Jonah's preaching may be traced to the singular
          vagueness of his prophecy. He says, |Yet forty days and Nineveh shall
          be overthrown.| By whom, he does not tell us. How he does not deign to
          reveal. It is to be overthrown, that is all. Whether some mighty
          nation should invade it, or whether an earthquake should swallow it up
          quick, or whether by plague or pestilence the whole city should be
          emptied, or whether an intestine quarrel should cut off the
          population, he says not. The very vagueness and indistinctness of a
          prophecy adds to its terror, just as men can never bring their minds
          to think of spectres in the plain daylight, but always conjure up such
          things in hours of shade and gloom. The gloominess of the message made
          men tremble. And oh! ye that are not reconciled to God, men without
          religion, without hope and without God in the world, how terrible is
          the judgment that shall come upon you! It is not for me to attempt to
          describe it. Scripture only speaks of the life to come in indistinct
          terms. Terrible are they in their vagueness. Jesus saith, |These shall
          go away into outer darkness, where there is weeping, and wailing, and
          gnashing of teeth,| and anon he speaks of torment as a place |where
          the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.| and then he
          describes it as |a bottomless pit,| and as |a fire| that |never shall
          be quenched.| Ah! my brethren, we know but little of the wrath of God
          which shall certainly come upon the wicked, but we know enough to let
          us understand that it is too terrible for human ear to hear. If hell
          had been fully described to us in this time-state, this life itself
          would have been but the vestibule of eternal torment. I question
          whether any eyes could bear to read such a description as God might
          have given. Both our ears would have tingled, and our hearts would
          melt like water, at the sound thereof. Oh! sinner, it is enough for me
          to say to you this day, |Except ye repent, ye must perish with a
          terrible overthrow. God, even God himself, shall draw his sword and
          bathe it in your blood. He shall drive you from his presence amidst
          the thunders of his wrath and the lightnings of his vengeance. He
          shall smite you with his omnipotence, and shall spend himself in
          punishing you, and your torment shall be without end, and the smoke
          thereof shall go up for ever and ever. I speak not this day to you
          that are unbelievers in the word: with you I will have nothing to do
          this morning; but to you who are believers in the revelation of the
          Bible -- who profess to be nominal Christians, with you I have to
          deal. Oh sirs, if ye believe this book, if ye are impenitent, how
          tremendous is the doom which awaits you; how fatal shall death be to
          you, and how terrible the last dread day of judgment! And all this is
          coming on apace. The chariot wheels of God's justice have axles which
          are hot with speed, the black coursers are covered with foam as on
          they drive. Perhaps, as here I stand and speak alas, too coldly on
          things which should make any man boil over with enthusiasm -- perhaps
          death may even now be fitting his arrow to the string, and you may be
          his victim, and this sermon may be closed, as Paul's sermon was, with
          some one's falling dead like Eutychus, in the window in his sleep. God
          grant it may not be so, but nevertheless there is cause enough for
          each one of us to tremble and to bow before the God of Israel. Thus
          have I spoken on the first point: O Holy Spirit, bless the word!
        </p>
        <p>
          These Ninevites however took heart and hope. They said, |Let us
          proclaim a fast, let man and beast cry mightily unto God, for who can
          tell but he may turn from his fierce anger that we perish not.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now the second point was, THE SLENDER GROUND WHICH THE NINEVITES
          HAD FOR HOPE. And now regard attentively, for I long this morning for
          you all in the bowels of Christ, that ye also with a far better hope
          may be enabled to imitate the example of the men of Nineveh. You will
          notice that in Jonah's message, there was no proclamation of mercy
          made. It was one short sentence of doom. Twas like the great bell of
          St. Sepulchre's Church tolling out the hour of the execution of a
          criminal. There was not so much as a note of mercy. Twas the trumpet
          of the Judge, but not the silver trump of Jubilee. No mercy glanced
          from Jonah's eye, no pity was in his heart. He was sent with a
          thundering commission and he dealt it out in a thundering fashion.
          |Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be Overthrown.| I think I see the
          king of Nineveh sitting down with his nobles at a council of state,
          and one of them would say, |We have little hope of mercy, for if you
          will observe Jonah never offered us any. How terribly he spoke. There
          was not so much as a tear in his eye. I am persuaded that Jonah's God
          is very just and severe. He will by no means spare us; we shall be cut
          off.| But the king's answer to his councillor was, |Who can tell? you
          only think so, but you cannot say it, let us yet hope, for |Who can
          tell.| My dear hearers, tis no Jonah that addresses you. My language
          to-day shall be rather that of Isaiah, |Come now, and let us reason
          together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet they shall be
          as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as
          wool.| Oh cannot you say with Nineveh's king, |Who can tell?| Will not
          you go home to your chamber and pray, for |Who can tell?| Will you not
          go to the Bible and search for a promise, for |Who can tell?| Will you
          not go to the cross and trust in the flowing blood, for |Who can
          tell?| You may be forgiven yet, accepted yet, and one day yet sing
          God's praises before the throne above. Another thing which would cut
          off the hope of the Ninevites very much was this, that they knew
          nothing of God except, it may he, some dreadful legends they had heard
          of his terrible acts. One of the councillors of the king deeply
          learned would say, |O king, live for ever! The God of Jonah is a
          terrible God. Hast thou not heard what he did in Egypt; how he
          destroyed Pharaoh and his chariots of old in the Red Sea? And hast
          thou not heard what he did to Sennacherib when he cut him off and his
          hosts? Hast thou never heard the thunder of his power, and the might
          of his terrible acts? Surely he will have no mercy on us.| But the
          king answered -- |Who can tell?| Thou dost not know. It is but a
          surmise. |Who can tell?| But oh, my hearers, we are on a vantage
          ground here, for you know that God is merciful. Many and many a time
          have we assured you from the lips of God himself, through this written
          word, that he delighteth in mercy. You have his promise for it, nay,
          you have his oath for it. Jehovah lifts his hand to heaven, and swears
          by himself. |As I live, saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the
          death of him that dieth; but had rather that he should turn unto me
          and live.| Come, then sinner, for |who can tell;| he is a merciful
          God. Do what Benhadad did of old, when he and his army had been
          routed, and he alone was left with a few of his nobles. He said: |Let
          us put ropes on our necks, and go unto the king of Israel, for we have
          heard that the kings of Israel are merciful kings.| Do you the like
          with Jesus. You have heard that he is merciful and full of compassion.
          Come to him now; trust in his blood, and |who can tell;| this day your
          sins may be blotted out? |Who can tell?| This day you may be washed in
          the blood of Christ, and made white as Adam in Paradise. |Who can
          tell?| This day the Lord may make your heart leap with joy, while he
          whispers -- |Thou art mine, and I am thine.| |Who can tell?| Drowning
          men catch at straws -- this is no straw -- this is a solid rock: lay
          hold on it and be saved. |Who can tell?|
        </p>
        <p>
          But once again, the people of Nineveh lacked another encouragement
          which you and I have. They had never heard of the cross. Jonah's
          preaching was very powerful, but there was no Christ in it. There was
          nothing about the Messiah that was to come -- no talking of the
          sprinkled blood -- no mention of a great sin-atoning sacrifice -- and
          therefore the men who were in the council of the king, might have said
          -- |Surely we have never heard that any satisfaction has been offered
          to the injured justice of God. How therefore can he be just and yet
          the justifier of the ungodly? |Ah,| said the king, |who can tell?| and
          on that slender |who can tell?| they ventured to cry for mercy; but
          oh, sinner thou art answered this day, that |God hath spared not his
          own Son, but freely delivered him up for us all, that whosoever
          believeth on him might not perish, but have everlasting life. For God
          so loved the world that he sent forth his only begotten Son, that
          whosoever believeth on him might not perish, but might be saved. For
          there is now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.| Come
          sinner, come to the cross, for God can be just, and yet the justifier
          of the ungodly. I say, this should make thee ask -- |Who can tell?| He
          may wash me clean, he may accept me, and I may yet be able to sing
          with the loudest of all the voices of his children --
        </p>
        <p>|I the chief of sinners am,</p>
        <p>But Jesus died for me.|</p>
        <p>
          And now shall I tell you what I think was the hope which the poor king
          of Nineveh really had? I have set before you his discouragements, and
          now I will set before you his encouragements. They were very slender,
          but still they seemed to have been sufficient. Perhaps the king said
          in his heart, or he might have said to his councillors -- |Sirs, there
          is one thing which ye cannot deny, we are come to the worst, and if we
          repent and cry for mercy, at least that cry will not be to our
          disadvantage. We shall be none the worse off even if we are not
          heard.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now sometimes I have known a trembling sinner take comfort even from
          that. The words of our hymn suggest the full idea.
        </p>
        <p>|I can but perish if I go,</p>
        <p>I am resolved to try;</p>
        <p>For if I stay away I know,</p>
        <p>I must for ever die.|</p>
        <p>
          If you seek not Christ; if you repent not of sin; if you put not your
          trust in him, perish you must. That is certain. If you go, and are
          rejected, at least you are none the worse off. Try it, and you shall
          find out that you are much the better, for you shall not be rejected.
          Remember the cage of the three lepers at the gate of Samaria. They
          were sitting there without food to eat, and at last the pangs of
          hunger were strong upon them. One of them said to his fellows, |Let us
          go now to the host of the Syrians. If they kill us we shall but die;
          if they save us alive, we shall live, but if we stay here, perish we
          must. So, as there was nothing to lose, and there might be something
          to gain, they risked it. Oh, sinner, would to God the Lord would teach
          thee as much wisdom as this. Go to him just as thou art, and say,
          |Lord, sink or swim, I take thy cross to be my only trust. If thou
          wilt not save me, if I perish in the stream, yet will I perish
          clinging to the rock of my salvation, for no other trust and no other
          hope have I.| Oh that you may be led to do even this, and ye shall not
          be disappointed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, the king would add, |It is true that Jonah did not say that
          God would have mercy, but then he did not say he would not.| There was
          a cry from Jonah's lip, |Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be
          overthrown| but he did not say, |God will not have any mercy at all.|
          So the king said, |Who can tell, then?| if any could have told him,
          Jonah would. Was he not a fierce looking man; if there had been any
          thunders in store, would he not have dealt them out in his terrible
          fury of prophecy? |Surely,| said the king, if he stopped there, and
          did not add, |I will have no mercy, this is a happy token. Who can
          tell? If Jonah did not tell, we cannot.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, sinner, I would thou wouldst catch hold on this. But thou
          hast something stronger and firmer still, for there is mercy
          proclaimed to thee this day. God is not willing that any should
          perish, but that all should come to repentance. These are his own
          words and he himself expressly invites you to come to him. He says
          |Whosoever will, let him come, and take of the water of life freely;|
          and he gives you his word for it -- |Him that cometh unto me I will in
          nowise cast out.| Salvation is free as the air we breathe to every
          convinced sinner. If thou knowest this day thy need of Christ, take
          him, he is thine. He is a fountain open for the thirsty. All the
          preparation thou needest is simply a burning thirst. Then come and
          drink, and none can say thee nay.
        </p>
        <p>|From the Mount of Calvary,</p>
        <p>Where the Saviour deigned to die,</p>
        <p>What transporting sounds I hear,</p>
        <p>Bursting on my ravished ear! --</p>
        <p>Love's redeeming work is done,</p>
        <p>Come and welcome, sinner, come!|</p>
        <p>
          Well, then, if thou art invited, |Who can tell?| Come, come and try,
          for |Who can tell?|
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, I think, the greatest confidence which the king of Nineveh would
          have would be derived from the following suggestion. |Oh,| said he,
          |if God had meant to destroy us without giving us an opportunity of
          pardon, he would not have sent Jonah forty days beforehand. He would
          have given us no time at all. He would simply have given a blow and a
          word, but the blow would have been first. He would have overthrown the
          city in his wrath without a single message. What did he to Sodom? He
          sent no messenger there. The sun rose and the fire descended from
          God's terrible right hand. Not so Nineveh; it had its warning. And
          now, sinner, turn thou this to good account. Thou hast had many a
          warning. Thou art this day warned, nay, more thou art affectionately
          invited to come to Christ. The voice from the cross is speaking, and
          each trickling drop of blood crieth, |Amen.|
        </p>
        <p>|Come and welcome, sinner, come!|</p>
        <p>
          Now, if the Lord were unwilling to forgive, would he have sent his
          servants to warn and to invite? If there were not bowels of mercy with
          him, would he not have said, |Let them alone, they are joined unto
          idols, let them perish?| It is no small prophecy of God's good
          intentions to a man when God sends to him a faithful minister. Oh, my
          hearers, I cannot speak to you with eloquence. I cannot address you
          with the fervid words of such an one as Whitfield, but this I can say,
          and God is my witness, I have not shunned to declare the whole counsel
          of God, whether man would hear, or whether he will forbear. If ye
          perish, it is not because I have kept back any part of that which I
          have received of God, who hath sent me. I have broken through the
          trammels of creed and system that I might free my head of the blood of
          all men. I have not been content to run in the track of an old and
          narrow creed, if I felt that it kept me from earnestly pleading with
          you, and warning you to flee from the wrath to come. I have endangered
          many a friendship, and brought upon my self no little shame, because I
          must and will, in this matter, deal earnestly with your souls. Tis no
          child's play to preach. It shall be no child's play to give an account
          of preaching at the last great tremendous day. You are warned; in
          God's name I conjure you, ere the gates of mercy are shut upon you --
          ere life shall end: now, now bethink yourselves. Now may the Spirit of
          God bring you to your knees, now drive you to prayer, now lead you to
          faith in the sprinkled blood of the Lamb of God which taketh away the
          sins of the world. Sinner, remember! if thou perish thou destroyest
          thyself. Behold, God willeth not thy death, but he bids thee come now.
          Nay! he doth, as it were, pray thee to return. He says, |Return, ye
          backsliding children of men.| |Oh Israel, return unto me.| He says
          again, |Come, now, let us reason together; though your sins be as
          scarlet they shall be as wool; though they be red like crimson they
          shall be white as snow.| Would that I could draw you! Oh that I had
          chains on my lips that should bind you in golden fetters to the cross
          of Christ. Come, sinner, for |who can tell?| Nay, I change the
          sentence. |I can tell| -- if ye turn, he will turn unto you. Come ye
          to him, and he will accept you, for he is a God ready to forgive, and
          now, this day, he is ready to cast your sins into the depths of the
          sea, and remember them no more for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, this shall bring me to the third point, namely, THE
          URGING OF DIVERS REASONS WHY WE SHOULD IMITATE THE NINEVITES IN
          REPENTANCE.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was an old and a horrible custom of past governments, when a man
          was executed for murder, to allow him to be hung in chains, so that as
          often as any one passed by the gibbet they might learn, as was
          thought, the severity of justice. I fear, however, that they more
          frequently learned the brutality and barbarism of the age. Now, as
          these were hung in chains as warnings, I would translate this horrible
          figure into one that shall glitter with joy and delight. God, in order
          that you may know his mercy, has been pleased to preserve instances
          thereof, that so often as you look upon them you may be led to say, if
          such and such an one was saved, why may not I? It is needless for me
          to refer you to Old Testament and New Testament scriptures. You will
          remember well the pardon given to David! Surely you have not forgotten
          the mercy which God had on that chief of sinners, Manasseh! As for the
          New Testament pardoned sinners, from the thief on the cross to Saul of
          Tarsus, the chief of sinners, it sufficeth but to hint at them. And
          now this day behold before your eyes in this place, sinners once like
          yourselves, who have obtained mercy and are now forgiven. Amongst the
          thousands in this hall there are not a few who (say some two years ago
          or less) entered this place out of idle curiosity. I could describe
          some to you who had never entered a place of worship for twenty or
          even thirty years. Some of them had been habitual drunkards, their
          lives had been the abodes of misery; some of them had been harlots,
          and led others into sin, beside destroying their own bodies and their
          souls. Into this place they crept, they came merely to listen to the
          preacher, of whom many a strange thing had been said. Their attention
          was rivetted. An arrow from the bow of God shot into their hearts and
          here they are this day. Without boasting I say it, they are my joy and
          my crown of rejoicing, and shall be such in the day of the appearing
          of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. If you, who have been like them,
          but are now repenting of your sins, could hear their testimony as I
          have done, you would never doubt of the mercy of God. If you could
          read the account that I have preserved of some of them -- sailors, who
          in every part of the world have sinned -- who have never touched upon
          land except to commit fornication and wickedness -- if I could tell
          you on the other hand the dreadful iniquities into which some here
          have plunged in the days of their flesh, you would say, |Surely he is
          a pardoning God, and methinks that might entice you to come. Oh if
          there be any such here, and there are many such here, I know, if you
          are sitting in this hall to-day side by side with some trembling
          sinner, and you observe the tear dropping from his eye, be not slow to
          tell him, |I am one of the men that Mr. Spurgeon mentions.| The Lord
          has saved thee, and be not slow to take the hand of the penitent, and
          bid him come where you went, and bid him look for mercy where you
          sought it and found it. And I may say again, if I may speak for myself
          here to-day, if you knew my own character as it was before conversion,
          you need none of you despair of mercy. When I went to God confessing
          my sins to him, I felt myself to be the vilest sinner out of hell.
          Others might have praised me, but I had not a word to say on my own
          account. If the hottest flames of the pit had been mine eternal
          portion it was not one whit more than I deserved. But
        </p>
        <p>|Tell it unto sinners tell,</p>
        <p>I am, I am out of hell,|</p>
        <p>
          And forgiven and accepted in Christ. Who then need despair? Who can
          tell? Come sinner, come, and say this in thine heart, and go and cry
          unto God in prayer, and lay hold on Christ by faith, saying, |Who can
          tell?| The innumerable instances of past mercies should stir us up to
          say, |Who can tell?|
        </p>
        <p>
          And then again let me remind you -- Oh, ye that are now conscious of
          your guilt, that your only hope for deliverance lies in the mercy of
          God. When a man knows that he has only one hope left how tenaciously
          will he cling to it. Some sick man has tried every system of medicine
          -- he has spent nearly all his wealth, and now he has come to the last
          stage. He is trying the last system of medicine. If this remedy fail,
          die he must. Do you not readily imagine that he would use this with
          the greatest diligence, and be as obedient as possible to every
          command of the physician? And now sinner, it is Christ or hell with
          thee this day. If Christ save thee not, thou art a lost man. If the
          cross be not thy salvation, the jaws of hell must soon close upon
          thee. Tis Christ or nothing. Nay it is Christ or perdition! Lay hold
          on him then; clutch him; he is thy last, thy only hope. Oh, fly to
          him: he his thine only refuge. If thou wert pursued by some fierce
          beast of prey: if there were but one tree on some vast plain, albeit,
          there were but a scanty hope of escape by climbing it, with what speed
          would thy feet carry thee to it. I see thee running and I come before
          thee and say, |Stop, why in such haste?| You rush past me crying --
          |Sir, tis my only chance, tis my only hope; I am devoured, I am rent
          in pieces if I find not shelter there.| It is your case today. Behold
          the roaring lion of the pit, athirst for your blood, is after you.
          Away to the cross; cling to it; there is hope; there is sure refuge.
          But apart from that thou art worse than rent in pieces; thou art
          destroyed for ever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          But for thy encouragement, let me tell thee one other thing, and then
          I shall have done. Sinner, remember that while it will be a happy
          thing for thee to be saved, it will be a glorious thing for God to
          save thee. Men object not to do a thing which is expensive to them, if
          it bring them in some honor. They will not stoop to do a thing which
          involves shame and scorn; but if honor goeth with a thing then are
          they ready enough to do it. Now soul, remember, if God shall save thee
          it will honor him. Why, wilt thou not honor him if he will but blot
          out thy sin? I thought when I was seeking mercy, if God would but save
          me there was nothing I would not do for him. I would be cut in pieces
          rather than deny him. I would serve him all my life, and he might do
          what he would with me in heaven. And do you not sometimes feel that if
          God would but save you, you would sing loudest of them all in heaven?
          Would you not love him; creep to the foot of his throne, and cast your
          crown before his feet, saying: |Lord, not unto me, not unto me, but
          unto thy name be all the glory.| God delighteth to save sinners,
          because this puts jewels in his crown. He is glorified in his justice,
          but not as he is in his mercy. He appears in silken robes with a
          golden crown upon his head when he saves sinners. He wears an iron
          crown when he crushes them. Judgment is his strange work; he does that
          with his left hand, but his right-handed acts are those of mercy and
          of love. Hence he puts the righteous always on the right hand that he
          may be ready to pardon and ready to deliver. Oh, come then soul to
          Christ. Thou art not about to ask a thing which God is unwilling to
          give, or that which will slur his escutcheon, or blot his banner. Thou
          art asking for that which is as glorious to God as it is beneficial to
          thyself. Come humble soul and cry to Christ, and he will have mercy
          upon thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          My only fear in conclusion is, that if any of you have received the
          slightest impression this morning you will go home and forget it. May
          I ask you now as a favor that if you have but got so much as a scar
          under the preaching of the Word, go home alone if you can. Say but
          little if you are obliged to walk with others, and go straight away to
          your chamber, fall there on your knees, make a confession of your sin,
          cry to God for mercy through the blood of Christ, and |Who can tell?|
          Who can tell -- this very day there shall be high holiday in heaven
          over hundreds of sinners who in this Music Hall have first learned to
          pray -- who in this place have first been led to consider their ways
          and turn to God. I hope our friends will all remain and no one move,
          while I pray that that may be the case, and all of you that wish it
          may be so, will solemnly say Amen after the few sentences of prayer I
          shall utter: --
        </p>
        <p>
          |Lord, save us this morning. We confess our sin; we ask for mercy
          humbly through the blood of Christ. We pray thee do not deny us, but
          let us all appear at thy right hand at last. Here reveal with power,
          and let many be saved this morning for Jesus' sake.| And the people
          said AMEN.<br />
