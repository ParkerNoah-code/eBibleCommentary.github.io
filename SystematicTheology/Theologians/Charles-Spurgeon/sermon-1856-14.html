        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.68)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, February 24, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their
          garments; and they shall walk with me in white; for they are worthy."
          -- Revelation 3:4.
        </p>
        <p>
          MY LEARNED and eminently pious predecessor, Dr. Gill, is of opinion
          that the different churches spoken of in the Book of Revelation are
          types of different states through which the church of God shall pass
          until it comes into the Philadelphia state, the state of love, in
          which Jesus Christ shall reign in its midst, and afterwards, as he
          thinks, shall pass into the state of Laodicea, in which condition it
          shall be when suddenly the Son of Man shall come to judge the world in
          righteousness and the people in equity. I do not go with him in all
          his suppositions with regard to these seven churches as following each
          other in seven periods of time; but I do think he was correct when he
          declared that the church in Sardis was a most fitting emblem of the
          church in his days, as also in these. The good old doctor says, "When
          we shall find any period in which the church was more like the state
          of Sardis as described here, than it is now?" And he points out the
          different particulars in which the church of his day (and I am sure it
          is yet more true of the church at the present day) was exactly like
          the church in Sardis. I shall use the church in Sardis as a figure of
          what I conceive to be the sad condition of Christendom at the present
          moment. My first point will be general defilement -- there were but "a
          few names" in Sardis who had not "defiled their garments;" secondly,
          special preservation -- there were a few who had not defiled their
          garments; and thirdly, a peculiar reward -- "And they shall walk with
          me in white; for they are worthy."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. GENERAL DEFILEMENT. The holy apostle, John, said of the church in
          Sardis, "These things saith he that hath the Seven Spirits of God, and
          the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou has a name that thou
          livest, and art dead. Be watchful, and strengthen the things which
          remain, that are ready to die; for I have not found thy works perfect
          before God. Remember therefore how thou has received and heard, and
          hold fast and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come
          on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon
          thee. Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled
          their garments."
        </p>
        <p>
          The first charge of general defilement he brings against the church in
          Sardis was that they had a vast deal of open profession, and but
          little of sincere religion. "I know thy works, that thou hast a name
          that thou livest, and art dead." That is the crying sin of the present
          age. I am not inclined to be morbid in my temperament, or to take a
          melancholy view of the church of God. I would wish at all times to
          exhibit a liberality of spirit, and to speak as well as I can of the
          church at large; but God forbid that any minister should shrink from
          declaring what he believes to be the truth. In going up and down this
          land, I am obliged to come to this conclusion, that throughout the
          churches there are multitudes who have "a name to live, and are dead."
          Religion has become fashionable. The shopkeeper could scarcely succeed
          in a respectable business if he were not united with a church. It is
          reckoned to be reputable and honorable to attend a place of worship;
          and hence men are made religious in shoals. And especially now that
          parliament itself doth in some measure sanction religion, we may
          expect that hypocrisy will abound yet more and more, and formality
          everywhere take the place of true religion. You can scarcely meet with
          a man who does not call himself a Christian, and yet it is equally
          hard to meet with one who is in the very marrow of his bones
          thoroughly sanctified to the good work of the kingdom of heaven. We
          meet with professors by hundreds; but me must expect still to meet
          with possessors by units. The whole nation appears to have been
          Christianized in an hour. But is this real? Is this sincere? Ah! we
          fear not. How is it that professors can live like other men? How is it
          that there is so little distinction between the church and the world?
          Or, that if there is any difference, you are frequently safer in
          dealing with an ungodly man than with one who is professedly
          righteous? How is it that men who make high professions can live in
          worldly conformity, indulge in the same pleasures, live in the same
          style, act from the same motives, deal in the same manner as other do?
          Are not these days when the sons of God have made affinity with the
          sons of men? And may be not fear that something terrible may yet occur
          unless God shall send a voice, which shall say, "Come out of them, my
          people, lest ye be partakers of their plagues?" Take our churches at
          large -- there is no lack of names, but there is a lack of life. Else,
          how is it that our prayer-meetings are so badly attended? Where is the
          zeal or the energy shown by the apostles? Where is the Spirit of the
          living God? Is he not departed? Might not "Ichabod" be written on the
          walls of many a sanctuary? They have a name to live, , but are dead.
          They have their piety? Where is sincere religion? Where is practical
          godliness? Where is firm, decisive, puritanical piety? Thank God,
          there are a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their
          garments; but charity itself will not allow us to say that the church
          generally possesses the Spirit of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the next charge was, that there was a want of zeal throughout the
          church of Sardis. He says, "Be watchful." He looked on the church and
          saw the bishops slumbering, the elders slumbering, and the people
          slumbering; they were not, as once they were, watchful for the faith,
          striving together and earnestly contending for it, not wrestling
          against the enemy of souls, labouring to spread their Master's
          kingdom, but the apostle saw sleepiness, coldness, lethargy; therefore
          he said, "Be watchful." Oh! John, if from thy grave thou couldst start
          up, and see the church as thou didst at Sardis, having thine eyes
          anointed by the Spirit, thou wouldst say it is even so now. Ah! we
          have abundance of cold, calculating Christians, multitudes of
          professors; but where are the zealous ones? where are the leaders of
          the children of God? where are your heroes who stand in the day of
          battle? where are your men who "count not their lives dear unto them,"
          that they might win Christ, and be found in him? where are those who
          have an impassioned love for souls? How many of our pulpits are filled
          by earnest, enthusiastic preachers? Alas! look, at the church. She has
          builded herself fine palaces, imitating popery; she hath girded
          herself with vestments; she has gone astray from her simplicity; but
          she has lost the fire and the life which she once had. We go into our
          chapels now, and we see everything in good taste: we hear the organ
          play; the psalmody is in keeping with the most correct ear; the gown
          and the noble vestments are there, and everything is grand and goodly,
          and we think that God is honored. Oh for the days when Whitfields
          would preach on tubs once more, when their pulpits should be on
          Kennington Common, and their roofs the ceiling of God's sky. Oh for
          the time when we might preach in barns again, or in catacombs either,
          if we might but have the life of God that once they had in such
          places. What is the use of garnishing the shell when you have lost the
          kernel. Go and whitewash, for the life is gone. Garnish the outside of
          your cups and platters; but ye have lost the pure word of God. Ye have
          it not for a piece of bread; they flinch to speak the whole truth, or
          if they seem to speak it, it is with cold, meaningless, passionless
          words, as if it were nothing whether souls were damned or saved,
          whether heaven were filled or heaven depopulated, or whether Christ
          should see of the travail of his would and be satisfied. Do I speak
          fierce things? I can say as Irving once did, I might deserve to be
          broken on the wheel if I did not believe what I say to be the truth;
          for the utterance of such things I might deserve the stake; but God is
          my witness, I have endeavoured to judge and to speak impartially. With
          all that universal cant of charity now so prevalent I am at arm's
          length; I care not for it. Let us speak of things as we find them. WE
          do believe that the church has lost her zeal and her energy. But what
          do men say of us? "Oh! you are too excited." Good God! excited! when
          men are being damned; Excited! When we have the mission of heaven to
          preach to dying souls. EXCITED! preaching too much! when souls are
          lost. Why should it come to pass that one man should be perpetually
          labouring all the week, while others are lolling upon their couches,
          and preach only upon the Sabbath-day? Can I bear to see the laziness,
          the slothfulness, the indifference of ministers, and of churches,
          without speaking. No! there must be a protest entered, and we enter it
          now. Oh! Church of God, thou has a name to live, and art dead; thou
          art not watchful. Awake! awake! arise from the dead, and Christ shall
          give thee light.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third charge which John brought against Sardis was that they did
          not "look to the things that remained and were ready to die." I take
          it that this may related to the poor feeble saints, the true children
          of God, who were sorrowing, mourning, and groaning in their midst, who
          were so oppressed with sorrow on account of the state of Sardis, that
          they were "ready to die." And what does the church do now? Do the
          shepherds go after those that are wounded and sick, and those that are
          weary? Do they carry the lambs in their bosom, and gently lead those
          that are with young? Do they see to poor distressed consciences, and
          speak to those who feel their deadness in trespasses and sins? Yes,
          but how do they speak? They tell them to do things they cannot do --
          to perform impossible duties -- instead of "strengthening the things
          that remain and are ready to die" In how much contempt are the truly
          new-born children of God held in these times! They are called peculiar
          men, scouted as Antinomians, hissed at as being oddities, high
          doctrine men who have departed from the usual mode of pulling down
          God's word to men's fancies; they are called bigots, narrow-minded
          souls, and their creed is set down as dry, hard, rough, severe
          Calvinism. God's gospel called hard, rough, and severe! The things for
          which our fathers died are not called infamous things! Mark whether,
          if ye stand out prominently in the truth, you will not be abhorred and
          scouted. If you go into a village, and hear of poor people who are
          said to be doing a deal of mischief, are they not the people who
          understand most of the gospel? Go and ask the minister who are the
          persons that he most dislikes? and he will say, "We have a nasty lot
          of Antinomians here." What does he mean by that? Men who love the
          truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and will have it,
          and are therefore called a nasty set of Antinomians. Ah! we have lost
          what once we had. We do not now "strengthen the things that remain and
          are ready to die;" they are not looked after as they ought to be, not
          beloved, not fostered. The salt of the earth are now the offscouring
          of all things; men whom God has loved, and who have attained a high
          standing in godliness -- these are the men who will not bow the knee
          to Baal, and who therefore are cast into the fiery furnace of
          persecution and slander. O Sardis! Sardis! I see thee now. Thou hast
          defiled thy garments. Thank God, there are a few who have not followed
          the multitude to do evil, and who shall "walk in white, for they are
          worthy."
        </p>
        <p>
          Another charge which God has brought against the church is, that they
          were careless about the things which they heard. He says, "Remember,
          therefore, how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast; and
          repent." If I am wrong upon other points, I am positive that the sin
          of this age is impurity of doctrine, and laxity of faith. Now you know
          you are told every Sunday that it does not signify what you believe;
          that all sects and denominations will be saved; that doctrines are
          unimportant things; that as to the doctrines of God's grace, they are
          rather dangerous than otherwise, and the less you inquire about them
          the better; they are very good things for the priests, but you common
          people cannot understand them. Thus they keep back a portion of the
          gospel with cautious reserve; but having studied in the devil's new
          Jesuitical college, they understand how to call themselves particular
          Baptists, and then preach general doctrines, to call themselves
          Calvinists, and preach Arminianism, telling the people that it does
          not signify whether they preach damnable heresies instead of the truth
          of God. And what do the congregations say? "Well, he is a wise man,
          and ought to know." So you are going back into as bad a priestcraft as
          ever. Presbyter has become priest written large, and minister has
          become priest in many a place because persons do not search for
          themselves and endeavour to get hold of the truth of God. It is
          everywhere proclaimed that we are all right; that though one says God
          loved his people from before the foundation of the world, and the
          other that he did not; though one says that God is changeable and
          turns away from his people, and the other, that he will hold them fast
          to the end; though the one says that the blood of Christ avails for
          all for whom it was shed and the other, that it is inefficacious for a
          large number of those for whom he died; though one says that the works
          of the law are in some measure necessary, or at any rate that we must
          endeavour to improve what we have, and then we shall get more, while
          the other says, that "by grace we are saved through faith, and that
          not of ourselves, it is the gift of God," yet both are right. A new
          age this, when falsehood and truth can kiss each other! New times
          these when fire and water can become friendly! Glorious times these
          when there is an alliance between hell and heaven, though God knows,
          we are of vastly different families. Ah! now, who cares for truth
          except a few narrow-minded bigots as they are called. Election --
          horrible! Predestination -- awful! Final perseverance -- desperate!
          Yet, turn to the pages of the Puritans, and you will see that these
          truths were preached every day. Turn to the Fathers; read Augustine,
          and you will see that these were the truths for which he would have
          bled and died. Read the Scriptures, and if every page is not full of
          them I have not read them aright, or any child of God either. Ay,
          laxity of doctrine is the great fault now; we solemnly protest against
          it. You may fancy that I am raising an outcry about nothing at all.
          Ah! no; my anxious spirit sees the next generation -- what will that
          be. This generation -- Arminianism. What next? Pelagianism. And what
          next? Popery. And what next? I leave you to guess. The path of error
          is always downward. We have taken one step in the wrong direction; God
          knows where we shall stop. If there had not been sturdy men in ages
          gone by, the Lord would not have left to us a remnant even now; all
          grace must have died, and we had become like unto Gomorrah and unto
          Sodoma. Oh, church of the living God, awake! awake! Once more write
          truth upon thy banner; stamp truth upon thy sword; and for God and for
          his word, charge home. Ye knights of truth, and truth alone, shall sit
          king over the whole world!
        </p>
        <p>
          But now I have lifted up the whip, I must have another lash. Look on
          any section of the church you like to mention, not excepting that to
          which I belong; and let me ask you whether they have not defiled their
          garments. Look at the church of England. Her articles are pure and
          right in most respects; yet see how her garments are defiled. She hath
          made the Queen her Head instead of God; she bows before the state, and
          worships the golden calf that is set up before her. Look at her
          abominations, her pluralities, her easy living bishops doing nothing;
          look at her ungodly clergymen in the country, living in sin. The
          churchman who does not know that his church has defiled her garments
          is partial to his mother, as indeed he ought to be, but he is too
          partial to speak the truth. But good churchmen themselves weep,
          because what I say is true. Then look at John Wesley's body; have not
          they defiled their garments? See how they have lately been contending
          with a despotism as accursed as any that ever brooded over the slaves
          in America? See how they have been rent in sunder, and how imperfect
          in doctrine they are too after all, professedly at least, not holding
          the truth of God. Look into what denomination you please, Independent,
          or Baptist, or any other -- have they not all defiled their garments
          in some way or other? Look at the churches around, and see how they
          have defiled their garments by giving baptism to those who whom it was
          never intended, and degrading a holy church ordinance to become a mere
          sop with which they feed their babes. And see how they have taken away
          Christ's honor, how they have taken the bread that was meant for the
          children, and cast it to ungodly persons. Look at our own
          denomination: see how it has deserted the leading truths of the
          gospel. For a proof hereof, I refer you to hundreds of our pulpits. Oh
          church of God! I am but a voice crying in the wilderness, but I must
          cry still, "How art thou fallen from heaven, thou son of the morning!
          how art thou fallen!" "Remember how thou hast received and heard, and
          hold fast, and repent." If thou dost not watch, thy Master will come
          upon thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know in what hour he will
          come unto thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But now we come to far easier work; not because we would shun what
          we conceive to be our duty, even at the expense of offending many now
          present, but because we always delight to speak well if we can. "Thou
          has a few names even in Sardis that have not defiled their garments."
          He we have SPECIAL PRESERVATION. Mark, "Thou hast a few names." Only a
          few; not so few as some think, but not as many as others imagine! A
          few compared with the mass of professors; a few compared even with the
          true children of God, for many of them have defiled their garments.
          They were but a few, and those few were even I Sardis. There is not a
          church on earth that is so corrupt but has "a few." You who are always
          fighting so much for your denomination, you think other denominations
          are Sardis; but there are a few even in Sardis. Even if the
          denomination is the worst of all Protestant sections, there are a few
          in Sardis; and perhaps that is as much as we can say of our
          denomination: so we will treat them all alike. There are a few in
          Sardis -- mark that. Not in what you conceive to be Philadelphia, your
          own blessed church, but in Sardis -- there are a few there. Where
          there is heresy and false doctrine, where there are many mistakes
          about rites and ceremonials, there are a few there; and even where
          they cringe before the state, there are a few there -- ay, and a
          goodly few too, a few whom we love, with whom we can hold communion.
          This makes us severe against the whole body, but it makes us very
          loving towards all the dear people of God everywhere. There are a few
          even in Sardis. Well, when I meet a brother who lives in Sardis, I
          will hope he is one of the few; and when you meet such, do you say,
          "Ah! well, I know my brother comes out of a bad church, but there are
          a few in Sardis, and very likely he is one of them." That is the kind
          of charity God loves; not the universal charity which says Sardis is
          all right, but that which says, some in her are sincere. We stand this
          morning like old Elijah, when he stood before God and said, "I, only
          I, am left, and they seek my life." But God whispers, "I have yet
          reserved unto myself seventy thousand that have not bowed the knee to
          Baal." Take heart, Christian, there are a few in Sardis -- do not
          forget that -- who have not defiled their garments. Take heart. It is
          not all rotten yet; there is a soundness in the core after all; there
          is "a remnant according to the election of grace;" there is "salt,"
          and for the sake of that salt, many who have defiled their garments in
          a measure will be saved. They will enter into heaven even as these few
          will; but unto the few there will be special honor and special
          blessing. Take heart then; and whenever you go to your chamber and
          mourn over the sad condition of the church, think you hear that good
          old woman in her closet groaning and crying; think you hear that
          minister faithfully dispensing the word; think you see that valiant
          deacon standing up for God's truth; think you see that young man
          strong in the midst of temptation; think of these few in Sardis, and
          they will cheer you. Do not be quite downcast. Some heroes have not
          turned their backs in the day of battle; some mighty men still fight
          for the truth. Be encouraged; there are a few in Sardis. But be
          careful, for perhaps you are not one of the few. Since there are but a
          few, there ought to be great searchings of heart. Let us look to our
          garments and see whether they be defiled. If they be not, we shall
          walk in white, for we are worthy through Jesus. Be active; be
          prayerful. The fewer the workmen to do the work the greater reason is
          there that you should be active. Be instant in season and out of
          season, because there are so few. Oh! if we had hundreds behind us, we
          might say, "Let them do the work;" but if we stand with only a few,
          how should each of those few rush hither and thither! A city is
          besieged: it is full of inhabitants; half of them are asleep; the
          others watch the walls, and thus they relieve each other. Another city
          has but a few defenders: see how that champion rushes first to that
          breach and routs the enemy; now he brings his might to another place;
          a bastion is assaulted, and he is there; now a postern is attacked --
          there he is with all his force behind him; he is here, he is there, he
          is everywhere, because he feels there is but a handful of men who can
          gather round him. Take courage, take heart; stir yourselves up to the
          sternest activity, for verily there are but a few in Sardis who have
          not defiled their garments. Above all, be prayerful. Put up your
          earnest cries to God that he would multiply the faithful, that he
          would increase the number of chosen ones who stand fast, that he would
          purify the church with fire in a furnace seven times heated, so that
          he might bring out her third part through the fire; cry unto God that
          the day may come when the much fine gold shall be no longer dim, when
          the glory shall again return unto Zion. Beg of God to remove the
          cloud, to take away "the darkness that may be felt." Be doubly
          prayerful, for there are but a few in Sardis who have not defiled
          their garments.

        <p>
          III. This brings us to the third point, which is a PECULIAR REWARD.
          "They shall walk in white, for they are worthy." The attentive reader
          will observe, that in quoting the passage just now, I left out two of
          the sweetest words in the passage. It reads: "They shall walk with me
          in white, for they are worthy." That is the very pith of the honor; if
          the rest of it be gold this is the jewel. "They shall walk with me in
          white." That is to say, communion with Christ on earth shall be the
          special reward of those who have not defiled their garments. Now, I
          must say a very hard thing again, but it is a true one. Go into what
          company you please, do you meet with many men who hold communion with
          Christ? Though they may be godly men, upright men, ask them if they
          hold communion with Christ, and will they understand you? If you give
          them some of those sweetly spiritual books, that those who hold
          fellowship love to read, they will say they are mystical, and they do
          not love them. Ask them whether they can spend an hour in meditation
          upon Christ, whether they ever rise to heaven and lay their head on
          the breast of the Saviour, whether they ever know what it is to enter
          into rest and get into Canaan; whether they understand how he has
          raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in
          Christ Jesus; whether they can often say,
        </p>
        <p>Abundant sweetness while I sing</p>
        <p>Thy love, my ravish'd heart o'erflows;</p>
        <p>Secure in thee my God and King</p>
        <p>Of glory that no period knows."</p>
        <p>
          Ask them that, and they will say, "We don't comprehend you." Now, the
          reason of it is in the first part of my sermon -- they have defiled
          their garments, and therefore Christ will not walk with them. He says,
          "Those that have not defiled their garments shall walk with me." Those
          who hold fast the truth, who take care to be free from the prevailing
          sins of the times, "These," he says, "shall walk with me; they shall
          be in constant fellowship with me; I will let them see that I am bone
          of their bone, and flesh of their flesh: I will bring them into the
          banqueting-house; my banner over them shall be love; they shall drink
          wine on the lees well refined; they shall have the secrets of the Lord
          revealed unto them, because they are the people who truly fear me:
          they shall walk with me in white." Oh, Christian! if thou wouldst have
          communion with Christ, the special way to win it is by not defiling
          thy garments, as the church has done.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we must dwell on the rest of the passage. "They shall walk with me
          in white, for they are worthy." A good old author says there is a
          reference here to that fact, that the rabbis allowed persons to walk
          in white who could trace their pedigree without a flew; but if they
          found any blot on their escutcheon, and could not trace their birth up
          to Abraham, they were not allowed to walk in white on certain days.
          Well, he says he thinks the passage means that those who have not
          defiled their garments will be able to prove their adoption, and will
          walk in white garments as being sure they are the sons of God. If we
          would be certain that we are the people of God, we must take care that
          we have no blots on our dress, for each one of those spatterings of
          the mire of this earth will cry out, and say "Perhaps you are not a
          child of God." Nothing is such a father of doubts as sin; sin is the
          very mother of our distress. He who is covered with sin must not
          expect to enjoy full assurance, but he who liveth close to his God,
          and keeps his garments unspotted from the world -- he shall walk in
          white, knowing that his adoption is sure.
        </p>
        <p>
          But chiefly we should understand this to refer to justification. "They
          shall walk in white;" that is, they shall enjoy a constant sense of
          their own justification by faith; they shall understand that the
          righteousness of Christ is imputed to them, that they have
        </p>
        <p>A matchless robe which far exceeds</p>
        <p>What earthly princes wear;"</p>
        <p>
          that they have been washed and make whiter than snow, and purified and
          made more cleanly than wool.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, it refers to joy and gladness: for white robes were holiday
          dresses among the Jews. They that have not defiled their garments,
          shall have their faces always bright; they shall understand what
          Solomon meant when he said, "Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and
          drink thy wine with a merry heart. Let thy garments be always white,
          for God hath accepted thy works." He who is accepted of God shall wear
          white garments, being received by the Father -- garments of joy and
          gladness. Whence so many doubts, so much distress, and misery, and
          mourning? It is because the church has defiled her garments; they do
          not here below walk in white, because they are not worthy.
        </p>
        <p>
          And lastly, it refers to walking in white before the throne of God.
          Those who have not defiled their garments here, shall most certainly
          walk in white up yonder, where the white-robed hosts sing perpetual
          hallelujahs to the Most High. If thou hast not defiled thy garments,
          thou mayest say, "I know whom I have believed;" not for my works, not
          by way of merit, but as the reward of grace. If there be joys
          inconceivable, happiness beyond a dream, bliss which imagination
          knoweth not, blessedness which even the stretch of desire hath not
          reached, thou shalt have all these: thou shalt walk in white, since
          thou art worthy. Christ shall say to thee "Well done, good and
          faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          But what shall be done with such persons as live in the church, but
          are not of it having a name to live, but are dead? What shall be done
          with mere professors who are not possessors? What shall become of
          those who are only outwardly religious but inwardly are in the gall of
          bitterness? We answer, as good Calvin did once: "They shall walk in
          black, for they are unworthy." They shall walk in black -- the
          blackness of God's destruction. They shall walk in black -- the
          blackness of hopeless despair. They shall walk in black -- the
          blackness of incomparable anguish. They shall walk in black -- the
          blackness of damnation. They shall walk in black for ever, because
          they were found unworthy. O professors, search yourselves. O
          ministers, search yourselves. O ye, who make a profession of religion
          now, put your hands within your hearts, and search your souls. You
          live in the sight of a rein-trying God. Oh! try your own reins, and
          search your own hearts. It is not a matter of half-importance for
          which I plead, but a matter of double importance. I beseech you,
          examine and cross-examine your own souls, and see whether ye be in the
          path, for it will go ill with you if ye shall find at last that ye
          were in the church, but not of it, that ye make a profession of
          religion, but it was only a cloak for your hypocrisy -- if ye should
          have entered into his courts below, and be shut out of the courts
          above. Remember, the higher the pinnacle of profession the direr your
          fall of destruction. Beggared kings, exile princes, crownless
          emperors, are always subjects of pity. Professor, what wilt thou think
          of thyself when thy robes are taken from thee, when thy crown of
          profession is taken from thy head, and thou standest the hiss of even
          vile men, the scoff of blasphemers, the jeer of those who, whatever
          they were, were not hypocrites, as thou art? They will cry to thee,
          "Art thou become like one of us? Thou professor, thou high-flying man,
          art thou become like one of us?" And ye will hide your guilty heads in
          the dark pit of perdition, but all in vain, for you never will be able
          to avoid that hiss which shall ever greet you. "What! thou!" the
          drunkard whom you told to drink no more will say "Art thou become like
          one of us?" And the harlot whom you scorned, and the young debauched
          man whom you warned, will stare you in the face, and say, "What! you!
          You who talked of religion. A pretty fellow you were! Art thou become
          one of us?" Oh! I think I hear them saying in hell, "Here's a parson,
          come here; here's a deacon; here's a church member; here's a man who
          has had the sacramental wine within his lips; here's a man that has
          had the baptismal water on his garments." Ah! take care. There are but
          a few names in Sardis who shall walk in white. Be ye of that few. May
          God give you grace that ye be not reprobates, but may be accepted of
          the Lord in that day! May he give you mercy, that when he severs the
          chaff from the wheat, you may abide as the good corn, and may not be
          swept away into unquenchable fire! The Lord in mercy bless this
          warning, and hear our supplication, for Christ's sake. Amen.
