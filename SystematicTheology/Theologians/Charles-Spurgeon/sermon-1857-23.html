        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.129)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, April 26, 1857, by the</p>

          "Let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen." --
          Psalm 72:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          THERE was a time when this prayer would have been unnecessary; a
          period, in fact, when it could not have been offered, seeing the thing
          to be asked for was already in being. A time there was when the word
          rebellion had not been uttered against the great magistracy of heaven;
          a day there was, when the slime of sin had never been left by the
          trail of the serpent, for no serpent then existed, and no evil spirit.
          There was a hour, never to be forgotten, when the seraph might have
          flapped his wing for aye, and never have found aught of discord, or
          aught of rebellion or of anarchy throughout God's universe, when the
          mighty angels assembled in the halls of the Most High, and without
          exception did reverence to their liege Lord, and paid him homage due;
          when the vast creation revolved around its center, the great
          metropolis, the throne of God, and paid its daily and hourly homage
          unto him, when the harmonies of creation always came to one spot and
          found their focus near the throne of God. There was a time when every
          star was bright; when all space was filled with loveliness, when
          holiness, purity, and happiness, were like a robe which mantled the
          entire creation. This world itself was once fair and lovely -- so fair
          and lovely that we who live in these erring times can scarcely guess
          its beauty. It was the house of song, and the dwelling-place of
          praise. If it had no pre-eminence among its sister spheres, certainly
          it was inferior to none of them, surrounded with beauty, girt with
          gladness, and having in it holy and heavenly inhabitants. It was a
          house to which the angels themselves loved to resort, where the holy
          spirits, the morning stars, delighted to sing together over this
          beautiful and fair earth of ours. But now how changed! how different!
          Now it is our duty devoutly to bend our knees and pray that the whole
          earth may yet be filled with his glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          In one sense this prayer is still unnecessary, for in a certain sense
          the whole earth is filled with God's glory. "All thy works praise
          thee, O God," is as true now as it was in paradise. The stars still
          sing their Maker's praise; no sin hath stopped their voice, no discord
          hath made a jarring note among the harmonies of the spheres. The earth
          itself still praiseth its Maker, the exhalations, as they arise with
          morn, are still a pure offfering, acceptable to their Maker. The
          lowing of the cattle, the singing of the birds, the leaping of the
          fishes, and the delights of animal creation, are still acceptable as
          votive offerings to the Moat High. The mountains still bring
          righteousness; on their hoary summits God's holy feet might tread, for
          they are yet pure and spotless. Still do the green valleys, laughing
          with their verdure send up their shouts to the Most High. The praise
          of God is sung by every wind it is howled forth in dread majesty by
          the voice of the tempest, the winds resound it, and the waves, with
          their thousand hands, clap, keeping chorus in the great march of God.
          The whole earth is still a great orchestra for God's praise, and his
          creatures still take up various parts in the eternal song, which, ever
          swelling and ever increasing, shall by-and-by mount to its climax in
          the consummation of all things. In that sense, therefore, the prayer
          is still inappropriate. God, who filleth all in all, and filleth earth
          and heaven, needeth not to have more glory, as to the essence of his
          glory; for still he is glorified in the whole earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          But David intended this prayer in another sense. "Let the whole earth
          be filled with his glory. Amen, and Amen;" not as Creator, but as a
          moral Governor, and a Ruler. It is as Governor that we have revolted
          from God and done dishonor to him; it is as our Master, our Ruler, our
          Judge, that we have done despite to his glory, and have trampled on
          his crown. It is, therefore, in this respect that David wished that
          the whole earth might be filled with God's glory. He desired that
          every idol temple might be cast down -- that the name of Jehovah might
          be sung by every lip, that he in his person might be loved by every
          heart, and be for ever adored as "God over all blessed for ever." A
          foolish wish, say you, for it never can be accomplished. Surely the
          day will never come when hoary systems of superstition shall die.
          What! shall colossal systems of infidelity and of idolatry totter to
          their fall? They have resisted the battering-ram for many a year; and
          yet shall they pass away, and shall God's kingdom come, and his will
          be done on earth, even as it is in heaven? Nay, it is no day dream of
          a boy, it is no wish of the enthusiast. Mark who uttered that prayer,
          and where he was when he uttered it. It was the prayer of a dying
          king; it was the prayer of a holy man of God, whose eyes were just
          then lighted up with brightness in view of the celestial city, as he
          stood on the mighty Pisgah, "and viewed the landscape o'er " -- the
          prayer of the dying psalmist, when on the margin of his life he
          surveyed the ocean -- the prayer of a mighty king, when he saw the
          scroll of prophecy unfolded before him for the last time and was about
          to be ushered into the presence of his Maker. He uttered this as his
          last best wish and desire; and when he had uttered it he sank back in
          his bed, and said, "The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended."
          It was his last prayer: "Let the whole earth be filled with his glory;
          Amen, and Amen."
        </p>
        <p>
          First, this morning, I shall try to explain the prayer, then I shall
          labor as God shall enable me, to inflame the hearts of all Christian
          men to desire the object of this prayer; then offer a word or two of
          counsel as to the pursuit of the object here spoken of; and conclude
          by noticing the promise to buoy our hopes up. By-and-by "the earth
          shall be filled with his glory."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, let me EXPLAIN THE PRAYER. It is a large prayer -- a
          massive one. A prayer for a city needs a stretch of faith, ay, there
          are times when a prayer for one man is enough to stagger our belief;
          for we can scarcely think that God will hear us for even that one. But
          how great this prayer is, how comprehensive! "Let the whole earth be
          filled with his glory, Amen, and Amen." It doth not exempt one single
          country, however trodden under the foot of superstition; it doth not
          leave out one single nation, however abandoned. For the cannibal as
          well as for the civilised, for the man that grasps the tomahawk as
          well as for the man who bends his knee in supplication, this prayer is
          uttered, "Let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen and
          Amen."
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me just very briefly note what I believe the psalmist meant. He
          desired that the true religion of God might be sent into every
          country. Looking from that point of view, as we utter this prayer,
          what a multitude of thoughts rush into our minds! Lo, yonder we see
          the hoary systems of ancient superstition; we behold multitudes bowing
          down before Budha and Brahma, and paying their adorations to idols
          that are no gods: we pray for them, that they may cease to be
          idolaters, and that God's name may be known amongst them. Yonder we
          see the crescent, gleaming with a pale and sickly light, and we pray
          that the followers of Mahomed may bow themselves before the cross,
          renounce the scimitar, and return to him that loved them, casting away
          all the uncleanness and filthiness of their former religion. We see
          yonder the scarlet woman on the seven hills, and we include her in our
          prayer; we pray that God may cast down Rome; that he may overturn her
          deep, hell-rooted foundations, and may cause her tyranny over the
          nations to cease, that she may no more be drunk with the blood of the
          slain, and no more with her idolatries and witchcrafts lead the
          nations astray. We include her in our supplications. We look on
          nations that are almost too debased lo be included in the roll of
          mankind; we see the Hottentot in his kraal, the Bushman and the
          Bechuana, and we put up our prayer for these: "Let the whole earth be
          filled with his glory. Amen and Amen." Let Africa's center, once
          thought to be barren but now discovered to be glorious in fertility,
          become fertile also in works of grace; let the regions whence our
          black brethren have been driven to slavery become the homes of
          blessedness, and the regions of God's praise. We cast our eye to other
          regions, where the scalp is still at the Indian's girdle, where still
          they wash their hands in blood and delight themselves in murder, or we
          look to that huge empire of China, and we see the myriads still lost
          in infidelity and a partial idolatry, which is consuming them and
          destroying them, and we pray, "Let the whole earth be filled with his
          glory; Amen, and Amen." Yes, it is a great prayer, but we mean it. We
          are praying against Juggernaut, and against Budha, and against every
          form and fashion of false religion. We are crying against anti-Christ,
          and we are praying that the day may come when every temple shall be
          dismantled, when every shrine shall be left poor as poverty, and when
          there shall be no temple but the temple of the Lord God of Hosts, and
          when no song shall be sung but the song of Hallelujah; unto him that
          loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood."
        </p>
        <p>
          But we mean more than this. We ask not merely the nominal Christianity
          of any country, but the conversion of every family in every country.
          "Let the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen, and Amen." Is
          that wish too great, too high? Are we too sanguine in our
          expectations? No; "The knowledge of the Lord" is to "cover the earth,
          as the waters cover the sea," and that is entirely. We do not wish to
          see dry places here and there, but as the deep foundations of the
          depths are covered with the sea, so we wish that every nation may be
          covered with God's truth. And so we pray that every family may receive
          it; yes, we pray that every household may have its morning and its
          evening prayer; we pray that every family may be brought up in the
          fear of the Lord, that every child may, on its mother's knee, say,
          "Our Father," and that the answer may come to the infant's prayer,
          "Thy kingdom come." Yes, we ask of God that every house may be like
          the tents of Judah, consecrated to God; we ask that even the kraal of
          the Hottentot may become a synagogue for God's praise. Our desire is,
          that man may become so holy, that every meal may become a eucharist,
          and every cup a chalice, and every garment a priestly vestment, and
          that all their labors may be consecrated to the Lord. We are bound to
          expect it, for it is said, "Even the bells upon the horses shall be
          holiness to the Lord, and even the pots in the Lord's house shall be
          like the bowls before the altar."
        </p>
        <p>
          But, we go further than that. We do not ask merely for household
          conversion, but for the individual salvation of every being existing.
          "Let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen." Should
          there be one heart that doth not beat in God's praise, or one lip that
          is dumb in the melody of thanksgiving, then there would be yet a spot
          left which would not be filled with God's praise, and that one left
          unconverted would blot and blur the whole great work of filling the
          earth with God's glory. A missionary once said, and said truly, that
          if all the people in the world were converted except one man in
          Siberia, it would be worth while for all the Christians in England to
          make a pilgrimage to Siberia, if that man's salvation could not be
          accomplished in any other way. And so it would. The salvation of one
          soul is unutterably precious, and when we offer this prayer we exclude
          none. We pray that the atheist, the blasphemer, the hardened rebel,
          the prodigate, may each be filled with God's glory; and then we ask
          for mercy for the whole earth; we leave not out so much as one, but so
          hope and expect the day when all mankind shall bow at the Saviour's
          feet, when every hand shall bring tribute, every lip a song, and every
          eye shall speak its gladness and its praise. This I believe to be the
          psalmist's prayer -- that every man might be converted, and that in
          fact everywhere, in every heart and conscience, God might reign
          without a rival, Lord paramount over the great wide world.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Well, now, I am going, in the second place, to try to STIR YOU UP,
          my brethren, to desire this great, this wonderful thing for which
          David prayed. Oh! for the rough and burning eloquence of the hermit of
          old, who stirred the nations of Europe to battle for the cross! I
          would to God this morning I could speak as he did when the multitude
          were gathered together, or, like that bishop of the church, who
          followed him, who addressed the mighty multitudes with such burning
          words of fiery eloquence, that at last they heaved to and fro with
          waves of excitement, and every man, starting to his feet and grasping
          his sword cried, "Deus vult," "The Lord wills it," and rushed forward
          to battle and to victory. In a higher and holier sense I preach the
          crusade to-day, not as a hermit, but as God's preacher, I come forth
          to stir you up, men and brethren, to desire and seek after this great
          and highest wish of the faithful, that the whole earth might be filled
          with his glory. And how shall I stir you up except by leading you to
          one or two contemplations?
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I beseech you, contemplate the majesty of God; or rather, since
          I am unable to help you to do that just now, let me remind you of
          seasons when you have in some measure grasped the thought of his
          divinity. Have you never at night gazed upon the starry orbs, with the
          thought that God was the Maker of them all until your soul was steeped
          in reverent adoration, and you bowed your head with wonder and with
          praise, and said, "Great God! how infinite art thou?" Have you never,
          in looking upon God's pure earth, when you have seen the mountains,
          and the clouds, and the rivers, and the floods, said --
        </p>
        <p>"These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,</p>
        <p>Almighty! Thine this universal frame,</p>
        <p>Thus wondrous fair: Thyself how wondrous then?"</p>
        <p>
          Oh! methinks you must have had some glowing bursts of devotion,
          somewhat like that burst of Coleridge in his hymn from the valley of
          Chamounix or, like that of Thompson, when he leads the Seasons out to
          sing God's praise, or, like that matchless burst of Milton, when he
          extolled God, making Adam in the garden praise his Maker. Yes, there
          have been moments when we could bow before God, when we felt our own
          nothingness, and knew that he was all-in-all. Ah! if you can get such
          thoughts as these, my friends, this morning, I know that the next
          thought akin to this will be -- "Let the whole earth be filled with
          his glory; Amen, and Amen." You cannot bow before God yourself and
          adore him, without wishing that all the rest of mankind should do the
          same. Ah! and the thought has gone further; ye have wished that even
          inanimate objects might praise him. Oh! ye mountains, let the shaggy
          woods upon your crowns wave in adoration ye that with bald heads lift
          up yourselves loftier than those minor hills, let the clouds that gird
          you serve like wings of cherubim to veil your faces. But oh! adore
          him, adore him, for he is worthy of all adoration; let him ever be
          extolled. You cannot, I repeat, have great thoughts of God yourselves,
          without spontaneously rising up and saying, "Let the whole earth be
          filled with his glory. Amen, and Amen."
        </p>
        <p>
          But, my brethren, turn your eyes yonder. What see you there? You see
          the Son of God stepping from the place of his glory, casting aside the
          garments of his majesty, and robing himself in garments of clay. Do
          you see him yonder? He is nailed to a cross. Oh! can ye behold him, as
          his head hangs meekly on his breast? Can ye catch the accents of his
          lips, when he says, "Father, forgive them?" Do you see him with the
          thorn-crown still about his brow, with bleeding head, and hands, and
          feet? And doth not your soul burst with adoration, when ye see him
          giving himself for your sins? What! can ye look upon this miracle of
          miracles, the death of the Son of God, without feeling reverence
          stirred within your bosom -- a marvellous adoration that language
          never can express? No, I am sure you cannot. You bow yourself before
          that cross, you close your eyes that are already filled with tears,
          and as you bend your head upon the mount of Calvary I hear you say,
          "Jesus, have mercy upon me." And when you feel the blood applied to
          your conscience, and know that he has blotted out your sins, you are
          not a man unless you start from your knees and cry, "Let the whole
          earth be filled with his glory, Amen, and Amen." What! did he bend his
          awful head down to the shades of death? What! did he hang upon a cross
          and bleed, and shall not earth praise him? O ye dumb, sure this might
          loose your tongues. O ye silent ones, ye might begin to speak; and if
          ye do not, sure the very stones will speak, and the rocks that rent
          once at his death will rend again, and open a wide mouth to let their
          hallelujahs ascend to heaven. Ah! the cross makes us praise him.
          Lovers of Jesus, can you love him without desiring that his kingdom
          may come? What! can ye bow before him, and yet not wish to see your
          Monarch master of the world? Out on ye, men, if ye can pretend to love
          your Master, and yet not desire to see him the conqueror. I give you
          not a doit for your piety, unless it leads you to wish that the same
          mercy which has been extended to you might reach to others, and unless
          it prompts you to pray this prayer, "Let the whole earth be filled
          with his glory, Amen, and Amen."
        </p>
        <p>
          But gaze a moment longer. The man that died for sinners sleeps within
          a grave; a little while he sleeps, until the angel rolls away the
          stone and gives him liberty. Do you behold him, as he wakes up from
          his slumber, and radiant with majesty, and glorious with light,
          affrights his guard, and stands a risen man? Do you see him, as he
          climbs to heaven, as he ascends to the paradise of God, sitting at the
          right hand of his Father till his enemies are made his footstool? Do
          you see him, as principalities and powers bow before him, as cherubim
          and seraphim cast their crowns at his feet? Do you hear him? Do you
          hear him intercede, and do you hear also the music of the glorified
          spirits, ever chanting perpetual lays before his throne? And do you
          not wish that we might
        </p>
        <p>"Prepare new honors for his name,</p>
        <p>And songs before unknown?"</p>
        <p>
          Oh! it is impossible to see the glorified Christ with the eye of
          faith, without exclaiming afterwards, "Let the whole earth be filled
          with his glory; Amen, and Amen.

          But now one other thought. Common humanity urges us to pray this
          prayer. Did you never walk through a village full of drunkenness and
          profanity? Did you never see at every ale-house poor wretched bloated
          carcases that once were men standing, or rather leaning against the
          posts staggering with drunkenness! Have you never looked into the
          houses of the people, and beheld them as dens of iniquity, at which
          your soul did turn aghast? Have you never walked through that village
          and seen the poverty, and degradation, and misery of the inhabitants,
          and sighed over it? Yes, you have. But was it ever your privilege to
          walk through that village in after years, when the gospel has been
          preached there? It has been mine. Once it was my delight to labor in a
          village where sin and iniquity had once been rampant, and I can say
          with joy and happiness, that almost from one end of the village to the
          other, at the hour of eventide, you would have heard the voice of song
          coming from every roof-tree, echoing from every heart. Oh! what a
          pleasant thing to walk through the village, when drunkenness hath
          almost ceased, when debauchery is dead, and when men and women go
          forth to labor with joyful hearts, singing as they go the praises of
          the ever-living God, and when at sunset the humble cottager calls his
          children together, and reads them some portion from the book of truth,
          and then together they bend their knees -- oh! happy, happy
          households! Yes, we have seen some such places, and when our hearts
          have been gladdened by the sight, we have said, "tot the whole earth
          be filled with his glory; Amen and Amen." It has been our delight
          sometimes to tabernacle amongst the lowly for a little season. We have
          had our seat given us in the chimney corner for awhile, and by-and-by
          as the time to retire drew nigh, the good man of the house has said to
          the prophet's servant, "Now, sir, will you read for us to-night, as
          you are here?" And we have noticed the faces of the little group
          around us, as we have read some portion like this -- "Truly God is
          good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart." And then we
          have said, "No, we will not pray to-night, you must be priest in your
          own house, and pray yourself." And then the good man has prayed for
          his children, and when we have seen them rise up and kiss their parent
          for the night we have thought, "Well, if this is the kind of family
          that religion makes, let the whole earth be filled with his glory. For
          the blessedness and for the happiness of man, let God's kingdom come,
          and let his will be done." Contrast that, my brethren, with the
          murderous rites of the Hindoo; contrast it with the savagery and
          barbarism of heathen lands. If I could bring some barbarian to stand
          before you this morning, he might himself be a better preacher than I
          can be, as with his almost unintelligible utterances and clicks he
          would begin to tell you the few ideas he had, which ideas began and
          ended with himself, and with the miserable prey on which he lived. You
          would say, "What!-there such a miserable race as this?" Let us at once
          kneel down and utter this prayer, and then rise up and labor to
          fulfill it -- "Let the whole earth be filled with his glory." I feel
          that I cannot stir you this morning as I wished. (If I were a Welshman
          I think I could move your hearts they have such a knack of waking
          persons up by what they say.) Oh! my soul longs for that day, it
          sigheth for that blessed period. Would God that all sighed and longed
          for it too, and were prepared to work and labor, watch and pray, until
          we should indeed sing with truth,
        </p>
        <p>"Hallelujah! Christ the Lord</p>
        <p>God Omnipotent shall reign;</p>
        <p>Hallelujah! Christ in God,</p>
        <p>God in Christ is all-in-all."</p>
        <p>May such a day come, as it certainly will!</p>
        <p>
          III. And now I am to give you A FEW COUNSELS IN THE PURSUIT OF THIS
          OBJECT.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, you cannot pray this prayer unless you seek in your own life to
          remove every impediment to the spread of Christ's kingdom. You cannot
          pray it, sir; you cannot say, "Let the whole earth be filled with his
          glory; Amen, and Amen," -- you who cursed God yesterday. How can the
          same lip that cursed God say, "Let the whole earth be filled with his
          glory; Amen, and Amen." You cannot say it, sir, -- you who break his
          commandments, and violate his laws, and run riot against his
          government. If you said it you would be a vile hypocrite. Is there
          anything in our character and conduct which has a tendency to prevent
          the spread of the gospel? Oh! we say it with pain, there are many
          members of the churches everywhere whose characters are such that if
          they remain what they are, Christ's gospel never can fill the whole
          earth, for it cannot fill their hearts. You know the men. They call
          themselves God's dear people, and they would be dear if they were
          given away; certainly nobody would buy them at the lowest price in the
          world. They say that they are his precious ones, and they must be very
          precious, or else he never would have any thoughts of mercy towards
          such a set as they are. And they will sometimes say, "Ah! we are the
          Lord's elect," and they live in sin. They say there are very few of
          their sort, and we reply, "What a mercy!" If there were we should need
          many of our public buildings to be turned at once into gaols, to lock
          up such people. No, we do not believe in the characters of men who
          make a profession of religion and yet do not live up to it. Do not
          tell us about such profession, just be quiet altogether. Do not call
          yourselves religious, and yet act as others do. I do prefer a man that
          is a right down blustering sinner when he is at it. Do not let him go
          into sin, and then mask and cover it all up. There is no use in it.
          The man is not honest. I do think there is some hope of a man who is a
          down-right, thorough-bred sinner, that goes at it and is not ashamed
          of it, but a rascally, canting hypocrite, that comes crawling into our
          church, and yet lives in sin all the while -- such a man -- God
          Almighty may save him, but it is very seldom that he does save such
          people. He lets them go on, and reap the fruit of their own ways; he
          lets them find out, after all, that hypocrisy is a sure road to hell,
          and never can lead to heaven. We must look well to ourselves, by God's
          Spirit, or else we must not pray this prayer: "Let the whole earth be
          filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen."
        </p>
        <p>
          And there is my friend Mr. Save-all. I am sure he cannot pray this
          prayer, at least I think I hear him in his soul say, "O Lord, let the
          whole earth be filled with thy glory." A contribution is requested to
          assist the cause in so doing. Oh! no not at all. Like the old negro
          woman we have all heard of, who sang, "Fly abroad, thou mighty
          gospel," and put her eye up in such a devout frame, that her brother
          negro who was passing the plate that day could not get her to pay any
          attention to him, till he jogged her elbow, and said, "Yes, sissy, it
          is well enough to sing, Fly abroad, thou mighty gospel;' if you would
          give it wings then it might, but you are just singing this and doing
          nothing at all." Now, what is the good of a man singing, "Fly abroad,
          thou mighty gospel," and praying this prayer, "Let the whole earth be
          filled with his glory," if he has got six thousand a year coming in
          for doing nothing at all? It is no use for a man to put on a pair of
          lawn sleeves and say, "Oh, it is my devout desire that the whole earth
          may be filled with his glory," and then leave the world to stare at
          him and consider what good he is. It is no use for a man simply to
          have a curacy or something of that sort, buy his manuscripts cheap,
          come up and read off two sermons twenty minutes long, go home with a
          good conscience that he has done duty twice, and then say, "Let the
          whole earth be filled with his glory." Why, my friends, there is no
          chance of it if that is the way it is to be done, not the slightest in
          the world; to cry, "Let the whole earth be filled with his glory," and
          then stand still and do nothing at all; or merely do some nominal
          well-paid work, and feel it is all over. We want something in the
          ministry a little different before even ministers can pray this prayer
          in sincerity. I am not finding fault with any of my brethren, but I
          would recommend them to preach thirteen times a week, and then they
          can pray this prayer a little better. Three times a week would not do
          for me. It would hurt my constitution; preaching thirteen times a week
          is good healthy exercise. But you shut yourself up in your study, or
          what is ten times worse, you do nothing at all, but just take it easy
          all the week till the Sunday comes, and then borrow a sermon out of an
          old magazine, or buy one of the helps for ministers, or take down one
          of Charles Simeon's skeletons and preach it. My good man, you cannot
          pray in that fashion. The poorest Sabbath-school teacher has a better
          right to pray that prayer than you have. You go to a fire that is
          raging vehemently, and say, "Oh, let it be put out!" and stand with
          your hands in your pockets, while a little boy that is standing there
          and passing the bucket may pray that prayer sincerely, but you cannot.
          No, my brethren, you must be up and doing for your blaster, or else
          you cannot pray this prayer. You say, "I am doing my duty;" but my
          friend, that is not much use, you must do a little more than that,
          doing your duty, as you think, is often doing but a very small part of
          your duty. What is a man's duty? "Why, as much as he is paid for,
          Sir." Oh, no, I think not; a man's duty is to do whatsoever his hand
          findeth to do, with all his might; and until he does that he cannot
          with any sincerity offer this prayer, "Let the whole world be filled
          with his glory "Amen, and Amen." Ah, there are some here that I could
          mention, who by their unparalleled philanthropy, by their unique and
          unrivalled love of their fellow-creatures, have done much to fill the
          earth with God's glory; for they have let the world see what Christian
          men and Christian women are able to do when God's love has touched
          their hearts. There are to be found some who by devoting themselves to
          the service of their Master, and spending and being spent for him,
          have done much to heighten the opinion of the world towards
          Christianity, and make them think better of the Christian church than
          they would have done if it had not been for these few rare, mighty
          heroes in the midst of us. "Let the whole earth be filled with his
          glory; Amen, and Amen." But it cannot be, speaking after the manner of
          men, unless we each of us labor and endeavor as God shall help us, to
          extend the kingdom of our Master.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, my friends, have I been urging you to an impossible toil Have
          I been telling Christian men to pray for that which never can be
          granted? Ah! no, blessed be God, we are taught to pray for nothing but
          that which God has been pleased to give. He has told us to pray that
          his kingdom may come, and his kingdom will come, and come most
          assuredly, too. Hark! hark! hark! I hear mustering for the battle;
          yonder in the dim distance I see the armies gathering; yes, I can
          dimly see their ensign, and behold the flag that waves before them!
          Who are these that come? Who are these? These are nobler and better
          men than we! These are warriors of Christ, as yet, perhaps, unborn.
          These are the mighty men, the rear-guard, these are the imperial guard
          of heaven, who have been fighting long. The enemy hath sometimes fled,
          but hitherto we have achieved but little, the phalanx of the foe
          standeth still fast and firm, and we have blunted our blades against
          the shields of the mighty. As yet the victory is not complete; the
          Master standeth on the hill with his reserve. Lo! I see them -- they
          are coming, they are coming. Some of us shall live to see them -- men
          those tongues are made of fire, whose hearts are full of flame, who
          speak like angels and preach like cherubim! The men are coming, and
          happy shall the man be that marks the triumph; each tramp of theirs
          shall be the tramp of victory, each blast of theirs shall level walls
          of spiritual Jerichos, each blow of their horn shall clear an acre of
          valiant foemen, each stroke from their sword shall cleave a dragon,
          and every blow from their arm shall be mighty to overturn thrones and
          scepters and kings! They come, they come; and till they come what
          shall we do? -- Why fight on and hold our posts. But lo! they come.
          Let us be cheered with the thought that victory is certain. The hour
          cometh when this mighty band of heroes shall sweep the earth with the
          banner of victory. And when in years to come, you and I shall look
          upon the plain of battle, we shall see there an idol broken, there a
          colossal system of wickedness dashed in pieces, there a false prophet
          slain, there a deluder cast away. Oh! glorious shall be that day when
          victory shall be complete; when the horse and the rider shall be
          overthrown; when the battle that is without blood and without smoke,
          without rolling of garments of warriors, shall be completed by the
          shout of victory through him that hath loved us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, we will wait awhile. We will still continue on this side with
          our Master; for though we are fighters now, we shall be winners
          by-and-by. Yes, man, woman, ye who are unknown, unnoted, but are
          striving for your Master, by prayer, and praise, and labor, the day is
          coming when everyone of you shall have a crown of victory! The hour is
          coming when your heart shall beat high, for you shall share the
          conquest, those men who are coming, without whom we cannot be made
          perfect, shall not have all the honor. We who have borne the brunt of
          the fight shall have a share of the glory; the victors shall divide
          the spoil, and we shall divide the spoil with them. Thou, tried,
          afflicted, forgotten and unknown, thou shalt soon have the palm-branch
          in thy hand, and thou shalt ride in triumph through the streets of
          earth and heaven, when thy Master shall make show of principalities
          and powers openly, in the day of his victory! Only still continue,
          only wrestle on, and thou shalt be crowned.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I have got one word to say, and then Amen. You know, in Roman
          warfare there were special rewards given for special works. There was
          the mural crown for the man that first scaled the rampart and stood
          upon the wall. I am looking on this great congregation with a thought
          in my mind which agitates my spirit. Young men! young men! is there
          not one among you that can win a mural crown? Have I not one true
          Christian heart here that is set for work and labor? Have not I one
          man that will devote himself for God and for his truth? Henry Martyn!
          thou art dead; and is thy mantle buried with thee? Brainerd, thou
          sleepest with thy fathers; and is thy spirit dead too, and shall there
          never be another Brainerd? Knibb, thou hast ascended to thy God; and
          is there nowhere another Knibb? Williams, thy martyred blood still
          crieth from the ground; and is there nowhere another Williams? What!
          not among this dense mass of young and burning spirits? Is there not
          one that can say in his heart, "Here am I, send me?" "Lo, this hour,
          by God's grace being saved, I give myself up to him, to go wherever he
          shall please to send me, to testify his gospel in foreign lands?"
          What! are there no Pauls now? Have we none who will be apostles for
          the Lord of hosts? I think I see one who, putting his lips together,
          makes this silent resolve -- "By God's grace I this day devote myself
          to him; through trouble and through trial I will be his, if he will
          help me; for missionary work or for aught else I give up my all to
          God, and if I may die as Williams did, and wear the blood-red crown of
          martyrdom, I will be proud; and if I may live to serve my Master, like
          a Brainerd, and die at last worn out here I am, do but have me,
          Master, give me the honor of leading the forlorn hope of leading the
          vanguard of Christianity; here I am, send me." O Lord, accept that
          young man! Lo, I consecrate him this day in thy name for that service,
          these outstretched hands this morning give a benediction to you, young
          hero of the cross! Your brother's heart beats with you; go, and go to
          victory; and if it must be mine to stay here to labor in a more easy
          and pleasant part of the vineyard, which I dare not leave, still I
          will envy you, that you have the honor of going to far distant lands,
          and I will pray for you, that your success may be great, and that
          through you the kingdoms of this world may be brought to Christ, and
          the knowledge of the Lord cover the earth. But we will all pray this
          prayer in our houses alone -- "Let the whole earth be filled with his
          glory; Amen, and Amen."
        </p>
        <p>
          You that are enemies to God, beware, beware, beware! It will be a hard
          thing to be found on the side of the enemy in the great battle of
          right.<br />
