          "But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and
          unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are called, both Jews
          and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God." -- 1
          Corinthians 1:23-24.
        </p>
        <p>
          What contempt hath God poured upon the wisdom of this world! How hath
          he brought it to nought, and made it appear as nothing. He has allowed
          it to word out its own conclusions, and prove its own folly. Men
          boasted that they were wise; they said that they could find out God to
          perfection; and in order that their folly might be refuted once and
          forever, God gave them the opportunity of so doing. He said, "Worldly
          wisdom, I will try thee. Thou sayest that thou art mighty, that thine
          intellect is vast and comprehensive, that thine eye is keen, and thou
          canst find all secrets; now, behold, I try thee; I give thee one great
          problem to solve. Here is the universe; stars make its canopy, fields
          and flowers adorn it, and the floods roll o'er its surface; my name is
          written therein; the invisible things of God may be clearly seen in
          the things which are made. Philosophy, I give thee this problem --
          find me out. Here are my works -- find me out. Discover in the
          wondrous world which I have made, the way to worship me acceptably. I
          give thee space enough to do it -- there are data enough. Behold the
          clouds, the earth, and the stars. I give thee time enough; I will give
          thee four thousand years, and I will not interfere; but thou shalt do
          as thou wilt with thine own world. I will give thee men enough; for I
          will make great minds and vast, whom thou shalt call lords of earth;
          thou shalt have orators, thou shalt have philosophers. Find me out, O
          reason; find me out, O wisdom; find me out, if thou canst; find me out
          unto perfection; and if thou canst not, then shut thy mouth forever,
          and then will I teach thee that the wisdom of God is wiser than the
          wisdom of man; yea, that the foolishness of God is wiser than men."
          And how did the wisdom of man work out the problem? How did wisdom
          perform her feat? Look upon the heathen nations; there you see the
          result of wisdom's researches. In the time of Jesus Christ, you might
          have beheld the earth covered with the slime of pollution, a Sodom on
          a large scale -- corrupt, filthy, depraved; indulging in vices which
          we dare not mention; revelling in lust too abominable even for our
          imagination to dwell upon for a moment. We find the men prostrating
          themselves before blocks of wood and stone, adoring ten thousand gods
          more vicious than themselves. We find, in fact, that reason wrote out
          her lines with a finger covered with blood and filth, and that she
          forever cut herself out from all her glory by the vile deeds she did.
          She would not worship God. She would not bow down to him who is
          "clearly seen," but she worshipped any creature -- the reptile that
          crawled, the viper -- everything might be a god; but not, forsooth,
          the God of heaven. Vice might be made into a ceremony, the greatest
          crime might be exalted into a religion; but true worship she knew
          nothing of. Poor reason! poor wisdom! how art thou fallen from heaven;
          like Lucifer -- thou son of the morning -- thou art lost; thou hast
          written out thy conclusion, but a conclusion of consummate folly.
          "After that in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it
          pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that
          believe."
        </p>
        <p>
          Wisdom had had its time, and time enough; it had done its all, and
          that was little enough; it had made the world worse than it was before
          it stepped upon it, and "now," says God, "Foolishness shall overcome
          wisdom; now ignorance, as ye call it, shall sweep away science; now,
          humble, child-like faith shall crumble to the dust all the colossal
          systems your hands have piled." He calls his armies. Christ puts his
          trumpet to his mouth, and up come the warriors, clad in fishermen's
          garb, with the brogue of the lake of Galilee -- poor humble mariners.
          Here are the warriors, O wisdom, that are to confound thee; these are
          the heroes who shall overcome thy proud philosophers; these men are to
          plant their standard upon thy ruined walls, and bid them to fall
          forever; these men and their successors are to exalt a gospel in the
          world which ye may laugh at as absurd, which ye may sneer at as folly,
          but which shall be exalted above the hills, and shall be glorious even
          to the highest heavens. Since that day, God has always raised up
          successors of the apostles; not by any lineal descent, but because I
          have the same roll and charter as any apostle, and am as much called
          to preach the gospel as Paul himself; if not as much owned by the
          conversion of sinners, yet, in a measure, blessed of God; and,
          therefore, here I stand, foolish as Paul might be, foolish as Peter,
          or any of those fishermen; but still with the might of God I grasp the
          sword of truth, coming here to "preach Christ and him crucified, unto
          the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto
          them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God,
          and the wisdom of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I enter upon our text, let me very briefly tell you what I
          believe preaching Christ and him crucified is. My friends, I do not
          believe it is preaching Christ and him crucified, to give people a
          batch of philosophy every Sunday morning and evening, and neglect the
          truths of this Holy Book. I do not believe it is preaching Christ and
          him crucified, to leave out the main cardinal doctrines of the Word of
          God, and preach a religion which is all a mist and a haze, without any
          definite truths whatever. I take it that man does not preach Christ
          and him crucified, who can get through a sermon without mentioning
          Christ's name once; nor does that man preach Christ and him crucified,
          who leaves out the Holy Spirit's work, who never says a word about the
          Holy Ghost, so that indeed the hearers might say, "We do not so much
          as know whether there be a Holy Ghost." And I have my own private
          opinion, that there is no such thing as preaching Christ and him
          crucified, unless you preach what now-a-days is called Calvinism. I
          have my own ideas, and those I always state boldly. It is a nickname
          to call it Calvinism. Calvinism is the gospel, and nothing else. I do
          not believe we can preach the gospel, if we do not preach
          justification by faith without works; not unless we preach the
          sovereignty of God in his dispensation of grace; nor unless we exalt
          the electing, unchangeable, eternal, immutable, conquering love of
          Jehovah; nor, I think, can we preach the gospel, unless we base it
          upon the peculiar redemption which Christ made for his elect and
          chosen people; nor can I comprehend a gospel which lets saints fall
          away after they are called, and suffers the children of God to be
          burned in the fires of damnation, after having believed. Such a gospel
          I abhor. The gospel of the Bible is not such a gospel as that. We
          preach Christ and him crucified in a different fashion, and to all
          gainsayers we reply, "We have not so learned Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three things in the text: first, a gospel rejected, "Christ
          crucified, to the Jews a stumblingblock, and to the Greeks
          foolishness"; secondly, a gospel triumphant, "unto those who are
          called, both Jews and Greeks"; and thirdly, a gospel admired; it is to
          them who are called "the power of God and the wisdom of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, we have here A GOSPEL REJECTED. One would have imagined
          that, when God sent his gospel to men, all men would meekly listen,
          and humbly receive its truths. We should have thought that God's
          ministers had but to proclaim that life is brought to light by the
          gospel, and that Christ is come to save sinners, and every ear would
          be attentive, every eye would be fixed, and every heart would be wide
          open to receive the truth. We should have said, judging favorably of
          our fellow-creatures, that there would not exist in the world a
          monster so vile, so depraved, so polluted, as to put so much as a
          stone in the way of the progress of truth; we could not have conceived
          such a thing; yet that conception is the truth. When the gospel was
          preached, instead of being accepted and admired, one universal hiss
          went up to heaven; men could not bear it; its first preacher they
          dragged to the brow of the hill, and would have sent him down
          headlong; yea, they did more -- they nailed him to the cross, and
          there they let him languish out his dying life in agony such as no man
          hath borne since. All his chosen ministers have been hated and
          abhorred by worldlings; instead of being listened to they have been
          scoffed at; treated as if they were the offscouring of all things, and
          the very scum of mankind. Look at the holy men in the old times, how
          they were driven from city to city, persecuted, afflicted, tormented,
          stoned to death, wherever the enemy had power to do so. Those friends
          of men, those real philanthropists, who came with hearts big with
          love, and hands full of mercy, and lips pregnant with celestial fire,
          and souls that burned with holy influence; those men were treated as
          if they were spies in the camp, as if they were deserters from the
          common cause of mankind; as if they were enemies, and not, as they
          truly were, the best of friends. Do not suppose, my friends, that men
          like the gospel any better now than they did then. There is an idea
          that you are growing better. I do not believe it. You are growing
          worse. In many respects men may be better -- outwardly better; the
          heart within is still the same. The human heart of today dissected,
          would be like the human heart a thousand years ago; the gall of
          bitterness within that breast of yours, is just as bitter as the gall
          of bitterness in that of Simon of old. We have in our hearts the same
          latent opposition to the truth of God; and hence we find men, even as
          of old, who scorn the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall, in speaking of the gospel rejected, endeavour to point out
          the two classes of persons who equally despise truth. The Jews make it
          a stumblingblock, and the Greeks account it foolishness. Now these two
          very respectable gentlemen -- the Jew and the Greek -- I am not going
          to make these ancient individuals the object of my condemnation, but I
          look upon them as members of a great parliament, representatives of a
          great constituency, and I shall attempt to show that, if all the race
          of Jews were cut off, there would be still a great number in the world
          who would answer to the name of Jews, to whom Christ is a
          stumblingblock; and that if Greece were swallowed up by some
          earthquake, and ceased to be a nation, there would still be the Greek
          unto whom the gospel would be foolishness. I shall simply introduce
          the Jew and the Greek, and let them speak a moment to you, in order
          that you may see the gentlemen who represent you; the representative
          men; the persons who stand for many of you, who as yet are not called
          by divine grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first is a Jew; to him the gospel is a stumblingblock. A
          respectable man the Jew was in his day; all formal religion was
          concentrated in his person; he went up to the temple very devoutly; he
          tithed all he had, even to the mint and the cummin. You would see him
          fast twice in the week, with a face all marked with sadness and
          sorrow. If you looked at him, he had the law between his eyes; there
          was the phylactery, and the borders of his garments of amazing width,
          that he might never be supposed to be a Gentile dog; that no one might
          ever conceive that he was not an Hebrew of pure descent. He had a holy
          ancestry; he came of a pious family; a right good man was he. He could
          not like those Sadducees at all, who had no religion. He was
          thoroughly a religious man; he stood up for his synagogue; he would
          not have that temple on Mount Gerizim; he could not bear the
          Samaritans, he had no dealings with them; he was a religionist of the
          first order, a man of the very finest kind; a specimen of a man who is
          a moralist, and who loves the ceremonies of the law. Accordingly, when
          he heard about Christ, he asked who Christ was. "The Son of a
          Carpenter." Ah! "The son of a carpenter, and his mothers's name was
          Mary, and his father's name was Joseph." "That of itself is
          presumption enough," said he; "positive proof, in fact, that he cannot
          be the Messiah." And what does he say? Why, he says, "Woe unto you,
          Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites." "That won't do." Moreover, he
          says, "It is not by the works of the flesh that any man can enter into
          the kingdom of heaven." The Jew tied a double knot in his phylactery
          at once; he thought he would have the borders of his garment made
          twice as broad. He bow to the Nazarene! No, no; and if so much as a
          disciple crossed the street, he thought the place polluted, and would
          not tread in his steps. Do you think he would give up his old father's
          religion, the religion which came from Mount Sinai, that old religion
          that lay in the ark and the overshadowing cherubim? He give that up!
          not he. A vile imposter -- that is all Christ was in his eyes. He
          thought so. "A stumblingblock to me; I cannot hear about it; I will
          not listen to it." Accordingly, he turned a deaf ear to all the
          preacher's eloquence, and listened not at all. Farewell, old Jew! Thou
          sleepest with thy fathers, and thy generation is a wandering race,
          still walking the earth. Farewell! I have done with thee. Alas! poor
          wretch, that Christ, who was thy stumbling-block, shall be thy judge,
          and on thy head shall be that loud curse. "His blood be on us and on
          our children." But I am going to find out Mr. Jew here in Exeter Hall
          -- persons who answer to his description -- to whom Jesus Christ is a
          stumblingblock. Let me introduce you to yourselves, some of you. You
          were of a pious family too, were you not? Yes. And you have a religion
          which you love; you love it so far as the chrysalis of it goes, the
          outside, the covering, the husk. You would not have one rubric
          altered, nor one of those dear old arches taken down, nor the stained
          glass removed, for all the world; and any man who should say a word
          against such things, you would set down as a heretic at once. Or,
          perhaps, you do not go to such a place of worship, but you love some
          plain old meeting-house, where your forefathers worshipped, called a
          dissenting chapel. Ah! it is a beautiful plain place; you love it, you
          love its ordinances, you love its exterior; and if any one spoke
          against the place, how vexed you would feel. You think that what they
          do there, they ought to do everywhere; in fact, your church is a model
          one; the place where you go is exactly the sort of place for
          everybody; and if I were to ask you why you hope to go to heaven, you
          would perhaps say, "Because I am a Baptist," or, "Because I am an
          Episcopalian," or whatever other sect you belong to. There is
          yourself; I know Jesus Christ will be to you a stumblingblock. If I
          come and tell you, that all your going to the house of God is good for
          nothing; if I tell you that all those many times you have been singing
          and praying, all pass for nothing in the sight of God, because you are
          a hypocrite and a formalist. If I tell you that your heart is not
          right with God, and that unless it is so, all the external is good for
          nothing, I know what you will say, -- "I shan't hear that young man
          again." It is a stumblingblock. If you had stepped in anywhere where
          you had heard formalism exalted: if you had been told "this must you
          do, and this other must you do, and then you will be saved," you would
          highly approve of it. But how many are there externally religious,
          with whose characters you could find no fault, but who have never had
          the regenerating influence of the Holy Ghost; who never were made to
          lie prostrate on their face before Calvary's cross; who never turned a
          wistful eye to yonder Saviour crucified; who never put their trust in
          him that was slain for the sons of men. They love a superficial
          religion, but when a man talks deeper than that, they set it down for
          cant. You may love all that is external about religion, just as you
          may love a man for his clothes -- caring nothing for the man himself.
          If so, I know you are one of those who reject the gospel. You will
          hear me preach; and while I speak about the externals, you will hear
          me with attention; whilst I plead for morality, and argue against
          drunkenness, or show the heinousness of Sabbath-breaking, but if once
          I say, "Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye can
          in no wise enter into the kingdom of God"; if once I tell you that you
          must be elected of God: that you must be purchased with the Saviour's
          blood -- that you must be converted by the Holy Ghost -- you say, "He
          is a fanatic! Away with him, away with him! We do not want to hear
          that any more." Christ crucified, is to the Jew -- the ceremonialist
          -- a stumblingblock.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is another specimen of this Jew to be found. He is
          thoroughly orthodox in his sentiments. As for forms and ceremonies, he
          thinks nothing about them. He goes to a place of worship where he
          learns sound doctrine. He will hear nothing but what is true. He likes
          that we should have good works and morality. He is a good man, and no
          one can find fault with him. Here he is, regular in his Sunday pew. In
          the market he walks before men in all honesty -- so you would imagine.
          Ask him about any doctrine, and he can give you a disquisition upon
          it. In fact, he could write a treatise upon anything in the Bible, and
          a great many things besides. He knows almost everything: and here, up
          in this dark attic of the head, his religion has taken up its abode;
          he has a best parlor down in his heart, but his religion never goes
          there -- that is shut against it. He has money in there -- Mammon,
          worldliness; or he has something else -- self-love, pride. Perhaps he
          loves to hear experimental preaching; he admires it all; in fact, he
          loves anything that is sound. But then, he has not any sound in
          himself; or rather, it is all sound and there is no substance. He
          likes to hear true doctrine; but it never penetrates his inner man.
          You never see him weep. Preach to him about Christ crucified, a
          glorious subject, and you never see a tear roll down his cheek; tell
          him of the mighty influence of the Holy Ghost -- he admires you for
          it, but he never had the hand of the Holy Spirit on his soul; tell him
          about communion with God, plunging in Godhead's deepest sea, and being
          lost in its immensity -- the man loves to hear, but he never
          experiences, he has never communed with Christ; and accordingly, when
          you once begin to strike home; when you lay him on the table, take out
          your dissecting knife, begin to cut him up, and show him his own
          heart, let him see what it is by nature, and what it must become by
          grace -- the man starts, he cannot stand that; he wants none of that
          -- Christ received in the heart, and accepted. Albeit that he loves it
          enough in the head, tis to him a stumblingblock, and he casts it away.
          Do you see yourselves here, my friends? See yourselves as God sees
          you? For so it is, here be many to whom Christ is as much a
          stumblingblock now as ever he was. O ye formalists! I speak to you; O
          ye who have the nutshell, but abhor the kernel; O ye who like the
          trappings and the dress, but care not for that fair virgin who is
          clothed therewith; O ye who like the paint and the tinsel, but abhor
          the solid gold, I speak to you; I ask you, does your religion give you
          solid comfort? Can you stare death in the face with it, and say, "I
          know that my Redeemer liveth?" Can you close your eyes at night,
          singing as your vesper song --
        </p>
        <p>"I to the end must endure</p>
        <p>As sure as the earnest is given"?</p>
        <p>
          Can you bless God for affliction? Can you plunge in, accounted as ye
          are, and swim through all the floods of trial? Can you march
          triumphant through the lion's den, laugh at affliction, and bid
          defiance to hell? Can you? No! Your gospel is an effeminate thing -- a
          thing of words and sounds, and not of power. Cast it from you, I
          beseech you; it is not worth your keeping; and when you come before
          the throne of God, you will find it will fail you, and fail you so
          that you shall never find another; for lost, ruined, destroyed, ye
          shall find that Christ, who is now "a stumblingblock," will be your
          Judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have found out the Jew, and I have now to discover the Greek. He is
          a person of quite a different exterior to the Jew. As to the
          phylactery, to him it is all rubbish; and as to the broad hemmed
          garment, he despises it. He does not care for the forms of religion;
          he has an intense aversion, in fact, to broad-brimmed hats, or to
          everything which looks like outward show. He likes eloquence; he
          admires a smart saying; he loves a quaint expression; he likes to read
          the last new book; he is a Greek, and to him the gospel is
          foolishness. The Greek is a gentleman found everywhere, now-a-days;
          manufactured sometimes in colleges, constantly made in schools,
          produced everywhere. He is on the exchange, in the market; he keeps a
          shop, rides in a carriage; he is noble, a gentleman; he is everywhere,
          even in court. He is thoroughly wise. Ask him anything, and he knows
          it. Ask for a quotation from any of the old poets, or any one else,
          and he can give it you. If you are a Mohammedan, and plead the claims
          of your religion, he will hear you very patiently. But if you are a
          Christian, and talk to him of Jesus Christ, "Stop your cant," he says,
          "I don't want to hear anything about that." This Grecian gentleman
          believes all philosophy except the true one; he studies all wisdom
          except the wisdom of God; he likes all learning except spiritual
          learning; he loves everything except that which God approves; he likes
          everything which man makes, and nothing which comes from God; it is
          foolishness to him, confounded foolishness. You have only to discourse
          about one doctrine in the Bible, and he shuts his ears; he wishes no
          longer for your company -- it is foolishness. I have met this
          gentleman a great many times. Once, when I saw him, he told me he did
          not believe in any religion at all; and when I said I did, and had a
          hope that when I died I should go to heaven, he said he dared say it
          was very comfortable, but he did not believe in religion, and that he
          was sure it was best to live as nature dictated. Another time he spoke
          well of all religions, and believed they were very good in their
          place, and all true; and he had no doubt that, if a man were sincere
          in any kind of religion, he would be alright at last. I told him I did
          not think so, and that I believed there was but one religion revealed
          of God -- the religion of God's elect, the religion which is the gift
          of Jesus. He then said I was a begot, and wished me good morning. It
          was to him foolishness. He had nothing to do with me at all. He either
          liked no religion, or every religion. Another time I held him by the
          coat button, and I discussed with him a little about faith. He said,
          "It is all very well, I believe that is true Protestant doctrine." But
          presently I said something about election, and he said, "I don't like
          that; many people have preached that and turned it to bad account." I
          then hinted something about free grace; but that he could not endure,
          it was to him foolishness. He was a polished Greek, and thought that
          if he were not chosen, he ought to be. He never liked that passage,
          "God hath chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the
          wise, and the things which are not, to bring to nought things that
          are." He thought it was very discreditable to the Bible and when the
          book was revised, he had no doubt it would be cut out. To such a man
          -- for he is here this morning, very likely come to hear this reed
          shaken of the wind -- I have to say this: Ah! thou wise man, full of
          worldly wisdom; thy wisdom will stand thee here, but what wilt thou do
          in the swellings of Jordan? Philosophy may do well for thee to learn
          upon whilst thou walkest through this world; but the river is deep,
          and thou wilt want something more than that. If thou hast not the arm
          of the Most High to hold thee up in the flood and cheer thee with
          promises, thou wilt sink, man; with all thy philosophy, thou wilt
          sink; with all thy learning, thou shalt sink, and be washed into that
          awful ocean of eternal torment, where thou shalt be forever. Ah!
          Greeks, it may be foolishness to you, but ye shall see the man your
          judge, and then shall ye rue the day that e'er ye said that God's
          gospel was foolishness.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Having spoken thus far upon the gospel rejected, I shall now
          briefly speak upon the GOSPEL TRIUMPHANT. "Unto us who are called,
          both Jews and Greeks, it is the power of God, and the wisdom of God."
          Yonder man rejects the gospel, despises grace, and laughs at it as a
          delusion. Here is another man who laughed at it, too; but God will
          fetch him down upon his knees. Christ shall not die for nothing. The
          Holy Ghost shall not strive in vain. God hath said, "My word shall not
          return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and
          it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it." "He shall see of the
          travail of his soul, and shall be abundantly satisfied." If one sinner
          is not saved, another shall be. The Jew and the Greek shall never
          depopulate heaven. The choirs of glory shall not lose a single
          songster by all the opposition of Jews and Greeks; for God hath said
          it; some shall be called; some shall be saved; some shall be rescued.
        </p>
        <p>"Perish the virtue, as it ought, abhorred,</p>
        <p>And the fool with it, who insults his Lord.</p>
        <p>The atonement a Redeemer's love has wrought</p>
        <p>Is not for you -- the righteous need it not.</p>
        <p>See'st thou yon harlot wooing all she meets,</p>
        <p>The worn-out nuisance of the public streets</p>
        <p>Herself from morn till night, from night to morn,</p>
        <p>Her own abhorrence, and as much your scorn:</p>
        <p>The gracious shower, unlimited and free,</p>
        <p>Shall fall on her, when heaven denies it thee.</p>
        <p>Of all that wisdom dictates, this the drift,</p>
        <p>That man is dead in sin, and life a gift."</p>
        <p>
          If the righteous and good are not saved, if they reject the gospel,
          there are others who are to be called, others who shall be rescued;
          for Christ will not lose the merits of his agonies, or the purchase of
          his blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Unto us who are called." I received a note this week asking me to
          explain that word "called"; because in one passage it says, "Many are
          called but few are chosen," while in another it appears that all who
          are called must be chosen. Now, let me observe that there are two
          calls. As my old friend, John Bunyan, says, the hen has two calls, the
          common cluck, which she gives daily and hourly, and the special one,
          which she means for her little chickens. So there is a general call, a
          call made to every man; every man hears it. Many are called by it; all
          you are called this morning in that sense, but very few are chosen.
          The other is a special call, the children's call. You know how the
          bell sounds over the workshop, to call the men to work -- that is a
          general call. A father goes to the door and calls out, "John, it is
          dinner time" -- that is the special call. Many are called with the
          general call, but they are not chosen; the special call is for the
          children only, and that is what is meant in the text, "Unto us who are
          called, both Jews and Greeks, the power of God and the wisdom of God."
          That call is always a special one. While I stand here and call men,
          nobody comes; while I preach to sinners universally, no good is done;
          it is like the sheet lightning you sometimes see on the summer's
          evening, beautiful, grand; but whoever heard of anything being struck
          by it? But the special call is the forked flash from heaven; it
          strikes somewhere; it is the arrow sent in between the joints of the
          harness. The call which saves is like that of Jesus, when he said
          "Mary," and she said unto him "Rabonni." Do you know anything about
          that special call, my beloved? Did Jesus ever call you by name? Canst
          thou recollect the hour when he whispered thy name in thine ear, when
          he said, "Come to me"? If so, you will grant the truth of what I am
          going to say next about it -- that it is an effectual call; there is
          no resisting it. When God calls with his special call, there is no
          standing out. Ah! I know I laughed at religion; I despised, I abhorred
          it; but that call! Oh, I would not come. But God said, "Thou shalt
          come. All that the Father giveth to me shall come." "Lord, I will
          not." "But thou shalt," said God. And I have gone up to God's house
          sometimes almost with a resolution that I would not listen, but listen
          I must. Oh, how the word came into my soul! Was there a power of
          resistance? No; I was thrown down; each bone seemed to be broken; I
          was saved by effectual grace. I appeal to your experience, my friends.
          When God took you in hand, could you withstand him? You stood against
          your minister times enough. Sickness did not break you down; disease
          did not bring you to God's feet; eloquence did not convince you; but
          when God puts his hand to the work, ah! then what a change. Like Saul,
          with his horses going to Damascus, that voice from heaven said, "I am
          Jesus whom thou persecutest." "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
          There was no going further then. That was an effectual call. Like
          that, again, which Jesus gave to Zaccheus, when he was up in the tree;
          stepping under the tree, he said, "Zaccheus, come down, today I must
          abide in thy house." Zaccheus was taken in the net; he heard his own
          name; the call sank into his soul; he could not stop up in the tree,
          for an almighty impulse drew him down. And I could tell you some
          singular instances of persons going to the house of God and having
          their characters described, limned out to perfection, so that they
          have said, "He is painting me, he is painting me." Just as I might say
          to that young man here, who stole his master's gloves yesterday, that
          Jesus calls him to repentance. It may be that there is such a person
          here; and when the call comes to a peculiar character, it generally
          comes with a special power. God gives his ministers a brush, and shows
          them how to use it in painting life-like portraits, and thus the
          sinner hears the special call. I cannot give the special call; God
          alone can give it, and I leave it with him. Some must be called. Jew
          and Greek may laugh, but still there are some who are called, both
          Jews and Greeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, to close up this second point, it is a great mercy that many a
          Jew has been made to drop his self righteousness; many a legalist has
          been made to drop his legalism, and come to Christ; and many a Greek
          has bowed his genius at the throne of God's gospel. We have a few
          such. As Cowper says:
        </p>
        <p>"We boast some rich ones whom the gospel sways,</p>
        <p>And one who wears a coronet, and prays;</p>
        <p>Like gleanings of an olive tree they show,</p>
        <p>Here and there one upon the topmost bough."</p>
        <p>
          III. Now we come to our third point, A GOSPEL ADMIRED; unto us who are
          called of God, it is the power of God, and the wisdom of God. Now,
          beloved, this must be a matter of pure experience between your souls
          and God. If you are called of God this morning, you will know it. I
          know there are times when a Christian has to say,
        </p>
        <p>"Tis a point I long to know,</p>
        <p>Oft it causes anxious thought;</p>
        <p>Do I love the Lord or no?</p>
        <p>Am I his, or am I not?"</p>
        <p>
          But if a man never in his life knew himself to be a Christian, he
          never was a Christian. If he never had a moment of confidence, when he
          could say, "Now I know in whom I have believed," I think I do not
          utter a harsh thing when I say, that that man could not have been born
          again; for I do not understand how a man can be killed and then made
          alive again, and not know it; how a man can pass from death unto life,
          and not know it; how a man can be brought out of darkness into
          marvellous liberty without knowing it. I am sure I know it when I
          shout out my old verse,
        </p>
        <p>"Now free from sin, I walk at large,</p>
        <p>My Saviour's blood's my full discharge;</p>
        <p>At his dear feet content I lay,</p>
        <p>A sinner saved, and homage pay."</p>
        <p>
          There are moments when the eyes glisten with joy and we can say, "We
          are persuaded, confident, certain." I do not wish to distress any one
          who is under doubt. Often gloomy doubts will prevail; there are
          seasons when you fear you have not been called, when you doubt your
          interest in Christ. Ah! what a mercy it is that it is not your hold of
          Christ that saves you, but his hold of you! What a sweet fact that it
          is not how you grasp his hand, but his grasp of yours, that saves you.
          Yet I think you ought to know, sometime or other, whether you are
          called of God. If so, you will follow me in the next part of my
          discourse, which is a matter of pure experience; unto us who are
          saved, it is "Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          The gospel is to the true believer a thing of power. It is Christ the
          power of God. Ay, there is a power in God's gospel beyond all
          description. Once, I, like Mazeppa, bound on the wild horse of my
          lust, bound hand and foot, incapable of resistance, was galloping on
          with hell's wolves behind me, howling for my body and my soul, as
          their just and lawful prey. There came a mighty hand which stopped
          that wild horse, cut my bands, set me down, and brought me into
          liberty. Is there power, sir? Ay, there is power, and he who has felt
          it must acknowledge it. There was a time when I lived in the strong
          old castle of my sins, and rested in my works. There came a trumpeter
          to the door, and bade me open it. I with anger chide him from the
          porch, and said he ne'er should enter. There came a goodly personage,
          with loving countenance; his hands were marked with scars, where nails
          were driven, and his feet had nail-prints too; he lifted up his cross,
          using it as a hammer; at the first blow the gate of my prejudice
          shook; at the second it trembled more; at the third down it fell, and
          in he came; and he said, "Arise, and stand upon thy feet, for I have
          loved thee with an everlasting love." A thing of power! Ah! it is a
          thing of power. I have felt it here, in this heart; I have the witness
          of the Spirit within, and know it is a thing of might, because it has
          conquered me; it has bowed me down.
        </p>
        <p>"His free grace alone, from the first to the last,</p>
        <p>Hath won my affection, and held my soul fast."</p>
        <p>
          The gospel to the Christian is a thing of power. What is it that makes
          the young man devote himself as a missionary to the cause of God, to
          leave father and mother, and go into distant lands? It is a thing of
          power that does it -- it is the gospel. What is it that constrains
          yonder minister, in the midst of the cholera, to climb up that
          creaking staircase, and stand by the bed of some dying creature who
          has that dire disease? It must be a thing of power which leads him to
          venture his life; it is love of the cross of Christ which bids him do
          it. What is that which enables one man to stand up before a multitude
          of his fellows, all unprepared it may be, but determined that he will
          speak nothing but Christ and him crucified? What is it that enables
          him to cry, like the war-horse of Job in battle, Aha! and move
          glorious in might? It is a thing of power that does it -- it is Christ
          crucified. And what emboldens that timid female to walk down that dark
          lane in the wet evening, that she may go and sit beside the victim of
          a contagious fever? What strengthens her to go through that den of
          thieves, and pass by the profligate and profane? What influences her
          to enter into that charnel-house of death, and there sit down and
          whisper words of comfort? Does gold make her do it? They are too poor
          to give her gold. Does fame make her do it? She shall never be known,
          nor written among the mighty women of this earth. What makes her do
          it? Is it love of merit? No; she knows she has no desert before high
          heaven. What impels her to it? It is the power of the gospel on her
          heart; it is the cross of Christ; she loves it, and she therefore says
          --
        </p>
        <p>"Were the whole realm of nature mine.</p>
        <p>That were a present far too small;</p>
        <p>Love so amazing, so divine,</p>
        <p>Demands my soul, my life, my all."</p>
        <p>
          But I behold another scene. A martyr is going to the stake; the
          halberd men are around him; the crowds are mocking, but he is marching
          steadily on. See, they bind him, with a chain around his middle, to
          the stake; they heap faggots all about him; the flame is lighted up;
          listen to his words: "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is
          within me, bless his holy name." The flames are kindling round his
          legs; the fire is burning him even to the bone; see him lift up his
          hands and say, "I know that my Redeemer liveth, and though the fire
          devour this body, yet in my flesh shall I see the Lord." Behold him
          clutch the stake and kiss it, as if he loved it, and hear him say,
          "For every chain of iron that man girdeth me with, God shall give me a
          chain of gold; for all these faggots, and this ignominy and shame, he
          shall increase the weight of my eternal glory." See all the under
          parts of his body are consumed; still he lives in the torture; at last
          he bows himself, and the upper part of his body falls over; and as he
          falls you hear him say, "Into thy hands I commend my Spirit." What
          wondrous magic was on him, sirs? What made that man strong? What
          helped him to bear that cruelty? What made him stand unmoved in the
          flames? It was the thing of power; it was the cross of Jesus
          crucified. For "unto us who are saved it is the power of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          But behold another scene far different. There is no crowd there; it is
          a silent room. There is a poor pallet, a lonely bed: a physician
          standing by. There is a young girl: her face is blanched by
          consumption; long hath the worm eaten her cheek, and though sometimes
          the flush came, it was the death flush of the deceitful consumption.
          There she lieth, weak, pale, wan, worn, dying, yet behold a smile upon
          her face, as if she had seen an angel. She speaketh, and there is
          music in her voice. Joan of Arc of old was not half so mighty as that
          girl. She is wrestling with dragons on her death-bed; but see her
          composure, and hear her dying sonnet:

        <p>"Jesus, lover of my soul,</p>
        <p>Let me to thy bosom fly,</p>
        <p>While the nearer waters roll,</p>
        <p>While the tempest still is high!</p>
        <p>Hide me, O my Saviour, hide,</p>
        <p>Till the storm of life is past,</p>
        <p>Safe into the haven guide,</p>
        <p>O receive my soul at last!"</p>
        <p>
          And with a smile she shuts her eye on earth, and opens it in heaven.
          What enables her to die like that? It is the thing of power; it is the
          cross; it is Jesus crucified.

          I have little time to discourse upon the other point, and it be far
          from me to weary you by a lengthened and prosy sermon, but we must
          glance at the other statement: Christ is, to the called ones, the
          wisdom of God as well as the power of God. To a believer, the gospel
          is the perfection of wisdom, and if it appear not so to the ungodly,
          it is because of the perversion of judgement consequent on their
          depravity.
        </p>
        <p>
          An idea has long possessed the public mind, that a religious man can
          scarcely be a wise man. It has been the custom to talk of infidels,
          atheists, and deists, as men of deep thought and comprehensive
          intellect; and to tremble for the Christian controversialist, as if he
          must surely fall by the hand of his enemy. But this is purely a
          mistake; for the gospel is the sum of wisdom; an epitome of knowledge;
          a treasure-house of truth; and a revelation of mysterious secrets. In
          it we see how justice and mercy may be married; here we behold
          inexorable law entirely satisfied, and sovereign love bearing away the
          sinner in triumph. Our meditation upon it enlarges the mind; and as it
          opens to our soul in successive flashes of glory, we stand astonished
          at the profound wisdom manifest in it. Ah, dear friends! if ye seek
          wisdom, ye shall see it displayed in all its greatness; not in the
          balancing of the clouds, nor the firmness of earth's foundations; not
          in the measured march of the armies of the sky, nor in the perpetual
          motions of the waves of the sea; not in vegetation with all its fairy
          forms of beauty; nor in the animal with its marvellous tissue of
          nerve, and vein, and sinew: nor even in man, that last and loftiest
          work of the Creator. But turn aside and see this great sight! -- an
          incarnate God upon the cross; a substitute atoning for mortal guilt; a
          sacrifice satisfying the vengeance of Heaven, and delivering the
          rebellious sinner. Here is essential wisdom; enthroned, crowned,
          glorified. Admire, ye men of earth, if ye be not blind; and ye who
          glory in your learning bend your heads in reverence, and own that all
          your skill could not have devised a gospel at once so just to God, so
          safe to man.

          Remember, my friends, that while the gospel is in itself wisdom, it
          also confers wisdom on its students; she teaches young men wisdom and
          discretion, and gives understanding to the simple. A man who is a
          believing admirer and a hearty lover of the truth as it is in Jesus,
          is in a right place to follow with advantage any other branch of
          science. I confess I have a shelf in my head for everything now.
          Whatever I read I know where to put it; whatever I learn I know where
          to stow it away. Once when I read books, I put all my knowledge
          together in glorious confusion; but ever since I have known Christ, I
          have put Christ in the centre as my sun, and each science revolves
          round it like a planet, while minor sciences are satellites to these
          planets. Christ is to me the wisdom of God. I can learn everything
          now. The science of Christ crucified is the most excellent of
          sciences, she is to me the wisdom of God. O, young man, build thy
          studio on Calvary! there raise thine observatory, and scan by faith
          the lofty things of nature. Take thee a hermit's cell in the garden of
          Gethsemane, and lave thy brow with the waters of Silo. Let the Bible
          be thy standard classic -- thy last appeal in matters of contention.
          Let its light be thine illumination, and thou shalt become more wise
          than Plato, more truly learned than the seven sages of antiquity.
        </p>

          And now, my dear friends, solemnly and earnestly, as in the sight of
          God, I appeal to you. You are gathered here this morning, I know, from
          different motives; some of you have come from curiosity; others of you
          are my regular hearers; some have come from one place and some from
          another. What have you heard me say this morning? I have told you of
          two classes of persons who reject Christ; the religionist, who has a
          religion of form and nothing else; and the man of the world, who calls
          our gospel foolishness. Now, put your hand upon your heart, and ask
          yourself this morning, "Am I one of these?" If you are, then walk the
          earth in all your pride; then go as you came in: but know that for all
          this the Lord shall bring thee unto judgement; know thou that thy joys
          and delights shall vanish like a dream, "and, like the baseless fabric
          of a vision," be swept away forever. Know thou this, moreover, O man,
          that one day in the halls of Satan, down in hell, I perhaps may see
          thee amongst those myriad spirits who revolve forever in a perpetual
          circle with their hands upon their hearts. If thine hand be
          transparent, and thy flesh transparent, I shall look through thy hand
          and flesh, and see thy heart within. And how shall I see it? Set in a
          case of fire -- in a case of fire! And there thou shalt revolve
          forever with the worm gnawing within thy heart, which ne'er shall die
          -- a case of fire around thy never-dying, ever-tortured heart. Good
          God! let not these men still reject and despise Christ; but let this
          be the time when they shall be called.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the rest of you who are called, I need say nothing. The longer you
          live, the more powerful will you find the gospel to be; the more
          deeply Christ-taught you are, the more you live under the constant
          influence of the Holy Spirit, the more you will know the gospel to be
          a thing of power, and the more also will you understand it to be a
          thing of wisdom. May every blessing rest upon you; and may God come up
          with us in the evening!
        </p>
        <p>"Let men or angels dig the mines</p>
        <p>Where nature's golden treasure shines;</p>
        <p>Brought near the doctrine of the cross,</p>
        <p>All nature's gold appears but dross.</p>
        <p>Should vile blasphemers with disdain</p>
        <p>Pronounce the truths of Jesus vain,</p>
        <p>We'll meet the scandal and the shame,</p>
        <p>And sing and triumph in his name."<br /></p>
