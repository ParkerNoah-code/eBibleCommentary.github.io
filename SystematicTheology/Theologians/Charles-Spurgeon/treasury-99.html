<p align="center"><font size="4">PSALM 96</font><br/>
 </p>
</b></font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">SUBJECT. </p>
<p align="justify">This Psalm is evidently taken from that sacred song which 
    was composed by David at the time when "the ark of God was set in the midst 
    of the tent which David had prepared for it, and they offered burnt 
    sacrifices and peace offerings before God." See the sixteenth chapter of the 
    first book of the Chronicles. The former part of that sacred song was 
    probably omitted in this place because it referred to Israel, and the design 
    of the Holy Spirit in this psalm was to give forth a song for the Gentiles, 
    a triumphant hymn with which to celebrate the conversion of the nations to 
    Jehovah in gospel times. <i>It follows fitly upon the last Psalm, which 
    describes the obstinacy of Israel, and the consequent taking of the gospel 
    from them that it might be preached among the nations who would receive it</i>, 
    and in due time be fully won to Christ by its power. It thus makes a pair 
    with the Ninety-fifth Psalm. It is a grand MISSIONARY HYMN, and it is a 
    wonder that Jews can read it and yet remain exclusive. </p>
<p align="justify">If blindness in part had not happened unto Israel, they 
    might have seen long ago, and would now see, that their God always had 
    designs of love for all the families of men, and never intended that his 
    grace and his covenant should relate only to the seed of Abraham after the 
    flesh. We do not wonder that the large hearted David rejoiced and danced 
    before the ark, while he saw in vision all the earth turning from idols to 
    the one living and true God. Had Michal, Saul's daughter, only been able to 
    enter into his delight, she would not have reproached him, and if the Jews 
    at this day could only be enlarged in heart to feel sympathy with all 
    mankind, they also would sing for joy at the great prophecy that all the 
    earth shall be fitted with the glory of the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">DIVISION. We will make none, for the song is one and 
    indivisible, a garment of praise without seam, woven from the top 
    throughout.</p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. O sing unto the Lord a new song. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">New joys are filling the hearts of men, for the glad 
    tidings of blessing to all people are proclaimed, therefore let them sing a 
    new song. Angels inaugurated the new dispensation with new songs, and shall 
    not we take up the strain? </p>
<p align="justify">The song is for Jehovah alone, the hymns which chanted 
    the praises of Jupiter and Neptune, Vishnoo and Siva are hushed forever; 
    Bacchanalian shouts are silenced, lascivious sonnets are no more<i>. Unto 
    the one only God all music is to be dedicated. </i>Mourning is over, and the 
    time of singing of hearts has come. No dismal rites are celebrated, no 
    bloody sacrifices of human beings are presented, no cutting with knives, and 
    outcries of lamentation are presented by deluded votaries. Joy is in the 
    ascendant, and <i>singing has become the universal expression of love, the 
    fitting voice of reverent adoration</i>. Men are made new creatures, and 
    their song is new also. The names of Baalim are no more on their lips, the 
    wanton music of Ashtareth ceases; the foolish ditty and the cruel war song 
    are alike forgotten; the song is holy, heavenly, pure, and pleasant. The 
    psalmist speaks as if he would lead the strain and be the chief musician—he 
    invites, he incites, he persuades to sacred worship, and cries with all his 
    heart, "<i>O sing unto Jehovah a new song." </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Sing unto the Lord, all the earth.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">National jealousies are dead; a Jew invites the Gentiles 
    to adore, and joins with them, so that all the earth may lift up one common 
    psalm as with one heart and voice unto Jehovah, who has visited it with his 
    salvation. No corner of the world is to be discordant, no race of heathen to 
    be silent. All the earth Jehovah made, and all the earth must sing to him. 
    As the sun shines on all lands, so are all lands to delight in the light of 
    the Sun of Righteousness. Out of many, one song shall come forth. The 
    multitudinous languages of the sons of Adam, who were scattered at Babel, 
    will blend in the same song when the people are gathered at Zion. </p>
<p align="justify">Not men alone—but the earth itself is to praise its 
    Maker. Made subject to vanity for a while by a sad necessity, the creation 
    itself also is to be delivered from the bondage of corruption, and brought 
    into the glorious liberty of the children of God, so that sea and forest, 
    field and flood, are to be joyful before the Lord. Is this a dream? then let 
    us dream again. Blessed are the eyes which shall see the kingdom, and the 
    ears which shall hear its songs. Hasten your advent, good Lord! Yes, send 
    forth speedily the rod of your strength out of Zion, that the nations may 
    bow before the Lord and his Anointed.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. Sing unto the Lord, bless his name. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Thrice is the name of the Lord repeated, and not without 
    meaning. Is it not unto the Three One Lord that the enlightened nations will 
    sing? Unitarianism is too cold to warm the world to worship; the sacred fire 
    of adoration only burns with vehement flame where the Trinity is believed in 
    and beloved. In other ways beside singing, the blessed Lord is to be 
    blessed. <i>His name, his fame, his character, his revealed word and will 
    are to be delighted in, and remembered with perpetual thanksgiving. We may 
    well bless him who so divinely blesses us. </i>At the very mention of his 
    name it is fit to say, "Let him be blessed forever." </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Show forth his salvation from day to day. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The gospel is the clearest revelation of himself. 
    Salvation outshines creation and providence; therefore let our praises 
    overflow in that direction. Let us proclaim the glad tidings, and do so 
    continually, never ceasing the blissful testimony. It is ever new, ever 
    suitable, ever sure, ever perfect; therefore let us show it forth 
    continually until he comes, both by words and deeds, by songs and sermons, 
    by sacred Baptism and by the Holy Supper, by books and by speech, by Sabbath 
    services and weekday worship. </p>
<p align="justify">Each day brings us deeper experience of our saving God, 
    each day shows us anew how deeply men need his salvation, each day reveals 
    the power of the gospel, each day the Spirit strives with the sons of men. 
    Therefore, never pausing, be it ours to tell out the glorious message of 
    free grace. Let those do this who know for themselves what his salvation 
    means; they can bear witness that there is salvation in none other, and that 
    in him salvation to the uttermost is to be found. Let them show it forth 
    until the echo flies around the spacious earth, and all the armies of the 
    sky unite to magnify the God who has displayed his saving grace among all 
    people.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. Declare his glory among the heathen.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">His salvation is his glory, the word of the gospel 
    glorifies him; and this should be published far and wide, until the remotest 
    nations of the earth have known it. England has spent much blood and 
    treasure to keep up her own prestige among barbarians; when will she be 
    equally anxious to maintain the honor of her religion, the glory of her 
    Lord? It is to be feared that <i>too often the name of the Lord Jesus has 
    been dishonored among the heathen by the vices and cruelties of those who 
    call themselves Christians</i>. May this fact excite true believers to 
    greater diligence in causing the gospel to be proclaimed as with a trumpet 
    in all quarters of the habitable globe.<b> </b></p>
<p align="justify">His wonders among all people. </p>

<p align="justify">The gospel is a mass of wonders, its history is full of 
    wonders, and it is in itself far more marvelous than miracles themselves. <i>
    In the person of his Son the Lord has displayed wonders of love, wisdom, 
    grace, and power. </i>All glory be unto his name; <i>who can refuse to tell 
    out the story of redeeming grace and dying love? </i>All the nations need to 
    hear of God's marvelous works; and a really living, self denying church 
    would solemnly resolve that right speedily they fill shall hear thereof. The 
    tribes which are dying out are not to be excluded from gospel teaching any 
    more than the great growing families which, like the fat cows of Pharaoh, 
    are eating up other races. Red Indians as well as Anglo Saxons are to hear 
    of the wonders of redeeming love. <i>None are too degraded, none too 
    cultured, none too savage, and none too refined.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. For the LORD is great and greatly to be praised.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He is no petty deity, presiding, as the heathen imagined 
    their gods to do, over someone nation, or one department of nature. Jehovah 
    is great in power and dominion, great in mind and act; nothing mean or 
    narrow can be found in him or his acts, in all things he is infinite<i>. 
    Praise should be proportionate to its object, therefore let it be infinite 
    when rendered unto the Lord</i>. We cannot praise him too much, too often, 
    too zealously, too carefully, too joyfully. He deserves that nothing in his 
    worship should be little—but all the honor rendered unto him should be given 
    in largeness of heart, with the utmost zeal for his glory. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">He is to be feared above all gods. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Other gods have been worshiped at great cost, and with 
    much fervor, by their blinded rotaries—but Jehovah should be adored with far 
    greater reverence. Even if the graven images had been gods, they could not 
    have borne comparison for an instant with the God of Israel, and therefore 
    his worship, should be far more zealous than any which has been rendered to 
    them. </p>
<p align="justify">He is to be feared, for there is cause to fear. Dread of 
    other gods is mere superstition—awe of the Lord is pure religion. Holy fear 
    is the beginning of the graces, and yet it is the accompaniment of their 
    highest range.<i> Fear of God is the blush upon the face of holiness, 
    enhancing its beauty.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. For all the gods of the nations are idols. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Mere images of wood and stone, vanities, nothings. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">But the Lord made the heavens. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The reality of his Godhead is proved by his works, and 
    foremost among these the psalmist mentions that matchless piece of 
    architecture which casts its arch over every man's head, whose lamps are the 
    light of all mankind, whose rains and dew fall upon the fields of every 
    people, and whence the Lord in voice of thunder is heard speaking to every 
    creature.</p>
<p align="justify">The idol gods have no existence—but our God is the author 
    of all existences. They are mere earthly vanities, while he is not only 
    heavenly—but made the heavens. This is mentioned as an argument for 
    Jehovah's universal praise. Who can be worshiped but he? Since none can 
    rival him, let him be adored alone.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. Honor and majesty are before him.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Men can but mimic these things; their pompous pageants 
    are but the pretense of greatness. Honor and majesty are with him and with 
    him alone. In the presence of Jehovah real glory and sovereignty abide, as 
    constant attendants.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.</p></b> 
<i>
<p align="justify">In him are combined all that is mighty and lovely, 
    powerful and resplendent.</p></i> We have seen rugged strength devoid of beauty, 
    we have also seen elegance without strength; the union of the two is greatly 
    to be admired. Do we desire to see the "sublime and beautiful" at one 
    glance? Then we must look to the eternal throne. 
<p align="justify">In the Chronicles we read strength and gladness; and the 
    two renderings do not disagree in sense, for in the highest degree in this 
    instance it is true that "a thing of beauty is a joy forever." Not in 
    outward show or parade of costly robes does the glory of God consist; such 
    things are tricks of state with which the ignorant are dazzled. <i>Holiness, 
    justice, wisdom, grace, these are the splendors of Jehovah's courts, these 
    the jewels and the gold, the regalia, and the pomp of the courts of Heaven.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7.</p></b> The first six verses commenced with an 
    exhortation to sing, three times repeated, with the name of the Lord thrice 
    mentioned; here we meet with the expression, <b>Give unto the Lord</b>, used 
    in the same triple manner. This is after the manner of those poets whose 
    flaming sonnets have best won the ear of the people, they reiterate choice 
    words until they penetrate the soul and fire the heart. 
<p align="justify">The invocation of the sweet singer is still addressed to 
    all mankind, to whom he speaks as,<b> You kindreds of the people</b>. 
    Divided into tribes and families, we are called in our courses and order to 
    appear before him and ascribe to him all honor. "All worship be to God 
    only," is the motto of one of our City companies, and it may well be the 
    motto of all the families upon earth. Family worship is peculiarly pleasing 
    unto him who is the God of all the families of Israel. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Give unto the LORD glory and strength.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">That is to say, recognize the glory and power of Jehovah, 
    and ascribe them unto him in your solemn hymns. Who is glorious but the 
    Lord? Who is strong, save our God? </p>
<p align="justify">You great nations who count yourselves both famous and 
    mighty, cease your boastings! You monarchs, who are styled imperial and 
    omnipotent, humble yourselves in the dust before the only Potentate. Glory 
    and strength are nowhere to be found, save with the Lord, all others possess 
    but the semblance thereof. Well did Massilion declare, "God alone is great!"</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">But who can do that to the full? Can all the nations of 
    the earth put together discharge the mighty debt? All conceivable honor is 
    due to our Creator, Preserver, Benefactor, and Redeemer. However much of 
    zealous homage we may offer to him, we cannot give him more than his due. If 
    we cannot bring in the full revenue which he justly claims, at least let us 
    not fail from want of honest endeavor. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Bring an offering, and come into his courts.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Come with an unbloody sacrifice; atonement for sin having 
    been made, it only remains to bring thank offerings, and let not these be 
    forgotten. To him who gives us all, we ought gladly to give our grateful 
    tithe. When assembling for public worship we should make a point of bringing 
    with us a contribution to his cause, according to that ancient word, "None 
    of you shall appear before me empty." The time will come when from all ranks 
    and nations the Lord will receive gifts when they gather together for his 
    worship. O long expected day begin!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This is the only beauty which he cares for in our public 
    services, and it is one for which no other can compensate. Beauty of 
    architecture and apparel he does not regard; moral and spiritual beauty is 
    that in which his soul delights. Worship must not be rendered to God in a 
    slovenly, sinful, superficial manner; we must be reverent, sincere, earnest, 
    and pure in heart both in our prayers and praises. Purity is the white linen 
    of the Lord's choristers. Righteousness is the lovely garment of his 
    priests. Holiness is the royal apparel of his servants. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Fear before him, all the earth. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">"Tremble" is the word in the original, and it expresses 
    the profoundest awe, just as the word "worship" does, which would be more 
    accurately translated by "bow down." Even the bodily frame would be moved to 
    trembling and prostration if men were thoroughly conscious of the power and 
    glory of Jehovah. Men of the world ridiculed "the Quakers" for trembling 
    when under the power of the Holy Spirit; had they been able to discern the 
    majesty of the Eternal they would have quaked also. There is a sacred 
    trembling which is quite consistent with joy, the heart may even quiver with 
    a solemn excess of delight. The sight of the King in his beauty caused no 
    alarm to John in Patmos, and yet it made him fall at his feet as dead. Oh, 
    to behold him and worship him with prostrate awe and sacred fear!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. Say among the heathen that the LORD reigns.</p></b>

<p align="justify">This is the gladdest news which can be carried to 
    them—the Lord Jehovah, in the person of his Son has assumed the throne, and 
    taken to himself his great power. Tell this out among the heathen, and let 
    the heathen themselves, being converted, repeat the same rejoicing. The 
    dominion of Jehovah Jesus is not irksome, his rule is fraught with untold 
    blessings, his yoke is easy, and his burden is light. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The world also shall be established that it shall not be 
    moved. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Society is safe where God is king, no revolutions shall 
    convulse his empire, no invasions shall disturb his kingdom. A settled 
    government is essential to national prosperity, the reign of the God of 
    truth and righteousness will promote this to the highest degree. Sin has 
    shaken the world, the reign of Jesus will set it fast again upon sure 
    foundations. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">He shall judge the people righteously.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">This is the best method for establishing society on a 
    secure basis, and this is the greatest source of joy to oppressed nations.<i> 
    Iniquity makes the dynasties of tyrants fall</i>, equity causes the throne 
    of Jesus to stand. He will impartially rule over Jew and Gentile, prince and 
    peasant, and this will bring happiness to those who are now the victims of 
    the despot's arbitrary will.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. Let the <i>heavens </i>rejoice, and let the <i>
    earth </i>be glad. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Above and below let the joy be manifested. Let the angels 
    who have stood in amaze at the wickedness of men, now rejoice over their 
    repentance and restoration to favor, and let men themselves express their 
    pleasure in seeing their true prince set upon his throne. The book of 
    creation has two covers—heavens and earth; and on each of these let the 
    glory of the Lord be emblazoned in letters of joy. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Let it be no more a troubled sea, wailing over 
    shipwrecked mariners, and rehearsing the griefs of widows and orphans—but 
    let it adopt a cheerful note, and rejoice in the kingdom of the Lord. Let it 
    thunder out the name of the Lord when its tides are at its full, and let all 
    its teeming life express the utmost joy because the Lord reigns even in the 
    depth of the sea. In common with the rest of the creation, the sea has 
    groaned and travailed until now; is not the time close at hand in which its 
    hollow murmur shall be exchanged for an outburst of joy? <i>Will not every 
    billow soon flash forth the praises of him who once trod the sea?</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. Let the field be joyful, and all that is 
    therein. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Let the cultivated plains praise the Lord. Peace enables 
    their owners to plough and sow and reap, without fear of the rapine of 
    invaders, and therefore in glad notes they applaud him whose empire is 
    peace. </p>
<p align="justify">Both men, and creatures that graze the plain, and the 
    crops themselves are represented as swelling the praises of Jehovah, and the 
    figure is both bold and warranted, for the day shall come when every 
    inhabited foot of ground shall yield its song, and every farmstead shall 
    contain a church.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Then shall all the trees of the forest rejoice. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He does not say, let them rejoice—but they shall do so. 
    The faith of the psalmist turns itself from the expression of desire, to the 
    fully assured prediction of the event. Groves have in old times stood 
    shuddering at the horrid orgies which have been performed within their 
    shade, the time shall come when they shall sing for joy because of the holy 
    worship, the sounds of which they shall hear. The bush is the stronghold of 
    savage men and robbers—but it shall be sanctified to retirement and 
    devotion. Perhaps the psalmist was thinking of the birds; so Keble must have 
    supposed, for he versifies the passage thus—</p>
<p align="justify">"Field exults and meadow fair,<br/>
    With each bud and blossom there,<br/>
    In the lonely woodlands now<br/>
    Chants aloud each rusting bough."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. They sing before the LORD, for he comes.</p></b>

<p align="justify">Even now he is near, his advent should, therefore, be the 
    cause of immediate rejoicing: already are we in his presence, let us worship 
    him with delight. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">For he comes to judge the earth.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">To rule it with discretion; not to tax it, and control it 
    by force, as kings often do—but to preside as magistrates do whose business 
    it is to see justice carried out between man and man.<i> All the world will 
    be under the jurisdiction of this great Judge, and before his bar all will 
    be summoned to appear. </i></p>

<p align="justify">At this moment he is on the road, and the hour of his 
    coming draws near. His great assize is proclaimed. Hear you not the 
    trumpets? His foot is on the threshold. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">He shall judge the world with righteousness.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">His essential rectitude will determine all causes and 
    cases, there will be no bribery and corruption there, neither can error or 
    failure be found in his decisions. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And the peoples with his truth.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Or rather "the nations in faithfulness." Honesty, 
    veracity, integrity, will rule upon his judgment seat. No nation shall be 
    favored there, and none be made to suffer through prejudice. The black man 
    shall be tried by the same law as his white master, the aboriginal shall 
    have justice executed for him against his civilized exterminator, the 
    crushed and hunted Bushman shall have space to appeal against the Boer who 
    slaughtered his tribe, and the South Sea Islander shall gain attention to 
    his piteous complaint against the treacherous wretch who kidnapped him from 
    his home. There shall be true judgment given without fear or favor. In all 
    this let the nations be glad, and the universe rejoice. </p>
<p align="justify">In closing, let us ourselves join in the song. Since the 
    whole universe is to be clothed with smiles, shall not we be glad? As John 
    Howe observes, "Shall we not partake in this common dutiful joy, and fall 
    into concert with the adoring loyal chorus? Will we cut ourselves off from 
    this happy throng? And what should put a pleasant face and aspect upon the 
    whole world—shall it only leave our faces covered with clouds, and a 
    mournful sadness?"</p>
