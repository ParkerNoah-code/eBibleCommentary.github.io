        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.980)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, March 12th, 1871, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me
          the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O
          Lord God of hosts,| -- Jeremiah 15:16.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jeremiah was a man of exceedingly sensitive temperament; the very
          reverse of Elijah. Yet he was sent of God to execute a duty which
          apparently required a person of great sternness and slender
          sensibility. It was his unhappy duty to denounce the judgments of God
          upon a people whom he dearly loved, but whom it was impossible to
          save; for even his deep anguish of heart and melting pathos were
          powerless with them, and rather excited their ridicule than their
          attention. Either they did not believe that he was sent of God at all,
          or else they neither cared for Jehovah nor for his prophet. Naturally
          mild and retiring, his strong sense of allegiance to God and love to
          Israel made him bear a fearless testimony for the truth; but the
          reproaches, insults, and threats, which were heaped upon him, sorely
          wounded his soul; and even deeper was his anguish, because he well
          knew that his rejected warnings were terribly true. He carried before
          his mind's eye at all times the picture of Jerusalem captured by her
          foes, and her wretched sons and daughters given up to the sword. There
          is no line in the whole of his prophecy more characteristic of him
          than that exclamation, |O that my head were waters, and mine eyes a
          fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of
          the daughter of my people.|
        </p>
        <p>
          He was eminently the man that had seen affliction, and yet in the
          midst of a wilderness of woe he discovered fountains of joy. Like that
          Blessed One, who was |the man of sorrows| and the acquaintance of
          grief, he sometimes rejoiced in spirit and blessed the name of the
          Lord. It will be both interesting and profitable to note the root of
          the joy which grew up in Jeremiah's heart, like a lone palm tree in
          the desert. Here was its substance. It was an intense delight to him
          to have been chosen to the prophetic office; and when the words of God
          came to him, he fed upon them as dainty food. They were often very
          bitter in themselves, for they mainly consisted of denunciations, yet
          being God's words, such was the prophet's love to his God, that he ate
          every syllable, bitter or not. This also was evermore a consolation to
          him -- that he was known by the people to be a prophet of Jehovah.
          This distinction, whatever persecution it brought upon him, was his
          joy |I am called by thy name.| God's word received, God's name named
          upon him, and God's work entrusted to him, these were stars which
          cheered the midnight of his grief. However hard his lot might be, and
          none seem to have fallen upon worse times, there were secret
          sweetnesses of which none could deprive him. When he was |filled with
          bitterness, and drunken with wormwood,| he still drank of that
          ever-flowing river, the streams whereof make glad the city of our God.
          The basis of faith's joy lies deeper than the water-floods of
          affliction; no torrents of misery can remove the firm foundations of
          our peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          May our hearts be so moulded by divine grace that the words of the
          weeping prophet in this verse may be proper language for us to use.
          Especially do I speak to those who during the last few weeks have
          found a Savior; my prayer and cry to God for you, beloved friends, is
          that you may say sincerely, |Thy words were found, and I did eat them;
          and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am
          called by thy name, O Lord God of hosts.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In considering these words, we shall begin by dwelling upon A
          MEMORABLE DISCOVERY -- |Thy words were found.| As Jeremiah meant them,
          they signified this: that certain messages came to him most clearly
          from God, and he recognised them as such; he ascertained how far the
          thoughts which passed through his mind were originated by the Spirit
          of God, and how far they were merely his own imaginings; he separated
          between the precious and the vile, and when he had found, discovered,
          and discerned God's word, then it was that he fed upon it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the words, as we may use them, may signify something more.
          Beloved, it is a great thing to find God's word, and discern it for
          ourselves. Many have heard it for years and yet have never found it. I
          may say of them as of the heathen gods, |Eyes have they, but they see
          not: ears have they, but they hear not.| Content with the outward
          letter of the Scriptures, the inner meaning is hid from their eyes. O
          that they had known the life-giving truth! O that they had found the
          |treasure hid in the field!| The word of God to them might as well be
          the word of King James the First, whose name dishonors our authorised
          version, for they have never felt that its truths proceed immediately
          from the throne of God, and bear the sign-manual of the King of kings.
          Hence they have never felt the weight of authority with which its
          authorship impresses holy writ. What is meant by finding God's words!
          The expression suggests the mode. A thing found has usually been
          sought for. Happy is that man who reads the Scriptures and hears the
          word -- searching all the while for the hidden spiritual sense, which
          is indeed the voice of God. The letter of the truth contains a kernel,
          which is the inner life of it. Like some tropical fruits, which are
          very large, but in which the actual life-germ is a comparatively small
          thing, so within the sacred volume are many words and books, but the
          living secret may be summed up in a few syllables. The mystery which
          was hid from ages, is a secret something which flesh and blood cannot
          reveal unto us. |Understandest thou what thou readest?| is a vital and
          heartsearching question, meaning more than appears at once. The chosen
          of God dig into the mines of revelation, believing that |Surely there
          is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it;|
          therefore they give their hearts to meditation, and cry mightily unto
          God to reveal himself unto them. Such seekers winnow sermons as the
          husbandman winnows his corn; they care little for the chaff of fair
          speeches; they desire only the fine wheat of the Lord's own truth.
          Solomon tells us the method of finding the true wisdom, in that
          cheering word at the commencement of the second chapter of the
          Proverbs, |My son, if thou wilt incline thine ear to wisdom, and apply
          thine heart to understanding; yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and
          liftest up thy voice for understanding; if thou seekest her as silver,
          and searches for her as for hid treasures; then shalt thou understand
          the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.| Though
          occasionally the Lord in his infinite sovereignty has been pleased to
          reveal his salvation to those who sought it not, according to his own
          word, |I am found of them that sought me not,| yet there is no promise
          to this effect; the promise is to those who seek.
        </p>
        <p>
          To find God's words, means that we have been made to understand them.
          A man may be well versed in Scripture, both in the English and in the
          original tongue; he may be accustomed to read the best of
          commentaries, and be acquainted with Eastern manners, and yet he may
          be quite ignorant as to the word of God. For the understanding of this
          Book, as to its depth of meaning, does not lie within the range of
          natural learning and human research; reason alone is blinded by the
          excess of light, and wanders in darkness at noon day; for |the natural
          man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are
          foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are
          spiritually discerned.| Before my conversion I was accustomed to read
          the Scriptures, to admire their grandeur, to feel the charm of their
          history, and wonder at the majesty of their language; but I altogether
          missed the Lord's intent therein; but when the Spirit came with his
          divine life, and quickened all the page to my newly-enlightened soul,
          the inner meaning-shone forth with quickening glory. The Bible is to
          many carnal minds almost as dull a book for reading as an untranslated
          Latin work would be to an ignorant ploughman, because they cannot get
          at the internal sense, which is to the words as juice to the grape, or
          the kernel to the nut. It is a tantalising riddle till you get the
          key; but the clue once found, the volume of our Father's grace absorbs
          our attention, delights our intellect, and enriches our heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the word of God means not only to understand it, but to
          appropriate it as belonging to yourself. To read a will is not an
          interesting occupation -- repetitions, legal phrases, tautologies
          multiplied to utter weariness; but if there be a legacy left to you in
          that will, no writing will be more fascinating; you will trip lightly
          over the lawyer's fences and five-barred gates, and rejoice as one
          that findeth spoil when you reach those clauses which leave certain
          |messages, tenements, and hereditaments| to yourself and heirs. In
          such a case every repetition becomes musical, and technical phrases
          sound harmoniously. After this manner we learn to enjoy the word of
          God by discovering that we have a part and lot in it. When we perceive
          that the Lord is calling us and blessing us, then have we found his
          word. When the divine promise assures us personally that our sin is
          forgiven, that our spirit is clothed in the righteousness of Christ,
          that heaven is for us, that we are accepted in the Beloved, then the
          word is found indeed. I will ask each hearer here, whether in this
          respect he has found God's word. Have you an ear to hear gospel truth
          as the voice of the Infinite God addressed to your own soul? The Dutch
          farmers at the Cape, at no very distant period, considered the
          hottentots around them to be little better than beasts, quite
          incapable of anything beyond mere eating, drinking, stealing, and
          lying. After our missionaries had labored among the natives for a
          time, one of them was found reading the Bible by the roadside. The
          Dutchman enquired of him, |What book are you reading?| -- |The Bible.|
          |The Bible! Why that book was never intended for you.| -- |Indeed it
          was,| said the black man, |for I see my name here.| |Your name:
          Where?| cried the farmer. |Show it to me.| -- |There,| said the
          Hottentot, putting his finger on the word |sinners.| |That's my name;
          I am a sinner, and Jesus Christ came to save me.| It were well indeed
          if men would but read the Bible, saying, |In this volume the great God
          condescends to speak to me, and bids me come and reason with him that
          my scarlet sins may become white; therein he appeals to my weakness
          that he may remove it, to my wilfulness that he may subdue it, to my
          distance from him that he may bring me near!| Happy is that man who
          hears or reads the word of God for himself, feeling evermore a living
          power witnessing within his soul, and operating mightily upon him.
          Unapplied truth is useless. Unappropriated truth may condemn but
          cannot save. The word of God to an unregenerate heart is like a
          trumpet at the ear of a corpse: the sound is lost. Beloved, I pray
          that you may discern the truth, and then may grasp it as your own. May
          your interest and title to the promises be clearly made out, so that
          not presumptuously, but with the full approbation of your conscience,
          you may know yourself to be beloved of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Thy word was found.| Yes, indeed, it has been found by many of us,
          and a blessed find it was! Recollect, my brethren, the time when you
          first found God's word. Recall the period of your conversion; let the
          remembrance kindle in you anew the flame of gratitude. Magnify the
          divine grace which revealed the heavenly word to you. What a removal
          of darkness, and bursting in of glory you then felt! It was a
          discovery far more memorable than the finding of a new continent by
          Columbus, or the discovery of gold mines in the southern continent --
          you found eternal life in God's word. May you who have never found the
          life-giving word, be led to desire it. We pray for you, that the Lord
          may open your eyes to see wondrous things in his law.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, our text testifies to AN EAGER RECEPTION. |Thy words
          were found, and I did eat them.|
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not |I did hear them,| for that he might have done, and yet have
          perished. Herod heard John gladly, and yet became his murderer. He
          does not say, |I did learn them by heart| -- hundreds have committed
          chapters to memory, and were rather wearied than benefited thereby.
          The Scribes fought over the jots and titles of the law, but were blind
          leaders of the blind not withstanding. It is not |Thy words were
          found, and I did repeat them,| for that he might have done as a parrot
          repeats language it is taught: nor is it even, |Thy words were found,
          and I remembered them;| for though its an excellent thing to store
          truth in the memory, yet the blessed effect of the divine words comes
          rather to those who ponder them in their hearts. |Thy words were
          found, and I did eat them.| What is meant by eating God's words? The
          phrase signifies more than any other word could express. It implies an
          eager study -- |I did eat them.| I could not have too much of them,
          could not enter too thoroughly into their consideration. He who loves
          the Savior desires to grow in knowledge of him; he cannot read or hear
          too much or too often concerning his great Redeemer. He turns to the
          holy page with ever new delight; he seeks the blessing of the man who
          meditates in God's law, both day and night. It is pleasing to notice
          the sharp-set, spiritual appetite of a new convert; he hungers and
          thirsts after righteousness; he will hear a sermon without fatigue,
          though he may have to stand in an uncomfortable position; and when one
          discourse is over, he is ready for another. O that we all had our
          first appetites back again! Some professors grow very squeamish and
          proudly delicate; they cannot feed on heavenly truth, because forsooth
          they see defects in the style of the preacher, or in the manner of the
          service. Some of you need a dose of bitters to keep you from
          quarrelling with your food. When the word was found by my soul I did
          not stand to remark upon an inelegant expression or a misplaced word,
          but I seized at once the marrow of the truth, and left the bones to
          the dogs. I drank in the expressed juice of the sacred clusters, and
          left the husks to the swine. I was greedy for the truth. My soul
          hungered even to ravenousness to be fed upon the bread of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          The expression also implies cheerful reception. |I did eat them.| I
          was so in love with thy word that I not merely held it, rejoiced in
          it, and embraced it, but I received it into my inner man. I was not in
          a frame of mind to judge God's word, but I accepted all without demur;
          I did not venture to sit in judgment upon my judge, and become the
          reviser of the unerring God. Whatever I found to be in his word I
          received with intense joy. The stamp of divine authority upon any
          teaching is enough for the believer. Proud self-will demands to have
          doctrines proved by reasoning, but faith lets the declaration of
          Jehovah stand in the place of argument. Others may cry, |Let us spin
          our creed out of our own bowels like the spiders; let us find in the
          easings of the great the grounds of our beliefs, or let us remain in a
          state of suspense, to be moulded by fresh discoveries;| but we are
          committed to revelation, our minds are made up; we confess that we
          have eaten God's word and intend still to feed upon it -- upon the
          whole of it, and upon nothing else. Open your mouths, ye wild asses of
          the wilderness, and snuff up wind; our food is more substantial, and
          we will not leave it to wander with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The expression signifies also an intense belief. |Thy words were
          found, and I did eat them.| He did not say, |Perhaps it is true, and
          if it be so it is of no great consequence,| but he made practical use
          of it at once. He set about testing the power of the word to nourish
          his soul; he brought it into the most intimate contact with his being,
          and allowed it to operate upon his vital parts. We have heard that
          God's word is life; be it ours to possess that life abundantly. The
          truth makes men strong, free, pure, god-like. Let us then eat it, that
          it may purify, strengthen, liberate and elevate us. Whatever God's
          word by his Spirit can do for man, it should be our desire to
          experience for ourselves. Blessed is that man who is so humbled as to
          become like a little child in the submission of his mind, his
          judgment, and all his faculties to the operation of the word of divine
          truth; he has eaten it, and shall live by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The language before us means besides both the diligent treasuring up
          of the truth and the inward digestion of the same. Food eaten does not
          long continue as it was; the juices of the body operate upon it, and
          the substance is dissolved and absorbed, so that it becomes a part of
          the man's body. So when we find God's truth, we delight to meditate,
          con template, and consider. We let it dwell in our hearts richly till
          at last its sustaining, upbuilding, nourishing influence is felt, and
          we grow thereby. It is not a hasty swallowing of the word which is
          blessed to us, but a deliberate eating of it. Our inward life acts
          upon the truth, and the truth acts upon our life. We become one with
          the truth, and the truth one with us. I would to God we were all more
          given to feeding and lying down in the green pastures of God's word;
          the sheep fattens as it chews the cud at peace, and so do we.
          Establishment in the gospel is the result of meditation, and nothing
          is more desirable at this present crisis than that all believers
          should more constantly study and weigh the word of God. Neglect in
          this matter has weakened, is weakening, and will weaken the church. We
          want at this time not merely persons who have been aroused by solemn
          exhortation, and led to give their hearts to Christ under the
          influence of deep emotion, but Christians well instructed in the
          things which are verily believed among us, rooted and grounded in
          gospel doctrines. Many professing Christians think very lightly of
          Scriptural knowledge, and especially of an experimental acquaintance
          with divine truth. Few nowadays have studied the doctrines of grace so
          as to be able to give a reason for the hope that is in them. Too often
          converts are made by excitement, and, as a consequence, when the
          excitement is gone, they grow cold; some of them go back to the world,
          and prove that they were never taught of God, and others linger on in
          a half-starved condition, because soul-sustaining truth is hidden from
          them. The man who knows the truth, and feels that the truth has made
          him free, is the man who will continue a free man at all hazards.
          There are enemies of the faith about nowadays; error is put in very
          tempting forms. Those who try to subvert the gospel are exceedingly
          dextrous, and know how to make every falsehood fascinating. These will
          rend and devour, but who will be their victims? Not the instructed
          saints, not those who can say |Thy words were found, and I did eat
          them,| but the mixed multitude in nominal union with the church, who
          scarce know what they believe, or knowing it merely in the letter have
          no inward vital acquaintance therewith. We read in the word of God of
          certain deceivers who would, if it were possible, deceive the very
          elect, from which we gather that the elect cannot be deceived, and
          that for this reason -- that the truth is not held in the hand of the
          elect man as a staff which can be wrenched from him, but he has eaten
          it: it has entered into his vital substance. You cannot tear away from
          a man what has become assimilated to himself. You might draw the
          silken thread out of a piece of tapestry, and in so doing injure the
          material, but you cannot remove the truth which is interwoven into the
          fabric of our new-born nature by the Holy Spirit. A Christian is dyed
          ingrain with the truth -- he wears no flying nor fading colors; he can
          as soon cease to be as cease to believe what he has learned by the
          Spirit's teaching. In olden times, the fury of persecutors has failed
          to make the servants of Christ deny the faith. The saints were taken
          to the stake, but the fires which devoured their bodies only burned
          their testimonies into the hearts of other witnesses. They were
          faithful even unto death. This glorious firmness in the faith is
          greatly needed now to resist the insidiousness of error. Besides, dear
          friends, it may in the providence of God happen that some of you will
          be taken away from the ministry which now feeds you, and what will you
          do if the word of God be not in your inmost souls? I have observed
          many who did run well when under a gospel ministry, who, when they
          have been removed into a barren region, have lagged and loitered in
          the race. Some whose principles were never very deep have given them
          up when placed in society which despised them. I pray you get such a
          hold of the gospel, that you need not be dependent upon the preacher
          or upon earnest companions. Let not your faith stand in the wisdom of
          man, but in the power of God. No truth will be of any use to you
          unless it is branded into you; yea, and made to penetrate the marrow
          of your being. If you could give up truth you have never received it.
          He only has the truth of God who so holds it that he could never part
          with it. A person takes a piece of bread and eats it. He who gave it
          to him demands it back. If he had put that bread upon a shelf, or laid
          it in a cupboard, he can hand it down; but if he can reply, |I have
          eaten it,| there is an end to the request; no human power can
          reproduce what is already eaten. |Give up justification by faith and
          trust in sacraments,| says the Ritualist. |Give up faith and follow
          reason,| cries the Infidel. We are utterly unable to do either. And
          why? Because our spiritual nature has absorbed the truth into itself,
          and none can separate it from us, or us from it. To live upon the
          truth is the sure method to prevent apostacy. |Be not carried about
          with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the
          heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not
          profited them that have been occupied therein.| May you all be rooted
          and built up in Christ Jesus, and established in the faith as ye have
          been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, good friend, you cannot be very useful to others if you are
          an unintelligent Christian. To do much good, we must have truth ready
          to hand, and be apt to teach. I desire that you may grow up, you who
          are new-born into the Christian family, to become fathers and mothers
          in Israel; but this cannot be, unless you as new-born babes desire the
          unadulterated milk of the word, that you may grow thereby. O for a
          race of Bible-reading Christians! We have long had a society for
          selling the Bible, but who shall found a society for getting the Bible
          read? A young man who never had read his Bible was tempted to do so,
          and led to conversion by the gift of a bookmarker, presented to him by
          a relative. The gift was made upon the condition that it should be put
          into his Bible, but should never stop two days in a place. He meant to
          shift it, and not to read the book, but his eye glanced on a text;
          after awhile he became interested, by-and-by he became converted, and
          then the bookmarker was moved with growing pleasure. I am afraid that
          even some professors cannot say that they shift their bookmark every
          day. Probably of all the books printed, the most widely circulated,
          and the least read volume, is the word of God. Books about the Bible
          are read, I fear, more than the Book itself. Do you believe we should
          see all these parties and sects if people studiously followed the
          teaching of inspiration? The Word is one; whence these many creeds? We
          cry, |the Bible, and the Bible alone, is the religion of Protestants;|
          but it is not true of half the Protestants. Some overlay the Bible
          with the Prayer-book, and kill its living meaning; others read through
          the spectacles of a religious leader, and rather follow man's gloss
          than God's text. Few indeed come to the pure fount of gospel
          undefiled. A second-hand religion suits most, for it spares them the
          trouble of thinking, which to many is a labor too severe while to be
          taught of man is so much easier than to wait upon the Holy Spirit for
          instruction. Remember ye, my beloved children in Christ, the words of
          David, and make them your own. |I will delight myself in thy statutes:
          I will not forget thy word.| |How sweet are thy words unto my taste!
          yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth.| |Thy testimonies have I taken as
          an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.| |Mine
          eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.|
          |My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly. I
          have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before
          thee.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Thirdly, the text tells us of HAPPY CONSEQUENCES. |Thy word was
          unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart.| He who has spiritually
          found God's word, and consequently feeds upon it, is the happy man.
          But in order to get joy from God's word we must receive it
          universally. Jeremiah first speaks of God's |words,| then he changes
          the number and speaks of God's |word.| We are not only to receive
          parts of the gospel, but the whole of it, and then it will afford us
          great joy. That man's heart is right with God who can honestly say
          that all the testimonies of God are dear to him. |But,| saith one,
          |that is impossible: parts of the Bible are full of terrible
          denunciations; can they afford us joy?| In this way, brethren. If God
          appoints that sin should be punished, we are not to rebel against his
          righteous ordinance, nor to close our minds to the consideration of
          divine justice: God's judgments are right, and what is right we must
          rejoice in. Moreover, by the threatenings of the word many are led to
          forsake their sin, and thus the warning itself is a means of grace. To
          tender-hearted Jeremiah I have no doubt it was a trial to say, |Your
          city will be destroyed, and your women and your children will be
          slain.| But when he considered that some might be led to repentance he
          would with tearful vehemence deal out the thunder of the Lord. But,
          brethren, God's word is not all threatening. How much of it consists
          of exceeding great and precious promises? grace drops from it like
          honey from the comb. How would even Jeremiah brush away the falling
          tear, while that face usually so clouded would beam as the sun when he
          spoke of the Messiah? Surely, if there be anything in the whole range
          of truth which can make our hearts leap for joy, it is the part of it
          which touches upon the lovely person and finished work of our adorable
          Redeemer, to whom be honor and glory for ever. Receive the whole of
          God's word. Do not cut a single text out of Scripture or desire to
          pervert its meaning. Hold the truth in its entirety and harmony, and
          then as a matter of certainty it will become to you the joy and
          rejoicing of your spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Allow me to interject another thought. No word of God to Jeremiah
          would have given him joy if he had not been obedient to it. If he had
          kept back a part of his Master's message, it would have been a burden
          intolerable to his conscience. What a wound it makes in the heart if
          we have inwardly to confess, |I have been unfaithful. I have neglected
          a command of the Host High.| Never, I beseech you, allow any text of
          Scripture to accuse you of having neglected its teaching or denied its
          obvious meaning. There are ordinances to which some of you have not
          submitted yourselves which you know to be the will of Jesus Christ.
          How can the Scriptures be a joy and rejoicing to you when their pages
          accuse you of disobedience to your Master's will? In order to have the
          full joy of the testimony of God, your mind must yield itself to what
          God reveals as the plastic clay to the potter's touch, your willing
          spirit must be prompt to run as with winged feet in the ways of
          obedience to all that Christ commands. Then the word being found, and
          you having eaten it, it will be to you a song in the house of your
          pilgrimage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me refresh your memories for a moment by reminding you of certain
          choice truths in God's word which are brimming with comfort. There is
          the doctrine of election: the Lord has a people whom he has chosen,
          and whom he loved before the foundations of the world. I will suppose
          that you have found it out for yourself, and have read the riddle, and
          like the apostle Paul, can say, |Whom he did foreknow, he also did
          predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son; and whom he did
          predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also
          justified.| I will suppose that you know yourself to be called, and
          therefore know yourself to be predestinated. Is not this the joy and
          rejoicing of your heart? Is it not to you a very heaven below to
          believe that ere the hills were made God loved you, ere sin was born
          or Satan fell, your name was in his book, and he regarded you with
          infinite affection? Could any doctrine be a more abundant table,
          spread for you in the presence of your enemies? Take the other
          doctrine, the doctrine of the immutability of divine love. Before you
          knew the secret of it, it was a mere dogma; but now you understand
          that Jesus never changes, and therefore the promises are yea and amen,
          you will, you must rejoice. Having loved his own, he loved them to the
          end. Is not this music to your ear? |I have loved thee with an
          everlasting love,| is not this a heavenly assurance? As you sit down
          and consider for yourself, |God has loved me, for he has given me
          salvation in Jesus Christ, and the mountains may depart, and the hills
          be removed, but the covenant of his grace cannot depart from me;| will
          not your cup run over, and your soul dance before the ark of God? Of
          course it will not be so till you have found the word for yourself,
          and have eaten it, but then it shall be marrow and fatness to you.
          Thousands of God's people live in doubts and fears, because they have
          not eaten God's word as they should; they do not know the fullness of
          the blessings of the gospel of peace. How many are in bondage through
          the fear that after all though they have been for years believers they
          are not yet saved, whereas if they read the Scriptures, and received
          their meaning, they would know that the moment the sinner believes in
          Christ he is saved in that very instant he has passed from death into
          life, and shall never come into condemnation. If they read the
          Scriptures, would they endure such doubts about being left to perish
          after having believed? The thing is impossible. The people of his
          choice Jehovah cannot cast away. No members of Christ's body shall be
          suffered to perish, or else the body of Christ would be mangled, and
          he himself would be the head of a dismembered frame. To have a clear
          understanding of the gospel, to know the covenant which like a mighty
          rock underlies all gospel blessings, to know Christ and our union with
          him, to know his righteousness, his perfection and our perfection in
          him, to know the indwelling of the Holy Ghost, these things must
          inevitably make us strong in the joy of the Lord. Half our doubts and
          fears would vanish if we had more acquaintance with the Lord's
          statutes. Other knowledge brings sorrow, but this wisdom is the joy
          and rejoicing of the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, if there is a quarrel between you and any text of Scripture,
          end the dispute by giving way at once, for the word of God is right,
          and you are wrong. Do not say, |We have always been of one way of
          thinking, and our parents were so before us.| Have respect unto God,
          and sit at Jesus' feet. The Lord's teaching is in this Book, and may
          be opened to you by his Spirit. Test everything by the word; prove the
          spirits whether they be of God. Do not be such fools as to take your
          religion from fallible men when you may have it from the infallible
          God. Some who do so are not fools in other matters, but in this case
          it may be said of them as it was once said of the people of an Italian
          city, |They were not fools, but they acted as if they were.| Persons
          who would not take the opinion of anybody else as to the goodness of a
          half-crown, will leave their religion to be settled by an Act of
          Parliament, or by convocation, or by conference. What are brains given
          to us for? Are we for ever to be the slaves of majorities and follow a
          multitude to do evil? God forbid! Stand upright, O Christian man, and
          be a man. God has given you a judgment, and his Spirit waits to
          enlighten it. Search the Scriptures! See whether the things handed
          down by tradition came from the devil or from God, for many an ancient
          maxim may be traced to the infernal pit. To the law and to the
          testimony, if they speak not according to this word it is because
          there is no light in them. May we have grace given us like Ezekiel to
          receive the roll from the Lord's hand, to eat it, and to find it in
          our mouth as honey for sweetness.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The fourth point is A DISTINGUISHING TITLE. |I am called by thy
          name, O Lord God of hosts.| This may not appear to some of you a very
          joyful thing -- to Jeremiah it was pre-eminently so. In Jeremiah's day
          the name of the Lord God of hosts was despised. The God of hosts was
          the subject of derision among the rabble of Jerusalem, and the weeping
          prophet of mournful countenance, who spoiled their mirth, came in for
          his full share of scorn. Now. Jeremiah, instead of feeling it a hard
          thing to be associated with the Lord in this contempt of the wicked,
          was glad to be so honored. The reproaches of them that reviled the
          Lord fell upon his poor servant, and he was content to have it so. O
          you who love Jesus Christ, never shun the scandal of his cross! Count
          it glory to be despised for his sake. Let fear be far from you.
          Remember Moses, of whom it is written, |he esteemed the reproach of
          Christ to be greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt.| It does
          not say he esteemed Christ to be greater riches, an ordinary believer
          would do that; but he reckoned the worst thing connected with Christ
          to be better than the best thing about the world. The reproach of
          Christ he esteemed above Pharaoh's crown. Disciples of Jesus, be
          willing to bear all the contumely the wicked pour upon you for your
          Lord's sake, for in so doing they help to make you blessed. Through
          the mire, and through the slough, march side by side with truth, for
          those who share her pilgrimage shall share her exaltation. Be content
          to abide with Christ in his humiliation, for only so may you be sure
          that you shall be with him in his glory. It was a comfort to Jeremiah
          that he bore the name of the despised God. It made him the object of
          very much persecution as well as contempt; the king put him in the
          dungeon; he was made to eat the bread of affliction, and was in
          tribulations oft, but he took it all joyfully for the Lord's sake. And
          if to serve Christ to-day, and bear his name, should entail suffering
          extreme, as in the days of Rome's tyranny, yet, my brethren, we ought
          to be cheerful in the bearing of it, and glad that we are counted
          worthy to suffer for the name of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet I am afraid I am speaking to some who do not count it a fair thing
          to bear the name of the Most High. I gather this from their conduct.
          They have a belief in Jesus, they hope they have, but they have never
          avowed Christ's name. You have missed, then, that which was a comfort
          to the prophet. Why have you missed it? Because you imagined that it
          would be a source of discomfort to you? Are you wiser than the
          prophet? To him it was consolation that he was called by God's name.
          Do you think it would be a sorrow to you? |Oh!| saith one, |I could
          not bear the world's rebuke.| Can you bear Christ's rebuke, when he
          will say to those who did not confess him before men, |I never knew
          you|? But you say you could not live up to a profession; you are
          afraid your life might fall short of what it should be -- a very
          salutary fear; but do you hope to improve your life by beginning with
          disobedience! If I own my Savior's name, it is Christ's business to
          keep me; but if I am so overwise that I think I am safer in the path
          of disobedience, then I cannot reckon upon grace to preserve me. The
          warfare is arduous, but we do enter upon it at our own charges, there
          is one who has promised to help us. Well, if you will be cowards, I
          will part company with you. If you were every one of you this day
          enemies of Christ, or if you were all of you lovers of Christ in
          secret, and none of you gloried in him, I, for my part, could not fire
          a moment without being an avowed Christian. I say not this in egotism,
          but as fact. My heart might sooner cease to beat than cease to own the
          Lord. It is a sneaking thing, and utterly degrading that my Lord
          should die upon the cross for me to save my soul from hell, and I
          should be ashamed to wear his livery; that he should honor me by
          redeeming me with his blood, and I should deny to him the little honor
          that my poor name could give when it is enrolled with his people. Nay,
          though least of all his followers, put down my name, O recording
          angel, and there let it stand, and if all men revile and devils rage
          so let it be. It shall be my heaven to suffer hell for Christ, if such
          must needs be. I cannot comprehend how so many believers remain
          outside the visible church of Christ. I would not question the safety
          of any man who has believed in Jesus, but I do avow that I would not
          run the risk that non-confessors run. For what is the gospel? |He that
          with his heart believeth, and with his mouth maketh confession of him
          should be saved.| How dare you leave out one half of the gospel
          command? What was the gospel which according to the Evangelist Mark is
          to be preached to every creature? It runs thus: |He that believeth and
          is baptised shall be saved.| I do not question the safety of the soul
          that has believed, but I do say again, I would not run the risk of the
          man who, having believed, refuses to be baptised. It is plainly his
          Master's will. I question the genuineness of his faith if he starts
          back from obedience to the known command of Jesus Christ. My dear
          brother, to confess Christ is so easy a burden, it involves so
          temporary a loss, and so real a gain, that I would have you say, |I
          have found God's word, and I have eaten it: it is the joy and
          rejoicing of my soul; and now from this day let others do as they
          will, but I will serve the Lord. I bow my willing back to his cross. I
          will be buried with him in baptism unto death, I would die to the
          world, and rise to newness of life through his Spirit.| Blessed are
          they who go to their Lord without the camp, leaving the world's
          religion as well as its sin, in obedience to that sacred call: |Come
          out from among them, and be ye separate, and touch not the unclean
          thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye
          shall be my sons and daughters.| The Lord deal graciously with you,
          beloved, and lead you in a plain path, because of your enemies, for
          his name's sake. Amen.
