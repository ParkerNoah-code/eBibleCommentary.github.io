        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.3500)</p>
        <p>Published on Thursday, February 24th, 1916.</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.</p>
        <p>"He that covereth his sins shall not prosper." -- Proverbs 38:13.</p>
        <p>"Thou Hast covered all their sins." -- Psalm 85:2.</p>
        <p>
          IN THESE two texts we have man's covering, which is worthless and
          culpable, and God's covering, which is profitable, and worthy of all
          acceptation. No sooner had man disobeyed his Maker's will in the
          garden of Eden than he discovered, to his surprise and dismay, that he
          was naked, and he set about at once to make himself a covering. It was
          a poor attempt which our first parents made, and it proved a miserable
          failure. "They sewed fig-leaves together." After that God came in,
          revealed to them yet more fully their nakedness, made them confess
          their sin, brought their transgression home to them, and then it is
          written, the Lord God made them coats of skin. Probably the coats were
          made of the skins of animals which had been offered in sacrifice, and,
          if so, they were a fit type of him who has provided us with a
          sin-offering and a robe of perfect righteousness. Every man since the
          days of Adam has gone through much of the same experience, more or
          less relying on his own ingenuity to hide his own confusion of face.
          He has discovered that sin has made him naked, and he has set to work
          to clothe himself. As I shall have to show you presently, he has never
          succeeded. But God has been pleased to deal with his own people,
          according to the riches of his grace; he has covered their shame and
          put away their sins that they should not be remembered any more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me now direct your attention, first, to man's covering, and its
          failure; and then to God's covering, and its perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          May the Holy Spirit be pleased to give you discernment, that you may
          see your destitute state in the presence of God, and understand the
          merciful relief that God himself has provided in the bounty of his
          grace!
        </p>
        <p>I. MAN'S COVERING.</p>
        <p>
          There are many ways in which men try to cover their sin. Some do so by
          denying that they have sinned, or, admitting the fact, they deny the
          guilt; or else, candidly acknowledging both the sin and the guilt,
          they excuse and exonerate themselves on the plea of certain
          circumstances which rendered it, according to their showing, almost
          inevitable that they should act as they have done. By pretext and
          presence, apology and self-vindication, they acquit themselves of all
          criminality, and put a fine gloss upon every foul delinquency.
          Excuse-making is the commonest trade under heaven. The slenderest
          materials are put to the greatest account. A man who has no valid
          argument in arrest of judgment, no feasible reason why he should not
          be condemned, will go about and bring a thousand excuses, and ten
          thousand circumstances of extenuation, the whole of them weak and
          attenuated as a spider's web. Someone here may be saying within
          himself, "It may be I have broken the law of God, but it was too
          severe. To keep so perfect a law was impossible. I have violated it,
          but then I am a man, endowed with passions that involve propensities,
          and inflamed with desires that need gratification. How could I do
          otherwise than I have done? Placed in peculiar circumstances, I am
          borne along with the current. Subject to special temptations, I yield
          to the fascination; this is natural." So you think; so you essay to
          exculpate yourself. But, in truth, you are now committing a fresh sin;
          for you are abasing God, you are inculpating the Almighty. You are
          impugning the law to vindicate yourself for breaking it. There is no
          small degree of criminality about such an unrighteous defence. The law
          is holy, just, and good. You are throwing the onus of your sins upon
          God. You are trying to mane out that, after all, you are not to blame,
          but the fault lies with him who gave the commandment. Do you think
          that this will be tolerated? Shall the prisoner at the bar bring
          accusations against the Judge who tries him? Or shall he challenge the
          equity of the statute while he is arraigned for violating it? And as
          for the circumstances that you plead, what valid excuse can they
          furnish, Has it come to this -- that it was not you, but your
          necessities, that did the wrong and are answerable for the
          consequence? Not you, indeed! you are a harmless innocent victim of
          circumstances! I suppose, instead of being censured, you ought almost
          to be pitied. What is this, again, but throwing the blame upon the
          arrangements of Providence, and saying to God, "It is the harshness of
          thy discipline, not the perverseness of my actions, that involves me
          in sin." What, I say, is this but a high impertinence, ay, veritable
          treason, against the Majesty of that thrice holy God, before whom even
          perfect angels veil their faces, while they cry, "Holy, holy, holy,
          Lord God of Hosts"? I pray thee resort not to such a covering as this,
          because, while it is utterly useless, it adds sin to sin, and exposes
          thee to fresh shame.
        </p>
        <p>
          In many cases persons violating the law of God have hoped to cover
          their transgression by secrecy. They have done the deed in darkness.
          They hope that no ear of man heard their footfall, or listened to
          their speech. Possibly they themselves held their tongue, and
          flattered themselves that no observer witnessed their movements or
          could divulge their action. So was it with Achan. I dare say he took
          the wedge of gold and the Babylonish garment, mid the confusion of the
          battle, and hid it when his comrades seemed too much engaged to notice
          so trivial fan affair. While they were rushing over the fallen walls
          of Jericho, amidst the debris and the dust, he might be unmolested;
          and then, in the dead of night, while they slept, he turned the sod of
          his tent, dug into the earth, and buried there his coveted treasure.
          All looks right, to his heart's content. He has smoothed it down, and
          spread his carpet over the grave of his lust. Little did he reckon of
          the Omniscient eye. Little did he count on the unerring lot that would
          come home to the tribe of Judah, to the family of the Zarhites, to the
          house of Zabdir, and, at last, to the son of Carmi, so that Achan
          himself would have to stand out confessed as a traitor -- a robber of
          his God. Men little know the ways in which the Almighty can find them
          out, and bring the evidence that convicts, out of the devices that
          were intended to cover their sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you not know that Providence is a wonderful detective? There are
          hounds upon the track of every thief, and murderer, and liar -- in
          foot, upon every sinner of every kind. Each sin leaves a trail. The
          dogs of judgment will be sure to scent it out, and find their prey.
          There is no disentangling yourselves from the meshes of guilt; no
          possibility of evading the penalty of transgression. Very wonderful
          have been the ways in which persons who have committed crimes have
          been brought to judgment. A trifle becomes a tell-tale. The method of
          deceit gives a clue to the manner of discovery. Wretched the men who
          bury their secrets in their own bosom. Their conscience plays traitor
          to them. They have often been forged to betray themselves. We have
          read of men talking in their sleep to their fellows, and babbling out
          in their dreams the crime they had committed years before. God would
          have the secret disclosed. No eye had seen, neither could other tongue
          have bold, but the man turned king's evidence against himself; he has
          thus brought himself to judgment. It has often happened, in some form
          or other, that conscience has thus been witness against men. Do I
          address anyone who is just now practicing a secret sin? You would not
          have me point you out for all the world, nor shall I do so. Believe
          me, however, the sin is known. Dexterous though you have been in the
          attempt to conceal it, it has been seen. As surely as you live, it has
          been seen. "By whom?" say you. Ah! by One who never forgets what he
          sees, and will be sure to tell of it. He may commission a little bird
          of the air to whisper it. Certainly he will one day proclaim it by the
          sound of trumpet to listening worlds. You are watched, sir; you are
          known. You have been narrowly observed, young girl; those things you
          have hidden away will be brought to light, for God is the great
          discoverer of sin. His eye has marked you; his providence will track
          you. It is vain to think that ye can conceal your transgressions.
          Before high heaven, disguise is futile. Yea, the darkness hideth not;
          the night shineth as the day. I have known persons who have harboured
          a sin in their breast till it has preyed upon their constitution. They
          have been like the Spartan boy who had stolen a fox, and was ashamed
          to have it known, so he kept it within his garment, till it ate
          through his flesh, and he fell dead. He suffered the fox to gnaw his
          heart ere he would betray himself. There are those who have got a sin,
          if not a lie in their right hand, yea, a lie in their heart, and it is
          eating into their very life. They dare not confess it. If they would
          confess it to their God, and make restitution to those whom they have
          offended, they would soon come to peace; but they vainly hope that
          they can cover the sin, and hide it from the eyes of God and man. He
          that covereth his sin in this fashion shall not prosper.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, full many a time sinners have tried to cover their sin with
          falsehood. Indeed, this is the usual habit -- to lie -- to cloak their
          guilt by denying it. Was not this the way with Gehazi? When the
          prophet said, "Whence comest thou, Gehazi?" he said, "Thy servant went
          no whither." Then the prophet told him that the leprosy of Naaman
          should cleave to him all the days of his life. The sin of Ananias and
          Sapphira, in lying in order to hide their sin, how quickly was it
          discovered, and how terrible was the retribution! I wonder that men
          and women can lie as they do after reading that story. "Hast thou sold
          the land for so much?" said Peter. And Ananias said, "Yea, for so
          much." At that instant he fell down and gave up the ghost. Three hours
          after, when his wife, Sapphire, said the same, the feet of the young
          men who had buried her husband were at the door, ready to carry out
          her corpse, and bury her by his side. Oh! sirs, ye must weave a
          tangled web, indeed, when once ye begin to deceive; and when you have
          woven it you will have to add lie to lie, and lie to lie, and yet all
          to no purpose, for you will be surely found out. There is something
          about a lie that always deludes the man who utters it. Liars have need
          of good memories. They are sure to leave a little corner uncovered
          through which the truth escapes. Their story does not hang together.
          Discrepancies excite suspicions, and evasions furnish a clue to
          discoveries, till the naked truth is unveiled. Then the deeper the
          plot the fouler is the shame. But to lie unto the God of truth, of
          what avail can that be? What advantageth it you to plead "not guilty,"
          when he has witnessed your crime? That infallible Eye which never
          mistakes is never closed. He knows everything; from him no secret is
          hid. Why, therefore, dost thou imagine that thou canst deceive thy
          Maker?
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some who try to cover their sin by prevarication. With
          cunning subtlety they strive to evade personal responsibility.
          Memorable is the instance of David. I will not dwell upon his flagrant
          crime; but I must remind you of his sorry subterfuge, when he tried to
          hide the baseness of his lust by conspiring to cause the death of
          Uriah. There have been those who have schemed deep and long to throw
          the blame on others, even to the injury of their reputation, to escape
          the odium of their own malpractices. Who knows but in this
          congregation there may be someone who affects a high social position,
          supported by a deep mercantile immorality? Merchants there have been
          that have swollen before the public as men of wealth, while they were
          falsifying their acoounts, abstracting money, yet making the books
          tally, rolling in luxury, and living in jeopardy. Have they prospered?
          Were they to be envied? The detection that long haunted them at length
          overtook them; could they look it in the face? We have heard of their
          blank despair, their insane suicide; at any rate, a miserable exposure
          has been their melancholy climax. "Be sure your sin will find you
          out." You may run the length of your tether. It is short. The hounds
          of justice, swift of scent and strong of limb, are on your trail. Rest
          assured, you will be discovered. Could you escape the due reward in
          this life, yet certainly your guilt is known in heaven, and you shall
          be judged and condemned in that great day which shall decide your
          eternal destiny. Seek not, then, to cover up sin with such transparent
          cobwebs as these.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people flatter themselves that their sin has already been hidden
          away by the lapse of time. "It was so very long ago," says one, "I had
          almost forgotten it; I was a lad at the time." "Aye," says another, "I
          am gray-headed now. It must have been twenty or thirty years ago.
          Surely you do not think that the sin of my far-off days will be
          brought out against me? The thing is gone by. Time must have
          obliterated it." Not so, my friend. It may be the lapse of time will
          only make the discovery the more clear. A boy once went into his
          father's orchard, and there in his rough play he broke a little tree
          which his father valued. But, rapidly putting it together again, he
          managed to conceal the fact, for the disunited parts of the tree took
          kindly to each other, and the tree stood as before. It so happened
          that more than forty years afterwards he went into that garden after a
          storm had blown across it in the night, and he found that the tree had
          been riven in two, and it had snapped precisely in the place where he
          had broken it when it was but a sapling. So there may come a crash to
          your character precisely in that place where you sinned when yet a
          lad. Ah! how often the transgressions of our youth remain within our
          bosoms! There lie the eggs of our young sin, and they hatch when men
          come into riper years. Don't be so sure that the lapse of time will
          consign your faults and follies to oblivion. You sowed your wild oats,
          sir; you have got to reap them. The time that has intervened has only
          operated to make that evil seed spring up, and you are so much the
          nearer to the harvest. Time does not change the hue of sin in the
          sight of God. If a man could live a thousand years, the sins of his
          first year would be as fresh in the memory of the Almighty as those of
          the last. Eternity itself will never wash out a sin. Flow on, ye ages;
          but the scarlet spots on the sand. Flow on still in mighty streams,
          but the damning spot is there still. Neither time nor eternity can
          cleanse it. Only one thing can remove sin. The lapse of time cannot.
          Let not any of you be so foolish as to hope it will.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the trumpet of the resurrection sounds, there will be a
          resurrection of characters, as well as of men. The man who has been
          foully slandered will rejoice in the light that reflects his purity.
          But the man whose latent vices have been skilfully veneered will be
          brought to the light too. His acts and motives will be alike exposed.
          As he himself looks and sees the resurrection of his crimes, with what
          horror will he face that day of judgment! "Ah! ah!" says he, "Where am
          I? I had forgotten these. These are the sins of my childhood, the sins
          of my youth, the sins of my manhood, and the sins of my old age. I
          thought they were dead and buried, but they start from their tombs. My
          memory has been quickened. How my brain reels as I think of them all!
          But there they are, and, like so many wolves around me, they seem all
          thirsting for my destruction." Beware, oh! men. Ye have buried your
          sins, but they will rise up from their graves and accuse you before
          God. Time cannot cover them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or do any of you imagine that your tears can blot out transgressions?
          That is a gross mistake. Could your tears for ever flow; could you be
          transformed into a Niobe, and do nothing else but weep for aye, the
          whole flood could not wash out a single sin. Some have supposed that
          there may be efficacy in baptismal water, or in sacramental emblems,
          or in priestly incantations, or in confession to a priest -- one who
          asks them to disclose their secret wickedness to him, and betrays a
          morbid avidity to make his breast the sewer into which all kinds of
          uncleanness should be emptied. Be not deceived. There is nothing in
          these ordinances of man, or these tricks of Romish priestcraft (I had
          almost said of witchcraft, the two are so much alike) to excuse the
          folly of those who are beguiled by them. You need not catch at straws
          when the rope is thrown out to you. There is pardon to be had;
          remission is to be found; forgivenness can be procured. Turn your back
          on yonder shavelings; lend not your ear to them, neither be ye the
          victims of their snares. In the street each day it makes one's soul
          sad to see them. Like the Pharisees of old, they wear their long
          garments to deceive. You cannot mistake them. Their silly conceit
          publishes their naked shame. Confide not in them for a moment. Christ
          can forgive you. God can blot out your sin. But they cannot ease your
          conscience by their penances, or remove your transgressions by their
          celebrations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have gone through a rough, not very accurate, list of the ways
          by which men hope to cover their sin, but they "shall not prosper."
          None of these shall succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          A more joyous task devolves on me now, while I draw your attention to
          my second text, "Thou hast covered all their sin."
        </p>
        <p>II. GOD'S COVERING.</p>
        <p>
          This fact is affirmed concerning the people of God. All who have
          trusted in the atoning sacrifice which was presented by the Lord Jesus
          Christ upon Calvary may accept this welcome assurance, "God. has
          covered all their sin." How this hath come to pass I will tell you.
          Before ever God covers a man's sins he unveils them. Did you ever see
          your sins unveiled? Did it ever seem as if the Lord put his hand upon
          you, and said, "Look, look at them"? Have you been led to see your
          sins as you never saw them before? Have you felt their aggravations
          fit to drive you to despair? As you have looked at them, has the
          finger of detection seemed to point out your blackness? Have you
          discovered in them a depth of guilt, and iniquity, and hell -- desert
          which never struck your mind before? I recollect a time when that was
          a spectacle always before the eyes of my conscience. My sin was ever
          before me. If God thus makes you see your sin in the light of his
          countenance, depend upon it he has his purposes of mercy toward you.
          When you see and confess it, he will blot it out. So soon as God, in
          infinite loving-kindness, makes the sinner know in truth that he is a
          sinner, and strips him of the rags of his self-righteousness, he
          grants him pardon and clothes his nakedness. While he stands shivering
          before the gaze of the Almighty, condemned, the guilt is purged from
          his conscience. I do not know of a more terrible position in one's
          experience than to stand with an angry God gazing upon you, and to
          know that wherever God's eye falls upon you it sees nothing but sin;
          sees nothing in you but what he must hate and must abhor. Yet this is
          the experience through which God puts those to whom he grants
          forgiveness. He makes them know that he sees how sinful they are, and
          he makes them feel how vile and leprous they are. His justice withers
          their pride; his judgment appals their heart. They are humbled in the
          very dust, and made to cry out -- each man trembling for his own soul
          -- "God be merciful to me, a sinner!"

          Not till this gracious work of conviction is fully wrought does the
          Lord appear with the glorious proclamation that whosoever believeth in
          the Lord Jesus shall have his sins covered. That proclamation. I have
          now openly to publish and personally to deliver to you. With your
          outward ears you may have heard it hundreds of times. It is old, yet
          ever new. Whosoever among you, knowing himself to be guilty, will come
          and put his trust in Jesus Christ, shall have his sins covered. "Can
          God do that?" Yes, he can. He alone can cover sin: Against him the sin
          was committed. It is the offended person who must pardon the offender.
          No one else can. He is the King. He has the right to pardon. He is the
          Sovereign Lord, and he can blot out sin. Beside that, he can cover it
          lawfully, for the Lord Jesus Christ (though ye know the story, let me
          tell it again -- the song of redemption always rings out a charming
          melody), Jesus Christ, the Father's dear Son, in order that the
          justice of God might be vindicated, bare his breast to its dreadful
          hurt, and suffered in our room, and place, and stead, what we ought to
          have suffered as the penalty of our sin. Now the sacrifice of God
          covers sin -- covers it right over; and he more than covers it, he
          makes it cease to be. Moreover, the Lord Jesus kept the law of God,
          and his obedience stands, instead of our obedience; and God accepts
          him and his righteousness on our behalf, imputing his merits to our
          souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! the virtue of that atoning blood! Oh! the blessedness of that
          perfect righteousness of the Son of God, by which he covers our sins!
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two features of covering I should like to recall to your
          recollection. The one was the mercy-seat or propitiatory, over the
          golden ark, wherein were the tables of stone. Those tables of stone
          seemed, as it were, to reflect the sins of Israel. As in a mirror they
          reflected the transgression of God's people. God was above, as it
          were, looking down between the cherubic wings. Was he to look down
          upon the law defied and defiled by Israel? Ah! no; there was put over
          the top of the ark, as a lid which covered it all, a golden lid called
          the mercy-seat, and when the Lord looked down he looked upon that lid
          which covered sin. Beloved, such is Jesus Christ, the covering for all
          our sins. God sees no sin in those who are hidden beneath Jesus
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was another covering at the Red Sea. On that joyous day when the
          Egyptians went down into the midst of the sea pursuing the Israelites,
          at the motion of Moses' rod the waters that stood upright like a wall
          leapt back into their natural bed and swallowed up the Egyptians.
          Great was the victory when Miriam sang, "The depths have covered them.
          There is not one of them left." It is even so that Jesus Christ's
          atonement has covered up our sins. They are sunk in his sepulchre;
          they are buried in his tomb. His blood, like the Red Sea, has drowned
          them. "The depths have covered them. There is not one of them left."
          Against the believer there is not a sin in God's Book recorded. He
          that believeth in him is perfectly absolved. "Thou hast covered all
          their sin." I shall not have time to dwell upon the sweetness of this
          fact, but I invite you that believe to consider its preciousness; and
          I hope you who have not believed will feel your mouth watering after
          it; to know that every sin one has ever committed, known and unknown,
          is gone -- covered by Christ. To be assured that when Jesus died he
          did not die for some of our sins, but for all the sins of his people;
          not for their sins up till now, but for all the sins they ever will
          commit! Well does Kent put it: --
        </p>
        <p>"Here's pardon for transgressions past,</p>
        <p>It matters not how black they're cast</p>
        <p>And O, my soul, with wonder view</p>
        <p>For sins to come here's pardon too."</p>
        <p>
          The atonement was made before the sin was committed. The righteousness
          was presented even before we had lived. "Thou hast covered all their
          sin. It seems to me as if the Lamb of God, slain from before the
          foundation of the world, had in the purpose of God, from the
          foundation of the world, covered all his people's sins. Therefore, we
          are accepted the Beloved, and dear to the Father's heart. Oh! what a
          joy it is to get a hold of something like this truth, especially when
          the truth gets a hold of you -- when you can feel by the inwrought
          power and witness of the Holy Ghost that your sins are covered -- that
          you dare stand up before a rein-trying, heart-searching God, and give
          thanks that every transgression you ever committed is hid from the
          view of those piercing eyes through Jesus Christ your Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people think we ought not to talk thus, that it is presumptuous.
          But really there is more presumption in doubting than there is in
          believing. For a child to believe his father's word is never
          presumption. I like to credit my Father's word. "He that believeth in
          him is not condemned." Condemned I am not, for I know I do believe in
          him. "Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea, rather,
          that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also
          maketh intercession for us."
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, the covering is as broad as the sin. The covering completely
          covers, and for ever covers; for as God sees to-day no sin in those
          who are washed in Jesus' blood, so will he never see any. You are
          accepted with an acceptance that nothing can change. Whom once he
          loves he never leaves, but loves them to the end. The reason of his
          love to them does not lie in their merits nor their charms; the cause
          of love is in himself. The ground of his acceptance of them is in the
          person and work of Christ. Whatever they may be, whatever their
          condition of heart may be, they are accepted, because Christ lived and
          died. It is not a precarious or a conditional, but an eternal
          acceptance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Would you enjoy the blessedness of this complete covering? Cowering
          down beneath the tempest of Jehovah's wrath, which you feel in your
          conscience, would you obtain this full remission? Behold the gates of
          the City of Refuge which stand wide open. The grace of our Lord Jesus
          Christ is proclaimed! to the thirsty, needy, labouring, weary soul.
          Not merely open are the gates, but the invitation to enter is given.
          "Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give
          you rest." You are bidden to lay hold upon eternal life. The way of
          doing so is simple. No works of yours, no merits, no tears, no
          preparations are required, but trust -- trust -- that is all. Believe
          in Jesus. Rely upon him; depend upon him; depend upon him. I have
          heard of Homer's Iliad being enclosed in a nutshell, so small was it
          written; but here is the Plain Man's Guide to Heaven in a nutshell.
          Here is the essence of the whole gospel in one short sentence.
          "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." Trust
          him; trust him. That is the meaning of that word believe. Depend upon
          him, and as surely as thou doest it, nor death, nor hell, nor sin
          shall ever separate thee from the love of him whom thou hast embraced,
          from the protection of him in whose power thou hast taken shelter. The
          Lord lead you to cower beneath his covering wings, and grant you to be
          found in Christ, accepted in the Beloved. So shall your present peace
          be the foretaste of your eternal felicity. Amen.<br />
