        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.2107)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, September 29th, 1889, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he
          lodged there. Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he
          hungered. And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and
          found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit
          grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree
          withered away. And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying,
          How soon is the fig tree withered away!" -- Matthew 21:17-20.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS is a miracle and a parable. We have books upon the miracles, we
          have an equal number of volumes upon the parables: into which of these
          volumes shall we place this story? I would answer, put it in both. It
          is a singular miracle, and it is a striking parable. It is an acted
          parable, in which our Lord gives us an object-lesson. He gets truth
          before men's eyes, in this instance, that the lesson may make a deeper
          impression upon the mind and heart. I would lay great stress upon the
          remark that this is a parable; for, if you do not look upon it in that
          light, you may misunderstand it. We are not of those who come to the
          Word of God with the cool impertinence of the critic, thinking
          ourselves wiser than the Book, and therefore able to judge it. We
          believe that the Holy Spirit is greater than man's spirit, and that
          our Lord and Master was a better judge of what is right and good than
          any of us can be. Our place is at his feet: we are not cavillers, but
          followers. Whatever Jesus does and says, we regard with deepest
          reverence; our chief desire is to learn as much as we can from it. We
          see great mysteries in his simplest actions, and profound teaching
          about his plainest words. When he speaks or acts, we are like Moses at
          the bush, and feel that we stand on holy ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flippant persons have spoken of the story before us in a very foolish
          manner. They have represented it as though our Lord, being hungered,
          thought only of his necessity, and, expecting to be refreshed by a few
          green figs went up to the tree in error. Finding no fruit upon the
          tree, it being a season when he had no right to expect that there
          would be any, he was vexed, and uttered a malediction against a tree,
          as though it had been a responsible agent. This view of the case
          results from the folly of the observer: it is not the truth. Our Lord
          desired to teach his disciples concerning the doom of Jerusalem. The
          reception given him in Jerusalem was full of promise, but it would
          come to nothing. Their loud hosannas would change to, "Crucify Him!"
        </p>
        <p>
          When Jerusalem was to be destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar a former time,
          the prophets had not only spoken, but they had used instructive signs.
          If you turn to the Book of Ezekiel, you will there see the record of
          many signs and symbols which set forth the coming woe. These tokens
          excited curiosity, secured consideration, and brought home the
          prophetic warnings to the homes and hearts of the common people.
          Again, the judgments of God were at the gates of the guilty city.
          Words -- the words of Jesus -- had been wasted; and even tears --
          tears of the Saviour -- had been spilt in vain; it was time that the
          sign should be given -- the sign of condemnation. Ezekiel had said,
          "All the trees of the field shall know that I the Lord have brought
          down the high tree, and have dried up the green tree"; and herein was
          suggested the very image which was employed by our Lord. He saw a fig
          tree, by a freak of nature, covered with leaves at a time when, in the
          ordinary course of things, it should not have been so. Our Lord saw
          that this was a fine object lesson for him, and therefore he took his
          disciples to see if there were figs as well as leaves. When he found
          none, he bade the fig tree remain for ever fruitless, and immediately
          it began to wither. Our Lord would have used the fig tree to excellent
          purpose had he ordered it to be used a fuel to warm cold hands, but he
          did better when he used it to warm cold hearts. No wrong was done to
          any man; it was a tree on the waste, and utterly worthless. No pain
          was inflicted; no anger was felt. In the object-lesson, the Lord
          simply said to the fig tree, "Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward
          for ever"; and it withered away. In this our Lord taught a great
          lesson to all ages at a small expense. The withering of a tree has
          been the quickening of many a soul; and if it had not been so, it was
          no loss to any that a tree should wither when it had proved itself
          barren. A great teacher may do far more than destroy a tree, if he can
          thereby give demonstrations of truth, and scatter seeds of virtue. It
          is the veriest idleness of criticism to find fault with our Lord Jesus
          for a piece of fine poetic instruction, for which, had it been spoken
          by any other teacher, the most lavish praise would have been awarded
          by these very critics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The blighted fig tree was a singularly apt simile of the Jewish state.
          The nation had promised great things to God. When all the other
          nations were like trees without leaves, making no profession of
          allegiance to the true God, the Jewish nation was covered with the
          leafage of abundant religious profession. Scribes, pharisees, priests
          and elders of the people were all sticklers for the letter of the law,
          and boaster of being worshippers of the one God, and strict observers
          of all his laws. Their constant cry was, "The temple of the Lord, The
          temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, are these." "We have
          Abraham to our Father" was frequently on their lips. They were a fig
          tree in full leaf. But there was no fruit upon them; for the people
          were neither holy, nor just, nor true, nor faithful towards God, nor
          loving to their neighbor. The Jewish church was a mass of glittering
          profession, unsupported by spiritual life. Our Lord had looked into
          the temple, and had found the house of prayer to be a den of thieves.
          He condemned the Jewish church to remain a lifeless, fruitless thing;
          and it was so. The synagogue remained open; but its teaching became a
          dead form. Israel had no influence upon the age. The Jewish race
          became, for centuries, a withered tree: it had nothing but profession
          when Christ came, and that profession proved powerless to save even
          the holy city. Christ did not destroy the religious organization of
          the Jews: he left them as they were; but they withered away from the
          root, till the Roman came, and with the axes of his legions cleared
          away the fruitless trunk.
        </p>
        <p>
          What a lesson is this to nations! Nations may make a profession, a
          loud profession, of religion, and yet may fail to exhibit that
          righteousness which exalteth a nation. Nations may be adorned with all
          the leafage of civilization, and art, and progress, and religion; but
          if there be no inner life of godliness, and no fruit unto
          righteousness, they will stand for a while, and then wither away.
        </p>
        <p>
          What a lesson this is to churches! There have been churches which have
          stood prominent in numbers and in influence; but faith, and love, and
          holiness have not been maintained, and the Holy Ghost has left them to
          the vain show of a fruitless profession; and there stand those
          churches, with the trunk of organization, and widely-extended
          branches, but they are dead, and every year they become more and more
          decayed. Brethren, such churches we have even among Nonconformists at
          this hour. May it never be so with this church! We may have numbers of
          people coming to hear the Word, and a considerable body of men and
          women professing to be converted; but unless vital godliness is in
          their midst, what are congregations and churches? We might have a
          valued ministry, but what would this be without the Spirit of God? We
          might have large subscriptions, and many outward efforts; but what of
          these without the spirit of prayer, the spirit of faith, the spirit of
          grace and consecration? I dread lest we should ever come to be like a
          tree, precocious with a superlative profession, but yet worthless in
          the sight of the Lord, because the secret life of piety, and vital
          union to Christ, are gone. Better that the axe clear away every
          vestige of the tree than that it stand out against the sky an open
          lie, a mockery, a delusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the lesson of the text; but I do not want you to consider it
          only in the gross, in its relation to nations and churches; but my
          heart's desire is that we may learn the lesson in detail, and take it
          home each one to his own heart. May the Lord himself speak to each one
          of us this morning personally! In preparing the sermon, I have had
          great searchings of heart, and I pray that the hearing of it may
          produce the same results. May we tremble, lest, having a profession of
          godliness, we should wear it conspicuously, and yet should lack the
          fruitbearing which alone can warrant such a profession. The name of
          saintship, if it be not justified by sanctity, is an offence to honest
          men, and much more to a holy God. A pronounced and forward avowal of
          Christianity without a Christian life at the back of it is a lie,
          abhorrent to God and man, an offence against truth, a dishonour to
          religion, and the forerunner of a withering curse.
        </p>
        <p>
          May the Holy Spirit help me to preach very solemnly and powerfully at
          this time!
        </p>
        <p>
          Our first observation is this -- There are in the world cases of
          forward, but fruitless, profession; our second observation will be
          this -- These will be inspected by King Jesus; and our third remark
          will be -- The result of that inspection will be very terrible. Help
          us, O Holy Spirit!
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, THERE ARE IN THE WORLD CASES OF FORWARD, BUT
          FRUITLESS, PROFESSION.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cases to which we refer are not so very rare. They far excel their
          fellow-men. Their promise is very loud, and their exterior very
          impressive. They look like fruitful trees; you expect many baskets of
          the best figs from them. They impress us by their talk, they overpower
          us by their manners. We envy them, and lash ourselves. This last might
          not harm us; but to envy hypocrites can never be otherwise than
          injurious in the long run; for, when their hypocrisy is discovered, we
          are apt to despise religion as well as the pretenders to it. Do you
          not know persons who are in appearance everything and in reality
          nothing? O dark thought! may we not ourselves be such persons? See the
          man, he is strong in faith, even to presumption; he is joyous in hope,
          even to levity; he is loving in spirit, even to utter indifference
          about truth! How very glib he is in talk! How deep he is in
          theological speculation! Yet he has never entered the kingdom by the
          new birth. He has never been taught of God. The gospel has come to him
          in word only. He is a stranger to the work of the Holy Ghost. Are
          there not such persons? Are there not persons who are defenders of
          orthodoxy and yet are heterodox in their own conduct? Do we not know
          men and women whose lives deny what their lips profess? We are sure it
          is so. All vineyards have had in them fig trees covered with leaves,
          which have been conspicuous from the foliage of their profession, and
          yet have brought forth no fruit unto the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such persons seem to defy the seasons. It was not the time of figs,
          yet was this fig tree covered with those leaves which usually
          betokened ripe figs. I suppose you all know what I have often seen for
          myself -- the fig tree puts forth its fruit before its leaves. Early
          in the year you see green knobs put forth at the end and points of the
          branches, and these, as they swell, turn out to be green figs. The
          leaves come forward afterwards, and by the time the tree is fully
          covered with leaves, the figs are ready for eating. When a fig tree is
          in full leaf, you expect to find figs upon it; and if you do not, it
          will bear no figs for that season. This tree put forth leaves
          abundantly before its season, and therein excelled all other fig
          trees. Yes, but it was a freak of nature, and not a healthy result of
          true growth. Such freaks of nature occur in forests and in vineyards;
          and their like may be met with in the moral and spiritual world.
          Certain men and women seem far in advance of those round about them,
          and astonish us by their special virtues. They are better than the
          best; more excellent than the most excellent -- at least in
          appearance. They are so zealous that they are not chilled by the
          surrounding world: their great souls create a summer for themselves.
          The backwardness of saints, and the wickedness of sinners, do not
          hinder them; they are too vigorous to be affected by their
          surroundings. They are very superior persons, covered with virtues, as
          this fig tree with leaves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, that they overleap the ordinary rule of growth. As I have
          told you, the rule is, first the fig, and afterwards the fig leaves;
          but we have seen persons who make a profession before they have
          produced the slightest fruit to justify it. I like to see our young
          friends, when they believe in Christ, proving their faith by holiness
          at home, by godliness abroad, and then coming forward and confessing
          their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. That looks to be the sober and
          normal way of proceeding, for a man first to be, and then to profess
          to be; first to be lighted, and then to shine; first to repent and
          believe, and then to confess his repentance and his faith in the
          Scriptural way, by baptism into Christ. But these people think it
          unnecessary to attend to the trifle of heart-work -- they dare to omit
          the most vital part of the matter. They attend a revival meeting, and
          they declare themselves saved, though they have not been renewed in
          heart, and possess neither repentance nor faith. They come forward to
          avow a mere emotion. They have nothing better than a resolve; but they
          flourish it as if it were the deed itself. Quick as thought, the
          convert sets up to be a teacher. Without test or trial of his
          brand-new virtues, he holds himself forth as an example to others.
          Now, I do not object to the rapidity of the conversion; on the
          contrary, I admire it, if it be true; but I cannot judge till I see
          the fruit and evidence in the life. If the change of conduct is
          distinct and true, I care not how quickly the work is done; but we
          must see the change. There is a heat which leads to fermentation, and
          a fermentation which breeds sourness and corruption. O dear friends,
          never think you may skip the fruit and come at once to the leaf. Be
          not like a builder who should say, "It is all nonsense to spend labor
          and material on works underground. Foundations are never seen; I can
          run up a house in no time; four walls and a roof will not take long."
          Yes; but how long will such a house last? Is it worthwhile building a
          house without foundations? If you omit the foundation, why not omit
          the house altogether? Is there not a tendency, especially in these
          days, when men are either skeptical or fanatical, to cultivate a
          mushroom godliness, which comes up in a night and perishes in a night?
          Will it not be ruinous if conviction of sin is slighted, repentance
          slurred, faith imitated, the new birth counterfeited, and godliness
          feigned? Beloved, this will never do. We must have figs before leaves,
          acts before declarations, faith before baptism, union to Christ before
          union with the church. You cannot leap over the processes of nature,
          neither may you omit the processes of grace, lest haply your foliage
          without fruit become a curse without cure.
        </p>
        <p>
          These people usually catch the eye of others. According to Mark, our
          Lord saw this tree "afar off." The other trees were not in leaf, and
          consequently, when he began to go up the hill toward Jerusalem, he saw
          this one tree quite a long way before he reached it. A fig tree
          dressed in its vesture of lovely green would be a striking object, and
          would be observable at a distance. It stood, also, near the track from
          Bethany to the city gate. It stood where every wayfarer would observe
          it, and probably speak with wonder of its singular leafage for the
          season. Persons whose religion is false are frequently prominent,
          because they have not grace enough to be modest and retiring. They
          seek the highest room, aspire to office, and push themselves into
          leadership. They do not walk in secret with God, they have little
          concern about private godliness, and so they are all the more eager to
          be seen of men. this is both their weakness and their peril. Though
          least of all able to bear the wear and tear of publicity, they are
          covetous for it, and are, therefore, all the more watched. This is the
          evil of the whole matter; for it makes their spiritual failure to be
          known by so many, and their sin brings all the greater dishonor upon
          the name of the Lord, whom they profess to serve. Better far to be
          fruitless in a corner of a wood than on the public way which leads to
          the temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such people not only catch the eye, but they often attract the company
          of good men. Who blames us for drawing near to a tree which is in leaf
          long before its fellows? Is it not right to cultivate the acquaintance
          of the eminently good? Our Saviour and his disciples went up to the
          leafy fig tree: not merely did it win their eye, but it drew them to
          itself. Have we not been fascinated by the charming conduct of one who
          seemed to be a brother in the Lord, more devout than usual, fearing
          God above many? Like Jehu, he has said, "Come, see my zeal for the
          Lord;" and we have been glad enough to ride in the chariot with him:
          he seemed so godly, so generous, so humble, so useful, that we looked
          up to him, and wished that we were more worthy to be associated with
          him. Young converts and seekers are naturally apt to do this; and
          hence it is a sad calamity when their confidence turns out to have
          been misplaced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever we see any standing out prominently, and making a bold
          profession, what should be our thoughts about them? I answer, do not
          judge them; do not fall into habitual mistrust. Your Lord did not
          stand at a distance and say, "That tree is worthless." No, he went up
          to it, with his disciples, and carefully inspected it. These prominent
          persons may be wonders of divine grace: let us hope and pray that they
          may be. Let the Lord and his love be magnified in them! God has his
          fig trees that bear figs in winter; God has his saints who are filled
          with good works when the love of others has waxed cold. The Lord
          raises some up to be as standards for the truth, rallying points in
          the battle. The Lord can make young men mature, and new converts
          useful. It has been said, by way of proverbial expression, that "some
          men are born with beards." The Lord can give great grace, so as to
          make spiritual growth rapid and yet solid. He does this so often that
          we have no right to doubt but what the prominent brother before us is
          one of these growths of grace. Unless we are forced to see with bitter
          regret that there are no marks of grace, no evidences of faith, let us
          hope for the best, and be glad at the sight of God's grace. If we are
          inclined to be suspicious, let us turn the point of that sword towards
          our own bosoms. Self-suspicion will be healthy; suspicion of others
          may be cruel. We are not judges; and even if we are, we had better
          keep to our own court, and sit on our own judgment-seat, dispensing
          the law within the little kingdom of our own selves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where those who are prominent turn out to be all they profess to be,
          they are a great blessing. It would have been well if that morning
          there had been figs upon that fig tree. It would have been a great
          refreshment to the Saviour if he had been fed by the green fruit. When
          the Lord makes the first in position to be first in holiness, it is a
          blessing to the church, to the family, and to the neighborhood;
          indeed, it may prove to ba a blessing to the whole world. We ought,
          therefore, to pray the Lord to water with his own hand those trees
          which he has planted; or, in other words, to uphold by his grace those
          men of his right hand whom he has made strong for himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when we take the text and lay it home to our own hearts, we need
          not be so gentle with it as in the cases of others. We have, many of
          us, for long years been like this fig-tree, as to prominence and
          profession. And in this matter, so far, there is nothing of which to
          be ashamed. Yet it is evidently to ourselves that the parable speaks;
          for we have stood in open avowal and distinct service by the wayside,
          and we have been seen "afar off." Certain of us have made a very bold
          profession, and we are not ashamed to repeat that profession before
          men and angels. Hence the enquiry: Are we truthful in it? What if we
          should turn out to be contending for a faith in which we have no
          share? What if in us there should be none of the life of love, and
          consequently our profession should be "as sounding brass, or a
          tinkling cymbal"? What if there should be talk, and no work; doctrine,
          and no practice? What if we are without holiness? Then we shall never
          see the Lord. Whatever terrible aspect this parable-miracle may have,
          it bears upon many of us. I, the preacher, feel how much it bears upon
          me. In that spirit have I thought it over, anxiously trusting that
          every deacon and every elder of this church, and every member and
          every worker among you, may have great searchings of heart. May every
          minister of Christ who may have dropped in here this morning, say to
          himself, "Yes, I have been like that fig tree in prominence and in
          profession; God grant that I be not like it in being devoid of fruit!"
        </p>
        <p>
          II. It is time that we remembered the solemn truth of our second head:
          THESE WILL BE INSPECTED BY KING JESUS.
        </p>
        <p>
          He will draw nigh to them, and when he comes up to them he will look
          for fruit. The first Adam came to the fig tree for leaves, but the
          Second Adam looks for figs. He searches our character through and
          through, to see whether there is any real faith, any true love, any
          living hope, any joy which is the fruit of the Spirit, any patience,
          any self-denial, any fervour in prayer, any walking with God, any
          indwelling of the Holy Spirit; and if he does not see these things, he
          is not satisfied with chapel-going, church-going, prayer meetings,
          communions, sermons, Bible readings; for all these may be no more than
          leafage. If our Lord does not see the fruit of the Spirit upon us, he
          is not satisfied with us, and his inspection will lead to severe
          measures. Notice that what Jesus looks for is not your words, not your
          resolves, not your avowals, but your sincerity, your inward faith,
          your being indeed wrought upon by the Spirit of God to bring forth
          fruits meet for his kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord has a right to expect fruit when he looks for it. When he
          went up to that fig tree he had a right to expect fruit; because the
          fruit, according to nature, comes before the leaf. If, then, the leaf
          has come, there should be fruit. True, it was not the time of figs;
          but then, if it was not the time of figs, it certainly was not the
          season for leaves, for the figs are first. This tree, by putting forth
          leaves, which are the signs and tokens of ripe figs, virtually
          advertised itself as bearing fruit. So, however bad the times may be,
          some of us profess that we will not follow the times, but will follow
          the one immutable truth. As Christians, we confess that we are
          redeemed from among men, and have been delivered from this perverse
          generation. Christ may not expect fruit of men who acknowledge the
          world and its changing ages as their supreme guide; but he may well
          look for it from the believer in his own Word. He looks for fruit from
          the preacher, from the Sunday-school teacher, from the church-
          officer, from the sister who conducts a Bible class, from that brother
          who has a band of young men around him, to whom he is a guide in the
          gospel. He does expect it of all who submit to his gospel rule. As
          Christ had a right to expect fruit of a leaf- bearing fig tree, so he
          has a right to expect great things from those who avow themselves his
          trustful followers. Ah me! how this fact should move the preacher with
          trembling! Should it not affect full many of you in the same manner?
        </p>
        <p>
          Fruit is what the Lord earnestly desires. The Saviour, when he came
          under the fig tree, did not desire leaves; for we read that he
          hungered, and human hunger cannot be removed by leaves of a fig tree.
          He desired to eat a fig or two; and he longs to have fruit from us
          also. He hungers for our holiness: he longs that his joy may be in us,
          that our joy may be full. He comes up to each of you who are members
          of his church, and especially to each of you who are leaders of his
          people, and he looks to see in you the things in which his soul is
          well pleased. He would see in us love to himself, love to our
          fellow-men, strong faith in revelation, earnest contention for the
          once delivered faith, importunate pleading in prayer, and careful
          living in every part of our course. He expects from us actions such as
          are according to the law of God and the mind of the Spirit of God; and
          if he does not see these, he does not receive his due. What did he die
          for but to make his people holy? What did he give himself for but that
          he might sanctify unto himself a people zealous of good works? What is
          the reward of the bloody sweat and the five wounds and the death
          agony, but that by all these we should be bought with a price? We rob
          him of his reward if we do not glorify him, and therefore the Spirit
          of God is grieved at our conduct if we do not show forth his praises
          by our godly and zealous lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          And mark here, that when Christ comes to a soul he surveys it with
          keen discernment. He is not mocked. It is not possible to deceive him.
          I have thought that to be a fig which turned out to be only a leaf was
          a mistake; but our Lord makes no such mistake. Neither will he
          overlook the little figs, just breaking forth. He knows the fruit of
          the Spirit in whatever stage it may be. He never mistakes fluent
          expression for hearty possession, nor real grace for mere emotion.
          Beloved, you are in good hands as to the trial of your condition when
          the Lord Jesus comes to deal with you. Your fellow-men are quick in
          their judgments, and they may be either censorious, or partial; but
          the King gives forth a righteous sentence. He knows just where we are,
          and what we are; and he judges not after the appearance, but according
          to truth. Oh, that our prayer might this morning rise to heaven:
          "Jesus, Master, come and cast thy searching eyes upon me, and judge
          whether I am living unto thee or not! Give me to see myself as thou
          seest me, that I may have my errors corrected, and my graces
          nourished. Lord, make me to be indeed what I profess to be; and if I
          am not so already, convince me of my false state, and begin a true
          work in my soul. If I am thine, and am right in thy sight, grant ma a
          kind, assuring word to sink my fears again, and I will gladly rejoice
          in thee as the God of my salvation."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I come, thirdly, by the help of the Spirit of God, to consider
          the truth, that THE RESULT OF THE COMING OF CHRIST TO THE FORWARD, BUT
          FRUITLESS, PROFESSOR WILL BE VERY TERRIBLE.
        </p>
        <p>
          The searcher finds nothing but leaves where fruit might have been
          expected. Nothing but leaves means nothing but lies. Is that a harsh
          expression? If I profess faith, and have no faith, is not that a lie?
          If I profess repentance, and have not repented, is not that a lie? If
          I unite with the people of the living God, and yet have no fear of God
          in my heart, is not that a lie? If I come to the communion-table, and
          partake of the bread and wine, and yet never discern the Lord's body,
          is not that a lie? If I profess to defend the doctrines of grace, and
          yet am not assured of the truth of them, is not that a lie? If I have
          never felt my depravity; if I have never been effectually called,
          never known my election of God, never rested in the redeeming blood,
          and have never been renewed by the Spirit, is not my defense of the
          doctrines of grace a lie? If there is nothing but leaves, there is
          nothing but lies, and the Saviour sees that it is so. All the verdure
          of green leaf to him without fruit is but so much deceit. Profession
          without grace is the funeral pageantry of a dead soul. Religion
          without holiness is the light which comes from rotten wood -- the
          phosphorescence of decay: I speak dread words, but how can I speak
          less dreadfully than I do? If you and I have but a name to live, and
          are dead, what a state we are in! Ours is something worse than
          corruption: it is the corruption of corruption. To profess religion
          and live in sin, is to sprinkle rose-water upon a dunghill, and leave
          it a dunghill still. To give a spirit an angel's name when it bears
          the devil's character, is almost to sin against the Holy Ghost. If we
          remain unconverted, of what use can it be to have our name written
          among the godly?
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord discovered that there was no fruit, and that was a dreadful
          thing; but, next, he condemned the tree. Was it not right that he
          should condemn it? Did he curse it? It was already a curse. It was
          calculated to tantalize the hungry, and take them out of their way to
          deceive them. God will not have the poor and needy made a jest of. An
          empty profession is a practical curse; and should it not receive the
          censure of the Lord of truth? The tree was of no use where it was: it
          ministered to no man's refreshment. So, the barren professor occupies
          a position in which he ought to be a blessing, but, in truth, an evil
          influence streams forth from him. If he has not the grace of God in
          him, he is utterly useless, and in all probability he is a curse: he
          is an Achan in the camp, grieving the Lord, and causing him to refuse
          success to his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord did, however, use the fig tree for a good purpose when he
          caused it to wither away; for it became, henceforth, a beacon and a
          warning to all others who put forth vain pretenses. So, when the
          ungodly man, who has exhibited a flourishing profession, is allowed to
          fade away in his ways, some moral effect is produced upon others: they
          are compelled to see the peril of an unsound profession; and if they
          are wise, they will no longer be guilty of it. Would God it might be
          so in every case whenever a notable religionist withers away!
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, when the Saviour had condemned it, he pronounced sentence
          upon it; and what was the sentence? It was simply, "As you were." It
          was nothing more than a confirmation of its state. This tree has borne
          no fruit, it shall never bear fruit. If a man chooses to be without
          the grace of God, and yet to make a profession of having it, it is
          only just that the great Judge should say, "Continue without grace."
          When the great Judge at last shall speak to those who depart from God,
          he will simply say to them, "Depart!" Throughout life they always were
          departing, and after death their character is stamped with perpetuity.
          If you choose to be graceless, to be graceless shall be your doom. "He
          that is filthy, let him be filthy still." May the Lord Jesus never
          have to sentence any of you in this way; but may he turn us, that we
          may be turned, and work in us eternal life to his praise and glory!
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there came a change over the tree. It began at once to wither. I
          do not know whether the disciples saw a quiver run through it at once;
          but on the next morning when they passed that way, according to Mark,
          it had dried up from the roots. Not only did the leaves hang down,
          like streamers when there is no wind; not only did the bark seem to
          have lost every token of vitality; but the whole fabric was blighted
          fatally. Have you ever seen a fig tree with its strange, weird
          branches? It is a very extraordinary sight when bare of leaves. In
          this case I see its skeleton arms! It is twice dead, dead from the
          very roots. Thus have I seen the fair professor undergo a blight. He
          has looked like a thing that has felt the breath of a furnace, and has
          had its moisture dried up. The man is no longer himself: his glory and
          his beauty are hopelessly gone. No axe was lifted; no fire was
          kindled; a word did it, and the tree withered from the root. So,
          without thunderbolt or pestilence, the once brave professor is
          stricken as with the judgment of Cain. It is an awful fate. Better far
          to have the vine-dresser come to you with the axe in his hand, and
          strike you with the head of it, and say to you, "Tree, thou must bear
          fruit, or be hewn down." Such a warning would be terrible, but it
          would be infinitely better than to be left in one's place untouched,
          quietly to wither to destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I have delivered my heavy burden, laying it far more upon myself
          than upon any one of you; for I stand more prominent than you; I have
          made a louder profession than most of you; and if I have not his grace
          in me, then I shall stand before the multitude that have seen me in my
          greenness, and shall wither away to the very roots, a terrible example
          of what God doth with those who bear no fruit to his glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now I desire to conclude with tenderer words. Let no man say,
          "This is very hard." Brother, it is not hard, is it, that if we
          profess a thing we should be expected to be true to it? Besides, I
          pray you not to think that anything my Lord can do is hard. He is all
          gentleness and tenderness. The only thing he ever did destroy was this
          fig tree. He destroyed no men, as Elias did when he brought fire from
          heaven upon them; nor as Elisha did when the bears came out of the
          wood. It is only a barren tree that he causes to wither away. He is
          all love and tenderness: he does not want to wither you, nor will he,
          if you be but true. The very least he may expect is that you be true
          to what you profess. Are you rebellious because he asks you not to
          play the hypocrite? If you begin to kick against his admonition, it
          will look as if you were yourself untrue at heart. Instead of that,
          come and bow humbly at his feet, and say, "Lord, if anything in this
          solemn truth bears upon me, I beseech thee so to apply it to my
          conscience that I may feel its power, and flee to thee for salvation."
          Many men are converted in this way -- these hard but honest things
          drive them from false refuges, and bring them to be true to Christ and
          to their own souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But," saith one, "I know what I will do; I will never make any
          profession; I will bear no leaves." My friend, that also is a sullen,
          rebellious spirit. Instead of talking so, you should say, Lord, I do
          not ask thee to take away my leaves, but let me have fruit. The fruit
          is not likely to ripen well without leaves; leaves are essential to
          the health of the tree, and the health of the tree is essential to the
          ripening of the fruit. Open confession of faith is good, and must not
          be refused. Lord, I would not drop a leaf.
        </p>
        <p>"I'm not ashamed to own my Lord,</p>
        <p>Or to defend his cause;</p>
        <p>Maintain the honour of his word,</p>
        <p>The glory of his cross."</p>
        <p>
          Lord, I do not want to be set away in a corner; I am satisfied to
          stand where men may see my good works, and glorify my Father who is in
          heaven. I do not ask to be observed; but I am not ashamed to be
          observed; only, Lord, make me fit for observation. If a commander said
          to a soldier, "Stand firm, but mind you have your cartridges ready, so
          that you may not lift an empty gun;" suppose that soldier answered, "I
          cannot be so particular. I would rather run to the rear." Would that
          be a fit reply? Coward! because your captain warns you that you must
          not be a sham, you would therefore, run off altogether! Surely, you
          are of an evil sort. You are not truly one of the Lord's, if you
          cannot bear his rebuke. Let not these solemn truths drive us away, but
          let them draw us on to say, "Lord, I pray thee, help me to make my
          calling and election sure. I beseech thee, help me to bring forth the
          expected fruit. Thy grace can do it."
        </p>
        <p>
          I would suggest to everyone here to cry to the Lord to make us
          conscious of our natural barrenness. Gracious ones, may the Lord make
          us mourn our comparative barrenness, even if we do bear some fruit. To
          feel quite satisfied with yourself is perilous: to feel that you are
          holy, and indeed that you are perfect, is to be on the brink of the
          pit of pride. If you hold your head so high, I am afraid you will
          strike it against the top of the doorway. If you walk on stilts, I
          fear you will fall. It is a safer thing to feel, "Lord, I do serve
          thee, and I am no deceiver. I do love thee; thou hast wrought the
          works of the Spirit in me. But alas! I am not what I want to be, I am
          not what I ought to be. I aspire to holiness: help me to attain it.
          Lord, I would lie in the very dust before thee to think that after
          being digged about and dunged, as I have been, I should bear such
          little fruit. I feel myself less than nothing. My cry is, 'God be
          merciful to me.' If I had done all, I should still have been an
          unprofitable servant; but having done so little, Lord, where shall I
          hide my guilty head?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, when you have made this confession, and the good Lord has
          heard you, there is one emblem in Scripture I should like you to copy.
          Suppose this morning you feel so dry and dead and barren, that you
          cannot serve God as you would, nor even pray for more grace, as you
          wish to do. Then you are something like these twelve rods. They are
          very dead and dry, for they have been held in the hands of twelve
          chiefs, who have used them as their official staves. These twelve rods
          are to be laid before the Lord. This one is Aaron's rod; but it is
          quite as dead and dry as any of the rest. The whole twelve are laid in
          the place where the Lord dwelleth. We see them next morning. Eleven
          are dry rods still; but see this rod of Aaron! What has happened? It
          was dry as death. See, it has budded! This is wonderful! But look, it
          has blossomed! There are almond flowers upon it. You know they are
          rosy pink and white. This is marvelous! But look again, it has brought
          forth almonds! Here, you have them! See these green fruits, which look
          like peaches. Take off the flesh, and here is an almond whose shell
          you may break and find the kernel. The heavenly power has come upon
          the dry stick, and it has budded and blossomed, and even brought forth
          almonds. Fruit-bearing is the proof of life and favour. Lord, take
          these poor sticks this morning, and make them bud. Lord, here we are,
          in a bundle, perform that ancient miracle in a thousand of us. Make us
          bud and blossom, and bear fruit! Come with divine power, and turn this
          congregation from a fagot into a grove. Oh, that our blessed Lord may
          get a fig from some dry stick this morning! at least, such a fig as
          this, "God be merciful to me a sinner;" there is sweetness in that fig
          as this, "Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief." Here is another,
          "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him" -- that is a whole
          basketful of the first ripe figs, and the Lord rejoices in their
          sweetness. Come Holy Spirit, produce fruit in us this day, through
          faith in Jesus Christ our Lord! Amen, and Amen.
