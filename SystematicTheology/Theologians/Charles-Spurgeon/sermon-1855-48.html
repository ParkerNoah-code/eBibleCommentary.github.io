        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.51)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, November 25, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>"Oh that I were as in months past." -- Job 29:2.</p>
        <p>
          FOR THE MOST part the gracious Shepherd leads his people beside the
          still waters, and makes them to lie down in green pastures; but at
          times they wander through a wilderness, where there is no water, and
          they find no city to dwell in. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainteth
          within them, and they cry unto the Lord in their trouble. Though many
          of his people live in almost constant joy, and find that religion's
          ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace, yet there
          are many who pass through fire and through water: men do ride over
          their heads, -- they endure all manner of trouble and sorrow. The duty
          of the minister is to preach to different characters. Sometimes we
          admonish the confident, lest they should become presumptuous;
          oftentimes we stir up the slumbering, lest they should sleep the sleep
          of death. Frequently we comfort the desponding, and this is our duty
          this morning -- or if not to comfort them, yet to give them some
          exhortation which may by God's help be the means of bringing them out
          of the sad condition into which they have fallen, so that they may not
          be obliged to cry out for ever -- "Oh that I were as in months past!"
        </p>
        <p>
          At once to the subject. A complaint; its cause and cure; and then
          close up with an exhortation to stir up your pure minds, if you are in
          such a position.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, there is a COMPLAINT. How many a Christian looks on the past
          with pleasure, on the future with dread, and on the present with
          sorrow! There are many who look back upon the days that they have
          passed in the fear of the Lord as being the sweetest and the best they
          have ever had, but as to the present, it is clad in a sable garb of
          gloom and dreariness. They could wish for their young days over again,
          that they might live near to Jesus, for now they feel that they have
          wandered from him, or that he has hidden his face from them, and they
          cry out, "Oh that I were as in months past!"
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Let us take distinct cases one by one. The first is the case of a
          man who has lost the brightness of his evidences, and is crying out,
          "Oh that I were as in months past!" Hear his soliloquy: -- "Oh that my
          past days could be recalled! Then I had no doubt of my salvation. If
          any man had asked for the reason of the hope that was in me, I could
          have answered with meekness and with fear. No doubt distressed me, no
          fear harassed me; I could say with Paul, I know whom I have believed,'
          and with Job, I know that my Redeemer liveth;'
        </p>
        <p>'My steady soul did fear no more</p>
        <p>Than solid rocks when billows roar.'</p>
        <p>I felt myself to be standing on the rock Christ Jesus. I said --</p>
        <p>'Let cares like a wild deluge come,</p>
        <p>And storms of sorrow fall;</p>
        <p>Sure I shall safely reach my home,</p>
        <p>My God, my heaven, my all'</p>
        <p>
          But ah! how changed it is now! Where there was no cloud it; all cloud;
          where I could read my my title clear,' I tremble to read my damnation
          quite as clearly. I hoped that I trusted in Christ, but now the dark
          thought rises up, that I was a hypocrite, and had deceived myself and
          others. The most I can attain to, is -- Methinks I will hope in him
          still; and if I may not be refreshed with the light of his
          countenance, still in the shadow of his wings will I trust.' I feel
          that if I depart from him there is no other Saviour; but oh! what
          thick darkness surrounds me! Like Paul of old, there have been days
          and nights wherein neither sun, nor moon nor stars have appeared. I
          have lost my roll in the Arbour of Ease; I cannot now take it out of
          my breast, and read it to console me on my journey; but I fear that
          when I get to the end of the way they will deny me entrance, because I
          came not in by the door to receive his grace and know his love, but
          have been deceived, have taken carnal fancies for the workings of the
          Spirit, and have imputed what was but natural conviction to the work
          of God the Holy Ghost."
        </p>
        <p>
          This is one phase, and a very common one. You will meet many who are
          crying out like that -- "Oh that I were as in months past!"
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Another phase of this great complaint, which it also very
          frequently assumes, is one under which we are lamenting -- not so much
          because our evidences are withered as because we do not enjoy a
          perpetual peace of mind as to other matters. "Oh "says one, "Oh that I
          were as in months past; for then whatever troubles and trials came
          upon me, were less than nothing. I had learned to sing --
        </p>
        <p>'Father, I wait thy daily will;</p>
        <p>Thou shalt divide my portion still;</p>
        <p>Give me on earth what seems thee best,</p>
        <p>Till death and heaven reveal the rest.'</p>
        <p>
          I felt that I could give up everything to him; that if he had taken
          away every mercy I could have said --
        </p>
        <p>'Yea, if thou take them all away,</p>
        <p>Yet will I not repine;</p>
        <p>Before they were possessed by me,</p>
        <p>They were entirely thine.'</p>
        <p>
          I knew no fear for the future. Like a child on its mother's breast I
          slept securely; I said, Jehovah-jireh, my God will provide,' I put my
          business into his hands; I went to my daily labor; like the little
          bird that waketh up in the morning, and knoweth not where its
          breakfast is to come from, but sitteth on the spray, singing --
        </p>
        <p>'Mortal, cease from toil and sorrow</p>
        <p>God provideth for the morrow;'</p>
        <p>
          so was I. I could have trusted Him with my very life, with wife, with
          children, with everything, I could give all into his hands, and say
          each morning, Lord, I have not a will of my own, or if I have one,
          still, thy will be done; thy wish shall be my wish; thy desire shall
          be my desire.' But oh that I were as in months past!' How changed am I
          now! I begin fretting about my business; and if I lose now but a live
          pound note, I am worried incessantly, whereas, if it were a thousand
          before, I could have thanked the God who took it away as easily as I
          could the God that gave it to me. How the least thing disturbs me. The
          least shadow of a doubt as to some calamity that may befall me, rests
          on my soul like a thick cloud. I am perpetually self-willed, desiring
          always to have just what I wish. I cannot say I can resign all into
          his hands; there is a certain something I could not give up. Twined
          round my heart there is an evil plant called self-love. It has twisted
          its roots within the very nerves and sinews of my soul. There is
          something I love above my God. I cannot give up all now; but oh that I
          were as in months past!' For then my mercies were real mercies,
          because they were God's mercies. "Oh," says he, "that I were as in
          months past!' I should not have had to bear such trouble as I have
          now, for though the burden might have pressed heavily, I would have
          cast it on the Lord. Oh! that I knew the heavenly science of taking
          the burdens off my own shoulders, and laying them on the Rock that
          supports them all! Oh! if I knew how to pour out my griefs and sorrows
          as I once did! I have been a fool, an arrant fool, a very fool, that I
          should have run away from that sweet confidence I once had in the
          Saviour! I used then to go to his ear, and tell him all my griefs.
        </p>
        <p>'My sorrows and my griefs I poured</p>
        <p>Into the bosom of my God;</p>
        <p>He helped me in the trying hour,</p>
        <p>He helped me bear the heavy load.'</p>
        <p>
          But now, I foolishly carry them myself, and bear them in my own
          breast, Ah!
        </p>
        <p>'What peaceful hours I then enjoyed!'</p>
        <p>Would that they would return to me."</p>
        <p>
          3. Another individual perhaps is speaking thus concerning his
          enjoyment in the house of God and the means of grace. "Oh," says one,
          "in months past, when I went up to the house of God, how sweetly did I
          hear! Why, I sat with my ears open, to catch the words, as if it were
          an angel speaking; and when I listened, how at times did the tears
          come rolling down my cheeks! and how did my eyes flash, when some
          brilliant utterance, full of joy to the Christian, aroused my soul!
          Oh! how did I awake on the Sabbath morning, and sing,
        </p>
        <p>'Welcome, sweet day of rest,</p>
        <p>That saw the Lord arise;</p>
        <p>Welcome to this reviving breast,</p>
        <p>And these rejoicing eyes!'</p>
        <p>
          And when they sang in the house of God, whose voice was so fond as
          mine. When I retired from worship, it was with a light tread; I went
          to tell my friends and my neighbors what glorious news I had heard in
          the sanctuary. Those were sweet Sabbaths; and when the prayer-meetings
          came round, how was I found in my places and the prayers were prayers
          indeed to my spirit; whoever I heard preach, provided it was the
          gospel, how did my soul feed and fatten under it! for I sat at a very
          banquet of joy. When I read the Scriptures they were always
          illuminated, and glory did gild the sacred page, whenever I turned it
          over. When I bent my knee in prayer, I could pour my soul out before
          God, and I loved the exercise; I felt that I could not be happy unless
          I spent my time upon my knees; I loved my God, and my God loved me;
          but oh! how changed now! Oh that I were as in months past!' I go up to
          God's house; it is the same voice that speaks, the same man I love so
          much, still addresses me; but I have no tears to shed now; my heart
          has become hardened even under his ministry; I have few emotions of
          joy; I enter the house of God as a boy goes to school, without much
          love to it, and I go away without having my soul stirred. When I kneel
          down in secret prayer, the wheels are taken off my chariot, and it
          drags very heavily; when I strive to sing, all I can say is, I would
          but cannot'; Oh that I were as in months past!' when the candle of the
          Lord shone round about me!"
        </p>
        <p>
          I trust there are not many of you who can join in this; for I know ye
          love to come up to the house of God. I love to preach to a people who
          feel the word, who give signs of assent to it -- men and women who can
          afford a tear now and then in a sermon -- people whose blood seems to
          boil within them when they hear the gospel. I don't think you
          understand much of the phase I am describing; but still you may
          understand a little of it. The word may not be quite so sweet and
          pleasant to you as it used to be; and then you may cry out -- "Oh that
          I were as in months past!"
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But I will tell you one point which perhaps may escape you. There
          are some of us who lament extremely that our conscience is not as
          tender as it used to be; and therefore doth our soul cry in
          bitterness, "Oh that I were as in months past!" "When first I knew the
          Lord," you say, "I was almost afraid to put one foot before another,
          lest I should go astray; I always looked before I leaped; if there
          were a suspicion of sin about anything, I faithfully avoided it; it
          there were the slightest trace of the trail of the serpent on it, I
          turned from it at once; people called me a Puritan; I watched
          everything; I was afraid to speak, and some practices that were really
          allowable I utterly condemned; my conscience was so tender, I was like
          a sensitive plant; if touched by the hand of sin, my leaves curled up
          in a moment; I could not bear to be touched I was so tender, I was all
          over wounds, and if any one brushed against me I cried out. I was
          afraid to do anything, lest I should sin against God. If I heard an
          oath, my bones shook within me; if I saw a man break the Sabbath, I
          trembled and was afraid; wherever I went, the least whisper of sin
          startled me; it was like the voice of a demon when I heard a
          temptation, and I said with violence, Get thee behind me, Satan,' I
          could not endure sin; I ran away from it as from a serpent; I could
          not taste a drop of it; but Oh that I were as in months past.' It is
          true, I have not forsaken his ways; I have not quite forgotten his
          law; it is true, I have not disgraced my character, I have not openly
          sinned before men, and none but God knoweth my sin; but oh! my
          conscience is not what it once was. It did thunder once, but it does
          not now. O conscience! conscience! thou art gone too much to sleep, I
          have drugged thee with laudanum, and thou art slumbering when thou
          oughtest to be speaking! Thou art a watchman; but thou dost not tell
          the hours of the night as thou once didst. O conscience! sometimes I
          heard thy rattle in my ears, and it startled me, now thou sleepest,
          and I go on to sin. It is but a little I have done; still, that little
          shows the way. Straws tell which way the wind doth blow; and I feel
          that my having committed one little sin, evidences in what way my soul
          is inclined. Oh! that I had a tender conscience again! Oh! that I had
          not this rhinoceros conscience, which is covered over with tough hide,
          through which the bullets of the law cannot pierce! Oh! that I had a
          conscience such as I used to have! ' Oh that I were as in months
          past!'"
        </p>
        <p>
          5. One more form of this sad condition. There are some of us, dearly
          beloved, who have not as much zeal for the glory of God and the
          salvation of men as we used to have. Months ago, if we saw a soul
          going to destruction, our eyes were filled with tears in a moment; if
          we did but see a man inclined to sin, we rushed before him with tears
          in our eyes, and wished to sacrifice ourselves to save him; we could
          not walk the street, but we must be giving somebody a tract, or
          reproving some one; we thought we must be for ever speaking of the
          Lord Jesus; if there were any good to be done, we were always first
          and foremost in it: we desired by all means to save some, and we did
          think at that time that we could give up ourselves to death, if we
          might but snatch a soul from hell. So deep, so ardent was our love to
          our fellowmen, that for the love we bore Christ's name, we would have
          been content to be scoffed at, hissed at, and persecuted by the whole
          world, if we might have done any good in it. Our soul was burning with
          intense longing for souls, and we considered all things else to be
          mean and worthless; but ah! now souls may be damned, and there is not
          a tear; sinners may sink into the scalding pit of hell, and not a
          groan; thousands may be swept away each day, and sink into bottomless
          woe, and yet not an emotion. We can preach without tears; we can pray
          for them without our hearts. We can speak to them without feeling
          their necessities; we pass by the haunts of infamy -- we wish the
          inmates better, and that is all. Even our compassion has died out.
          Once we stood near the brink of hell, and we thought each day that we
          heard the yellings and howlings of the doomed spirits ringing in our
          ears; and then we said, "O God, help me to save my fellow-men from
          going down to the pit! "But now we forget it all. We have little love
          to men, we have not half the zeal and energy we once had. Oh! if that
          be your state, dearly beloved; if you can join in that, as your poor
          minister, alas! can do in some measure, then may we well say, "Oh that
          I were as in months past!"
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But now we are about to take these different characters, and tell
          you the CAUSE AND CURE.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. One of the causes of this mournful state of things is defect in
          prayer; and of course the cure lies somewhere next door to the cause.
          You are saying, "Oh that I were as in months past!" Come, my brother;
          we are going into the very root of the matter. One reason why it is
          not with you as in months past is this: you do not pray as you once
          did. Nothing brings such leanness into a man's soul as want of prayer.
          It is well said that a neglected closet is the birth-place of all
          evil. All good is born in the closet, all good springeth from it;
          there the Christian getteth it; but if he neglecteth his closet, then
          all evil comes of it. No man can progress in grace if he forsakes his
          closet. I care not how strong he may be in faith. It is said that fat
          men may for a time live on the flesh they have acquired; but there is
          not a Christian so full of flesh that he can live on old grace. If he
          waxes fat he kicks, but he cannot live upon his fat. Those who are
          strong and mighty in themselves cannot exist without prayer. If a man
          should have the spiritual might of fifty of God's choicest Christians
          in himself, he must die, if he did not continue to plow. My brother,
          cannot you look back and say, "Three or four months ago my prayers
          were more regular, more constant, more earnest than they are now; but
          now they are feeble, they are not sincere, they are not fervent, they
          are not earnest? "O brother, do not ask anybody what is the cause of
          your grief; it is as plain as possible; you need not ask a question
          about it. There is the cause; and where is the remedy? Why, in more
          prayer, beloved. It was little prayer that brought you down; it is
          great prayer that will lift you up. It was lack of prayer that brought
          you into poverty, it must be increase of prayer that will bring you
          into riches again. Where no oxen are the crib is clean. There is
          nothing for men to eat where there are no oxen to plough; and where
          there are no prayers to plough the soil, you have little to feed upon.
          We must be more earnest in prayer. Oh! beloved, might not the beam out
          of the wall cry against us? Our dusty closets might bear witness to
          our neglect of secret devotion; and that is the reason why it is not
          with us as in months past. My friends: if you were to compare the
          Christian to a steam-engine, you must make his prayers, fed by the
          Holy Spirit, to be the very fire which sustains his motion. Prayer is
          God's chosen vehicle of grace, and he is unwise who neglects it. Let
          me be doubly serious on this matter, and let me give a home-thrust to
          some. Dear friend, do you mean what you say, and do you believe what
          you say -- that neglect of prayer will bring your soul into a most
          hazardous condition? If so, I will say no more to thee; for thou wilt
          easily guess the remedy for thy lamentable cry, "Oh that I were as in
          months past!" A certain merchant wishes that he were as rich as he
          used to be: -- he was wont to send his ships over to the gold country,
          to bring him home cargoes of gold, but ne'er a ship has been out of
          port lately, and therefore can he wonder that he has had no cargo of
          gold? So when a man prayeth he sends a ship to heaven, and it comes
          back laden with gold; but if he leaves off supplication, then his ship
          is weather-bound and stays at home, and no wonder he cometh to be a
          poor man.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Perhaps, again, you are saying, "Oh that I were as in months past!"
          not so much from your own fault as from the fault of your minister.
          There is such a thing, my dear friends, as our getting into a terribly
          bad condition through the ministry that we attend. Can it be expected
          that men should grow in grace when they are never watered with the
          streams that make glad the city of our God? Can they be supposed to
          wax strong in the Lord Jesus, when they do not feed on spiritual food?
          We know some who grumble, Sabbath after Sabbath, and say they cannot
          hear such and such a minister. Why don't you buy an ear-trumpet then?
          Ah! but I mean, that I can't hear him to my soul's profit. Then do not
          go to hear him, if you have tried for a long while and don't get any
          profit. I always think that a man who grumbles as he goes out of
          chapel ought not to be pitied, but whipped, for he can stay away if he
          likes, and go where he will be pleased. There are plenty of places
          where the sheep may feed in their own manner; and every one is bound
          to go where he gets the pasture most suited to his soul; but you are
          not bound to run away directly your minister dies, as many of you did
          before you came here. You should not run away from the ship directly
          the storm comes, and the captain is gone, and you find her not exactly
          sea-worthy; stand by her, begin caulking her, God will send you a
          captain, there will be fine weather by-and-bye, and all will be right;
          but very frequently a bad minister starves God's people into walking
          skeletons, so that you can tell all their bones; and who wonders that
          they starve out their minister, when they get no food and no nutriment
          from his ministrations. This is a second reason why men frequently cry
          out, "Oh that I were as in months past!"
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But there is a better reason still, that will come more home to
          some of you. It is not so much the badness of the food, as the
          seldomness that you come to eat it. You know, my dear friends, we find
          every now and then that there is a man who came twice a day to the
          house of God on the Sabbath. On the Monday night he was busy at work;
          but his apron was rolled up, and if he could not be present all the
          while, he would come in at the end. On the Thursday evening he would,
          if possible, come to the sanctuary, to hear a sermon from some gospel
          minister, and would sit up late at night and get up early in the
          morning, to make up the time he had spent in these religious
          exercises; but by-and-bye he thought, "I am too hard-worked; this is
          tiring; it is too far to walk." And so he gives up first one service,
          and then another, and then begins to cry out, "Oh that I were as in
          months past!" Why, brethren you need not wonder at it. The man does
          not eat so much as he used to do. Little and often is the way children
          should be fed, though I have given you a great deal this morning.
          Still, little and often is a very good rule. I do think, when people
          give up week-day services, unless it is utterly impracticable for them
          to attend them, farewell to religion. "Farewell to practical
          godliness," says Whitfield, "when men do not worship God on the
          week-day!" Week-day services are frequently the cream of all. God
          giveth his people pails full of milk on the Sabbath, but he often
          skims off the cream for the week-day. If they stay away, is it
          wonderful that they have to say, "Oh, that I were as in months past!"
          I do not blame you, beloved; I only wish to "stir up your pure minds
          by way of remembrance." A very plain fellow that is -- is he not? Yes,
          he always tells you what he means, and always intends to do so. Stand
          to your colors, my men! Keep close to the standard if you would win
          the battle! And when there seems to be the slightest defection, it is
          simply our duty to exhort you, lest by any measure ye depart from the
          soundness of your faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But frequently this complaint arises from idolatry. Many have given
          their hearts to something else save God, and have set their affections
          upon the things of earth, instead of the things in heaven. It is hard
          to love the world and love Christ, it is impossible: that is more; but
          it is hard not to love the creature; it is hard not to give yourself
          to earth; I had almost said, it is impossible not to do that; it is
          difficult, and only God can enable us; he alone can keep us with our
          hearts fully set on him; but mark whenever we make a golden calf to
          worship sooner or latter it will come to this, -- we shall get our
          golden calf ground up and put into our water for us to drink, and then
          we shall have to say, "He hath made me drunken with wormwood." Never a
          man makes an idol for himself to worship but it tumbles down on him
          and breaks some of his bones. There was ne'er a man yet who departed
          to broken cisterns to find water, but instead thereof he found
          loathsome creatures therein, and was bitterly deceived. God will have
          his people live on him, and on none else, and if they live on anything
          else but him he will take care to give them of the waters of Mara, to
          embitter their drink, and drive them to the Rock of purest streams.
          Oh, beloved, let us take care that our hearts are wholly his, only
          Christ's, solely Christ's! If they are so, we shall not have to cry
          out, "Oh that I were as in months past!"
        </p>
        <p>
          5. We scarcely need, however, detail any more reasons. We will add but
          one more and that is the most common one of all. We have, perhaps,
          become self-confident and self-righteous. If so, that is a reason why
          it is not with us as in months past. Ah! my friends, that old rascal
          self-righteousness, you will never get rid of him as long as you live.
          The devil was well pictured under the form of a serpent because a
          serpent can creep in anywhere, though the smallest crevice.
          Self-righteousness is a serpent; for it will enter anywhere. If you
          try to serve your God, "What a fine fellow you are," says the devil.
          "Ah! don't you serve your God well! You are always preaching. You are
          a noble fellow." If you go to a prayer meeting, God gives you a little
          gift, and you are able to pour out your heart. Presently there is a
          pat on the back from Satan. "Did not you pray sweetly? I know the
          brethren will love you; you are growing in grace very much." If a
          temptation comes, and you are able to resist it, "Ah!" says he at
          once, "you are a true soldier of the cross; look at the enemy you have
          knocked down; you will have a bright crown by-and-bye; you are a brave
          fellow!" You go on trusting God implicitly; Satan then says, your
          faith is very strong: no trial can overcome you: there is a weak
          brother, he is not half as strong as you are!" Away you go, and scold
          your weak brother, because he is not as big as you, and all the while
          Satan is cheering you up, and saying, "What a mighty warrior you are!
          so faithful -- always trusting in God, you have not any
          self-righteousness." The minister preaches to the Pharisee: but the
          Pharisee is not fifty-ninth cousin to you; you are not at all
          self-righteous in your own opinion, and all the while you are the most
          self-righteous creature in existence. Ah! beloved, just when we think
          ourselves humble we are sure to be proud; and when we are groaning
          over our pride we are generally the most humble. You may just read
          your own estimate backwards. Just when we imagine we are the worst, we
          are often the best, and when we conceive ourselves the best, we are
          often the worst. It is that vile self-righteousness who creeps into
          our souls, and makes us murmur, "Oh that I were as in months past!"
          Your candle has got the snuff of self-righteousness upon it; you want
          to have that taken away, and then you will burn all right. You are
          soaring too high; you require something that will bring you down again
          to the feet of the Saviour, as a poor lost and guilty sinner --
          nothing at all; then you will not cry any longer. "Oh that I were as
          in months past!"
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, the closing up is to be an EXHORTATION. An exhortation,
          first of all, to consolation, One is saying, "Oh! I shall never be in
          a more happy state than I now am in, I have lost the light of his
          countenance; he hath clean gone away from me, and I shall perish." You
          remember in John Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress," the description of the
          man shut up in the iron cage. One says to him, "Wilt thou never come
          out of this cage?" "No, never." "Art thou condemned for ever?" "Yes, I
          am." "Why was this?" "Why I grieved the Spirit, and he is gone; I once
          thought I loved him, but I have treated him lightly and he has
          departed. I went from the paths of righteousness, and now I am locked
          up here, and cannot get out." Yes, but John Bunyan does not tell you
          that the man never did get out? There have been some in that iron cage
          that have come out. There may be one here this morning, who has been
          for a long while sitting in that iron cage, rattling the bars, trying
          to break them, trying to file them through with his own little might
          and strength. Oh! dear friend, you will never file through the iron
          bars of that terrible cage; you will never escape by yourself. What
          must you do? You must begin to sing like the bird in the cage does;
          then the kind master will come and let you out. Cry to him to deliver
          you; and though you cry and shout, and he shutteth out your prayer, he
          will hear you by-and-bye; and like Jonah you shall exclaim in days to
          come, "Out of the belly of hell I cried unto the Lord, and he heard
          me." You will find the roll under the settle, although you have
          dropped it down the Hill of Difficulty; and when thou hast it thou
          will put it in thy bosom again, and hold it all the more tightly,
          because thou hast lost it for a little season.
        </p>
        <p>"Return, O wanderer, return,</p>
        <p>And seek an injured Father's face;</p>
        <p>Those warm desires that in thee burn</p>
        <p>Were kindled by reclaiming grace."</p>
        <p>
          And now another exhortation, not so much to console you as to stir you
          up more and more to seek to be what you ought to be. O Christian men
          and women, my brethren and sisters in the faith of Jesus Christ! How
          many there are of you who are content just to be saved, and merely to
          enter heaven. How many do we find who are saying "Oh! if I can but
          just get in at the door -- if I can simply be a child of God!" and
          they carry out their desires literally, for they are as little
          Christian as possible. They would have moderation in religion! But
          what is moderation in religion? It is a lie; it is a farce. Doth a
          wife ask her husband to be moderately loving? Doth a parent expect his
          child to be moderately obedient? Do you seek to have your servants
          moderately honest? No! Then how can you talk about being moderately
          religious? To be moderately religious is to be irreligious. To have a
          religion that does not enter into the very heart and influence the
          life, is virtually to have no religion at all. I tremble sometimes,
          when I think of some of you who are mere professors. Ye are content ye
          whitewashed sepulchres; because ye are beautifully whitened ye rest
          satisfied, without looking at the charnel-house beneath. How many of
          you make clean the outside of the cup and platter; and because the
          church can lay nothing to your charge, and the world cannot accuse
          you, you think the outside of the cup will be sufficient. Take heed!
          take heed! The judge will look at the inside of the cup and platter
          one day; and if it be full of wickedness he will break that platter,
          and the fragments shall for ever be cast about in the pit of torment.
          Oh! may God give you to be real Christians! Waxen-winged professors!
          ye can fly very well here; but when like Icarus, ye fly upwards, the
          mighty sun of Jesus shall melt your wings, and ye shall fall into the
          pit of destruction. Ah! gilded Christians, beautifully painted,
          varnished, polished, what will ye do when ye shall be found at last to
          have been worthless metal? When the wood, hay, and stubble shall be
          buried and consumed, what will ye do if ye are not the genuine coin of
          heaven, if ye have not been molten in the furnace, if ye have not been
          minted from on high? If ye are not real gold, how shall ye stand the
          fire in that "great and terrible day of the Lord?" Ah! and there are
          some of you who can stand the fire, I trust. You are the children of
          God, but, beloved, do I charge you wrongfully when I say, that many of
          us know that we are the children of God, but we are content to be as
          little dwarf children, we are always crying out, "Oh that I were as in
          months past!" That is a mark of dwarfishness. If we are to do great
          things in the world we must not often utter this cry, We must often be
          singing
        </p>
        <p>"I the chief of sinners am; but Jesus died for me;"</p>
        <p>
          and with cheerful countenance we must be able to say that we "know
          whom we have believed." Do you wish to be useful? Do you desire to
          honor your Master? Do you long to carry a heavy crown to heaven, that
          you may put it on the Saviour's head? If you do -- and I know you do
          -- then seek above all things that your soul may prosper and be in
          health -- that your inner-man may not be simply in a living state, but
          that you may be a tree planted by the rivers of water, bringing forth
          your fruit in your season, your leaf never withering, and whatsoever
          you do prospering. Ah! do you want to go to heaven, and wear a
          starless crown there -- a crown that shall be a real crown, but that
          shall have no star upon it, because no soul has been saved by you? Do
          you wish to sit in heaven with a dress of Christ's on, but without one
          single jewel that God has given you for your wages here below? Ah! no;
          methinks you wish to go to heaven in full dress, and to enter into the
          fullness of the joy of the Lord. Five talents well improved, five
          cities; and let no man be satisfied with his one talent merely, but
          let him seek to put it out at interest; "for unto him that hath shall
          be given, and he shall have abundance."
        </p>
        <p>
          And finally, to many of you what I have preached about has no interest
          whatever. Perhaps you may say, "Oh that I were as in months past!' for
          then I was quite well and a jolly fellow was I. Then I could drink
          with the deepest drinker anywhere. Then I could run merrily into sin,
          but I cannot now. I have hurt my body. I have injured my mind. It is
          not with me as it used to be, I have spent all my money. I wish I were
          as I used to be!" Ah! poor sinner, thou hast good reason to say, "Oh
          that I were as in months past!" But wait four or five months, and then
          you will say it more emphatically, and think even to day better than
          that day; and the further you go on, the more you will wish to go back
          again; for the path to hell is down, down, down, down -- always down
          -- and you will be always saying, "Oh that I were as in months past!"
          Thou wilt look back to the time when a mother's prayer blessed thee,
          and a father's reproof warned thee -- when thou wentest to a
          Sabbath-school, and sattest upon thy mother's knee, to hear her tell
          thee of a Saviour; and the longer the retrospect of goodness, the more
          that goodness will pain you. Ah I my friends, ye have need to go back,
          some of you. Remember how far ye have fallen -- how much ye have
          departed; but oh! ye need not turn back! Instead of looking back and
          crying, "Oh that I were as in months past!" say something different.
          Say, "Oh that I were a new man in Christ Jesus -- "It would not do for
          you to begin again in your present state; you would soon be as bad as
          you now are; but say, "Oh that I were a new man in Christ Jesus; oh
          that I might begin a new life!" Some of you would like to begin a new
          life -- some of you reprobates, who have gone far away! Well, poor
          mortal, thou mayest. "How?" savest thou. Why, if thou art a new man in
          Christ Jesus thou wilt begin again. A Christian is as much a new man
          as if he had been no man at all before; the old creature is dethroned,
          he is a new creature, born again, and starting on a new existence.
          Poor soul! God can make thee a new man. God the Holy Spirit can build
          a new house out of thee, with neither stick nor stone of the old man
          in it, and he can give thee a new heart, a new spirit, new pleasures
          new happiness, new prospects, and at last give thee a new heaven.
          "But," says one "I feel that I want these things; but may I have
          them?" Guess whether you may have them, when I tell you -- "This is a
          faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came
          into the world to save sinners." It does not say it is worthy of some
          acceptation, but it is worthy of all the acceptation you will ever
          give it. If you now say, "Jesus came into the world so save sinners, I
          believe he did! I know he did; he came to save me," you will find it
          "worthy of all acceptation." You say still, "But will he save me?" I
          will give you another passage: "Whosoever cometh unto me I will in no
          wise cast out." Ah! but I do not know whether I may come! "Whosoever,"
          it saith. "Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out."
          "Whosoever will, let him come," it is written. Dost thou will? I only
          speak to such as will, who know their need of a Saviour. Dost thou
          will? Then God the Holy Spirit says, "Whosoever will let him come, and
          take the water of life freely."
        </p>
        <p>The feeble, the guilty, the weak, the forlorn,</p>
        <p>In coming to Jesus shall not meet with scorn;</p>
        <p>But he will receive them, and bless them, and save</p>
        <p>From death and destruction, from hell and the grave.</p>
        <p>
          and he will lift them up to his kingdom of glory. God so grant it; for
          his name sake.<br />
