          1. For which reason the Lord declared to the disciples: "Behold, I say
          unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look upon the districts (regiones),
          for they are white [already] to harvest. For the harvest-man receiveth
          wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal, that both he that soweth
          and he that reapeth may rejoice together. For in this is the saying
          true, that one soweth and another reapeth. For I have sent you forward
          to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour; other men have laboured,
          and ye have entered into their labours." Who, then, are they that have
          laboured, and have helped forward the dispensations of God? It is
          clear that they are the patriarchs and prophets, who even prefigured
          our faith, and disseminated through the earth the advent of the Son of
          God, who and what He should be: so that posterity, possessing the fear
          of God, might easily accept the advent of Christ, having been
          instructed by the prophets. And for this reason it was, that when
          Joseph became aware that Mary was with child, and was minded to put
          her away privily, the angel said to him in sleep: "Fear not to take to
          thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy
          Ghost. For she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call His name
          Jesus; for He shall save His people from their sins." And exhorting
          him [to this], he added: "Now all this has been done, that it might be
          fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet, saying,
          Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and
          His name shall be called Emmanuel;" thus influencing him by the words
          of the prophet, and warding off blame from Mary, pointing out that it
          was she who was the virgin mentioned by Isaiah beforehand, who should
          give birth to Emmanuel. Wherefore, when Joseph was convinced beyond
          all doubt, he both did take Mary, and joyfully yielded obedience in
          regard to all the rest of the education of Christ, undertaking a
          journey into Egypt and back again, and then a removal to Nazareth.
          [For this reason,] those who knew not the Scriptures nor the promise
          of God, nor the dispensation of Christ, at last called him the father
          of the child. For this reason, too, did the Lord Himself read at
          Capernaum the prophecies of Isaiah: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon
          Me, because He hath anointed Me; to preach the Gospel to the poor hath
          He sent Me, to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the
          captives, and sight to the blind." At the same time, showing that it
          was He Himself who had been foretold by Esaias the prophet, He said to
          them: "This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears."

          2. For this reason, also, Philip, when he had discovered the eunuch of
          the Ethiopians' queen reading these words which had been written: "He
          was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb is dumb before the
          shearer, so He opened not His mouth: in His humiliation His judgment
          was taken away;" and all the rest which the prophet proceeded to
          relate in regard to His passion and His coming in the flesh, and how
          He was dishonoured by those who did not believe Him; easily persuaded
          him to believe on Him, that He was Christ Jesus, who was crucified
          under Pontius Pilate, and suffered whatsoever the prophet had
          predicted, and that He was the Son of God, who gives eternal life to
          men. And immediately when [Philip] had baptized him, he departed from
          him. For nothing else [but baptism] was wanting to him who had been
          already instructed by the prophets: he was not ignorant of God the
          Father, nor of the rules as to the [proper] manner of life, but was
          merely ignorant of the advent of the Son of God, which, when he had
          become acquainted with, in a short space of time, he went on his way
          rejoicing, to be the herald in Ethiopia of Christ's advent. Therefore
          Philip had no great labour to go through with regard to this man,
          because he was already prepared in the fear of God by the prophets.
          For this reason, too, did the apostles, collecting the sheep which had
          perished of the house of Israel, and discoursing to them from the
          Scriptures, prove that this crucified Jesus was the Christ, the Son of
          the living God; and they persuaded a great multitude, who, however,
          [already] possessed the fear of God. And there were, in one day,
          baptized three, and four, and five thousand men. <br />
