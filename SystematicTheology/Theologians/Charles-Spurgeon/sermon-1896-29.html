          5. Exalt Jehovah our God, and worship at his footstool; he is holy.6.
          Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those who call
          upon his name; they called upon Jehovah, and he answered them.7. He
          spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and
          the statute which he gave them.8. O Jehovah our God, thou wast a God
          that wast favorable to them, though thou didst take vengeance upon
          their inventions.9. Exalt Jehovah our God, and worship at his holy
          mountain; for Jehovah our God is holy.
        </p>

          5 Exalt Jehovah our God This exhortation is properly addressed to the
          Church alone, because having been made a partaker of the grace of God,
          she ought the more zealously to devote herself to his service, and to
          the love of godliness. The Psalmist, therefore, calls upon the Jews to
          exalt that God from whom they had received such manifest help, and
          enjoins them to render that worship appointed in his Law. The temple
          indeed is frequently in other places denominated God's seat, or house,
          or rest, or dwelling-place; here it is called his footstool, and for
          the use of this metaphor, there is the best of all reasons. For God
          desired to dwell in the midst of his people in such a manner, as not
          only to direct their thoughts to the outward temple and to the ark of
          the covenant, but rather to elevate them to things above. Hence the
          term house or dwelling-place tended to impart courage and confidence
          to them, that all the faithful might have boldness to draw near unto
          God freely, whom they beheld coming to meet them of his own accord.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as the minds of men are prone to superstition, it was necessary to
          check this propensity, lest they should associate with their notions
          of God things fleshly and earthly, and their thoughts should be wholly
          engrossed by the outward forms of worship. The prophet, therefore, in
          calling the temple God's footstool, desires the godly to elevate their
          thoughts above it, for he fills heaven and earth with his infinite
          glory. Nevertheless, by these means he reminds us that true worship
          can be paid to God no where else than upon mount Zion. For he employs
          a style of writing such as is calculated to elevate the minds of the
          godly above the world, and, at the same time, does not in the least
          degree detract from the holiness of the temple, which alone of all
          places of the earth God had chosen as the place where he was to be
          worshipped. From this we may see, since the days of Augustine, how
          vainly many perplex themselves in endeavoring to ascertain the reason
          for the prophet ordering God's footstool to be worshipped. The answer
          of Augustine is ingenious. If, says he, we look to Christ's manhood,
          we will perceive a reason why we may worship the footstool of God, and
          yet not be guilty of idolatry; for that body in which he wishes to be
          worshipped he took from the earth, and on this earth nothing else than
          God is worshipped, for the earth is both the habitation of Deity, and
          God himself condescended to become earth. All this is very plausible,
          but it is foreign to the design of the prophet, who, intending to
          distinguish between legal worship, (which was the only worship that
          God sanctioned,) and the superstitious rites of the heathen, summons
          the children of Abraham to the temple, as if to their standard, there,
          after a spiritual manner, to worship God, because he dwells in
          celestial glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that the shadowy dispensation has passed away, I believe that God
          cannot otherwise be properly worshipped, than when we come to him
          directly through Christ, in whom all the fullness of the Godhead
          dwells. It were improper and absurd for any one to designate him a
          footstool. For the prophet merely spake in this manner to show that
          God was not confined to the visible temple, but that he is to be
          sought for above all heavens, inasmuch as he is elevated above the
          whole world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The frantic bishops of Greece, in the second Council of Nice, very
          shamefully perverted this passage, when they endeavored to prove from
          it that God was to be worshipped by images and pictures. The reason
          assigned for exalting Jehovah our God, and worshipping at his
          footstool, contains an antithesis: he is holy For the prophet, in
          hallowing the name of the one God, declares all the idols of the
          heathen to be unholy; as if he should say, Although the heathen claim
          for their idols an imaginary sanctity, they are nevertheless very
          vanity, an offense, and abomination. Some translate this clauses for
          it is holy; but it will appear from the end of the psalm that it was
          the design of the prophet by this title to distinguish God from all
          idols.

          6. Moses and Aaron. The Psalmist magnifies the special grace which God
          in a very remarkable manner vouchsafed to the seed of Abraham, that
          thence he chose for himself prophets and priests to be, as it were,
          mediators between him and the people, to ratify the covenant of
          salvation. And he mentions three persons who were famous in former
          times. For Moses was, as it were, a mediator to reconcile the people
          unto God. Aaron was invested with the same office; and, subsequently,
          Samuel sustained the same character. There is no doubt, however, that
          under these three persons he included all the people with whom God had
          made a covenant. But he mentions the names of those who were the
          depositaries and guardians of this invaluable treasure. It may appear
          improper that he should speak of Moses as among the priests, since his
          sons were only among the common Levites, and that Moses himself, after
          the giving of the law, never held the office of high priest. But as
          the Hebrews call kvhnym, chohanim, those who are chief and very
          eminent personages, such as kings' sons, there is nothing to prevent
          the prophet from giving this designation to Moses, as if he had said
          that he was one of the holy rulers of the Church. Moreover, if we go
          back to the first original -- to the period prior to the publication
          of the law, it is certain that Moses was then invested with the high
          priest's office. The design of the prophet must also be kept in mind,
          namely, that God not only adopted the seed of Abraham, but set apart
          some of them to act as mediators, whom he enjoined to call upon his
          name, in order that his covenant might be the more confirmed. For the
          invocation of which he speaks must not be understood indiscriminately
          of every manner of calling upon, but only of that which belongs to the
          priests, who were chosen by God, as intercessors to appear in his
          presence in the name of all the people, and to speak on their behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
          They called upon Jehovah The Psalmist explains more fully what I have
          just now said, that God from the very first, and with a special
          reference to his gracious covenant, bestowed great benefits upon the
          descendants of Abraham -- the Jews. And, therefore, as often as they
          experienced the loving-kindness of God, it behooved them to call to
          mind his former loving-kindness. The prophet, too, makes particular
          mention of the visible symbol of the cloudy pillar, by which God
          designed to testify in all ages that his presence was ever with his
          people, according as he employed temporal signs, not only for their
          benefit to whom they were exhibited, but also for the benefit of those
          who were to succeed them. Not that God always showed a cloudy pillar
          to his ancient people, but considering that the dullness of men is so
          great, that they do not perceive the presence of God unless they are
          put in mind by external signs, the prophet very properly reminds the
          Jews of this memorable token. And as God had appeared openly in the
          desert to their fathers, so their posterity might be well assured that
          he would also be near to them. He adds, that they had kept God's
          testimonies, for the purpose of enforcing the duty of like obedience
          upon succeeding generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. O Jehovah our God The prophet here reminds them that God had heard
          their prayers because his grace and their piety harmonized.
          Consequently, encouraged by their exemplary success in prayer, their
          posterity ought to call upon God, not merely pronouncing his name with
          their lips, but keeping his covenant with all their heart. He farther
          reminds us that if God does not display his glory so bountifully, and
          so profusely in every age, the fault is with men themselves, whose
          posterity have either utterly forsaken, or greatly declined from the
          faith of the fathers. It is not to be wondered at that God should
          withdraw his hand, or at least not stretch it forth in any remarkable
          way, when he beholds piety waxing cold on the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          O God, thou hast been propitious to them. From these words it is quite
          obvious that what the Psalmist had formerly said concerning Moses,
          Aaron, and Samuel, refers to the whole people; for surely they did not
          officiate as priests merely for their own benefit, but for the common
          benefit of all the Israelites. Hence the transition is more natural
          which he makes from these three to the remaining body of the people.
          For I neither restrict the relative, to these three persons, nor do I
          interpret them exclusively of the same, but I rather think that the
          state of the whole Church is pointed out; namely, that while God, at
          the prayers of the priests, was propitious to the Jews, he, at the
          same time, sharply punished them for their sins. For on the one hand,
          the prophet magnifies the grace of God in that he had treated the
          people so kindly, and had so mercifully forgiven their iniquity; on
          the other hand, he specifies those awful examples of punishment by
          which he punished them for their ingratitude, that their descendants
          might learn to submit themselves dutifully to him. For it must not be
          forgotten, that by how much God deals graciously with us, by so much
          will he the less easily endure that we should treat his liberality
          with scorn.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the close of the psalm he repeats the same sentence which we had in
          the fifth verse, only substituting his holy mountain instead of his
          footstool; and as for the sake of brevity he had formerly said
          somewhat obscurely qdvs hv', kadosh hu, he is holy, he now says more
          plainly, Jehovah our God is holy His intention is to show that God is
          not to be worshipped by the Israelites at random, (as the religion of
          the heathen depended upon fancy alone,) but that his worship is
          founded upon the assurance of faith.<br />
