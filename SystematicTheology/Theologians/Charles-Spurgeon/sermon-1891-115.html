          1. The oblation of the Church, therefore, which the Lord gave
          instructions to be offered throughout all the world, is accounted with
          God a pure sacrifice, and is acceptable to Him; not that He stands in
          need of a sacrifice from us, but that he who offers is himself
          glorified in what he does offer, if his gift be accepted. For by the
          gift both honour and affection are shown forth towards the King; and
          the Lord, wishing us to offer it in all simplicity and innocence, did
          express Himself thus: |Therefore, when thou offerest thy gift upon the
          altar, and shalt remember that thy brother hath ought against thee,
          leave thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled
          to thy brother, and then return and offer thy gift.| We are bound,
          therefore, to offer to God the first-fruits of His creation, as Moses
          also says, |Thou shalt not appear in the presence of the Lord thy God
          empty;| so that man, being accounted as grateful, by those things in
          which he has shown his gratitude, may receive that honour which flows
          from Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. And the class of oblations in general has not been set aside; for
          there were both oblations there [among the Jews], and there are
          oblations here [among the Christians]. Sacrifices there were among the
          people; sacrifices there are, too, in the Church: but the species
          alone has been changed, inasmuch as the offering is now made, not by
          slaves, but by freemen. For the Lord is [ever] one and the same; but
          the character of a servile oblation is peculiar [to itself], as is
          also that of freemen, in order that, by the very oblations, the
          indication of liberty may be set forth. For with Him there is nothing
          purposeless, nor without signification, nor without design. And for
          this reason they (the Jews) had indeed the tithes of their goods
          consecrated to Him, but those who have received liberty set aside all
          their possessions for the Lord's purposes, bestowing joyfully and
          freely not the less valuable portions of their property, since they
          have the hope of better things [hereafter]; as that poor widow acted
          who cast all her living into the treasury of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. For at the beginning God had respect to the gifts of Abel, because
          he offered with single-mindedness and righteousness; but He had no
          respect unto the offering of Cain, because his heart was divided with
          envy and malice, which he cherished against his brother, as God says
          when reproving his hidden [thoughts], |Though thou offerest rightly,
          yet, if thou dost not divide rightly, hast thou not sinned? Be at
          rest;| since God is not appeased by sacrifice. For if any one shall
          endeavour to offer a sacrifice merely to outward appearance,
          unexceptionably, in due order, and according to appointment, while in
          his soul he does not assign to his neighbour that fellowship with him
          which is right and proper, nor is under the fear of God; -- he who
          thus cherishes secret sin does not deceive God by that sacrifice which
          is offered correctly as to outward appearance; nor will such an
          oblation profit him anything, but [only] the giving up of that evil
          which has been conceived within him, so that sin may not the more, by
          means of the hypocritical action, render him the destroyer of himself.
          Wherefore did the Lord also declare: |Woe unto you, scribes and
          Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye are like whited sepulchres. For the
          sepulchre appears beautiful outside, but within it is full of dead
          men's bones, and all uncleanness; even so ye also outwardly appear
          righteous unto men, but within ye are full of wickedness and
          hypocrisy.| For while they were thought to offer correctly so far as
          outward appearance went, they had in themselves jealousy like to Cain;
          therefore they slew the Just One, slighting the counsel of the Word,
          as did also Cain. For [God] said to him, |Be at rest;| but he did not
          assent. Now what else is it to |be at rest| than to forego purposed
          violence? And saying similar things to these men, He declares: |Thou
          blind Pharisee, cleanse that which is within the cup, that the outside
          may be clean also.| And they did not listen to Him. For Jeremiah says,
          |Behold, neither thine eyes nor thy heart are good; but [they are
          turned] to thy covetousness, and to shed innocent blood, and for
          injustice, and for man-slaying, that thou mayest do it.| And again
          Isaiah saith, |Ye have taken counsel, but not of Me; and made
          covenants, [but] not by My Spirit.| In order, therefore, that their
          inner wish and thought, being brought to light, may show that God is
          without blame, and worketh no evil -- that God who reveals what is
          hidden [in the heart], but who worketh not evil -- when Cain was by no
          means at rest, He saith to him: |To thee shall be his desire, and thou
          shalt rule over him.| Thus did He in like manner speak to Pilate:
          |Thou shouldest have no power at all against Me, unless it were given
          thee from above;| God always giving up the righteous one [in this life
          to suffering], that he, having been tested by what he suffered and
          endured, may [at last] be accepted; but that the evildoer, being
          judged by the actions he has performed, may be rejected. Sacrifices,
          therefore, do not sanctify a man, for God stands in no need of
          sacrifice; but it is the conscience of the offerer that sanctifies the
          sacrifice when it is pure, and thus moves God to accept [the offering]
          as from a friend. |But the sinner,| says He, |who kills a calf [in
          sacrifice] to Me, is as if he slew a dog.|
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Inasmuch, then, as the Church offers with single-mindedness, her
          gift is justly reckoned a pure sacrifice with God. As Paul also says
          to the Philippians, |I am full, having received from Epaphroditus the
          things that were sent from you, the odour of a sweet smell, a
          sacrifice acceptable, pleasing to God.| For it behoves us to make an
          oblation to God, and in all things to be found grateful to God our
          Maker, in a pure mind, and in faith without hypocrisy, in
          well-grounded hope, in fervent love, offering the first-fruits of His
          own created things. And the Church alone offers this pure oblation to
          the Creator, offering to Him, with giving of thanks, [the things
          taken] from His creation. But the Jews do not offer thus: for their
          hands are full of blood; for they have not received the Word, through
          whom it is offered to God. Nor, again, do any of the conventicles
          (synagog√¶) of the heretics [offer this]. For some, by maintaining that
          the Father is different from the Creator, do, when they offer to Him
          what belongs to this creation of ours, set Him forth as being covetous
          of another's property, and desirous of what is not His own. Those,
          again, who maintain that the things around us originated from
          apostasy, ignorance, and passion, do, while offering unto Him the
          fruits of ignorance, passion, and apostasy, sin against their Father,
          rather subjecting Him to insult than giving Him thanks. But how can
          they be consistent with themselves, [when they say] that the bread
          over which thanks have been given is the body of their Lord, and the
          cup His blood, if they do not call Himself the Son of the Creator of
          the world, that is, His Word, through whom the wood fructifies, and
          the fountains gush forth, and the earth gives |first the blade, then
          the ear, then the full corn in the ear.|
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Then, again, how can they say that the flesh, which is nourished
          with the body of the Lord and with His blood, goes to corruption, and
          does not partake of life? Let them, therefore, either alter their
          opinion, or cease from offering the things just mentioned. But our
          opinion is in accordance with the Eucharist, and the Eucharist in turn
          establishes our opinion. For we offer to Him His own, announcing
          consistently the fellowship and union of the flesh and Spirit. For as
          the bread, which is produced from the earth, when it receives the
          invocation of God, is no longer common bread, but the Eucharist,
          consisting of two realities, earthly and heavenly; so also our bodies,
          when they receive the Eucharist, are no longer corruptible, having the
          hope of the resurrection to eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Now we make offering to Him, not as though He stood in need of it,
          but rendering thanks for His gift, and thus sanctifying what has been
          created. For even as God does not need our possessions, so do we need
          to offer something to God; as Solomon says: |He that hath pity upon
          the poor, lendeth unto the Lord.| For God, who stands in need of
          nothing, takes our good works to Himself for this purpose, that He may
          grant us a recompense of His own good things, as our Lord says: |Come,
          ye blessed of My Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you. For I
          was an hungered, and ye gave Me to eat: I was thirsty, and ye gave Me
          drink: I was a stranger, and ye took Me in: naked, and ye clothed Me;
          sick, and ye visited Me; in prison, and ye came to Me.| As, therefore,
          He does not stand in need of these [services], yet does desire that we
          should render them for our own benefit, lest we be unfruitful; so did
          the Word give to the people that very precept as to the making of
          oblations, although He stood in no need of them, that they might learn
          to serve God: thus is it, therefore, also His will that we, too,
          should offer a gift at the altar, frequently and without intermission.
          The altar, then, is in heaven (for towards that place are our prayers
          and oblations directed); the temple likewise [is there], as John says
          in the Apocalypse, |And the temple of God was opened:| the tabernacle
          also: |For, behold,| He says, |the tabernacle of God, in which He will
          dwell with men.|
