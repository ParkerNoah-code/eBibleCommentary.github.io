          |Thus saith the Lord; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou
          shalt make for them yokes of iron.| -- Jeremiah 28:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          ALL THROUGH THE BOOK of Jeremiah you will observe that the prophet
          taught the people not only by words, but by symbols. At one time he
          took his mantle and hid it in the earth till it was soiled and worn,
          and then taught them something by wearing it. At another time he took
          an earthen pot and broke it in their presence. And on this occasion he
          put a yoke about his own neck as the token that Israel should be
          subdued beneath the power of Nebuchadnezzar. This was a strange method
          of teaching. I have sometimes heard complaints made by those who are
          fond of criticizing things they know nothing about -- when a teacher
          puts a truth very plainly, if he shall, as it were, act what he says,
          he is upbraided at once as being histrionic. I know not what
          ungenerous words are hurled at him. Yet after all, this was what
          Jeremiah did. He taught the people by signs and symbols. So, too, our
          Lord himself. I doubt not, that when he uttered those words, |Consider
          the lilies,| he stooped down and plucked a lily; and when he said,
          |Consider the ravens,| he pointed to the ravens flying overhead, in
          the sky. At any rate, we know that once he took a little child, and
          set it in the midst of them. What an outcry there would be if I were
          to take a little child and set him here and preach about him! Did we
          use any kind of symbol, to what ridicule we should expose ourselves!
          The fact is, we might do much more good if we did less regard the
          general current of public opinion, and ventured to do strange things,
          that anyhow the truth of God might come home to a slumbering
          generation, and the Word of God, which must be learnt by them or they
          must perish, were made to tell upon their minds. The prophet Jeremiah,
          though exceedingly faithful in his mission, which he discharged as God
          would have him discharge it, with many tears in great love and deep
          anxiety, nevertheless had a great obstacle in his way. He was met by
          false prophets who withstood and contradicted him to his face. Not so
          very surprising either. It must ever be expected that it will be so.
          If God shall speak by any man, there shall be some other who protests
          that God speaks by him to the contrary. If there be a Christ, there
          will be an Antichrist; if there be a Simon Peter, there will be a
          Simon Marcus, if there shall be raised up by God a Luther, there shall
          be an Eckius, or some other controversialist who shall seek to resist
          and overthrow him. Let no man's heart then fail him if he be flatly
          contradicted when he bears testimony for God. Let him rather expect
          it, and go on never caring, for the fact is, the truth will outlive
          error, and in the long run that Word of God before which all things
          else are as grass and as the flower, the perishing flower of the field
          -- the Word of God shall endure for ever and triumph over the ruin of
          all the words of men. Tremble not, ye feeble adherents of the truth,
          who fear lest your weakness should make the truth itself weak, and the
          strong logic and the powerful rhetoric of its adversaries should
          overturn the oracles of God. It cannot be. The gates of hell shall not
          prevail against the gospel, mighty though they be both in power and in
          sophistry. The truth shall abide; the right shall prevail; for God is
          faithful, and Christ must reign till he hath put all enemies under his
          feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this, by way of preliminary observation, we will now come to the
          text, and endeavor to make some use of it for ourselves. Hananiah took
          off the symbolic yoke, the wooden yoke, from Jeremiah's neck and broke
          it. Jeremiah comes again, and says, |You have broken the yoke of wood,
          but God has commanded that ye shall now wear yokes of iron.| They were
          not benefited, therefore, by the change, but the reverse. This is
          suggestive of a broad principle. From the symbol, which was applicable
          in one case, we draw a general truth. Whenever men say of God, |Let us
          break his bands asunder, and cast his cords from us,| they may do so
          if they will; but instead of the yokes of wood they will be sure to
          get yokes of iron. If they will not submit to the government of
          Christ, they will have to submit to the tyranny of Satan. Some yoke
          they will have to wear, and if they reject the easy yoke of the Christ
          of God, the wooden yoke as it were which he puts on men, there shall
          be made for them yokes of iron, which they shall neither be able to
          break off nor yet to support.
        </p>
        <p>
          So our thought will run this way. First, that men must wear some yoke
          or other; and, secondly, that the yoke of Christ is a very easy one;
          and, thirdly, that when it is refused, it is inevitable that men
          should wear a heavier one.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. MEN MUST WEAR SOME YOKE. It is so naturally. There is no stage of
          life in which this is not the case. The child must bear the yoke in
          his youth. He is an unhappy child that is under no control. Probably
          there is nothing so ruinous to a man as to be allowed to have his own
          way, while yet his judgment is not ripe enough to guide him. And when
          we advance into youth, we are usually placed in some position of life
          where we are under obligations to some superior, be he parent, or
          guardian, or employer. Nor if we become what is called our own
          masters, does it make much difference. As things go now, I think there
          are no people that are their own masters, for the masters are bound to
          yield to the terms which the servants dictate; and this condition of
          things is getting more and more rife. I shall not discuss the right or
          wrong of this, where questions arise between capitalists and skillful
          laborers, but I will say that if the employed claim liberty, the
          masters might very well be allowed a portion of that choice
          prerogative. As it is now, I am sure he that says, |I am a master,| is
          as much under the yoke to his servants as the servant is under the
          yoke to his master. That a man who lives in the midst of society
          should hold some relationship to all around him is indispensable. But
          men are always for changing their forms of government. Some nations
          have a revolution almost with every moon, but for all that there is
          still a yoke upon them; and if it were ever to come to anarchy, to mob
          rule -- ah, I warrant you, it would be a yoke of iron, and of red hot
          iron too. God save us from it. No yoke is so hard to bear as that yoke
          which a people put upon themselves when they reject all order, break
          through all law, and will not submit to any principle or any
          government, however just or righteous. You cannot get on in this world
          without a yoke of some sort. We are not going to wear a tyrant's yoke
          any of us. Let lords and lands have what masters they will: in this
          land of ours we will be free, and our own masters still; but the
          selfishness of individuals or of classes must never determine the
          boundary lines of power or of privilege; for we can only maintain our
          freedom by everyone of us paying that right obedience to the law which
          is due from every citizen, if we would promote alike his own comfort
          and the common weal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Away from those lower grounds into higher spheres -- it is certainly
          true that we must wear the yoke. God has made us, and not we
          ourselves; and God has made us to be his servants. We are daily in
          dependence on him for the bread we eat. If any man shall say he is not
          dependent upon God, I will at least reply to him, |You are dependent
          for the air you breathe and the power to breathe it. The life that is
          within you hangs upon a thread, and that thread is in the hand of the
          Most High.| Every moment each one of us is most certainly sustained by
          God. And in return for this support, there is something asked, namely,
          that we would submit to his will; that we would obey his law, which is
          perfect, and just, and right, and that having sinned against him we
          should rebel no longer or continue his enemies, but be reconciled to
          him. We are made dependent creatures, and from that very fact we must
          wear a yoke unto God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, dear friends, we are all so constituted as creatures, with
          such passions and propensities, that when we break one yoke, the yoke
          which it is meet we should wear, and do not serve God, we at once bend
          our necks to another yoke and begin to serve something else -- we
          serve ourselves, and oh, the slavery of serving one's self! He that
          makes his belly his god, and bows down to the lusts of the flesh,
          serves a tyrant indeed. Something or other we must serve, not only
          because we are dependent creatures, but also it seems to be stamped
          upon us that we must follow some great principle, and must yield
          ourselves to some spiritual influence. A yoke of some kind or another
          we must submit to. The man who shall say, |I am perfectly free, and I
          live for nothing but myself,| is so mean an animal, that he is hardly
          worthy to be called a man. In his boasted exemption from all regard to
          his fellow creatures and to his God, he sets himself up, in his own
          esteem, and that after a diabolical model, alone and apart in his
          awful selfishness, like an iceberg to melt away, and may be to crush
          others as he moves along his course. What is he but a beacon, against
          which all are to be warned? Sir, the yoke fits the human neck, and the
          human neck was made to wear it. We must have some God, we must have
          some ruler, we must have some principle, which shall master us, and be
          it ours in God's name to choose the right and the best master, or
          else, woe be unto us.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Not to dwell longer upon our first point, I proceed to notice THAT
          THE YOKE OF CHRIST IS AN EASY YOKE. It is, as it were, a yoke of wood.
          Let us dwell upon this awhile. God grant that some who have never worn
          that yoke may, by the Holy Spirit's power, be led to carry it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you become a servant of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the man of
          Nazareth, he asks of you nothing but what is absolutely right. His
          life, which is the Christian's law written out in living characters,
          is perfection itself. His precepts which distil like dew from his
          lips, are all pure and good, just and kind. It ought to be enough for
          a man, and would be enough for him if he were not fallen, to know that
          all rule is right, and to submit to it at once. When God gives a man a
          noble spirit, he pants to enlist in honorable service. He craves a
          post in the council or the camp. His heart's enquiry is, |Where can I
          find a leader who will always lead me aright? Where shall I discover a
          law which will never lead me into evil, if I obey it? Where can I
          discover an example, which I may imitate in its very jots and tittles,
          and yet never be found any other than I ought to be?| I commend to
          such spirits, Jesus the Christ of God, for there is nothing in his
          precepts or his practices, in his profession or his life, that is not
          consonant with righteousness of the highest order, majestic in its
          compass, and scrupulously minute in its obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The yoke of Christ is framed in our interest. The law of Christ is
          drawn up and dictated by our Councillor for our welfare. If man were
          infinitely wise, and could draw up a code for himself, which would
          involve no hardship, and entail all that was happy, he could devise no
          regulations more healthful, more profitable, or more pleasant than
          those of the Savior; he would discover that to believe in Jesus was
          the highest wisdom; to repent of sin, the most delightful necessity;
          to follow after holiness the most blissful pursuit, and to serve God
          the greatest delight. Service and sovereignty blend here, as when
          Joseph became Prime Minister of Pharaoh he was lord over all the land
          of Egypt. To serve God in very truth is to reign, and to become a
          servant of Christ, is to be made a king and a priest unto God -- to be
          ennobled with as much dignity as human nature can bear. Jesus Christ,
          if he forbids you anything, only forbids you what would harm you. Say
          any of you of sin -- |Tis sweet|? Ah! and so are many I poisoned
          things. Your nature goes after it. Yes, and many a sick man's nature
          craves for that which would be his poison. The Lord Jesus denies to
          those who take his yoke nothing but that which would be injurious to
          them. His is a blessed yoke, because it is the yoke of righteousness,
          and it is the yoke of personal benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, Christ's yoke is not exacting. If he assesses us with one
          hand, he more richly endows us with the other hand. He in his grace
          always gives to us of his bounty what he asks of us as our duty. Under
          one view of divine truth, faith is man's act. The Holy Ghost never
          believes for anybody. A sinner must believe himself. It is a personal
          act. But yet in another phase of it, it is the Holy Spirit's work in
          the man -- he gives the faith which the man exercises towards God. If
          then faith in Jesus be required, it is not a hard thing, because the
          Spirit works in men the very faith which Jesus seeks of them. If to
          repent of sin be thought difficult -- how shall we get tears out of a
          rock? -- the reply is, true repentance is the gift of the Holy Ghost,
          and when it is sought of the Lord, it is never denied. Christ is
          exalted on high to give not only the pardon of sin, but to give the
          repentance which comes before the pardon. To give repentance and
          remission of sins is the very office of Christ. If, then, the precepts
          should seem difficult, the difficulty is removed, because the virtues
          and graces which are a matter of precept are also a matter of promise.
          What is commanded in one Scripture, is conceded in another as an
          absolute gift of God according to the covenant of his grace. It is an
          easy yoke, then, sinner. Dost thou say: |I cannot believe|? Hast thou
          asked for faith? Is thy heart hard? Hast thou asked to have it
          softened? If ye cannot come to Christ with broken hearts, come for
          broken hearts, for they are his gift. He will give you all -- all that
          his gospel demands, for he is Alpha and Omega, the author and the
          finisher of our faith. It is an easy yoke, then, since he gives what
          he requires.
        </p>
        <p>
          That the yoke of Christ is easy, I might call to witness all those who
          have ever proved it. Never did a man wear it but he always loved to
          wear it. I think I have heard that Queen Elizabeth carried the crown
          in the procession of her sister Mary at the coronation, and she
          remarked that it was very heavy, but some one standing by told her it
          would not be heavy when she had to wear it herself. So the precepts
          which some men do but carry in their hands seem very heavy; but when a
          man comes to know Christ and to love him, those very precepts become
          light and easy. |I could not,| says one, |be a Christian as I am: it
          would be very hurtful to me: I should have to give up much that I have
          learned to prize.| Ah! but suppose you were made a new man in Christ
          Jesus, there would be nothing irksome at all about renouncing old
          habits. Here is a raven, to tutor it into cleanly living, it must
          forego all carrion, it must feed upon these grains sweet and pure. The
          raven might pine and repine at this as a hardship, unless by some
          transmuting influence the raven were turned into a dove. Then it would
          be no hardship to forsake the carrion, which its new nature would
          loathe; nor would it be grievous to feed upon the clean winnowed
          grain, for its appetite would crave it. And, O beloved, the life of
          the true Christian is not a life chafed and galled with vexatious
          prohibitions, because pursuits which, to the non-Christian heart are
          distasteful and repulsive, to the renewed heart are a matter of
          intense delight. A man shall carry a bucket of water on his head and
          be very tired with the burden, but that same man when he dives into
          the sea shall have a thousand buckets on his head without perceiving
          their weight, because he is in the element and it entirely surrounds
          him. The duties of holiness are very irksome to men who are not in the
          element of holiness; but when once those men are cast into the element
          of grace, then they bear ten times more and feel no weight, but are
          refreshed thereby with joy unspeakable. Christ's yoke is easy, for the
          new heart rejoices in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The yoke of Christ is rendered easy by the bright example of Christ,
          and by the blessed fellowship with him to which his people are called.
          Christ himself carried it. Have you never read in Grecian story -- I
          think there are one or two cases to the point -- how the Grecian
          soldiers on their long marches grew exceedingly weary, and wished that
          the war were closed: they felt so dispirited. But there was a man whom
          they almost adored as a god -- Alexander himself -- and they saw him
          always sharing their toil. If the road was rough, the monarch walked
          with them: if they were short of a draught of water, Alexander would
          share their thirst. At the sight of him every man grew strong. Oh! it
          is grand to the believer to feel that, if there be a trial or a
          difficulty in the Christianity, Christ has borne it, and Christ is
          with us, bearing it still. Not like the scribes and Pharisees, who
          laid heavy burdens, grievous to be borne, upon men's shoulders, and
          they themselves would not touch them with one of their fingers; our
          Lord has taken the load himself and carried it, and he now says to the
          disciples, |Take my yoke upon you -- the very yoke I carried -- and
          learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart: I have borne the trial
          which you have to bear and endured to the end, as you shall do through
          my grace.|
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one remarkable fact about the yoke of Christ which I should
          like to mention. All who have borne it have always had grace given
          equal to the weight of the burden. I have never, yet discovered one
          cross-bearer among the children of God who ever expressed regret that
          to become a Christian and took upon himself the yoke. I have been
          familiar with death-beds: I have witnessed strange scenes, for the
          bony hand of death pulls back many curtains and plucks off many masks
          from faces that were accustomed to wear them. One thing however, I can
          solemnly say I have never scene. I have never seen a Christian weary
          of His Master's service. I have never heard from an aged pilgrim a
          word of complaint against Christ, or against his yoke. There have been
          a great many Christians beyond all suspicion of fanaticism, of whom
          none would suppose that they strove to act a part inconsistent with
          their true character, yet not one has had to regret that he served
          Christ. You know the words so often quoted of him who regretted that
          he had not served his God with half the zeal that he had served his
          kind; but I never remember, nor do any of you ever remember having
          heard of one who, in life's latest hour, bemoaned his allegiance to
          God, or bewailed the ardor with which he followed Christ. Surely, if
          remorse had ever begotten such a thought, some one would have been
          bold to utter it. And, verily, verily, if such an incident had ever
          occurred, there would have been no lack of historians to record it.

          Another thing I think tells strongly in favor of this yoke of Christ.
          The servants of Christ are always anxious to get their children into
          the same service. Often do I hear men say, |I don't want to bring my
          boy up to my trade; the work is dirty, the hours long, and the pay
          small.| I have heard them say, |I should not like to see my boy in our
          office; there are so many temptations,| and so on. Did you ever hear a
          pious man say, |I should not like my boy to be a Christian|? Did you
          ever hear a godly matron say, |I should deeply regret to see my
          daughter become a follower of Christ|? No, but what they have
          possessed for themselves they have longed to have for their children.
          I remember well hearing my grandfather's earnest prayer for all his
          household. It always lay near his heart that his children and his
          children's children might fear the Lord. I have lively recollections
          of his devotions. My father, whose prayer you heard just now -- how
          often have I heard him pray for his children; and I can truly say the
          prayer that is nearest to my heart is for my sons, that they may serve
          the Lord. There is nothing I desire so much beneath the skies. Now if
          Christ's yoke were hard, we could not wish to bring our children under
          it. We have natural affections and common sense as well as you, and
          having tried Christ so long ourselves, that is our desire for our
          posterity. I have tried him now (what shall I say?) these twenty
          years. Had I found him a hard master I would not beguile you or belie
          my own conscience. I speak the truth, there is no lord like Christ,
          and no service like Christ's. I would that every young man and every
          young woman here believed in his name and submitted to his authority,
          and that they would take upon themselves, through his grace, his easy
          peace-giving yoke.

          III. If not, what then? THOSE WHO REFUSE TO WEAR THE EASY YOKE OF
          CHRIST WILL HAVE TO WEAR A WORSE ONE. |Thou hast broken the yokes of
          wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe! Adam wore an easy yoke in Paradise: he broke it. Himself and
          his posterity have had to wear yokes of iron ever since. Death has
          come into the world with all its train of woes. I need not enlarge
          enough that it is a case in point. Whenever a child of God, a true
          child of God, under pressure of temptation, turns aside from the right
          path, he is always made to feel that after he has broken the yoke of
          wood, he must wear a yoke of iron. John Bunyan's illustration will
          serve me well here. The two pilgrims, Christian and Hopeful, when they
          went on their way, came to a place where the road was full of flints
          that cut their feet, and there were thorns and briers in the way; and
          by-and-by one of them said, |Here is a meadow on the other side of the
          hedge, and if we were just to pass through the gap we might save a
          corner: it would be sure to come out in the way again, and so we
          should be certain to avoid the rough places.| Bunyan well describes
          how, when they got into By-path Meadow the night overtook them and the
          flood, and they wished to find the road again -- longing for it, rough
          as it had been. But Giant Despair laid hold of them, took them to his
          dungeon, and beat them within an inch or their lives, and it was only
          by mighty grace that they escaped. Take care, Christian, take care,
          though you shall not utterly perish, you may often have to go with
          broken bones through a sin. David -- ah, you recollect his sin, his
          repentance, and his life of sorrow -- how he went to his grave halting
          still, as a consequence, an entail of his crimes. Do not, therefore,
          shrink from Christian duty because it is onerous. Never, O Christian,
          turn aside from the straight road, the highway of rectitude, because
          it threatens you with shame or loss. That first loss will be vastly
          less than the after-losses you will incur by seeking to avoid it.
          Jonah would resist the word of the Lord that came to him, saying,
          |Arise, go to Nineveh,| but he had to endure the perils of a voyage,
          to encounter the fury of the tempest, and at length to sink to the
          bottom of the sea, and yet to Nineveh after all he must go. If you
          shirk a duty you will be brought up to it yet, but it will be with
          bitter pain. Be ye not as the horse or as the mule, which have no
          understanding, whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest
          they come near unto thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          The principle of our text is very applicable to all backsliders. We
          have known men that set out apparently on the road to heaven -- made a
          profession of being Christians, but after awhile they tired and
          fainted, and walked no more with us. Christianity was to them a yoke,
          and they put it off. I wonder whether they have improved their
          condition. I believe not. I will single out a person here -- may his
          conscience single him out. When you lived in the country, every
          Sabbath you went with your wife and family to the house of God. Were
          you a Methodist then? Never mind: you were very earnest, whatever
          place it was you attended. And you and your little family were very
          happy too. But you came to London, and after awhile the general idle
          habits of our London people in the morning came over you. You were
          content with one service a day. You did not seek Church-membership,
          nor cast yourself in the way of God's people. By-and-by it was not one
          service a day you attended, it was none at all; or else you called it
          religion to go and hear the music and see the religious theatricals in
          certain great houses in London. I know not if you called that
          worshipping God when you were only whiling away the hour with sensual
          gratifications. And at last you gave up all presence of being a
          Christian or of frequenting places of worship. Now I will ask you a
          question. You have got rid of the yoke of wood: how about your
          shoulders now? Your Sundays, are they very pleasant? Your family, is
          it very happy? Your mind, is it very much at ease? Oh, no! I know
          while I am talking to you you wish yourself back in the little village
          again listening to the minister's voice once more; for your Sundays
          are distasteful and comfortless, and your week days, when you think
          about your condition, are wretched and reproachful, and your children
          are not growing up in the way you could wish. Ah, sir! I pray God to
          make that yoke of iron very heavy to you. Do you long to get rid of
          that and come back and take the yoke of wood again? God of his
          infinite mercy, bring you back if you are his child, or if you are not
          of his family may he put you among his children and teach you to walk
          worthily.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have known those who have backslidden in another way. Here you are
          now. Perhaps you used to be a professor of religion, but the little
          shop was situated in a neighborhood where a good deal of trade was
          done on Sunday; you heard it said by the neighbors: |I do not know how
          it is you can shut up as you do.| The wife did not like it, nor the
          husband either: it was, however, done by slow degrees, and now it is
          always done, and you cannot both come together: there is only one can
          come, and the other must stop at home. Well, you have given up
          Christ's yoke; and Sabbath keeping seems to be too hard a thing for
          you. Are you better off? Are you really better off? Are you happier?
          Are you really happier? Something in your soul answers my question;
          you know you have a yoke of iron now, instead of a yoke of wood. May
          God help you to break away from your present slavery; and may you
          become a true heir of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be, I have here before me, one who was led into backsliding by
          a very common occurrence. Young woman, knew you once, when your face
          was radiant with happiness, while we preached Christ, and sung the
          hymns of Zion, but you married, and your marriage was not in the Lord.
          An unbelieving husband was your choice. You thought the yoke of Christ
          was hard when we reminded you of the precept, |Be ye not unequally
          yoked together with unbelievers.| You rejected the yoke of Christ. How
          have you found it since? I have seen a great many such marriages, and
          I have only seen one -- I have seen one, it is fair to say that, but I
          assert I never saw but one -- in which I could get anything like an
          acknowledgement of happiness from the ill assorted pair. Here and
          there it has happened perhaps, that God has forgiven the fault, but
          not seldom it leads to alienation of heart, and to utter departure
          from the living God, and often too, to disappointment and
          heart-breaking, and to wretchedness such as I shall not attempt to
          describe. Those that break Christ's yoke and become backsliders, shall
          find an iron yoke given in its stead.
        </p>
        <p>
          To take another class of illustrations. There are those in the world
          who will not have the yoke of Christ in the matter of religion -- they
          prefer another. For instance, there are superstitious persons who are
          not satisfied with the Bible, they want tradition. They are not
          content with the teaching of the ancient church of Christ, as we find
          it in the Acts of the Apostles, but they hanker after those modern
          upstart churches, that call themselves catholic and apostolic, and
          amuse themselves by raking up the grotesque fashions of the middle
          ages. What is the consequence? Do these perverts, who cast off the
          yoke of the true Christian religion, get an easier yoke? Ask them.
          Their penances and their mortifications; their fast days and their
          festivals; their comminations, and their celebrations -- oh, what do
          they get for them all? Is there one of them who can say he is saved?
          It is usually one of their cardinal doctrines, that no man can know he
          is saved, so that the only position they get in this life, is to slave
          on with a dim hope and to die with a grim rite, and according to one
          faith to go -- even if it were the best man in the church -- to go to
          purgatory. Ah, cheerless prospect! If I were a Roman Catholic, I
          should turn a heretic, in sheer desperation, because I would rather go
          to heaven than go to purgatory. I cannot see any advantage that is
          offered to a man: if he gets all he can get, it is not worth having.
          Who among you would slave his life away in voluntary humiliations,
          buoyed up with the cheering faith of purgatorial fires at the goal of
          your days? Where is the gain of it? And there is no church under
          heaven, except the true church of Christ, that says to men, |Believe,
          and live: lay hold on Christ, and you are saved.| We present to you in
          Christ's name the greatest boon beneath the sky, and other churches
          dare not pretend to offer it. They will only tell you that you may get
          into a state in which you may be saved perhaps, but they do not know
          quite certainly: it may be you shall fall away and perish after all,
          but as to an absolute certain salvation in perpetuity, received by an
          act of faith, they know not what it is. They put upon a yoke of iron
          grievous to their necks.
        </p>
        <p>
          And look at self-righteous men and women who try to work their own way
          to heaven. The Pharisees of old -- what a slavery their life was! Any
          man who is seeking to be saved by his good works makes himself a
          slave. He must know in his conscience that his good works are
          imperfect, and therefore he has no title, no sure, clear title to
          heaven. Only the man who takes Christ to be his wisdom, his
          righteousness, his justification, his redemption, his all and in all
          -- knows that he is saved; but he that getteth Christ hath all that
          God asks of him, he hath his sins punished in his Savior, he hath had
          the law fulfilled by his Savior, and he is thus saved. Those who will
          not have Christ, put upon their necks a horrible yoke. Oh, beware of
          superstition; beware of self-righteousness! These are iron yokes
          indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what remonstrance shall I address to the unbeliever, who says: |I
          shall believe nothing: I am a skeptic. I will not bow my neck to
          revelation|? Well, sir, you will be sure before long to bow your neck
          to some tremendous absurdity. If you can once get a skeptic to tell
          you what he does believe, you will generally find that his credulity
          is on a par with his infidelity. What he relishes he feeds on without
          question; what he dislikes he rejects, because somebody shrugged his
          shoulders at it. I have sometimes tried to muddle my way through
          chapters of German neology. Thank God I have felt this is not the way
          of life, or else certainly I should never find it, though I had a
          doctor of divinity on either side to assist me. It is too hard and
          difficult for any intellects, except they happen to be of the German
          type, to be able to find a way through its labyrinths, and they miss
          it I am afraid. The men who do not believe in God, believe that this
          world was not made at all, but grew. If you were to sow some mustard
          and cress in your garden, in the form of the initials of your boy, and
          it came up as A or B, and you took him into the garden and said: |Now,
          nobody ever sowed that seed; it grew there in that way,| you could not
          make him believe it. But these philosophical speculators believe that
          this big world, and sun, and moon, and stars, came forth without a
          creator. They can believe anything. You cannot convince the simplest
          boy in the street that somehow or other he was developed from an
          oyster, or some creature inferior to that, and yet these profound
          thinkers bow themselves down to such a belief as this. Verily, it is
          fulfilled in these days as of old, professing themselves to be wise,
          they become fools. He that will not believe the simple revelation of
          God, will presently find himself committed to systematic misbeliefs
          which distract reason, oppress the heart, and trammel the conscience.
          He wears a yoke of iron instead of a yoke of wood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still giving but a word to each case, we have hearers who, when they
          listen to the word, are haunted with reproach, but never softened with
          repentance, because of their sins. They go on hardening their necks
          and persevering in their iniquities. Impenitent sinner, mark this
          word. The day will come when inasmuch as thou hast rejected the easy
          yoke of repentance, thou wilt have to bear the iron yoke of remorse. A
          man under remorse in this world is a dreadful sight. Horrified with
          the past and alarmed with the future, yet having knees so stubborn
          that they will not bow, and blood-shot eyes that will not weep;
          because, alas! his heart is like to adamant that cannot feel. Of all
          the pangs convinced and repentant sinners bear, there are none so
          dreadful as the gloomy torment of remorse. I could unfold scenes that
          I have witnessed with my own eyes, paint the visage, and repeat the
          expressions of men dying in fell despair, but I will spare you. God
          grant that you may never have to endure that foretaste of hell upon
          earth, for such it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what shall I say to the lover of pleasure? There are those who
          say, |I shall not bear the yoke of Christ: I shall live in pleasure.|
          Pleasure in some instances means lust, and gaiety means crime. Have
          you never seen the young man who was respectably brought up in his
          youth, after leading a life of pleasure shivering at your door in
          rags? One I knew whom I had often clothed; I supposed that he was
          dead. But I saw him return loathsome in his filthiness, squalid and
          tremulous, he came begging yet again, stranger still to virtue and to
          shame. The poor soul still lives -- a life more like death than life
          -- a prodigal whom none can help because he does not return unto
          himself, nor desire to return unto his Father. London dens have in
          them many hapless profligates that are terrible warnings that men who
          seek their own pleasure put upon themselves a yoke of iron.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, what revelations the infirmaries of our hospitals, and the wards
          of our lunatic asylums might disclose of men who have played the
          wanton and rioted in sin, and have worse than a yoke of iron upon
          their necks now! Oh, if there should have come into this house some
          fallen woman, about whose neck there is that yoke of iron, that she
          rejected a mother's precepts and disdained a father's counsel --
          sister, that yoke of iron from thy neck may yet be taken; but beware
          lest it grow heavier still! There are those who would help thee escape
          from thy sin in the Christian church. Arise, and flee from this evil
          that hath made thee captive, for there is hope yet. The Christ of God
          is willing to receive the foulest of the foul. Persevere not in your
          criminal course, or that yoke of iron will grow heavier and heavier
          and heavier, and be riveted to thee, till at last thou shalt perish in
          it -- perish, and that for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          All unholy persons who break the law of God, and break away From the
          gospel's holiness, in the long run get a yoke of iron about their
          necks. There are those in this place, perhaps, who once used to sit
          with us at the Lord's table, having made a profession of religion, but
          they gave way to drink. I know that if they could break away from that
          habit now they would. If it could be done with a resolution they would
          do it at once, for somehow they love this house, and slink in still;
          and when they pass me in the streets, half-ashamed, they still
          remember him for whom they yet retain a love, and who retains a love
          for them, and would fain see them back again. But ah! ye drunkards,
          when ye once fall into this sin, how seldom are ye restored! May God
          help you! May the eternal God deliver you; for this, this iron yoke,
          is often hard to break. Resolve now, and pray also in God's name that
          you may be free. Have done with the accursed thing. God can enable you
          to come clear of it. May he do so now!
        </p>
        <p>
          Another form of the same evil not often spoken of, but quite as bad,
          is that of avarice. We have known those who professed to be
          Christians, who succeeded in business and from that time they grew
          greedy. The gold they had stuck to their fingers burned into their
          flesh, yea, into their very souls and turned their hearts to steel.
          They have no pity now for the poor, and little care for the church of
          God. Ah, sirs; what an iron yoke avarice puts upon a man's neck! You
          see a man grown old still keep scraping, yearning still for more,
          afraid that he shall lose what he has, trembling in the night lest the
          burglars should make a forcible entrance, and fearing we know not
          what. His heart is in his iron safe, and is as hard as the iron of
          which it is made. O God, forgive! for the covetous man can no more
          enter heaven than the drunkard. The covetous have no place in the
          kingdom of God. There is a mark set upon the covetous man.
          Covetousness is idolatry. It is a heavy burden -- the burden of
          avarice. Happy they who wear the yoke of Christ, for all their givings
          are a delight, and what they sacrifice is no loss to them, but becomes
          true storing -- the laying up of treasure in heaven, where neither
          moth nor rust doth corrupt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enough of this. The general principle running through every case is,
          that he who rejects the yoke of Christ bows his neck to something
          worse by far. Mark ye! The day cometh -- I know not how soon --
          perhaps as here I stand and rudely talk of these mysterious things.
          Soon may this hand be stretched? and dumb the mouth that lisps this
          faltering strain. Ere this service is over, the sight of the Son of
          Man may be seen in the clouds of heaven, and the trumpet may ring out
          loud as that of Sinai of old, |Awake, ye dead, and come to judgment.
          And ye living sinners, come ye also; for the great white throne is
          set.| And in that day the yoke of Christ will be a chain of gold about
          each believer's neck. To have served Christ will be our honor and our
          delight; but ah? the sin that once was pleasure -- how it will turn to
          misery? How the rod of your joy will become a serpent and seek to
          devour you! How will you flee away from yourselves, and that which ye
          courted and ye loved, to ask the hills to hide you, and the rocks to
          engulf you, that you may not see the face of the Redeemer. Come to him
          now, ere yet that last tremendous day dawns. I lift him up to you now.
          Whosoever looks to Christ shall live Jesus the Son of God has died,
          and he that trusts him shall not die. There is life in a look at the
          crucified One. Pardon and peace come at once to the soul that trusts
          the Savior. May ye now trust him, ere ye leave this house, and God
          shall have the glory of it, both now and evermore. Amen.<br />
