        <p>To Edessa he made his journey, and found in it a great work:</p>
        <p>
          For the king was become a labourer for the church, and was building
          it.
        </p>
        <p>The apostle Add√¶us stood in it like a builder,</p>
        <p>And King Abgar laid aside his diadem and builded with him.</p>
        <p>When apostle and king concurred the one with the other,</p>
        <p>What idol must not fall before them?</p>
        <p>Satan fled to the land of Babylon from the disciples,</p>
        <p>
          And the tale of the crucifixion had got before him to the country of
          the Chaldeans.
        </p>
        <p>
          He said, when they were making sport of the signs of the Zodiac, that
          he was nothing.<br />
