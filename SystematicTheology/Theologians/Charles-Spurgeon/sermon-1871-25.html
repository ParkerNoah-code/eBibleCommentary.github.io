          "And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith the
          Lord." -- Isaiah 66:21.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS chapter is surrounded with critical difficulties, and yet it is
          full of spiritual instruction. The verse before us is by some referred
          to Gentiles, and supposed to mean that the Lord promises that he will
          take out of the heathen nations a people whom he will make into
          priests and Levites. Others would say it points to the Jews, rejected
          for their unbelief and dispersed in judgment among all nations. When
          their own Messiah came, it was not with a devout faith, but with a
          profane imprecation, they said, "His blood be on us, and on our
          children." The curse they invoked did come upon them. The retribution
          they challenged has been meted out to them in full measure. To the
          letter it was verified. Have you never read how, when Titus was
          besieging Jerusalem, five hundred Jews were sometimes crucified in a
          day? Do you not remember that Josephus, speaking as an eye-witness,
          said, "There wanted room for crosses, and crosses for bodies"? To this
          day their children are scattered in all lands, and have found no rest
          for the soles of their feet. But they are to be restored; they are to
          be brought back to their own land, and to worship God in his holy
          mountain; and in the latter days, when they are restored, then will
          God take of them for priests and Levites. To me it appears of very
          small consequence to which this verse refers, for in Christ Jesus
          there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision; and
          this promise seems to me to stand good to the whole human race
          considered in its fallen state. "I will take of them for priests and
          for Levites, saith the Lord." Under the gospel dispensation God will
          select both out of Jews and Gentiles a chosen people, who shall stand
          before him spiritually as the priests and the Levites stood before him
          typically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think for a minute of the compass of this great promise. Evidently a
          high honor is here conferred. The connection leads us to see that not
          only a great promise but likewise a great privilege is herein implied.
          What is this privilege? It is that we shall be priests and Levites.
          Now, the priests or Levites were persons set apart to be God's
          peculiar property. When the firstborn were spared in Egypt, God
          claimed the firstborn to be his own, and he took the tribe of Levi to
          represent the firstborn; they were to be the Lord's. Though all Israel
          belonged to God, yet the tribe of Levi was especially selected and
          particularly appointed to do the service of the tabernacle of the
          congregation; and of this tribe of Levi, chief among them the house of
          Aaron, to minister in the sanctuary as priests. So now, glory be to
          God, he takes out of all nations a people that are to be peculiarly
          his own -- his own by election, as he chose them -- his own by
          redemption, as he bought them -- his own by endowment through the
          regenerating and sanctifying operations of the Holy Spirit. "They
          shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my
          jewels;" his own, therefore, before time, and after time shall close.
          "I will take of them for priests and for Levites, saith the Lord."
          Being thus set apart as the Lord's property, the priests and Levites
          lived only for divine service. While others were engaged with their
          trade or upon their farm, the Levites were attending to the tabernacle
          or temple, and the priests in their courts were slaughtering bullocks
          and lambs, and offering them to God; or they had other duties of a
          kindred order, by reason of the charge given them of all the hallowed
          things of the children of Israel. Anyhow, it was in sacred things that
          they were occupied; so now, it is the duty of every man to serve the
          Lord; but, alas! man will not; and therefore God takes unto himself a
          people out of all nations, and kindreds, and tongues, and he ordains
          them to stand before him continually, to wait on his commands, and to
          do his bidding. Thus he puts upon their shoulders his easy yoke and
          weights them with his light burden, and they become his willing
          servants -- that their life may be for his glory, and that their
          desire, as well as their duty, may be to serve him with heart and
          strength so long as they have any being. In this sense, then, happy is
          the man who is set apart to the divine service, a priest and a Levite
          unto God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further than this, the priests and the Levites enjoyed the privilege
          of drawing near to God -- nearer than the rest of the people in that
          typical dispensation. While the people stood without, the Levites are
          busy inside. One of them, the chief of the tribe, and the High Priest
          before the Lord for all the tribes, was permitted and commanded to go
          into the most holy place within the veil; and you know that the holy
          places made with hands are figures of the true, even of heaven itself.
          In like manner there is a people to be found on earth at this day whom
          God has chosen to draw near unto him. In Christ Jesus they who
          sometimes were afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ. The
          same precious blood that is applied to their conscience is sprinkled
          on the mercy-seat; therefore they have access to the Father. Oh! happy
          they, who, like the priests and Levites, love dwelling in the Lord's
          house, and praising him, who can say --
        </p>
        <p>"Here, Lord, I find settled rest</p>
        <p>While others go and come;</p>
        <p>No more a stranger or a guest,</p>
        <p>But like a child at home."</p>
        <p>
          Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place in all generations: we are a
          people near unto thee made nigh by affinity with the Son of God,
          brought nigh by the blood, led nigh by the Spirit of God, kept nigh,
          and rejoicing to be nigh -- for herein is our honor and comfort, to be
          near unto God; made priests and Levites, because claimed as God's
          portion, prepared for God's service, and admitted to a near
          familiarity with him. There are some such to be found in this place
          to-day, whom God has taken from among the Gentiles to be priests and
          Levites unto him. But priests and Levites had two works to do:
          something to do towards God for men, and something to do towards men
          for God. They were engaged to do something towards God for men, and so
          they offered the sacrifices that were brought to the door of the
          tabernacle, whether according to the general ordinances, or to any
          special vows. Spiritually minded, they were much engaged in
          intercession for the rest of Israel. So there is a people to be found
          this day who offer unto God acceptable prayer and praise, and in
          answer to their prayer, unnumbered blessings come down upon the sons
          of men. I trust there are some here that have power with God in
          prayer. Ye are the king's remembrancers; ye make mention of his name,
          and keep not silence; ye cry to God for Sodom, and yet more hopefully
          ye cry to God for Jerusalem: your prayer ceaseth not, and God's grace
          and favor always follow it. In this sense God is constantly taking
          out, even from amongst the vilest of the vile, a people whom he makes
          to be priests and Levites for men towards himself. Another part of
          their office consisted in speaking for God to the people; "For the
          priest's lips should keep knowledge." As for the Levites, they were as
          ushers in the schools and tutors in the families of Israel. Amongst
          the Levites were found those scribes who became the instructors of the
          people, the copyists of the law, and the expounders of its statutes
          and ordinances; ministers who opened up to the people, as Ezra did,
          the knotty points of the old covenant, and expounded the word. So not
          all of us in the same degree, but all of us in a measure, are to be
          teachers of God's revealed truth, even as he has taught us; and he has
          in this place, and throughout the world, taken out a certain company
          whom he has made to speak as his mouth to the sons of men -- men of
          his own choosing, and his own sending, who are as priests and Levites
          for his name. They claim no priestly office as though they could
          absolve the sinner: they leave that with Christ, the firstborn of his
          Father's house, and the chief rabbi of all the Lord's chosen seed, but
          as teachers and instructors; they are in the midst of the world the
          priests and Levites of God. I have thus shown what the promise means.
          God will take out of the Jews and Gentiles a people whom he will bring
          very near to himself, and make use of for his own sacred purposes. The
          great point is this. It seems to be mentioned here as a matter of
          surprise that God should take any of them -- of the persons here
          mentioned -- of the sinful, backsliding, tranegressing Jews, or of the
          blinded, dark, benighted, heathen Gentiles -- that he should take
          them, and make them to be priests and Levites before him. Now, that is
          parallel to the fact that God does take some of the most unlikely
          persons, who seem to be the most unsuitable of all, and make these to
          be his faithful and honored servants among the sons of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I shall first notice that fact; then, the reason for it; and
          then, the lessons from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, I notice that God does, to the astonishment of men, TAKE
          SOME WHOM HE MAKES BE PRIESTS AND LEVITES TO HIMSELF. This is a fact.
          How, there are priests and Levites that God never took. There have
          been such in all ages. There were those in the days of Aaron who said:
          "Ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi;" and when they stood
          before the Lord with their censers, "the earth opened her mouth and
          swallowed them up." There were those in the days of Elias. When he
          stood by the altar of the Lord, the priests of Baal, in great numbers,
          stood by their altar, offering prayer to Baal. Ye know how God had no
          regard to their sacrifice. They were the church established by law;
          but, for all that, Elias the Nonconformist, put them to the rout, and
          maintained the worship of the invisible God of Israel firm and
          faithful to the end. So in our Savior's days there were priests and
          Levites -- men taught and instructed in the law, and these were the
          very men who conspired together against him, who took counsel how they
          might put him to death, and who stirred up the people to say, "Not
          this man, but Barabbas." And on down to this present day there are
          those legitimate priests and Levites -- at least, those who call
          themselves so -- whom God hath never taken, upon whom he hath never
          laid his hand, upon whom his Holy Spirit hath never descended; who
          speak, but he speaks not by them; and who administer ordinances, but
          he gives not grace to the ordinances by their hands. And such there
          always will be, doubtless, till Christ cometh, but they are not spoken
          of in the text, for the text says, "I will take," and it is only those
          whom God himself takes and chooses among men that are the real priests
          and Levites that serve him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, according to the text, men have nothing to do with the
          selection; for here it is said, "I will also take of them" -- not
          "their parents shall bring them up to it;" not "those who shall be
          looked out as the most fit and proper men on account of some natural
          bent and bias, or gift and talent, but I will take." God's priesthood
          in the world is a priesthood of his own choosing of his own setting
          apart, of his own anointing. "He hath made us kings and priests unto
          God." The church is a royal priesthood, not of man, neither by man,
          nor of the will of man, nor of blood, nor of birth: it is of God's
          choosing. This sacred and consecrated band of priests and Levites, and
          all that serve God effectually and acceptably, are men whom he has
          himself chosen to the work. He himself hath done it, and only his own
          will as been consulted in the matter. In their case, it appears from
          the text, that whatever was unfit in their character has been overcome
          by divine grace. "I will also take of them for priests and for
          Levites, saith the Lord." If God takes them for Levites, he makes them
          Levites; if he chooses them for priests, he makes them priests. So,
          glory be to his name, when he chose you, my dear brother, when he
          chose you, my dear sister, to be his servants, to be his priests and
          his Levites, he gave you the grace you wanted. He found in you no
          natural fitness, no suitability, but in fitness for sin, a suitability
          to go astray, and to become a brand for the burning; but if there be a
          fitness in you to serve him on earth and in heaven, it is his grace
          that has done it. It is his grace speaking in all its wondrous majesty
          -- "I will take of them for priests and for Levites" -- which has
          effected in you the great transformation, making in you all things
          new, and thus qualifying you to become the servants of the Most High.
          In some persons this natural inaptitude and unfitness for the Lord's
          work has been more apparent than in others. They have been men of
          rough exterior, unhallowed life; their education neglected, their
          passions wild and lawless, their tastes low and grovelling; yet, for
          all that, God has taken from amongst such men some who in an especial
          manner, even beyond the rest of God's servants have become as priests
          and Levites unto him. He has sometimes selected women, in whom there
          seemed to be no suitability for his grace, to make them matrons in the
          church; and men, who seemed to be ringleaders in the service of Satan,
          to make them very captains of the Lord's hosts. They had no inbred
          faculty, no natural genius that qualified them to become the
          instruments of righteousness: as I have said before, it was the
          reverse of this. Their career was not foreshadowed by any instinct
          with which they were born; nor was it aided by any training they
          received in childhood. The God who chose them gave the grace they
          required at their second birth, and subdued all the evil that was in
          them by the rich discipline of his spiritual operations, in order to
          qualify them for efficient service. I thank God, I do remember in my
          soul some dear brethren who have been made eminent ministers of the
          gospel, of whom, if any one had said they would ever have preached the
          gospel, none would have believed it. Not to mention the living, the
          men of to-day, go back to the early days of John Newton, an earnest
          preacher, a famous evangelist, not to add a sweet poet. Almost a model
          for the ministry was John Newton, but once a blasphemer and injurious.
          Turn farther back, to John Bunyan, on the village green, with his
          tip-cat on the Sabbath-day, with all a drunkard's vices and sins, and
          foul-mouthed in his profanity: yet John Bunyan becomes an eminent
          proclaimer of the gospel, and the author of a matchless allegory which
          has served to guide many a pilgrim to heaven. Turn farther back, to
          Luther, most earnest as a Romanist for all the letter of the law,
          diligent in every ceremony, superstitious to a high degree, yet
          afterwards the bold proclaimer of the gospel of the grace of God. Turn
          to Augustine, in youth of corrupt and vicious propensities, according
          to his own confession, to the grief of his mother Monica, yet called
          by sovereign grace to be one of the fathers of the church, and a
          notable exponent of sound doctrine. Look yet farther back to the
          apostle Paul, breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the
          disciples of the Lord, like a huge wild beast, making havoc of the
          church, but suddenly struck down, and almost as suddenly raised up a
          new man, and ordained (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ
          and God the Father) to be a chosen vessel unto Christ, to bear his
          name unto the Gentiles. "I will also take of them," the most unlikely
          and unfit, according to human judgment. "I will also take of them for
          priests and for Levites unto me." And where the service has not taken
          the form of preaching, we can remember some whom God hath made eminent
          in prayer. Never account prayer second to preaching. No doubt prayer
          in the Christian church is as precious as the utterance of the gospel.
          To speak to God for men is a part of the Christian priesthood that
          should never be despised. Surely I have heard some prayers of those
          whom none would ever have expected to pray, such as I have not heard
          from those who, from their youth up, have been accustomed to the
          language of devotion -- moved with energy and full of fervor, like
          Elijah. Or, shall I say it, they have become in spiritual force nerved
          as Samson was with physical strength. In their prayers they have
          seemed to take hold of the pillars of the temple of Satan, and pull it
          down upon their enemies; they have been so mighty as to wrestle with
          God and prevail. God has taken of them -- that is, even of the
          prayerless, and the careless, and the blaspheming -- and he has made
          these to be priests and Levites unto him. And in all other holy
          service I think I can recollect eminent men who out of weakness were
          made strong, from simpletons they were changed into sages, or, rescued
          from the dregs of infamy, they became paragons of virtue. In their
          unregeneracy as bitter fruit, apples of Sodom, that crumbled into dust
          and turned to ashes, yet so transformed by the renewing of their
          minds, that they bore the richest clusters of choicest fruit to the
          praise and glory of the Great Husbandman. "I will also take of them
          for priests and for Levites, saith the Lord." There is the fact. You
          need not that I enlarge upon it. While a false priesthood still lives
          (and always will), God has his elect people, who are his royal
          priesthood among the sons of men, who are discharging regal functions
          and sacred offices among the sons of men in his name, and before his
          face; and these he oftentimes takes out from the least likely of
          mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now, secondly, as to THE REASON OF THE FACT. Does not he do
          this to display his mercy -- his great and infinite mercy? that those
          who have provoked him to wrath should become the men in whom he should
          show forth his lovingkindness -- men to be pardoned, men to be washed,
          to be sanctified -- and then men to be put in trust of the gospel of
          Jesus Christ -- does not this reveal and illustrate the high
          prerogative of sovereign grace? "Unto me," saith the apostle, "who am
          less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should
          preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ." It is a
          great grace to be permitted to preach the gospel. I have sometimes
          said to you that when the prodigal came back to his father, and was
          received into his father's house, no earthly parent, though he had
          quite forgiven him all the wildness of his son's adventure, could
          wholly forget the waywardness of his disposition. He might condone the
          past without confiding in him for the future. If it were needful to
          send one of the sons to market with a bag of money, the good old
          father would, in all probability, say to himself, "I will send the
          elder son with it: he is better to be trusted; I would hardly like to
          put such a responsibility upon the young lad who has so lately been
          reclaimed." I can fancy, without uttering a word to his younger son he
          would, discreetly (as you would say), trust the other with any weighty
          concerns. But our heavenly Father -- oh, how he forgives us! He leaves
          no back reckonings, for though we used to be such sinners, some of us,
          and so injurious, after he forgave us, he committed to our charge not
          merely silver and gold, the perishable resources of time, but the
          priceless treasure of the gospel of Jesus Christ: he allowed us to go
          and tell to others "the unsearchable riches of Christ." See ye not the
          impure giving, lessons on chastity, the intemperate teaching chastity?
          and mark ye not how he who persecuted the disciples in times past, now
          preacheth the faith he once destroyed? Oh, what deep mercy there is in
          Jesus! What wonderful grace there is in giving his commissions, that
          those that cursed him themselves should intercede with him for others;
          that those that despised him should be permitted to honor him; that
          those who broke his Sabbaths should nevertheless be helpful to his
          people in hallowing the Lord's-day; that those who despised his word,
          and put it behind their back, should be the men to open it, and
          display the sweetness of it to their fellow men! Is not this grace?
          Methinks every time Paul preached Jesus Christ he would say to
          himself: "I used to call him the Nazarene; I abhorred him and used
          opprobrious language, but herein is great mercy, boundless mercy, that
          he should take me to be his servant, permit me to labor for his people
          and suffer for his sake."
        </p>
        <p>
          Next to this, do you not think that the Lord loves to display his
          power? Men who are tamers of wild beasts, will frequently, when they
          have subdued a lion, take a delight in showing to the people how
          obedient that lion will be to them, and how every word that the
          lion-tamer chooses to say, it will regard and pay attention to. Thus,
          when the Lord takes a great sinner, after he has tamed him, removed
          his heart of stone, and given him a heart of flesh, he desires to show
          how, without the use of the whip, without a threatening look or an
          angry word, he causes his enemy to become his diligent servant, his
          earnest friend. O brethren, it shows the power of love on a man when
          he is so broken down that the things he sneered at he now preaches
          with all his might. Surely it showed the power of divine grace when
          Paul avowed Christ openly, and vehemently preached -- exposing himself
          to persecution and death -- that same gospel which his soul had
          previously nauseated; yea, which his zeal, full of bitterness, had
          kindled to exterminate. God takes great sinners, and then appoints and
          qualifies them to be priests and Levites, in order that he might show
          the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, does not God do this to show his sovereignty? Can we ever
          forget that attribute of the Almighty? Divine grace, while it comes
          freely to us, is dispensed freely by God, according to the good
          pleasure of his will. I should like to hear that text thundered
          throughout Christendom: "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,
          and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion." No man
          hath any right to the mercy of God. We have all sinned ourselves into
          outlaw: all the rights we have are the right to be condemned, and the
          right to be cast into hell; all the rights of man that he can appeal
          to God for in equity are merged in the wrongs for which he is
          responsible. If the Lord have mercy, it is his own will to do it: he
          can withhold it if it pleases him; so he selects the most degraded,
          those that have gone farthest from him, and takes them into his
          church; nay, more, advances them into eminent positions of service in
          that church, that all his people may know that the Most High ruleth in
          the armies of heaven and Amongst the inhabitants of this earth, and
          none can stay his hand, or say unto him, "What doest thou?" He lifteth
          up the poor from the dunghill, and setteth him among princes, even
          among the princes of his people. His mercy, power, and sovereignty are
          displayed when he takes of them to be priests and Levites.
        </p>
        <p>
          But does he not thereby secure to himself the most loving service? I
          have sometimes thought (I hope I am not censorious) as I have observed
          with pain the superficiality of a great deal of what is called
          ministry in these days -- that kind of superficiality, I mean, in
          which little is said about the corruption and depravity of the heart;
          little about the experience of the child of God when under the law;
          little, far too little, about the glory of that grace that takes such
          worms of the dust to make them one with Christ. I have often thought
          that this avoidance of, not to say this aversion to, deep ploughing,
          may be accounted for by the fact that the preachers themselves
          probably had not been suffered to go very far into outward sin; had
          never had any very deep law-work upon their souls; never had much
          awakening of conscience, nor felt much of the powers of the world to
          come. They got their religion very easily; and so knowing little of
          soul-humbling sensations themselves, they could not go very deeply
          into the experience of the children of God. When the Lord calls a
          grievous sinner, to make a gracious example of him, it is not so. The
          man who has done business in deep waters knows what sin means;
          tortured with a sense of his own crimes, he has been like those
          wretched culprits who surrender themselves to justice, because their
          conscience makes liberty chafe them. He knows what pardon means, for
          he has found peace after great bitterness, and got remission after the
          gnawings of despair; he knows what the conflicts of God's people are,
          for he has had many fierce encounters with the lusts that beset him
          within, and the temptations that assailed him from without. And now,
          when he opens his mouth, the testimony he bears is from an inwrought
          experience: he speaks of things which he has tasted and handled of the
          good Word of God. John Newton, to whom I referred just now, could not
          do otherwise than livingly and lovingly preach the Word of God. You
          could not have brooked from him a dainty essay or a flowery sermon,
          because nothing else would have consorted and accorded with his
          experience, but a faithful tale of the way the Lord had led him, and a
          forcible exposition of what the Lord had taught him. He had been such
          a sinner, that it must be grace which saved him; and he would have
          belied all his inward feelings if he had not proclaimed the grace of
          God. And so with Bunyan: if he had not tearfully wept over sinners and
          preached Jesus Christ in his fullness, as the Savior of Jerusalem
          sinners, he would have been opposing all that animated his own breast,
          and all that burned and glowed for utterance. God, therefore, takes
          some of these men who have gone far astray, that he might have
          warm-hearted, intensely earnest men, who must proclaim the gospel,
          because they have felt its power; who love much because they have had
          much forgiven; who preach of grace, because they need much grace, and
          lift up high the brazen serpent amongst the sin-bitten hosts of men,
          because they have been sin-bitten themselves and do remember it; they
          have looked and been cured, and they still remember the cure, and
          rejoice in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another reason why the Lord takes the vilest of men to make them the
          saintliest is, that he might openly triumph over Satan. How the devil
          must feel defeated when such a man as Saul is taken straight away from
          persecuting to preaching! Surely, it makes Satan bite his chains and
          gnash his teeth when he loses his servants so. Just when he has
          trained them up, and got them into fine condition for doing mischief,
          in comes the officer of divine grace, arrests them, and changes their
          hearts. You know none ever do the devil so much mischief as those who
          once did him service. They know the ins and outs of his castle --
          where to attack it. They understand so much of his devices and
          tactics, that they become all the more powerful adversaries when they
          are converted. All heaven rings with rapture when a great sinner is
          saved; and all hell howls with dismay when one of the arch host bows
          down to kiss the feet of Christ, and receive the mercy of God. Glory
          be to God when he takes those that would have been deepest damned, and
          sets them highest among the saved on earth to be priests and Levites
          unto him. By these means also he secures another end: he encourages
          poor penitents; for when a sinner, under a sense of sin, meets with a
          brother in Christ, who was like himself once, but is now living near
          to God and serving him acceptably, he is much encouraged. "Why," he
          thinks to himself, "is this how God receives sinners when they turn to
          him? Perhaps he will receive me." And if he gets into conversation
          with one of those whom God has made priests and Levites, he says,
          "Tell me what the Lord has done for thy soul." And the minister being
          a man of like passions, and having had like experience, delights to
          describe the works and ways of God with hardened sinners and old
          offenders and then the man who is seeking finds in the other a guide
          who is touched with the feeling of his infirmity, is very helpful to
          him, and much blessed of God to enter into the secrets of his heart,
          and lead him to the cross. If there be here some great rebel against
          God, I think he ought to take encouragement thence to turn unto the
          Lord and live, for surely, when God so treats his most defiant enemies
          as to make them his most honored ministers, there should be some
          comfort for the great sinner to seek the Lord while yet he waits to be
          gracious.
        </p>
        <p>
          And do not you think this is done very much for the encouragement of
          the church of God? I know, as myself one of its humble members I often
          need to be solaced by seeing what God's hand can do. We ought to walk
          by faith, and so I trust we do; but when we see sinners converted, it
          gives zest to our fellowship and zeal to our enterprise. We all of us
          feel the happier for it. I hardly expect to see so many converts in
          the Tabernacle as there used to be. We have had so very many brought
          to God, that those of you who are left, I almost fear, have resisted
          overmuch the wooings and warnings of love divine. Indeed, there are so
          few comparatively left, that we have not the opportunities we once had
          when the mass of the congregation was not converted. Peradventure
          there are few of you whom God has not blessed. But I do long to see a
          fresh ingathering of converts: it would make my heart glad, and it
          would make all the church glad if we heard of some great sinners being
          saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pray God sometimes that he would save a great multitude of the
          priests of the church of Rome and the church of England. Be did in the
          olden times bring a great multitude of the priests to believe the
          gospel, and why should he not yet again? If he wills to call to
          himself some of the lowest of the low, and the vilest of the vile, and
          make them wonders of his grace, his omnipotent fiat shall be instantly
          obeyed. Why should he not? Why should he not? He has done so: why
          should he not again? He has done so, I say, and the text says, "I will
          take of them for priests and for Levites." Why should he not go on to
          take from strange quarters still a people that shall serve him? Does
          he not say "I will"? Suppose it should ever come to this, as some say
          it will, that the churches, many of them, should desert the old
          truths, and the ministers become dumb dogs that cannot bark, and one
          by one their testimony should be silent, and every candlestick should
          be taken out of its place, and the whole head should be sick, and the
          whole heart faint, and Zion be under a cloud, and there should be none
          to help her, and none to lift up the banner for the truth? What then?
          Why, then God would arise, and take again from the fishermen in their
          boats new apostles, and from the lowest dens of iniquity, and the
          worst haunts of vice, from the saloons of frivolity where the rich
          resort, and from the chambers of commerce and the palaces of
          merchandise where buyers and sellers make their contracts, he would
          take a fresh staff of men. Out of the roughest material he can make
          the finest fabric, out of the newest recruits he can raise the noblest
          regiment, to show forth his praise, to do his work, and to secure
          victory for his cause. If some were unworthy holders of his vineyard,
          and brought him no revenue, he would put aside these wicked men, and
          send forth fresh laborers, and give his vineyard unto others, for he
          will get glory unto his name; he "will take of them for priests and
          for Levites." Never say it is a dark day; never say God has forgotten
          his church; never give way to despairing fits, and dream of horrible
          times coming, that yet are not to come. Verily, "all flesh shall see
          the salvation of God," and the glory of God shall be revealed, and all
          flesh shall see it; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. He shall
          arise, and have mercy upon Zion; he will build up her walls, heal all
          her breaches, and once again shall she be the joy of the whole earth.
          Take heart and comfort, God can find his servants anywhere.
          Omnipotence hath instruments where we see them not. He "will take of
          them for priests and for Levites."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Lastly, WHAT IS THE LESSON FROM THIS? I address myself to those
          of you especially, my dear brethren and sisters, whom the grace of God
          has taken to make priests and Levites unto God. You are near to him:
          you serve him. What effect should this have upon you? First, remember
          what state you where in before God's grace took you in hand. Then
          consider what you are called to be; you are made priests and Levites.
          Then ask yourself what you would soon become if his grace were to
          depart from you? Why, as you were before, only with this difference,
          that the evil spirit in you would take unto himself seven other
          spirits more wicked than the first, and enter in and dwell there, and
          your last state would be worse than the first. Watch then, watch!
          watch! God, his grace enabling you to watch, will preserve you to the
          end. Am I a priest and Levite -- a holy vessel set apart before God,
          serving at his altar, bringing prayers and praises to him? Ah! yes, I
          may be a priest and a Levite, but I should be a devil if his grace did
          not prevent. O watch, watch, watch! "What I say unto you I say unto
          all, Watch."
        </p>
        <p>
          And oh, what humility this vocation of God should produce! However
          high we may be raised, we must remember whence the honor cometh. For
          this promotion cometh neither from the east nor from the west -- it is
          God's gift. Thou, a blasphemer and injurious; thou, a careless,
          godless, Christless man, now raised to be a servant of God, to wait in
          his courts, and honor his name, be thankful that thou art lifted so
          high, but wonder, and fear and tremble, for all the goodness that God
          has made to pass before thee. What am I, and what is my father's
          house, that thou hast brought me hitherto; to pray and my prayer to be
          heard, yet not worthy to lift mine eyes to the place where thine honor
          dwelleth; to have thy holy Spirit dwelling in me, and yet not worthy
          that thou shouldst come under my roof! Be humble brother: it will help
          you to watch. Watching is done best in a lowly manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          And since he hath taken us for priests and for Levites, let us do
          every office heartily as unto the Lord. If others in this world can
          serve God coldly, yet, my brethren and sisters, you and I cannot
          afford to do so. We were such sinners, that if we have been forgiven,
          we must love him. Those that had little sin to be cleansed may not
          have much love to lavish on their Redeemer. Not so with me or thee:
        </p>
        <p>"Love I most; I've more forgiven;</p>
        <p>I'm a miracle of grace."</p>
        <p>
          Those that had some good principles instilled into them by early
          training or some sort of preparation to receive the gospel, may not
          feel their deep indebtedness to the wonderful working of the Spirit;
          but those of us who were steeped in sin, and hardened in heart, when
          we are saved must magnify the power of God, and moved by that feeling
          we must serve him heartily with our whole spirit, soul, and body. A
          man that feels what grace has done for him cannot help throwing his
          whole soul into it. I used to know a man whom I often heard swear --
          on the other side of the river, in the town where I was -- and when
          converted I recollect his prayers. They used to trouble us rather:
          they were so loud. It was not everybody that knew the reason why. He
          had been so accustomed to swear loud that he could not help praying
          loud; and when a man has been very loud for the devil, he cannot help
          being loud for Christ. Some of those dear Methodist brethren who cry
          out, "Amen!" so stentoriously, do it, I hope, because they feel the
          love of God in Christ on account of what great things have been done
          for them. Let those go the common track of service that have gone the
          common track of sin, but let those serve the Lord with all their
          heart, and mind, and strength, that have been unusual sinners. Bring
          your alabaster box, O great sinner, break it on his blessed head that
          pardoned you. Wash his feet with your tears, and wipe them with the
          hairs of your head, for where extraordinary love has been experienced,
          extraordinary love ought to be the outgrowth, and extraordinary
          service ought to be the consequence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again, if the Lord has taken of us to be his priests and Levites,
          let us serve him with great thankfulness and joy. If any people should
          be glad, I am sure it is those people that feel the aboundings of his
          mercy in forgiveness, having heard those glad tidings, as it were,
          from the lips of Jesus himself. "Thy sins which are many are all
          forgiven thee: go in peace." They have something always to stimulate
          their gratitude and regale them with sunshine. "I am very poor," saith
          one, "but, never mind, poor as I am, I am not a drunkard or a swearer
          now; I feel weak and sickly in body, it may be; never mind that; I
          have not the burden of sin upon my soul." Or, "I am unknown, quite
          unknown. I have nobody to come and see me. Never mind that; I am known
          to God. I am poor and needy, yet the Lord thinketh upon me. My great
          wounds have been healed in Jesus' precious blood." Why, you have
          always cause to be glad, my dear brother and sister, if you have had
          your sins forgiven: you have a fountain opened in your soul of love to
          Christ and joy in God, quite as surely as there is a fountain open for
          the cleansing of your sin in the side of Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          So let me close, by saying, surely we ought to serve God with great
          confidence in him. If he has made us priests and Levites to him, why
          then we may trust him to do anything. "He that spared not his own Son,
          but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely
          give us all things?" He that has done so much for us, as to take us
          out of the miry clay, and set our feet upon a rock, and put his gospel
          into our hearts, may be trusted for the rest. Suppose a man owed you
          ten thousand pounds and a trifling sum besides for a small promissory
          note he had given you; if he paid you the ten thousand pounds, you
          might trust him to meet the little bill when it fell due. And when the
          Lord has given us so much, so infinitely much, the little that remains
          -- for it is comparatively little -- ought to cause us no anxieties or
          doubts, no fears or misgivings. "Because thou hast been my help,
          therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice." He who found me
          a sinner, made me a pardoned sinner, put me among his children, and
          numbered me among his honored servants, has not done all this to
          desert me at last and put me to shame. He has not been at this expense
          with his poor servant to fling him away after all. No, glory be to his
          name: he will continue his work till he has perfected it. He is the
          God that performeth all things for me, and in him will I rest, and not
          be ashamed, world without end. Amen.
