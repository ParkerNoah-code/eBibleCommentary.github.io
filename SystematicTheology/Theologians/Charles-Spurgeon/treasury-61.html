        Strange that the painful events in David's life should end in enriching
        the repertoire of the national minstrelsy. Out of a sour, ungenerous
        soil spring up the honey bearing flowers of psalmody. Had he never been
        cruelly hunted by Saul, Israel and the church of God in after ages would
        have missed this song.
        <i>
          The music of the sanctuary is in no small degree indebted to the
          trials of the saints. Affliction is the tuner of the harps of
          sanctified songsters. </i
        ><b> <p align="justify">Destroy not.</p></b> Another "destroy not"
        Psalm. Whom God preserves Satan cannot destroy. The Lord can even
        preserve the lives of his prophets by the very ravens that would
        naturally pick out their eyes. David always found a friend to help him
        when his case was peculiarly dangerous, and that friend was in his
        enemy's household; in this instance it was Michal, Saul's daughter, as
        on former occasions it had been Jonathan, Saul's son.
        <b> <p align="justify">A Michtam of David.</p></b>This is the Fifth of
        the Golden Secrets of David: God's chosen people have many such. When
        Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him. Great efforts were
        made to carry the Psalms away to other authors and seasons than those
        assigned in the headings, it being the fashion just now to prove one's
        learning by disagreeing with all who have gone before. Perhaps in a few
        years the old titles will be as much reverenced as they are now
        rejected. There are spasms in these matters, and in many other things
        among the would be "intellectuals" of the schools. We are not anxious to
        show our readiness at conjecture, and therefore are content with reading
        this Psalm in the light of the circumstances here mentioned; it does not
        seem unsuitable to any verse, and in some the words are very appropriate
        to the specified occasion.

          in verses 3-4 he complains of his woes, <br />
          and again in verse 5 he prays. <br />
          Here he inserts a Selah, and ends one portion of his song. <br />
          In verses 6-7 he renews his complaint, <br />
          in verses 8-10 declares his confidence in God, <br />
          and in verses 11-13 lifts up his heart in prayer; <br />
          closing another part of his Psalm with Selah.<br />
          Then he prays again in verses 14-15, <br />
          and afterwards betakes himself to singing.<br />

        They were all round the house with the warrant of authority, and a force
        equal to the carrying of it out. He was to be taken dead or alive, well
        or ill, and carried to the slaughter. No prowess could avail him to
        break the cordon of armed men, neither could any eloquence stay the hand
        of his bloody persecutor.
        <p align="justify">
          He was taken like a bird in a net, and no friend was near to set him
          free. Unlike the famous starling, he did not cry, "I cannot get out,"
          but his faith uttered quite another note. Unbelief would have
          suggested that prayer was a waste of breath, but not so thought the
          godly man, for he makes it his sole resort. He cries for deliverance
          and leaves ways and means with his God.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Defend me from them that rise up against me.</p></b
        >
        Saul was a king, and therefore sat in high places, and used all his
        authority to crush David; the persecuted one therefore beseeches the
        Lord to set him on high also, only in another sense. He asks to be
        lifted up, as into a lofty tower, beyond the reach of his adversary.
        <p align="justify">
          Note how he sets the title, <i>My God</i>, over against the word,
          <i>my enemies</i>. This is the right method of effectually catching
          and quenching the fiery darts of the enemy upon the shield of faith.
          God is our God, and therefore deliverance and defense are ours.

            Verse 2. Deliver me from the workers of iniquity.
          </p></b
        >
        Saul was treating him very unjustly, and besides that was pursuing a
        tyrannical and unrighteous course towards others, therefore David the
        more vehemently appeals against him. Evil men were in the ascendant at
        court, and were the ready tools of the tyrant, against these also he
        prays.
        <p align="justify">
          Bad men in a bad cause may be pleaded against without question. When a
          habitation is beset by thieves, the godly man of the house rings the
          alarm bell; and in these verses we may hear it ring out loudly,
          "deliver me," "defend me," "deliver me," "save me."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Saul had more cause to fear than David had, for the invincible weapon
          of prayer was being used against him, and Heaven was being aroused to
          give him battle.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">And save me from bloody men.</p></b> As David
        remembers how often Saul had sought to assassinate him, he knows what he
        has to expect from that quarter and from the king's creatures and
        minions who were watching for him. David represents his enemy in his
        true colors before God; the bloodthirstiness of the foe is a fit reason
        for the interposition of the righteous God, for the Lord abhors all
        those who delight in blood.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 3. For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul.
          </p></b
        >
        They were in ambush for the godly man's life. He knew their design and
        cried to God to be rescued from it. Like wild beasts they crouched, and
        waited to make the fatal spring; but their victim used effectual means
        to baffle them, for he laid the matter before the Lord.
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            While the enemy lies waiting in the posture of a beast, we wait
            before God in the posture of prayer, for God waits to be gracious to
            us and terrible towards our foes.
          </p> </i
        ><b> <p align="justify">The mighty are gathered against me.</p></b> None
        of them were absent from the muster when a saint was to be murdered.
        They were too fond of such sport to be away. The men at arms who ought
        to have been fighting their country's battles, are instead thereof
        hunting a quiet citizen; the gigantic monarch is spending all his
        strength to slay a faithful follower.

        >He appeals to Jehovah that he had done no ill. His only fault was, that
        he was too valiant and too gracious, and was, besides, the chosen of the
        Lord, therefore the envious king could not rest until he had washed his
        hands in the blood of his too popular rival.
        <p align="justify">
          We shall always find it to be a great thing to be innocent; if it does
          not carry our cause before an earthly tribunal, it will ever prove the
          best of arguments in the <i>court of conscience</i>, and a standing
          consolation when we are under persecution.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Note the repetition of his declaration of integrity. David is sure of
          his innocence. He dares repeat the plea.

            Verse 4. They run and prepare themselves without my fault.

        They are all alive and active, they are swift to shed blood. They
        prepare and use their best tactics; they besiege me in my house, and lay
        their ambushes as for some notable enemy. They come up fully armed to
        the attack, and assail me with all the vigor and skill of a host about
        to storm a castle; and all for no cause, but out of wicked malice. So
        quick are they to obey their cruel master, that they never stay to
        consider whether their errand is a good one or not; they run at once,
        and buckle on their harness as they run. To be thus wickedly attacked is
        a great grief. To a brave man the danger causes little distress of mind
        compared with the injustice to which he is subjected. It was a cruel and
        crying shame that such a hero as David should be hounded down as if he
        were a monster, and beset in his house like a wild beast in its den.
        <b> <p align="justify">Awake to help me, and behold.</p></b> When others
        go to sleep, keep watch, O God. Put forth your might. Arouse from your
        inaction. Only look at your servant's sad condition and your hand will
        be sure to deliver me.
        <p align="justify">
          We see how thorough was the psalmist's faith in the mercy of his Lord,
          for he is satisfied that if the Lord does but look on his case it will
          move his active compassion.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 5. You</p></b>, yourself, work for me
        personally, for the case needs your interposition.

        assailed, and cannot help myself. O Lord, ever living, God Almighty,
        able to rescue me; the God of Israel, pledged by covenant to redeem your
        oppressed servant; awake to visit all the heathen, arouse your holy
        mind, bestow your sacred energies, punish the heathen among your Israel,
        the false hearted who say they are Jews and are not, but do lie.
        <p align="justify">
          And when you are about the business, let all the nations of your
          enemies, and all the heathenish people at home and abroad know that
          you are upon circuit, judging and punishing. It is the mark of a
          thoughtful prayer that the titles which are in it applied to God are
          appropriate, and are, as it were, congruous to the matter, and fitted
          to add force to the argument.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Shall Jehovah endure to see his people oppressed? Shall the God
          Almighty permit his enemies to exult over his servant? Shall the
          faithful God of a chosen people leave his chosen to perish? The name
          of God is, even in a literal sense, a fortress and high tower for all
          his people.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What a forceful petition is contained in the words, "<b
            >awake to visit</b
          >"! Actively punish, in wisdom judge, with force chastise.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Be not merciful to any wicked transgressors.</p></b
        >
        Be merciful to them as men, but not as transgressors; if they continue
        hardened in their sin, do not wink at their oppression. To wink at sin
        in transgressors will be to leave the righteous under their power,
        therefore do not pass by their offences but deal out the due reward.
        <p align="justify">
          The psalmist feels that the overthrow of oppression which was so
          needful for himself must be equally desirable for multitudes of the
          godly placed in like positions, and therefore he prays for the whole
          company of the faithful, and against the entire confraternity of
          traitors.

          David compares his foes to Eastern dogs, unowned, loathsome, degraded,

          Saul's watchmen and the cruel king himself must have raved and raged

          David must have been in a singular plight when he could hear the foul

          After the style in which a Cavalier would have cursed a Puritan, or
          Claverhouse a Coventanter—the Saulites swore at the upstarts whom the
          king's majesty had sent them to arrest. David called them <i>dogs</i>,

          <i>a cursed cursing company of curs</i>. When they said, "Who does

        It argues great faith on David's part, that even while his house was
        surrounded by his enemies he is yet so fully sure of their overthrow,
        and so completely realizes it in his own mind, that he puts in a

        exterminated.

          God's victory over the craft and cruelty of the wicked is so easy and
