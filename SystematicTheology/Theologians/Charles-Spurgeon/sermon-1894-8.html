          Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and
          drank wine before the thousand. Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine,
          commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar
          his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that
          the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink
          therein. Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of
          the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king
          and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank in them. They drank
          wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron,
          of wood, and of stone. In the same hour came forth the fingers of a
          man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister
          of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the
          hand that wrote. Then the king's countenance was changed in him, and
          his thoughts troubled him; and the joints of his loins were loosed,
          and his knees smote one against another. The king cried aloud to bring
          in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king spake
          and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this
          writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with
          purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall rule as one
          of three in the kingdom. Then came in all the king's wise men: but
          they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the
          interpretation. Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his
          countenance was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came
          into the banquet house: the queen spake and said: O king, live for
          ever; let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be
          changed: there is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the
          holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and
          wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him: and the king
          Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made him
          master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;
          forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding,
          interpreting of dreams, and shewing of dark sentences, and dissolving
          of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named
          Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the
          interpretation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The king spake and said
          unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the
          captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah? I
          have heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that
          light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee. And now
          the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that
          they should read this writing, and make known unto me the
          interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of
          the thing. But I have heard of thee, that thou canst give
          interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the
          writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt
          be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and
          shalt rule as one of three in the kingdom. Then Daniel answered and
          said before the king: Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy
          rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing unto the
          king, and make known to him the interpretation. O thou king, the Most
          High God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom, and greatness,
          and glory, and majesty: and because of the greatness that he gave him,
          all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before
          him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom
          he would he raised up, and whom he would he put down. But when his
          heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened that he dealt
          proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his
          glory from him: and he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart
          was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; he
          was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of
          heaven: until he knew that the Most High God ruleth in the kingdom of
          men, and that he setteth up over it whomsoever he will. And thou his
          son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest
          all this: but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and
          they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and
          thy lords, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and
          thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood,
          and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose
          hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not
          glorified: then was the part of the hand sent from before him, and
          this writing was inscribed. And this is the writing that was
          inscribed:
        </p>
        <p>
          M U P<br />E L H<br />N E A<br />E K R<br />M E S<br />E T I<br />N E
          N
        </p>
        <p>[Footnote 2: Daniel reads down, up, down: instead of across.]</p>
        <p>This is the interpretation of the thing:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>MENE</p>
        <p>God hath NUMBERED thy kingdom:<br />And brought it to an end!</p>
        <p>TEKEL</p>
        <p>Thou art WEIGHED in the balances:<br />And art found wanting!</p>
        <p>PERES</p>
        <p>Thy kingdom is DIVIDED:<br />And given to the Medes and Persians!</p>
        <p>
          Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and
          put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning
          him, that he should rule as one of three in the kingdom. In that night
          Belshazzar the Chaldean king was slain. And Darius the Mede received
          the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.
