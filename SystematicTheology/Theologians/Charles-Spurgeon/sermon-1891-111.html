          1. In the beginning, therefore, did God form Adam, not as if He stood
          in need of man, but that He might have [some one] upon whom to confer
          His benefits. For not alone antecedently to Adam, but also before all
          creation, the Word glorified His Father, remaining in Him; and was
          Himself glorified by the Father, as He did Himself declare, "Father,
          glorify Thou Me with the glory which I had with Thee before the world
          was." Nor did He stand in need of our service when He ordered us to
          follow Him; but He thus bestowed salvation upon ourselves. For to
          follow the Saviour is to be a partaker of salvation, and to follow
          light is to receive light. But those who are in light do not
          themselves illumine the light, but are illumined and revealed by it:
          they do certainly contribute nothing to it, but, receiving the
          benefit, they are illumined by the light. Thus, also, service
          [rendered] to God does indeed profit God nothing, nor has God need of
          human obedience; but He grants to those who follow and serve Him life
          and incorruption and eternal glory, bestowing benefit upon those who
          serve [Him], because they do serve Him, and on His followers, because
          they do follow Him; but does not receive any benefit from them: for He
          is rich, perfect, and in need of nothing. But for this reason does God
          demand service from men, in order that, since He is good and merciful,
          He may benefit those who continue in His service. For, as much as God
          is in want of nothing, so much does man stand in need of fellowship
          with God. For this is the glory of man, to continue and remain
          permanently in God's service. Wherefore also did the Lord say to His
          disciples, "Ye have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you;" indicating
          that they did not glorify Him when they followed Him; but that, in
          following the Son of God, they were glorified by Him. And again, "I
          will, that where I am, there they also may be, that they may behold My
          glory;" not vainly boasting because of this, but desiring that His
          disciples should share in His glory: of whom Esaias also says, "I will
          bring thy seed from the east, and will gather thee from the west; and
          I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back:
          bring My sons from far, and My daughters from the ends of the earth;
          all, as many as have been called in My name: for in My glory I have
          prepared, and formed, and made him." Inasmuch as then, "wheresoever
          the carcase is, there shall also the eagles be gathered together," we
          do participate in the glory of the Lord, who has both formed us, and
          prepared us for this, that, when we are with Him, we may partake of
          His glory.

          2. Thus it was, too, that God formed man at the first, because of His
          munificence; but chose the patriarchs for the sake of their salvation;
          and prepared a people beforehand, teaching the headstrong to follow
          God; and raised up prophets upon earth, accustoming man to bear His
          Spirit [within him], and to hold communion with God: He Himself,
          indeed, having need of nothing, but granting communion with Himself to
          those who stood in need of it, and sketching out, like an architect,
          the plan of salvation to those that pleased Him. And He did Himself
          furnish guidance to those who beheld Him not in Egypt, while to those
          who became unruly in the desert He promulgated a law very suitable [to
          their condition]. Then, on the people who entered into the good land
          He bestowed a noble inheritance; and He killed the fatted calf for
          those converted to the Father, and presented them with the finest
          robe. Thus, in a variety of ways, He adjusted the human race to an
          agreement with salvation. On this account also does John declare in
          the Apocalypse, "And His voice as the sound of many waters." For the
          Spirit [of God] is truly [like] many waters, since the Father is both
          rich and great. And the Word, passing through all those [men], did
          liberally confer benefits upon His subjects, by drawing up in writing
          a law adapted and applicable to every class [among them].

          3. Thus, too, He imposed upon the [Jewish] people the construction of
          the tabernacle, the building of the temple, the election of the
          Levites, sacrifices also, and oblations, legal monitions, and all the
          other service of the law. He does Himself truly want none of these
          things, for He is always full of all good, and had in Himself all the
          odour of kindness, and every perfume of sweet-smelling savours, even
          before Moses existed. Moreover, He instructed the people, who were
          prone to turn to idols, instructing them by repeated appeals to
          persevere and to serve God, calling them to the things of primary
          importance by means of those which were secondary; that is, to things
          that are real, by means of those that are typical; and by things
          temporal, to eternal; and by the carnal to the spiritual; and by the
          earthly to the heavenly; as was also said to Moses, "Thou shalt make
          all things after the pattern of those things which thou sawest in the
          mount." For during forty days He was learning to keep [in his memory]
          the words of God, and the celestial patterns, and the spiritual
          images, and the types of things to come; as also Paul says: "For they
          drank of the rock which followed them: and the rock was Christ." And
          again, having first mentioned what are contained in the law, he goes
          on to say: "Now all these things happened to them in a figure; but
          they were written for our admonition, upon whom the end of the ages is
          come." For by means of types they learned to fear God, and to continue
          devoted to His service.<br />
