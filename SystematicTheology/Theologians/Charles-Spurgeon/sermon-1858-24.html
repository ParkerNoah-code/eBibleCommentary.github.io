        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.188)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, April 18th, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens</p>
        <p>
          "Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me
          where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me:
          for thou lovedst me before the foundations of the world." -- John
          17:24.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHEN the High Priest of old entered into the most holy place, he
          kindled the incense in his censer, and waving it before him, he
          perfumed the air with its sweet fragrance, and veiled the mercy seat
          with the denseness of its smoke. Thus was it written concerning him,
          "He shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the
          altar before the Lord, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten
          small, and bring it within the vail: and he shall put the incense upon
          the fire before the Lord, that the cloud of the incense may cover the
          mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not." Even so our
          Lord Jesus Christ, when he would once for all enter within the vail
          with his own blood to make an atonement for sin, did first offer
          strong crying and prayers. In this 17th chapter of John, we have, as
          it were, the smoking of the Saviour's pontifical center. He prayed for
          the people for whom he was about to die, and ere he sprinkled them
          with his blood, he did sanctify them with his supplications. This
          prayer therefore stands pre-eminent in Holy Writ as the Lord's Prayer
          -- the special and peculiar prayer of our Lord Jesus Christ; and "if,"
          as an old divine hath it, "it be lawful to prefer one Scripture above
          another, we may say, though all be gold, yet this is a pearl in the
          gold; though all be like the heavens, this is as the sun and stars."
          Or if one part of Scripture be more dear to the believer than any
          other, it must be this which contains his Master's last prayer before
          he entered through the rent vail of his own crucified body. How sweet
          it is to see that not himself, but his people, constituted the staple
          of his prayer! He did pray for himself -- he said, "Father, glorify
          thou me!" but while he had one prayer for himself, he had many for his
          people. Continually did he pray for them -- "father, sanctify them!"
          "Father, keep them!" "Father, make them one!" And then he concluded
          his supplication with, "Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast
          given me, be with me where I am." Melancthon well said there was never
          a more excellent, more holy, more fruitful, and more affectionate
          voice ever heard in heaven or in earth, than this prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall first notice the style of the prayer; secondly, the persons
          interested in it; and thirdly, the great petitions offered -- the last
          head constituting the main part of our discourse.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, notice THE STYLE OF THE PRAYER -- it is singular: it is,
          "Father, I will". Now, I cannot but conceive that there is something
          more in the expression, "I will" than a mere wish.It seems to one,
          that when Jesus said "I will," although perhaps it might not be proper
          to say that he made a demand, yet we may say that he pleaded with
          authority, asking for that which he knew to be his own, and uttering
          an "I will" as potent as any fiat that ever sprang from the lips of
          the Almighty "Father, I will." It is an unusual thing to find Jesus
          Christ saying to God, "I will" You know that before the mountains were
          brought forth, it was said of Christ, "in the volume of the book it is
          written of me, I delight to do thy will, O God." and we find whilst he
          was on earth, that he never mentioned his own will, that he expressly
          declared, "I came not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent
          me." It is true you do hear him when addressing men, saying "I will,"
          for he saith, "I will, be thou clean;" but in his prayers to his
          Father he prayed with all humility;
        </p>
        <p>"With sighs and groans he offered up,</p>
        <p>His humble suit below."</p>
        <p>
          "I will," therefore, seems to be an exception to the rule; but we must
          remember that Christ was now in an exceptional condition. He had never
          been before where he was now. He was now come to the end of his work;
          he could say, "I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do,"
          and therefore, looking forward to the time when the sacrifice would be
          complete and he should ascend on high, he sees that his work is done,
          and takes his own will back again and saith, "Father, I will."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, mark, that such a prayer as this would be totally unbecoming in
          our lips. We are never to say, "Father, I will." Our prayer is to be,
          "Not my will, but thine be done." We are to mention our wishes, but
          our wills are to subside into the will of God. We are to feel that
          whilst it is ours to desire, it is God's to will. But how pleasant, I
          repeat, it is to find the Saviour pleading with such authority as
          this, for this puts the stamp of certainty upon his prayer. Whatsoever
          he has asked for in that chapter he shall have beyond a doubt. At
          other times, when he pleaded as a Mediator, in his humility he was
          eminently successful in his intercessions; how much more shall his
          prayer prevail now that he takes to himself his great power, and with
          authority cries, "Father, I will." I love that opening to the prayer,
          it is a blessed guarantee of its fulfillment, rendering it so sure
          that we may now look upon Christ's prayer as a promise which shall be
          assuredly fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Thus much concerning the style of the prayer; and now we NOTICE
          THE PERSONS FOR WHOM HE PRAYED, "Father, I will that they also, whom
          thou hast given me, be with me where I am." This was not an universal
          prayer. It was a prayer including within it a certain class and
          portion of mankind, who are designated as "those whom the Father had
          given him." Now we are taught to believe that God the Father did, from
          before the foundation of the world, give unto his Son Jesus Christ a
          number whom no man can number, who were to be the reward of his death,
          the purchase of the travail of his soul; who were to be infallibly
          brought unto everlasting glory by the merits of his passion, and the
          power of his resurrection. These are the people here referred to.
          Sometimes in Scripture they are called the elect, because when the
          Father gave them to Christ he chose them out from among men. At other
          times they are called the beloved, because God's love was set upon
          them of old. They are called Israel; for like Israel of old, they are
          a chosen people, a royal generation. They are called God's
          inheritance, for they are especially dear to God's heart; and as a man
          careth for his inheritance and his portion, so the Lord careth
          especially for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me not be misunderstood. The people whom Christ here prays for,
          are those whom God the Father out of his own free love and sovereign
          good pleasure ordained unto eternal life, and who, in order that his
          design might be accomplished, were given into the hands of Christ the
          Mediator, by him to be redeemed, sanctified, and perfected, and by him
          to be glorified everlastingly. These people, and none others, are the
          object of our Saviour's prayer. It is not for me to defend the
          doctrine; it is Scriptural, that is my only defense. It is not for me
          to vindicate God from any profane charge of partiality or injustice.
          If there be any wicked enough to impute this to him, let them settle
          the matter with their Maker. Let the thing formed, if it have
          arrogance enough, say to him that formed it, "Why hast thou made me
          thus?" I am not God's apologist, he needs no defender. "Who art thou,
          O man, that repliest against God? Hath he not, like the potter, power
          over the clay, to make one vessel to honor, and another to dishonor?"
          Instead of disputing, let us enquire who are these people? Do we
          belong to them? Oh! let each heart now put the solemn query, "Am I
          included in that happy throng whom God the Father gave to Christ?"
          Beloved, I cannot tell you by the mere hearing of your names; but if I
          know your character, I can tell you decisively -- or rather, you will
          need no telling, for the Holy Spirit will bear witness in your hearts
          that you are amongst the number. Answer this question -- Have you
          given yourselves to Christ? Have you been brought, by the constraining
          power of his own free love, to make a voluntary surrender of yourself
          to him? Have you said, "O Lord other lords have had dominion over me;
          but now I reject them, and I give myself up to thee.
        </p>
        <p>'Other refuge have I none;</p>
        <p>Hangs my helpless soul on thee;'</p>
        <p>
          and as I have no other refuge, so I have no other Lord. Little am I
          worth, but such as I am, I give all I have and all I am to thee. It is
          true, I was never worth thy purchasing, but since thou hast bought me,
          thou shalt have me. Lord, I make a full surrender of myself to thee."
          Well, soul, if thou hast done this, if thou hast given thyself to
          Christ, it is but the result of that ancient grant made by Jehovah to
          his son long ere the worlds were made. And, once again, canst thou
          feel to-day that thou art Christ's? If thou canst not remember the
          time when he sought thee and brought thee to himself, yet canst thou
          say with the spouse "I am my beloved's?" Can you now from your inmost
          soul say, Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is none upon earth
          that I desire beside thee! If so, trouble not your minds about
          election, there is nothing troublesome in election to you. He that
          believes is elected, he who is given to Christ now, was given to
          Christ from before the foundation of the world. You need not dispute
          divine decrees, but sit down and draw honey out of this rock, and wine
          out of this flinty rock. Oh, it is a hard, hard doctrine to a man who
          has no interest in it, but when a man has once a title to it, then it
          is like the rock in the wilderness, it streams with refreshing water
          whereat myriads may drink and never thirst again. Well does the Church
          of England say of that doctrine, "is full of sweet, pleasant, and
          unspeakable comfort to godly persons." And though it be like the
          Tarpeian rock, whence many a malefactor has been dashed to pieces in
          presumption, yet it is like Pisgah, from whose lofty summit the spires
          of heaven may be seen in the distance. Again, I say, be not cast down,
          neither let your hearts be disconsolate. If you be given to Christ
          now, you are among the happy number for whom he intercedes above, and
          you shall be gathered amongst the glorious throng, to be with him
          where he is, and to behold his glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I very briefly pass over these two points, because I desire to
          dwell upon the third, which is, THE PETITIONS WHICH THE Saviour
          OFFERS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ prayed, if I understand his prayer, for three things -- things
          which constitute Heaven's greatest joy, Heaven's sweetest employment,
          and Heaven's highest privilege.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The first great thing he prayed for, is that which is heaven's
          greatest joy -- "Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given
          me, be with me where I am." If you notice, every word in the sentence
          is necessary to its fullness. He does not say -- "I pray that those,
          whom thou hast given me, may be where I am;" but, "with me where I
          am." And he does not only pray that they might be with him, but that
          they might be with him in the same place where he is. And mark! he did
          not say he wished his people to be in heaven, but with him in heaven,
          because that makes heaven heaven. It is the very pith and marrow of
          heaven to be with Christ. Heaven without Christ would be but an empty
          place it would lose its happiness, it would be a harp without strings;
          and where would be the music? -- a sea without water, a very pool of
          Tantalus. He prayed then that we might be with Christ -- that is our
          companionship, with him where he is -- that is our position. It seems
          as if he would tell us, that heaven is both a condition and a state --
          in the company of Christ, and in the place where Christ is.
        </p>
        <p>
          I might, if I expose, enlarge very much on these points, but I just
          throw out the raw material of a few thoughts, that will furnish you
          with topics of meditation in the afternoon. Let us now pause and think
          how sweet this prayer is, by contrasting it with our attainments on
          earth. "Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be
          with me where I am." Ah! brothers and sisters, we know a little of
          what it is to be with Christ. There are some happy moments, sweet
          pauses between the din of the continued battles of this wearied life
          there are some soft times, like couches of rest, wherein we do repose.
          There are hour when our Master comes to us, and makes us, or ever we
          are aware, like the chariots of Amminadib. It is true, we have not
          been caught up to the third heaven, like Paul, to hear words which it
          is unlawful for us to utter; but we have sometimes thought that the
          third heavens have come down to us. Sometimes I have said within
          myself, "Well, if this be not heaven, it is next door to it" and we
          have thought that we were dwelling in the suburbs of the celestial
          city. You were in that land which Bunyan calls the land Beulah. You
          were so near to heaven, that the angels did flit across the stream and
          bring you sweet bunches of myrrh, and bundles of frankincense, which
          grow in the beds of spices on the hills, and you pressed these to your
          heart and said with the spouse, "A bundle of myrrh, is my well beloved
          unto me. he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts," for I am ravished
          with his love and filled with his delights He hath made himself near
          to me, he hath unveiled his countenance and manifested all his love.
          But, beloved, while this gives us a foretaste of heaven, we may
          nevertheless use our state on earth as a complete contrast to the
          state of the glorified above. For here, when we see our Master, it is
          but at a distance. We are sometimes we think in his company, but still
          we cannot help feeling that there is a great gulf fixed between us,
          even when we come the nearest to him. We talk, you know, about laying
          our head upon his bosom, and sitting at his feet; but alas! we find it
          after all to be very metaphorical, compared with the reality which we
          shall enjoy above. We have seen his face, we trust we have sometimes
          looked into his heart, and tasted that he is gracious, but still long
          nights of darkness lay between us. We have cried again and again with
          the bride, "Oh, that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts
          of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea,
          I should not be despised. I would lead thee, and bring thee into my
          mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of
          spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate." We were with him but
          still he was in an upper-room of the house, and we below; we were with
          him but still we felt that we were absent from him, even when we were
          the nearest to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, even the sweetest visits from Christ, how short they are!
          Christ comes and goes very much like an angel; his visits are few and
          far between with the most of us, and oh! so short -- alas, too short
          for bliss. One moment our eyes see him, and we rejoice with joy
          unspeakable and full of glory, but again a little time and we do not
          see him, our beloved withdraws himself from us; like a roe or a young
          hart he leaps over the mountain of division; he is gone back to the
          land of spices, and feeds no more among the lilies.
        </p>
        <p>"If to-day he deigns to bless us</p>
        <p>With a sense of pardoned sin,</p>
        <p>He to-morrow may distress us,</p>
        <p>Make us feel the plague within"</p>
        <p>
          Oh, how sweet the prospect of the time when we shall not see him at a
          distance, but face to face. There is a sermon in those words, "face to
          face." And then we shall not see him for a little time, but
        </p>
        <p>"Millions of years our wondering eyes,</p>
        <p>Shall o'er our Saviour's beauties rove;</p>
        <p>And myriad ages we'll adore,</p>
        <p>The wonders of his love."</p>
        <p>
          Oh, if it is sweet to see him now and then, how sweet to gaze on that
          blessed face for aye, and never have a cloud rolling between, and
          never have to turn one's eyes away to look on a world of weariness and
          woe! Blest days! when shall ye come, when our companionship with
          Christ shall be close and uninterrupted?
        </p>
        <p>
          And let us remark, again, that when we get a glimpse of Christ, many
          step in to interfere. We have our hours of contemplation, when we do
          draw near to Jesus, but alas! how the world steps in and interrupts
          even our most quiet moments -- the shop, the field, the child, the
          wife, the head, perhaps the very heart, all these are interlopers
          between ourselves and Jesus. Christ loves quiet; he will not talk to
          our souls in the busy market place, but he says, "Come, my love, into
          the vineyard, get thee away into the villages, there will I show thee
          my love." But when we go to the villages, behold the Philistine is
          there, the Canaanite has invaded the land. When we would be free from
          all thought except thought of Jesus, the wandering band of Bedouin
          thoughts come upon us, and they take away our treasures, and spoil our
          tents. We are like Abraham with his sacrifice; we lay out the pieces
          ready for the burning, but foul birds come to feast on the sacrifice
          which we desire to keep for our God and for him alone. We have to do
          as Abraham did; "When the birds came down upon the sacrifice, Abraham
          drove them away." But in heaven there shall be no interruption, no
          weeping eyes shall make us for a moment pause in our vision, no
          earthly joys, no sensual delights, shall create a discord in our
          melody; there shall we have no fields to till, no garment to spin, no
          wearied limb, no dark distress, no burning thirst, no pangs of hunger,
          no weepings of bereavement; we shall have nought to do or think upon,
          but for ever to gaze upon that Sun of Righteousness, with eyes that
          cannot be blinded, and with a heart that can never be weary; to lie in
          those arms for ever; throughout a whole eternity to be pressed to his
          bosom, to feel the beatings of his ever faithful heart; to drink his
          love; to be satisfied for ever with his favor, and full with the
          goodness of the Lord! Oh! if we have only to die to get to such
          delights as these, -- death is gain, it is swallowed up in victory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor must we turn away from the sweet thought, that we are to be with
          Christ where he is, until we have remembered, that though we often
          draw near to Jesus on earth, yet the most we ever have of him, is but
          a sip of the well. We sometimes come to the wells of Elim and the
          seventy palm trees, but when sitting beneath the palm trees, we feel
          that it is just like an oasis; to-morrow we shall have to be treading
          the burning sands, with the scorching sky above us. One day we sit
          down and we drink from the sweet soft spring, to-morrow we know that
          we have to be standing with parched lips over Marah's fount, and
          crying, "Alas, alas! it is bitter; I cannot drink thereof" But oh, in
          heaven, we shall do what holy Rutherford says, we shall put the well
          head to our lips and drink right on from that well that never can be
          drained, we shall drink to our souls utmost full. Ay, as much of Jesus
          as the finite can hold of infinity shall the believer receive. We
          shall not then see him for the twinkling of an eye and then lose him,
          but we shall see him ever. We shall not eat of manna that shall be
          like a small round thing, a coriander seed, but the manna whereof we
          feed shall be mountains, the broad hills of food, there we shall have
          rivers of delight, and oceans of ecstatic joy. Oh, it is very hard for
          us to tell, with all that we can guess of heaven, how large, how deep,
          how high, how broad it is. When Israel ate of that one fair branch
          which came from Esheol, they guessed what the clusters of Canaan must
          be; and when they tasted the honey they guessed the sweetness. But I
          warrant no man in all that host, had any idea of how full that land
          was of fertility and sweetness; how the very brooks ran with honey,
          and the very rocks did teem with fatness. Nor can any of us who have
          lived the nearest to our Master, form more than the faintest guess of
          what it is to be with Jesus where he is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now all that is wanted to help my feeble description of being with
          Jesus, is this -- if you have faith in Christ, just think over this
          fact, that in a few more months you will know more about it than the
          wisest mortal ere can tell. A few more rolling suns, and you and I
          shall be in heaven. Go on, O Time! with thy swiftest pinions fly! A
          few more years, and I shall see his face. O canst thou say, my hearer,
          "I shall see his face?" Come, thou gray-headed one, nearing the goal
          of life, canst thou with confidence say, "I know that my Redeemer
          liveth?" If thou canst say that, it will fill thy soul with joy. I can
          never think of it without being moved to tears. To think that this
          head shall wear a crown; that these poor fingers shall strike the
          harp-strings of everlasting song; that this poor lip, which now
          faintly tells the wonders of redeeming grace, shall join with cherubim
          and seraphim, and rival them in melody. Is it not too good to be true?
          Does it not seem sometimes as if the very greatness of the thought
          overwhelmed our faith? But true it is, and though too great for us to
          receive it, it is not too great for God to give. We shall be with him
          where he is. Yes, John; thou laidst thy head upon thy Saviour's bosom
          once, and I have ofttimes envied thee; but I shall have thy place
          by-and-bye. Yes, Mary; it was thy sweet delight to sit at thy Master's
          feet, while Martha was cumbered with her much serving. I too, am too
          much cumbered with this world; but I shall leave my Martha's cares in
          the tomb and sit to hear thy Master's voice. Yes, O spouse, thou didst
          ask to be kissed with the kisses of his lips, and what thou askedst
          for poor humanity shall yet see. And the poorest, meanest, and most
          illiterate of you, who have trusted in Jesus, shall yet put your lip
          to the lip of your Saviour, not as Judas did, but with a true "Hail,
          Master!" you shall kiss him. And then, wrapped in the beams of his
          love, as a dim star is eclipsed in the sunlight, so shall you sink
          into the sweet forgetfulness of ecstacy, which is the best description
          we can give of the joys of the redeemed. "Father, I will that they
          whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am." That is heaven's
          sweetest joy, -- to be with Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. And now the next prayer is, "that they may behold my glory which
          thou hast given me." This is heaven's sweetest employment. I doubt not
          there are many joys in heaven which will amplify the grand joy with
          which are have just started; I feel confident that the meeting of
          departed friends, the society of apostles, prophets priests, and
          martyrs, will amplify the joy of the redeemed. But still the sun that
          will give them the greatest light to their joy, will be the fact that
          they are with Jesus Christ and behold his face. And now there may be
          other employments in heaven, but that mentioned in the text is the
          chief one, "That they may behold my glory." O for the tongue of
          angel-O for the lip of Cherubim! for one moment to depict the mighty
          scenes which the Christian shall behold when he seeth the glory of his
          Master, Jesus Christ! Let us pass as in a panorama before your eyes
          the great scenes of glory which you shall behold after death. The
          moment the soul departs from this body, it will behold the glory of
          Christ. The glory of his person will he the first thing that will
          arrest our attention. There will he sit in the midst of the throne,
          and our eyes will first be caught with the glory of his appearance.
          Perhaps we shall be struck with astonishment. Is this the visage that
          was more marred than that of any man? Are these the hands that once
          rude iron tore? Is that the head that once was crowned with thorns.
          Oh, how shall our admiration rise, and rise, and rise to the very
          highest pitch, when we shall see him who was --
        </p>
        <p>"The weary man, and full of woes</p>
        <p>The humble man before his foes,"</p>
        <p>
          now King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. What! are those fire-darting
          eyes the very eyes that once wept over Jerusalem? Are those feet shod
          with sandals of light; the feet that once were torn by the flinty
          acres of the Holy Land? Is that the man, who scarred and bruised was
          carried to his tomb? Yes, tis he. And that shall absorb our thoughts
          -- the godhead and the manhood of Christ; the wondrous feet that he is
          God over all blessed for ever, and yet man, bone of our bone, flesh of
          our flesh. And when for an instant we have noted this, I doubt not the
          next glory we shall see will be the glory of his enthronement. Oh, how
          will the Christian stop at the foot of his Master's throne and look
          upward, and if there could be tears in heaven, tears of rich delight
          will roll down his cheeks when he looks and sees the man enthroned.
          "Oh," saith he "I often used to sing on earth Crown him! crown him!
          crown him! King of Kings, and Lord of Lords!" And now I see him, up
          those hills of glorious light, my soul doth not dare to climb. There,
          there he sits! Dark with unsufferable light his skirts appear.
          Millions of angels bow themselves around him. The redeemed before his
          throne prostrate themselves with rapture. Ah! we shall not deliberate
          many moments but taking our crowns in our hands we shall help to swell
          that solemn pomp, and casting our crowns at his feet, we shall join
          the everlasting song, "Unto him that hath loved us, and washed us from
          our sins in his blood, unto him be glory for ever and ever." Can you
          imagine the magnificence of the Saviour? Can you conceive how thrones
          and princes, principalities and powers, all wait at his beck and
          command? Ye cannot tell how well the tiara of the universe doth fit
          his brow, or how the regal purple of all worlds doth gird his
          shoulders; but certain it is, from the highest heaven to the deepest
          hell, he is Lord of Lords -- from the furthest east to the remotest
          west, he is master of all. The songs of all creatures find a focus in
          him. He is the grand reservoir of praise. All the rivers run into the
          sea, and all the hallelujahs come to him, for he is Lord of all. Oh,
          this is heaven -- it is all the heaven I wish, to see my Master
          exalted; for, this has often braced my loins when I have been weary,
          and often steeled my courage when I have been faint "The Lord also
          hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every
          name; that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow, both of things
          in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth."
        </p>
        <p>
          And then the believer will have to wait a little while, and then he
          shall see more glorious things yet. After a few years, he will see the
          glories of the latter day. We are told in prophecy, that this world is
          to become the dominion of Christ. At present, idolatry, and bloodshed,
          and cruelty, and lusts, do reign. But the hour is coming; when this
          Augean stable shall be cleansed once and for ever, when these huge
          shambles of Aceldama shall yet become the temple of the living God. We
          believe that in these times, Christ with solemn pomp will descend from
          heaven to reign upon this earth. We cannot read our Bibles and believe
          them literally, without believing that there are bright days coming,
          when Christ shall sit upon the throne of his father David, when he
          shall hold his court on earth, and reign amongst his ancients
          gloriously. But oh, if it be so, you and I shall see it, if we belong
          to the happy number, who have put their trust in Christ. These eyes
          shall see that pompous appearance, when he shall stand in the latter
          day upon the earth. "Mine eyes shall see him, and not another's." I
          could almost weep to think, that I have lost the opportunity of seeing
          Christ on earth as crucified. I do think the twelve apostles were very
          highly favored, but when we shall see our Saviour here, and shall be
          like our head, we shall think that all deficiencies are made up in the
          eternal weight of glory. When from the center to the poles the harmony
          of this world shall all be given to his praise, these ears shall hear
          it, and when all nations shall join the shout, this tongue shall join
          the shout also. Happy men and happy women who have such a hope, so to
          behold the Saviour's glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, after that a little pause. A thousand years shall run their
          golden cycle, and then shall come the judgment Christ, with sound of
          trumpet, in pomp terrific, shall descend from heaven -- Angels shall
          form his body-guard. surrounding him on either hand. The chariots of
          the Lord are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels. The whole sky
          shall be clad with wonders. Prodigies, and miracles shall be as rife
          and as plentiful as the leaves upon the trees. The earth shall totter
          at the tramp of the Omnipotent; the pillars of the heavens shall
          stagger like drunken men, beneath the weight of the eternal splendour
          -- heaven shall display itself in the sky, while on earth all men
          shall be assembled. The sea shall give up its dead; the graves shall
          yield their tenants from the cemetery, and the graveyard, and the
          battle-field, men shall start in their thousands; and every eye shall
          see him, and they who have crucified him. And while the unbelieving
          world shall weep and wail because of him, seeking to hide themselves
          from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne, believers shall
          come forward, and, with songs and choral symphonies, shall meet their
          Lord Then shall they be caught up together with the Lord in the air,
          and after he hath said, "Come, ye blessed" they shall sit upon his
          throne, judging the twelve tribes of Israel; they shall take their
          seats as assessors upon that awful judgment bench. and when at the
          last he shall say, "Depart, ye cursed," and his left hand shall open
          the door of thunder, and let loose the flames of fire, they shall cry,
          Amen; and when the earth shall vanish, and men shall sink into their
          appointed doom, they gladly seeing the triumph of their Master, shall
          shout again, again, again the shout of victory -- "Hallelujah, for the
          Lord God hath triumphed over all."
        </p>
        <p>
          And to complete the scene, when the Saviour shall ascend on high for
          the last time, his victories all completed, and death himself being
          slain, he, like a mighty conqueror about to ride through heaven's
          bright streets, shall drag at his chariot wheel hell and death. You
          and I, attendants at his side, shall shout the victor to his throne,
          and while the angels clap their bright wings and cry, "the Mediator's
          work is done," you and I
        </p>
        <p>"Louder than them all shall sing</p>
        <p>While heaven's resounding mansions ring,</p>
        <p>With shouts of sovreign grace."</p>
        <p>
          We shall behold his glory. Picture whatever splendor and magnificence
          you please if you do but conceive it rightly, you shall behold it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You see people in this world running through the streets a king or a
          queen ride through them. How they do climb to their house-tops to see
          some warrior return from battle. Ah! what a trifle! What is it to see
          a piece of flesh and blood though it be crowned with gold. But oh!
          what is it to see the Son of God with heaven's highest honors to
          attend him, entering within the pearly gates, while the vast universe
          resounds with "Hallelujah! for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. I must close by noticing the last point, which is this. In our
          Saviour's prayer heaven's greatest privilege is also included. Mark,
          we are not only to be with Christ and to behold his glory, but we are
          to be like Christ and to be glorified with him. Is he bright? So shall
          you be. Is he enthroned? So shall you be. Does he wear a crown? So
          shall you. Is he a priest? So shall you be a priest and a king to
          offer acceptable sacrifices for ever. Mark, that in all Christ has, a
          believer has a share. This seems to me to be the sum total, and the
          crowning of it all -- to reign with Christ, to ride in his triumphal
          chariot, and have a portion of his joy; to be honored with him, to be
          accepted in him, to be glorified with him. This is heaven, this is
          heaven indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, how many of you are there here who have any hope that this
          shall be your lot? Well said Chrysostom, "The pains of hell are not
          the greatest part of hell; the loss of heaven is the weightiest woe of
          hell;" to lose the sight of Christ, the company of Christ, to lose the
          beholding of his glories, this must be the greatest part of the
          damnation of the lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, you that have not this bright hope, how is it that you can live?
          You are going through a dark world, to a darker eternity. I beseech
          you stop and pause. Consider for a moment whether it is worth while to
          lose heaven for this poor earth. What! pawn eternal glories for the
          pitiful pence of a few moments of the world's enjoyments. No, stop I
          beseech you; weigh the bargain ere you accept it. What shall it profit
          you to gain the whole world and lose your soul, and lose such a heaven
          as this?
        </p>
        <p>
          But as for you who have a hope, I beseech you hold it fast, live on
          it, rejoice in it --
        </p>
        <p>"A hope so much divine,</p>
        <p>May trials well endure,</p>
        <p>May purge your soul from sense and sin,</p>
        <p>As Christ the Lord is pure."</p>
        <p>
          Live near your Master now, so shall your evidences be bright; and when
          you come to cross the flood, you shall see him face to face, and what
          that is only they can tell who enjoy it every hour.
