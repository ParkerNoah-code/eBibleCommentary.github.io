          In the four preceding books, my very dear friend, which I put forth to
          thee, all the heretics have been exposed, and their doctrines brought
          to light, and these men refuted who have devised irreligious opinions.
          [I have accomplished this by adducing] something from the doctrine
          peculiar to each of these men, which they have left in their writings,
          as well as by using arguments of a more general nature, and applicable
          to them all. Then I have pointed out the truth, and shown the
          preaching of the Church, which the prophets proclaimed (as I have
          already demonstrated), but which Christ brought to perfection, and the
          apostles have handed down, from whom the Church, receiving [these
          truths], and throughout all the world alone preserving them in their
          integrity (bene), has transmitted them to her sons. Then also --
          having disposed of all questions which the heretics propose to us, and
          having explained the doctrine of the apostles, and clearly set forth
          many of those things which were said and done by the Lord in parables
          -- I shall endeavour, in this the fifth book of the entire work which
          treats of the exposure and refutation of knowledge falsely so called,
          to exhibit proofs from the rest of the Lord's doctrine and the
          apostolical epistles: [thus] complying with thy demand, as thou didst
          request of me (since indeed I have been assigned a place in the
          ministry of the word); and, labouring by every means in my power to
          furnish thee with large assistance against the contradictions of the
          heretics, as also to reclaim the wanderers and convert them to the
          Church of God, to confirm at the same time the minds of the neophytes,
          that they may preserve stedfast the faith which they have received,
          guarded by the Church in its integrity, in order that they be in no
          way perverted by those who endeavour to teach them false doctrines,
          and lead them away from the truth. It will be incumbent upon thee,
          however, and all who may happen to read this writing, to peruse with
          great attention what I have already said, that thou mayest obtain a
          knowledge of the subjects against which I am contending. For it is
          thus that thou wilt both controvert them in a legitimate manner, and
          wilt be prepared to receive the proofs brought forward against them,
          casting away their doctrines as filth by means of the celestial faith;
          but following the only true and stedfast Teacher, the Word of God, our
          Lord Jesus Christ, who did, through His transcendent love, become what
          we are, that He might bring us to be even what He is Himself.
