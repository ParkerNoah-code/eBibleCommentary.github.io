        >The song is one and indivisible. It seems almost impossible to expound
        it in detail, for a living poem is not to be dissected verse by verse.
        It is a song of <i>nature </i>and of <i>grace</i>. As a flash of
        lightning flames through space, and enwraps both Heaven and earth in one
        vestment of glory, so does the adoration of the Lord in this Psalm light
        up all the universe, and cause it to glow with a radiance of praise. The
        song begins in the heavens, sweeps downward to sea creatures and all
        deeps-and then ascends again, until the people near unto Jehovah take up
        the strain.
        <i
          >For its exposition the chief requisite is a heart on fire with
          reverent love to the Lord over all, who is to be blessed forever.<br />
           
        </i>
        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. Praise the LORD.</p></b> Whoever you may
        be that hear this word, you are <i>invited</i>, <i>entreated</i>,
        <i>commanded</i>, to magnify Jehovah. Assuredly he has made you, and, if
        for nothing else, you are bound, upon the ground of creatureship, to
        adore your Maker. This exhortation can never be out of <i>place</i>,
        speak it where we may; and never out of <i>time</i>, speak it when we
        may.
        <b> <p align="justify">Praise the LORD from the heavens.</p></b> Since
        you are nearest to the High and Lofty One, be you sure to lead the song.
        You angels, you cherubim and seraphim, and all others who dwell in the
        precincts of his courts, praise Jehovah. Do this as from a starting
        point from which the praise is to pass on to other realms. Keep not your
        worship to yourselves, but let it fall like a golden shower from the
        heavens on men beneath.
        <b> <p align="justify">Praise him in the heights.</p></b>This is no vain
        repetition; but after the manner of attractive poesy the truth is
        emphasized by reiteration in other words. Moreover, God is not only to
        be praised <i> from </i>the heights, but <i>in </i>them: the adoration
        is to be perfected in the heavens from which it takes its rise.
        <p align="justify">
          No place is too high for the praises of the most High. On the summit
          of creation the glory of the Lord is to be revealed, even as the tops
          of the highest Alps are tipped with the golden light of the same sun
          which gladdens the valleys. Heavens and heights become the higher and
          the more heavenly as they are made to resound with the praises of
          Jehovah.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          See how the Psalmist trumpets out the word "PRAISE." It sounds forth
          some nine times in the first five verses of this song. Exultant
          exhortations are sounded forth in tremendous force—Praise! Praise!
          Praise! The drum of the great King beats round the world with this one
          note—Praise! Praise! Praise! "Again they said, <i>Hallelujah</i>." All
          this praise is distinctly and personally for Jehovah. Praise not his
          servants nor his works; but praise HIM. Is he not worthy of all
          possible praise? Pour it forth before HIM in full volume; pour it only
          there!
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 2. Praise him, all his angels.</p></b
        >Living intelligences, perfect in character and in bliss, lift up your
        loudest music to your Lord, each one, of you.
        <p align="justify">
          Not one bright spirit is exempted from this consecrated service.
          However many you be, O angels, you are all <i>his </i>angels, and
          therefore you are bound, all of you, to render service to your Lord.
          You have all seen enough of him to be able to praise him, and you have
          all abundant reasons for so doing. Whether you be named Gabriel, or
          Michael, or by whatever other titles you are known, Praise the Lord.
          Whether you bow before him, or fly on his errands, or desire to look
          into his covenant, or behold his Son, cease not, you messengers of
          Jehovah, to sound forth his praise while you move at his bidding.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Praise him, all his heavenly hosts.</p></b> This
        includes angelic armies, but groups with them all the heavenly bodies.
        Though they be inanimate, the stars, the clouds, the lightnings, have
        their ways of praising Jehovah. Let each one of the countless legions of
        the Lord Almighty show forth his glory; for the countless armies are all
        his, his by <i> creation</i>, and <i>preservation</i>, and consequent
        <i>obligation</i>.
        <p align="justify">
          Both these sentences claim unanimity of praise from those in the upper
          regions who are called upon to commence the strain, "all his angels,
          all his heavenly hosts." That same hearty oneness must pervade the
          whole orchestra of praising ones; hence, further on, we read of all
          stars of light, all deeps, all hills, all cedars, and all people. How
          well the concert begins when all angels, and all the heavenly host,
          strike the first joyful notes! In that concert our souls would at once
          take their part.

          <p align="justify">
            Verse 3. Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you stars of
            light.
          </p></b
        >The Psalmist enters into detail as to the heavenly hosts. As all, so
        each—must praise the God of each and all. The sun and moon, as joint
        rulers of day and night, are paired in praise: the one is the complement
        of the other, and so they are closely associated in the summons to
        worship. The sun has his peculiar mode of glorifying the Great Father of
        lights, and the moon has her own special method of reflecting his
        brightness.
        <p align="justify">
          There is a perpetual adoration of the Lord in the skies: it varies
          with night and day, but it ever continues while sun and moon endure.
          There is ever a lamp burning before the high altar of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Nor are the greater luminaries allowed to drown with their floods of
          light the glory of the lesser brilliants, for all the
          <i> stars </i>are bidden to the banquet of praise. <i>Stars </i>are
          many, so many that no one can count the host included under the words,
          "all you stars"; yet no one of them refuses to praise its Maker. From
          their extreme brilliance they are fitly named "stars of light"; and
          this light is praise in a visible form twinkling to true music.<i>
            Light is song glittering before the eye, instead of resounding in
            the ear</i
          >. Stars without light would render no praise, and Christians without
          light rob the Lord of his glory.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          However small our beam, we must not hide it: if we cannot be sun or
          moon we must aim to be one of the "stars of light", and our every
          twinkling must be to the honor of our Lord.

          <p align="justify">Verse 4. Praise him, you heavens of heavens.</p></b
        >
        By these are meant those regions which are heavens to those who dwell in
        our heavens; or those most heavenly of abodes where the most choice of
        spirits dwell. As the highest of the highest, so the best of the best
        are to praise the Lord. If we could climb as much above the heavens as
        the heavens are above the earth, we could still cry out to all around
        us, "Praise the Lord!" There can be none so great and high as to be
        above praising Jehovah.
        <b> <p align="justify">And you waters that be above the heavens.</p></b>
        Let the <i> clouds </i>roll up volumes of adoration. Let the sea above
        roar, and the fullness thereof, at the presence of Jehovah, the God of
        Israel.
        <p align="justify">
          There is something of mystery about these supposed reservoirs of
          water; but let them be what they may, and as they may, they shall give
          glory to the Lord our God. Let the most unknown and perplexing
          phenomena take up their parts in the universal praise.
        </p>

            Verse 5. Let them praise the name of the LORD; for he commanded, and
            they were created.
          </p></b
        >Here is good argument:
        <i
          >The Maker should have honor from his works, they should tell forth
          his praise</i
        >: and thus they should praise his <i>name</i>—by which his
        <i>character </i>is intended. The name of JEHOVAH is written legibly
        upon his works, so that his power, wisdom, goodness, and other
        attributes are therein made manifest to thoughtful men, and thus his
        name is praised.<i>
          <p align="justify">
            The highest praise of God is to declare what he is.
          </p></i
        >
        We can invent nothing which would magnify the Lord.<i> </i>We can never
        extol him better than by repeating his <i>name</i>, or describing his
        character. The Lord is to be extolled as creating all things that exist,
        and as doing so by the simple agency of his word. He created by a
        command—what a power is this! Well may he expect those to praise him,
        who owe their being to him.
        <p align="justify">
          Evolution may be atheistic; but the doctrine of creation logically
          demands worship; and hence, as the tree is known by its fruit, it
          proves itself to be true. Those who were created by command, are under
          command to adore their Creator. The voice which said "Let them
          <i>be</i>", now says "Let them <i>praise</i>."
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 6. He has also established them forever and ever.

        <i
          >The continued existence of celestial beings is due to the supporting
          might of Jehovah, and to that alone. </i
        >They do not fail, because the Lord does not fail them. Without his will
        these things cannot alter; he has impressed upon them laws which only he
        himself can change. Eternally his ordinances are binding upon them.
        Therefore ought the Lord to be praised because he is <i>Preserver </i>as
        well as <i>Creator</i>, <i>Ruler </i>as well as <i>Maker</i>.
        <b> <p align="justify">He has made a decree which shall not pass.</p></b
        >The heavenly bodies are ruled by Jehovah's decree: they cannot pass his
        limit, or trespass against his law. His rule and ordination can never be
        changed except by himself, and in this sense his decree "shall not
        pass". Moreover, the highest and most wonderful of creatures are
        perfectly obedient to the statutes of the Great King, and thus his
        decree is not passed over. This submission to law is praise. Obedience
        is homage; order is harmony.
        <p align="justify">
          In this respect the praise rendered to Jehovah from the "celestial
          bodies" is absolutely perfect.
          <i
            >His almighty power upholds all things in their spheres, securing
            the march of stars and the flight of seraphs</i
          >; and thus the music of the upper regions is never marred by discord,
          nor interrupted by destruction.
          <i
            >The eternal hymn is forever chanted; even the solemn silence of the
            spheres is a perpetual Psalm.</i
          >
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 7. Praise the LORD from the earth.</p></b
        >The song descends to our abode, and so comes nearer home to us. We who
        are "terrestrial bodies", are to pour out our portion of praise from the
        golden globe of this favored planet. Jehovah is to be praised not only
        in the earth but from the earth, as if the adoration ran over from this
        planet into the general accumulation of worship. In verse 1 the song was
        "from the heavens"; here it is "from the earth". Songs coming down from
        Heaven, are to blend with those going up from earth. The "earth" here
        meant is our entire globe of land and water: it is to be made vocal
        everywhere with praise.
        <b> <p align="justify">You sea creatures, and all deeps.</p></b> It
        would be idle to inquire what special sea creatures are here meant; but
        we believe all of them are intended, and the places where they abide are
        indicated by "all deeps."<i>
          Terrible beasts or fishes, whether they roam the earth or swim the
          seas, are bidden to the feast of praise. </i
        >Whether they float amid the teeming waves of the tropics, or wend their
        way among the floes and bergs of polar waters—they are commanded by our
        sacred poet to yield their tribute to the creating Jehovah. They pay no
        service to man; let them the more heartily confess their allegiance to
        the Lord. About "sea creatures" and "deeps" there is somewhat of dread,
        but this may the more fitly become the <i>bass </i>of the music of the
        Psalm. If there be anything grim in mythology, or fantastic in
        heraldry—let it praise the incomprehensible Lord.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 8. Lightning and hail.</p></b> Lightning
        and hailstones go together. In the plagues of Egypt they cooperated in
        making Jehovah known in all the terrors of his power. Lightning and ice
        morsels are a contrast in nature, but they are combined in magnifying
        the Lord. <b> <p align="justify">Snow and vapors.</p></b> Offsprings of
        cold, or creations of heat, are equally consecrated to his praise.
        Congealed or expanded vapors, falling flakes or rising clouds, should,
        rising or falling, still reveal the praises of the Lord.
        <b> <p align="justify">Stormy winds fulfilling his word.</p></b> Though
        rushing with incalculable fury, the storm wind is still under law, and
        moves in order due, to carry out the designs of God. It is a grand
        orchestra which contains such <i>wind instruments </i>as these! He is a
        great leader who can keep all these <i>musicians </i>in concert, and
        direct both time and tune.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 9. Mountains and all hills.</p></b>Towering
        steeps and swelling knolls alike declare their Creator. "All hills" are
        to be consecrated; we have no longer Ebal and Gerizim, the hill of the
        curse and the hill of the blessing—but all our Ebals are turned to
        Gerizims. Tabor and Hermon, Lebanon and Carmel, rejoice in the name of
        the Lord. The greater and the lesser mounts are one in their adoration.
        Not only the Alps and the mountains of the Jura thunder out his praise;
        but our own Cotswolds and Grampians are vocal with songs in his honor.
        <b> <p align="justify">Fruitful trees, and all cedars.</p></b>Fruit
        trees and forest trees, trees deciduous or evergreen, are equally full
        of benevolent design, and alike subserve some purpose of love. Therefore
        for all and by all let the great Designer be praised. There are many
        species of cedar, but they all reveal the wisdom of their Maker. When
        kings fell them, that they may make beams for their palaces, they do but
        confess their obligation to the <i>King of trees</i>, and to the
        <i>King of kings</i>, whose trees they are. Varieties in the landscape
        are produced by the rising and falling of the soil, and by the many
        kinds of trees which adorn the land: let all, and all alike, glorify
        their one Lord. When the trees clap their hands in the wind, or their
        leaves rustle in the gentle breath of Zephyr, they do to their best
        ability sing out unto the Lord.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 10. Beasts, and all cattle.</p></b> Animals
        fierce or tame; wild beasts and domestic cattle—let all these show forth
        the praises of Jehovah.
        <i>Those are worse than beasts who do not praise our God. </i>
        More than brutish are those who are willfully dumb concerning their
        Maker.

        <b> <p align="justify">Creeping things, and flying birds.</p></b> The
        multitudes that throng the earth and the air; insects of every form and
        birds of every wing are called upon to join the universal worship. No
        one can become familiar with insect and bird life without feeling that
        they constitute a wonderful chapter in the history of divine wisdom. The
        minute <i>insect </i> marvelously proclaims the Lord's handiwork; when
        placed under the microscope it tells a wondrous tale. So, too, the
        <i>bird </i>which soars aloft displays in its adaptation for an aerial
        life an amount of skill which our balloonists have in vain attempted to
        emulate.
        <p align="justify">
          True devotion not only hears the praises of God in the sweet song of
          feathered minstrels, but even discovers it in the croaking from the
          marsh, or in the buzz of "the blue fly which sings in the window
          pane."

        Now the poet has reached our own race, and very justly he would have
        rulers and subjects, chieftains and magistrates, unite in worshiping the
        sovereign Lord of all. Monarchs must not disdain to sing, nor must their
        people refrain from uniting with them. Those who lead in battle and
        those who decide in courts, must neither of them allow their vocations
        to keep them from reverently adoring the Chief and Judge of all.

        <i>glory </i>is above the earth and Heaven: it is therefore alone
        because it surpasses all others. His <i> royal splendor </i>exceeds all
        that earth and Heaven can express. He is himself the crown of all
        things, the excellency of the creation. There is more glory in him
        personally, than in all his works united.<i>
          It is not possible for us to exceed and become extravagant in the
          Lord's praise; his own natural glory is infinitely greater than any
          glory which we can render to him. </i

            Verse 14. He also exalts the horn of his people.
          </p></b
        >
        He has made them strong, famous, and victorious. His goodness to all his
        creatures does not prevent his having a special favor to his chosen
        nation. He is good to all, but he is God to his people. He lifts up the
        down trodden, but he in a peculiar manner lifts up his redeemed people.
        When they are brought low he raises up a horn for them by sending them a
        deliverer; when they are in conflict he gives them courage and strength,
        so that they lift up their horn amid the fray; and when all is peaceful
        around them, he fills their horn with plenty, and they lift it up with
        delight. <b> <p align="justify">The praise of all his saints.</p></b> He
        is their glory: to him they render praise; and he by his mercy to them
        evermore gives them further reasons for praise, and higher motives for
        adoration.
        <i>He lifts up their horn, and they lift up his praise. </i>He exalts
        them, and they exalt him.<i> The Holy One is praised by holy ones. </i
        >He is their God, and they are his saints; he makes them blessed, and
        they bless him in return.
        <b> <p align="justify">Even of the children of Israel.</p></b> The Lord
        knows those who are his. He knows the name of him with whom he made a
        covenant, and how he came by that name, and who his children are, and
        where they are. All nations are bidden in verse 11 to praise the Lord;
        but here the call is specially addressed to
        <i>his elect people, who know him beyond all others</i>. Those who are
        children of privilege should be children of praise.
        <b> <p align="justify">A people near unto him</p></b>, near by kin, and
        near by care; near as to manifestation and near as to affection. This is
        a highly honorable description of the beloved race; and it is true even
        more emphatically of the <i>spiritual Israel</i>, the
        <i>believing seed</i>. This nearness should prompt us to perpetual
        adoration. The Lord's elect are the children of his love, the courtiers
        of his palace, the priests of his temple—and therefore they are bound
        beyond all others to be filled with reverence for him, and delight in
        him. <b> <p align="justify">Praise the Lord</p></b>, or, Hallelujah.
        This should be the Alpha and Omega of a godly man's life. Let us praise
        God to the end, world without end.
        <p align="justify">
          The field of praise which lies before us in this Psalm is bounded at
          beginning and end by landmarks in the form of <i>Hallelujahs</i>, and
          all that lies between them is every word of it to the Lord's honor.
          Amen.
