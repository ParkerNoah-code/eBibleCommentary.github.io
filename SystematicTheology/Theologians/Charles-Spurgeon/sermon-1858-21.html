        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.185)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, March 28th, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens</p>
        <p>
          "The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations;
          and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God." --
          Isaiah 52:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHEN THE HEROES of old prepared for the fight they put on their
          armour; but when God prepares for battle he makes bare his arm. Man
          has to look two ways -- to his own defence, as well as to the offence
          of his enemy; God hath but one direction in which to cast his eye --
          the overthrow of his foeman, and he disregards all measures of
          defence, and scorns all armour. He makes bare his arm in the sight of
          all the people. When men would do their work in earnest, too, they
          sometimes strip themselves, like that warrior of old, who, when he
          went to battle with the Turks, would never fight them except with the
          bare arm. "Such things as they," said he, "I need not fear; they have
          more reason to fear my bare arm than I their scimitar." Men feel that
          they are prepared for a work when they have cast away their cumbrous
          garments. And so the prophet represents the Lord as laying aside for
          awhile the garments of his dignity, and making bare his arm, that he
          may do his work in earnest, and accomplish his purpose for the
          establishment of his church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, leaving the figure, which is a very great one, I would remind you
          that its meaning is fully carried out, whenever God is pleased to send
          a great revival of religion. My heart is glad within me this day, for
          I am the bearer of good tidings. My soul has been made exceedingly
          full of happiness, by the tidings of a great revival of religion
          throughout the United States. Some hundred years, or more, ago, it
          pleased the Lord to send one of the most marvellous religious
          awakenings that was ever known; the whole of the United States seemed
          shaken from end to end with enthusiasm for hearing the Word of God;
          and now, after the lapse of a century, the like has occurred again.
          The monetary pressure has at length departed; but it has left behind
          it the wreck of many mighty fortunes. Many men, who were once princes,
          have now become beggars, and in America. more than in England, men
          have learned the instability of all human things. The minds of men,
          thus weaned from the earth by terrible and unexpected panic, seem
          prepared to receive tidings from a better land, and to turn their
          exertions in a heavenly direction. You will be told by any one -- who
          is conversant with the present state of America, that wherever you go
          there are the most remarkable signs that religion is progressing with
          majestic strides. The great revival, as it is now called, has become
          the common market talk of merchants; it is the theme of every
          newspaper; even the secular press remark it, for it has become so
          astonishing that all ranks and classes of men seem to have been
          affected by it. Apparently without any cause whatever, fear has taken
          hold of the hearts of men; a thrill seems to be shot through every
          breast at once; and it is affirmed by men of good repute, that there
          are, at this time, towns in New England where you could not, even if
          you searched, find one solitary unconverted person. So marvellous -- I
          had almost said, so miraculous -- has been the sudden and
          instantaneous spread of religion throughout the great empire, that it
          is scarcely possible for us to believe the half of it, even though it
          should be told us. Now, as you are aware, I have at all times been
          peculiarly jealous and suspicious of revivals. Whenever I see a man
          who is called a revivalist, I always set him down for a cipher. I
          would scorn the taking of such a title as that to myself. If God
          pleases to make use of a man for the promoting of a revival, well and
          good; but for any man to assume the title and office of a revivalist,
          and go about the country, believing that wherever he goes he is the
          vessel of mercy appointed to convey a revival of religion, is, I
          think, an assumption far too arrogant for any man who has the
          slightest degree of modesty. And again, there are a large number of
          revivals, which occur every now and then in our towns, and sometimes
          in our city, which I believe to be spurious and worthless. I have
          heard of the people crowding in the morning, the afternoon, and the
          evening, to hear some noted revivalist, and under his preaching some
          have screamed, have shrieked, have fallen down on the floor, have
          rolled themselves in convulsions, and afterwards, when he has set a
          form for penitents, employing one or two decoy ducks to run out from
          the rest and make a confession of sin, hundreds have come forward,
          impressed by that one sermon, and declared that they were, there and
          then, turned from the error of their ways; and it was only last week I
          saw a record of a certain place, in our own country, giving an
          account, that on such a day, under the preaching of the Rev. Mr.
          So-and-so, seventeen persons were thoroughly sanctified, twenty-eight
          were convinced of sin, and twenty-nine received the blessing of
          justification. Then comes the next day, so many more; the following
          day, so many more; and afterwards they are all cast up together,
          making a grand total of some hundreds, who have been blessed during
          three services, under the ministry of Mr. So-and-so. All that I call
          farce! There may be something very good in it; but the outside looks
          to me to be so rotten, that I should scarcely trust myself to think
          that the good within comes to any very great amount. When people go to
          work to calculate so exactly by arithmetic, it always strikes me they
          have mistaken what they are at. We may easily say that so many were
          added to the church on a certain occasion, but to take a separate
          census of the convinced, the justified, and the sanctified, is absurd.
          You will, therefore, be surprised at finding me speaking of revival;
          but you will, perhaps, not be quite so surprised when I endeavour to
          explain what I mean by an earnest and intense desire, which I feel in
          my heart, that God would be pleased to send throughout this country a
          revival like that which has just commenced in America, and which, we
          trust, will long continue there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I should endeavour to mark, in the first place, the cause of every
          revival of true religion; secondly,the consequences of such revival;
          then, thirdly, I shall give a caution or two, that we make not
          mistakes in this matter, and conceive that to be God's work which is
          only man's; and then I shall conclude by making an exhortation to all
          my brethren in the faith of Christ, to labour and pray for a revival
          of religion in the midst of our churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, THE CAUSE: OF A TRUE REVIVAL. The mere worldly man
          does not understand a revival; he cannot make it out. Why is it, that
          a sudden fit of godliness, as he would call it, a kind of sacred
          epidemic, should seize upon a mass of people all at once? What can be
          the cause of it? It frequently occurs in the absence of all great
          evangelists; it cannot be traced to any particular means. There have
          been no special agencies used in order to bring it about -- no
          machinery supplied, no societies established; and yet it has come,
          just like a heavenly hurricane, sweeping everything before it. It has
          rushed across the land, and of it men have said, "The wind bloweth,
          where it listeth; we hear the sound thereof, but we cannot tell whence
          it cometh or whither it goeth." What is then, the cause? Our answer
          is, If a revival be true and real, it is caused by the Holy Spirit,
          and by him alone. When Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost, and
          preached that memorable sermon by which three thousand persons were
          converted, can we attribute the remarkable success of his ministry to
          anything else but the ministry of the Holy Spirit? I read the notes of
          Peter's discourse; it was certainly very simple; it was a plain
          narration of facts; it was certainly very bold, very cutting, and
          pointed, and personal, for he did not blush to tell them that they had
          put to death the Lord of life and glory, and were guilty of his blood;
          but on the mere surface of the thing, I should be apt to say that I
          had read many a sermon far more likely to be effective than Peter's;
          and I believe there have been many preachers who have lived, whose
          sermons when read would have been far more notable and far more
          regarded, at least by the critic, than the sermon of Peter. It seems
          to have been exceedingly simple and suitable, and extremely earnest,
          but none of these things are so eminently remarkable as to be the
          cause of such extraordinary success.
        </p>
        <p>
          What, then, was the reason? And we reply, once more, the same word
          which the Holy Spirit blesses to the conversion of one, he might, if
          he pleased, bless to the conversion of a thousand: and I am persuaded
          that the meanest preacher in Christendom might come into this pulpit
          this morning, and preach the most simple sermon, in the most
          uneducated style, and the Holy Spirit, if so he willed it, might bless
          that sermon to the conversion of every man, woman, and child, within
          this place: for his arm is not shortened, his power is not straitened,
          and as long as he is Omnipotent, it is ours to believe that he can do
          whatsoever seemeth him good. Do not imagine, when you hear of a sermon
          being made useful, that it was the sermon itself that did the work.
          Conceive not, because a certain preacher may have been greatly blessed
          in the conversion of souls, that there is anything in the preacher.
          God forbid that any preacher should arrogate such a thing to himself.
          Any other preacher, blessed in the same manner, would be as useful,
          and any other sermon, provided it be truthful and earnest, might be as
          much blessed as that particular sermon which has become notable by
          reason of the multitudes who by it have been brought to Christ. The
          Spirit of God, when he pleaseth, blows upon the sons of men. He finds
          a people hard and careless; he casts a desire into their minds -- he
          sows it broadcast in their spirits -- a thought towards the house of
          the Lord, and straightway, they know not why, they flock in multitudes
          to hear the Word preached. He casts the seed, the same seed, into the
          preacher's mind, and he knows not how, but he feels more earnest than
          he did before. When he goes to his pulpit, he goes to it as to a
          solemn sacrifice, and there he preaches, believing that great things
          will be the effect of his ministry. The time of prayer cometh round;
          Christians are found meeting together in large numbers; they cannot
          tell what it is that influences them, but they feel they must go up to
          the house of the Lord to pray. There are earnest prayers lifted up;
          there are earnest sermons preached, and there are earnest hearers.
          Then God the Almighty One is pleased to, soften hard hearts, and
          subdue the stout-hearted, and bring them to know the truth. The only
          real cause is, his Spirit working in the minds of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          But while this is the only actual cause, yet there are instrumental
          causes; and the main instrumental cause of a great revival must be the
          bold, faithful, fearless preaching of the truth as it is in Jesus.
          Why, brethren, we want every now and then a reformation. One
          reformation will never serve the church; she need's continually to be
          wound up, and set a-going afresh; for her works run down, and she does
          not act as she used to do. The bold, bald doctrines that Luther
          brought out, began to be a little modified, until layer after layer
          was deposited upon them, and at last the old rocky truth was covered
          up, and there grew upon the superficial subsoil an abundance of green
          and flowery errors, that looked fair and beautiful, but were in no way
          whatever related to the truth, except as they were the products of its
          decay. Then there came bold men who brought the truth out again, and
          said, "Clear away this rubbish; let the blast light upon these
          deceitful beauties; we want them not; bring out the old truth once
          more!" And it came out. But the tendency of the church perpetually is,
          to be covering up its own naked simplicity, forgetting that the truth
          is never so beautiful as when it stands in its own unadorned,
          God-given glory. And now, at this time, we want to have the old truths
          restored to their places. The subtleties and the refinements of the
          preacher must be laid aside. We must give up the grand distinctions of
          the school-men, and all the lettered technicalities of men who have
          studied theology as a system, but have not felt the power of it in
          their hearts; and when the good old truth is once more preached by men
          whose lips are touched as with a live coal from off the altar, this
          shall be the instrument, in the hand of the Spirit, for bringing about
          a great and thorough revival of religion in the land.
        </p>
        <p>
          But added to this, there must be the earnest prayers of the church.
          All in vain the most indefatigable ministry, unless the church waters
          the seed sown, with her abundant tears. Every revival has been
          commenced and attended by a large amount of prayer. In the city of New
          York at the present moment, there is not, I believe, one single hour
          of the day, wherein Christians are not gathered together for prayer.
          One church opens its doors from five o'clock till six, for prayer;
          another church opens from six to seven, and summons its praying men to
          offer the sacrifice of supplication. Six o'clock is past, and men are
          gone to their labour. Another class find it then convenient -- such as
          those, perhaps, who go to business at eight or nine-and from seven to
          eight there is another prayer meeting. From eight to nine there is
          another, in another part of the city, and what is most marvellous, at
          high noon, from twelve to one, in the midst of the city of New York,
          there is held a prayer meeting in a large room, which is crammed to
          the doors every day, with hundreds standing outside. This prayer
          meeting is made up of merchants of the city, who can spare a quarter
          of an hour to go in and say a word of prayer, and then leave again;
          and then a fresh company come in to fill up the ranks, so that it is
          supposed that many hundreds assemble in that one place for prayer
          during the appointed hour. This is the explanation of the revival. If
          this were done in London-if we for once would outvie old Rome, who
          kept her monks in her sanctuaries, always at prayer, both by night and
          by day, -- if we together could keep up one golden chain of prayer,
          link after link of holy brotherhood being joined together in
          supplication, then might we expect an abundant outpouring of the
          Divine Spirit from the Lord our God. The Holy Spirit, as the actual
          agent -- the Word preached, and the prayers of the people, as the
          instruments -- and we have thus explained the cause of a true revival
          of religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But now what are THE CONSEQUENCES OF A REVIVAL OF RELIGION? Why,
          the consequences are everything that our hearts could desire for the
          church's good. When the revival of religion comes into a nation, the
          minister begins to be warmed. It is said that in America the most
          sleepy preachers have begun to wake up; they have warmed themselves at
          the general fire, and men who could not preach without notes, and
          could not preach with them to any purpose at all, have found it in
          their hearts to speak right out, and speak with all their might to the
          people. When there comes a revival, the minister all of a sudden finds
          that the usual forms and conventionalities of the pulpit are not
          exactly suitable to the times. He breaks through one hedge; then he
          finds himself in an awkward position, and he has to break through
          another. He finds himself perhaps on a Sunday morning, though a Doctor
          of Divinity, actually telling an anecdote -- lowering the dignity of
          the pulpit by actually using a simile or metaphor -- sometimes perhaps
          accidentally making his people smile, and what is also a great sin in
          these solid theologians, now and then dropping a tear. He does not
          exactly know how it is, but the people catch up his words. "I must
          have something good for them," he says. He just burns that old lot of
          sermons; or he puts them under the bed, and gets some new ones, or
          gets none at all, but just gets his text, and begins to cry, "Men and
          brethren, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved."
          The old deacons say, "What is the matter with our minister?" The old
          ladies, who have heard him for many years, and slept in the front of
          the gallery so regularly, begin to rouse, and say, "I wonder what has
          happened to him; how can it be?" Why, he preaches like a man on fire.
          The tear runs over at his eye; his soul is full of love for souls."
          They cannot make it out; they have often said he was dull and dreary
          and drowsy. How is it all this is changed? Why, it is the revival. The
          revival has touched the minister; the sun, shining so brightly, has
          melted some of the snow on the mountain-top, and it is running down in
          fertilizing streams, to bless the valleys; and the people down below
          are refreshed by the ministrations of the man of God who has awakened
          himself up from his sleep, and finds himself, like another Elijah,
          made strong for forty days of labour. Well, then, directly after that
          the revival begins to touch the people at large. The congregation was
          once numbered by the empty seats, rather than by the full ones. But on
          a sudden -- the minister does not understand it -- he finds the people
          coming to hear him. He never was popular, never hoped to be. All at
          once he wakes up and finds himself famous, so far as a large
          congregation can make him so. There are the people, and how they
          listen! They are all awake, all in earnest; they lean their heads
          forward, they put their hands to their ears. His voice is feeble; they
          try to help him; they are doing anything so that they may hear the
          Word of Life. And then the members of the church open their eyes and
          see the chapel full, and they say, "How has this come about? We ought
          to pray." A prayer-meeting is summoned. There had been five or six in
          the vestry: now there are five or six hundred, and they turn into the
          chapel. And Oh! how they pray! That old stager, who used to pray for
          twenty minutes, finds it now convenient to confine himself to five;
          and that good old man, who always used to repeat the same form of
          prayer when he stood up, and talked about the horse that rushed into
          the battle, and the oil from vessel to vessel, and all that, leaves
          all these things at home, and just prays, "O Lord, save sinners, for
          Jesus Christ's sake." And there are sobs and groans heard in the
          prayer meetings. It is evident that not one, but all, are praying; the
          whole mass seems moved to supplication. How is this again? Why, it Is
          just the effect of the revival, for when the revival truly comes, the
          minister and the congregation and the church will receive good by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it does not end here. The members of the church grow more solemn,
          more serious. Family duties are better attended to; the home circle is
          brought under better culture. Those who could not spare time for
          family prayer, find they can do so now; those who had no opportunity
          for teaching their children, now dare not go a day without doing it;
          for they hear that there are children converted in the Sunday school.
          There are twice as many in the Sunday school now as there used to be;
          and, what is wonderful, the little children meet together to pray;
          their little hearts are touched, and many of them show signs of a work
          of grace begun; and fathers and mothers think they must try what they
          can do for their families: if God is blessing little children, why
          should he not bless theirs?
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, when you see the members of the church going up to the house
          of God, you mark with what a steady and sober air they go. Perhaps
          they talk on the way, but they talk of Jesus; and if they whisper
          together at the gates of the sanctuary, it is no longer idle gossip;
          it is no remark about, "how do you like the preacher? What did you
          think of him? Did you notice So-and-so?" Oh, no! "I pray the Lord that
          he might bless the word of his servant, that he might send an unction
          from on high, that the dying flame may be kindled, and that where
          there is life, it may be promoted and strengthened, and receive fresh
          vigour." This is their whole conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then comes the great result. There is an inquirers' meeting held:
          the good brother who presides over it is astonished; he never saw so
          many coming in his life before. "Why," says he, "there is a hundred,
          at least, come to confess what the Lord has done for their souls! Here
          are fifty come all at once to say that under such a sermon they were
          brought to the knowledge of the truth. Who hath begotten me these? How
          hath it come about? How can it be? Is not the Lord a great God that
          hath wrought such a work as this?" And then the converts who are thus
          brought into the church, if the revival continues, are very earnest
          ones. You never saw such a people. The outsiders call them fanatics.
          It is a blessed fanaticism. Others say, they are nothing but
          enthusiasts. It is a heavenly enthusiasm. Everything that is done is
          done with such spirit. If they sing, it is like the crashing thunder;
          if they pray, it is like the swift, sharp flash of lightning, lighting
          up the darkness of the cold hearted, and making them for a moment feel
          that there is something in prayer. When the minister preaches, he
          preaches like a Boanerges, and when the church is gathered together,
          it is with a hearty good will. When they give, they give with enlarged
          liberality; when they visit the sick, they do it with gentleness,
          meekness, and love. Everything is done with a single eye to God's
          glory; not of men, but by the power of God. Oh! that we might see such
          a revival as this!
        </p>
        <p>
          But, blessed be God, it does not end here. The revival of the church
          then touches the rest of society. Men, who do not come forward and
          profess religion, are more punctual in attending the means of grace.
          Men that used to swear, give it up; they find it is not suitable for
          the times. Men that profaned the Sabbath, and that despised God, find
          it will not do; they give it all up. Times get changed; morality
          prevails; the lower ranks are affected. They buy a sermon where they
          used to buy some penny tract of nonsense. The higher orders are also
          touched; they too are brought to hear the word. Her ladyship, in her
          carriage, who never would have thought of going to so mean a place as
          a conventicle, does not now care where she goes so long as she is
          blessed. She wants to hear the truth; and a drayman pulls his horses
          up by the side of her ladyship's pair of grays, and they both go in
          and bend together before the throne of sovereign grace. All classes
          are affected. Even the senate feels it; the statesman himself is
          surprised at it, and wonders what all these things mean. Even the
          monarch on the throne feels she has become the monarch of a people
          better than she knew before, and that God is doing something in her
          realms past all her thought -- that a great King is swaying a better
          sceptre and exerting a better influence than even her excellent
          example. Nor does it even end there. Heaven is filled. One by one the
          converts die, and heaven gets fuller; the harps of heaven are louder,
          the songs of angels are inspired with new melody, for they rejoice to
          see the sons of men prostrate before the throne. The universe is made
          glad: it is God's own summer; it is the universal spring. The time of
          the singing of birds is come; the voice of the turtle is heard in our
          land. Oh! that God might send us such a revival of religion as this!
        </p>
        <p>
          I thank God, that we, as a people, have had great cause to thank him
          that we had great measure of revival of this kind, but nothing
          compared with what we desire. I have heard of revivals, where
          twenties, and thirties, and forties, and fifties, were gathered in;
          but, tell it to the honour of our God, there is never a month passes,
          but our baptismal pool is opened, and never a communion Sabbath, but
          we receive many into the fold of the Lord. As many as three hundred in
          one year have we added to the church, and still the cry is, "They
          come! they come!" and were but our new sanctuary built, I am
          persuaded, that in six months from its erection, instead of having
          twelve hundred members, I should be the pastor of at least two
          thousand. For I believe there are many of you who attend this hall in
          the morning, who find it quite impossible to crowd into the chapel in
          the evening, and are only waiting and anxious, that you may tell to me
          and to the brethren, what God has done for your souls. This I know,
          the Lord hath been very gracious to us, and to him be the honour of
          it. But we want more. Our souls are greedy -- covetous for God. Oh!
          that we might be all converted!
        </p>
        <p>"We long to see the churches full,</p>
        <p>That all the chosen race,</p>
        <p>May with one voice, and heart, and tongue,</p>
        <p>Sing his redeeming grace."</p>
        <p>
          And we have to thank God, too, that it has not ended there; for we had
          last Sabbath evening, Exeter Hall full, Westminster Abbey full, and
          this place full too; and though we may not altogether agree in
          sentiment with all that preach, yet God bless them all! So long as
          Christ is preached, I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice; and I would to
          God that every large building in London were crowded too, and that
          every man who preached the Word were followed by tens of thousands,
          who would hear the truth. May that day soon come! and there is one
          heart which will rejoice in such a day more than any of you -- a heart
          that shall always beat the highest when it sees God glorified, though
          our own honour should decrease.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now we shall have to turn to the third point, which was A
          CAUTION. When Christmas Evans preached in Wales, during a time of
          revival, he used to make the people dance; the congregation were so
          excited under his ministry that they positively danced. Now I do not
          believe that dancing was the work of the Spirit. Their being stirred
          in their hearts might be the Holy Spirit's work, but the Holy Spirit
          does not care to make people dance under sermons; no good comes of it.
          Now and then among our Methodist friends there is a great break out,
          and we hear of a young woman in the middle of a sermon getting on the
          top of a form and turning round and round in ecstacy, till she falls
          down in a fainting fit, and they cry, "Glory be to God." Now we do not
          believe that is the work of the Spirit; we believe it is ridiculous
          nonsense, and nothing more. In the old revivals in America a hundred
          years ago, commonly called "the great awakening," there were many
          strange things, such as continual shrieks and screams, and knockings,
          and twitchings, under the services. We cannot call that the work of
          the Spirit. Even the great Whitfield's revival at Cambuslang, one of
          the greatest and most remarkable revivals that were ever known, was
          attended by some things that we cannot but regard as superstitious
          wonders. People were so excited, that they did not know what they did.
          Now, if in any revival you see any of these strange contortions of the
          body, always distinguish between things that differ. The Holy Spirit's
          work is with the mind, not with the body in that way. It is not the
          will of God that such things should disgrace the proceedings. I
          believe that such things are the result of Satanic malice. The devil
          sees that there is a great deal of good doing; "Now," says he, "I'll
          spoil it all. I'll put my hoof in there, and do a world of mischief.
          There are souls being converted; I will let them get so excited that
          they will do ludicrous things, and then it will all be brought into
          contempt." Now, if you see any of these strange things arising look
          out. There is that old Apollyon busy, trying to mar the work. Put such
          vagaries down as soon as you can, for where the Spirit works, he never
          works against his own precept, and his precept is, "Let all things be
          done decently and in order." It is neither decent nor orderly for
          people to dance under the sermon, nor howl, nor scream, while the
          gospel is being preached to them, and therefore it is not the Spirit's
          work at all, but mere human excitement.
        </p>
        <p>
          And again, remember that you must always distinguish between man and
          men in the work of revival. While, during a revival of religion, a
          very large number of people will be really converted, there will be a
          very considerable portion who will be merely excited with animal
          excitement, and whose conversion will not be genuine. Always expect
          that, and do not be surprised if you see it. It is but a law of the
          mind that men should imitate one another, and it seems but reasonable,
          that when one person is truly converted, there should be a kind of
          desire to imitate it in another, who yet is not a possessor of true
          and sovereign grace. Be not discouraged, then, if you should meet with
          this in the midst of a revival. It is no proof that it is not a true
          revival; it is only a proof that it is not true in that particular
          case.
        </p>
        <p>
          I must say, once more, that if God should send us a great revival of
          religion, it will be our duty not to relax the bonds of discipline.
          Some churches, when they increase very largely, are apt to take people
          into their number by wholesale, without due and proper examination. We
          ought to be just as strict in the paroxysms of a revival as in the
          cooler times of a gradual increase, and if the Lord sends his Spirit
          like a hurricane, it is ours to deal with skill with the sails, lest
          the hurricane should wreck us by driving us upon some fell rock that
          may do us serious injury. Take care, ye that are officers in the
          church, when ye see the people stirred up, that ye exercise still a
          holy caution, lest the church become lowered in its standard of piety
          by the admission of persons not truly saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. With these words of caution, I shall now gather up my strength,
          and with all my might labour to stir you up to seek of God a great
          revival of religion throughout the length and breadth of this land.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men, brethren and fathers, the Lord God hath sent us a blessing. One
          blessing is the earnest of many. Drops precede the April showers. The
          mercies which he has already bestowed upon us are but the forerunners
          and the preludes of something greater and better yet to come. He has
          given us the former, let us seek of him the latter rain, that his
          grace may be multiplied among us, and his glory may be increased.
          There are some of you to whom I address myself this morning who stand
          in the way of any revival of religion. I would affectionately admonish
          you, and beseech you, not to impede the Lord's own work. There be some
          of you, perhaps, here present to-day who are not consistent in your
          living. And yet you are professors of religion; you take the
          sacramental cup into your hand and drink its sacred wine, but still
          you live as worldlings live, and are as carnal and as covetous as
          they. Oh, my brother, you are a serious drawback to the church's
          increase. God will never bless an unholy people, and in proportion to
          our unholiness, he will withhold the blessing from us. Tell me of a
          church that is inconsistent, you shall tell me of a church that is
          unblest. God will first sweep the house before be will come to dwell
          in it. He will have his church pure before he will bless it with all
          the blessings of his grace. Remember that, ye inconsistent ones, and
          turn unto God, and ask to be rendered holy. There are others of you
          that are so cold-hearted, that you stand in the way of all progress.
          You are a skid upon the wheels of the church. It cannot move for you.
          If we would be earnest, you put your cold band on everything that is
          bold and daring. You are not prudent and zealous; if you were so, we
          would bless God for giving you that prudence, which is a jewel for
          which we ought ever to thank God, if we have a prudent man among us.
          But there are some of you to whom I allude, who are prudent, but you
          are cold. You have no earnestness, you do not labour for Christ, you
          do not serve him with all your strength. And there are others of you
          who are imprudent enough to push others on, but never go forward
          yourselves. O ye Laodiceans, ye that are neither hot nor cold,
          remember what the Lord hath said of you -- "So then, because thou art
          neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth." And so will
          he do with you. Take heed, take heed, you are not only hurting
          yourselves, but you are injuring the church. And then there are others
          of you who are such sticklers for order, so given to everything that
          has been, that you do not care for any revival, for fear we should
          hurt you. You would not have the church repaired, lest we should touch
          one piece of the venerable moss that coats it. You would not cleanse
          your own garment, because there is ancient dirt upon it. You think
          that because a thing is ancient, therefore it must be venerable. You
          are lovers of the antique. You would not have a road mended, because
          your grandfather drove his waggon along the rut that is there. "Let it
          always be there," you say; "Let it always be knee-deep." Did not your
          grandfather go through it when it was knee deep with mud, and why
          should not you do the same? It was good enough for him, and it is good
          enough for you. You always have taken an easy seat in the chapel. You
          never saw a revival; you do not want to see it. You believe it is all
          nonsense, and that it is not to be desired. You look back; you find no
          precedent for it. Doctor So-and-so did not talk about it. Your
          venerable minister who is dead did not talk so, you say; therefore it
          is not needed. We need not tell you it is scriptural; that you do not
          care for. It is not orderly, you say. We need not tell you the thing
          is right; you care more about the thing being ancient than being good.
          Ah, you will have to get out of the way now, it isn't any good; you
          may try to stop us, but we will run over you if you do not get out of
          the way. With a little warning we shall have to run over your
          prejudices and incur your anger. But your prejudices must not, cannot,
          restrain us. The chain may be never so rusty with age, and ever so
          stamped with authority, the prisoner is always happy to break it, and
          however your fetters may shackle us, we will dash them in pieces if
          they stand in the way of the progress of the kingdom of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having thus spoken to those who hinder, I want to speak to you who
          love Jesus with all your hearts, and want to promote it. Dear friends,
          I beseech you remember that men are dying around you by thousands.
          Will you let your eye follow them into the world of shades? Myriads of
          them die without God, without Christ, without hope. My brother, does
          not their fearful fate awake your sympathy. You believe, from
          Scriptural warrant, that those who die without faith go to that place
          where "their worm dieth not and their fire is not quenched." Believing
          this, is not your soul stirred within you in pity for their fate? Look
          around you to-day. You see a vast host gathered together, professedly
          for the service of God. You know also how many there are here who fear
          him not, but are strangers to themselves and strangers to the cross.
          What! Do you know yourself what a solemn thing it is to be under the
          curse, and will you not pray and labour for those around you that are
          under the curse to-day? Remember your Master's cross. He died for
          sinners; will not you weep for them?
        </p>
        <p>"Did Christ o'er sinners weep;</p>
        <p>And shall your cheek be dry?"</p>
        <p>
          Did he give his whole life for them, and will not you stir up your
          life to wrestle with God, that his purposes may be accomplished on
          their behalf? You have unconverted children -- do you not want them
          saved? You have brothers, husbands, wives, fathers, that are this day
          in the gall of bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity; do you not
          want a revival, even if it were only for their sakes? Behold, how much
          of robbery, of murder, of crime, stains this poor land. Do you not
          want a revival of religion, if it were merely for quenching the flames
          of crime? See how God's name every day is blasphemed. Mark how, this
          day, trades are carried on, as if it were man's day, and not God's.
          Mark how multitudes are going the downward course, merry on their way
          to destruction. Do you not feel for them? Are your hearts hard and
          stolid? Has your soul become steeled? Has it become frozen like an
          iceberg? O sun of righteousness arise, and melt the icy heart, and
          make us all feel how fearful it is for immortal souls to perish; for
          men to be hurried into eternity without God, and without hope. Oh,
          will you not now, from this time forth, begin to pray that God may
          send forth his Word and save them, that his own name may be glorified?
        </p>
        <p>
          As for you that fear not God, see how much ado we are making about
          you. Your souls are worth more than you think for. O that ye would
          believe in Christ, to the salvation of your souls!<br />
