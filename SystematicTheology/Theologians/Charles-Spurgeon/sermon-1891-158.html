          1. That the Lord then was manifestly coming to His own things, and was
          sustaining them by means of that creation which is supported by
          Himself, and was making a recapitulation of that disobedience which
          had occurred in connection with a tree, through the obedience which
          was [exhibited by Himself when He hung] upon a tree, [the effects]
          also of that deception being done away with, by which that virgin Eve,
          who was already espoused to a man, was unhappily misled, -- was
          happily announced, through means of the truth [spoken] by the angel to
          the Virgin Mary, who was [also espoused] to a man. For just as the
          former was led astray by the word of an angel, so that she fled from
          God when she had transgressed His word; so did the latter, by an
          angelic communication, receive the glad tidings that she should
          sustain (portaret) God, being obedient to His word. And if the former
          did disobey God, yet the latter was persuaded to be obedient to God,
          in order that the Virgin Mary might become the patroness (advocata) of
          the virgin Eve. And thus, as the human race fell into bondage to death
          by means of a virgin, so is it rescued by a virgin; virginal
          disobedience having been balanced in the opposite scale by virginal
          obedience. For in the same way the sin of the first created man
          (protoplasti) receives amendment by the correction of the
          First-begotten, and the coming of the serpent is conquered by the
          harmlessness of the dove, those bonds being unloosed by which we had
          been fast bound to death.

          2. The heretics being all unlearned and ignorant of God's
          arrangements, and not acquainted with that dispensation by which He
          took upon Him human nature (inscii ejus qu√¶ est secundum hominem
          dispensationis), inasmuch as they blind themselves with regard to the
          truth, do in fact speak against their own salvation. Some of them
          introduce another Father besides the Creator; some, again, say that
          the world and its substance was made by certain angels; certain others
          [maintain] that it was widely separated by Horos from him whom they
          represent as being the Father -- that it sprang forth (floruisse) of
          itself, and from itself was born. Then, again, others [of them assert]
          that it obtained substance in those things which are contained by the
          Father, from defect and ignorance; others still, despise the advent of
          the Lord manifest [to the senses], for they do not admit His
          incarnation; while others, ignoring the arrangement [that He should be
          born] of a virgin, maintain that He was begotten by Joseph. And still
          further, some affirm that neither their soul nor their body can
          receive eternal life, but merely the inner man. Moreover, they will
          have it that this [inner man] is that which is the understanding
          (sensum) in them, and which they decree as being the only thing to
          ascend to "the perfect." Others [maintain], as I have said in the
          first book, that while the soul is saved, their body does not
          participate in the salvation which comes from God; in which [book] I
          have also set forward the hypotheses of all these men, and in the
          second have pointed out their weakness and inconsistency.<br />
