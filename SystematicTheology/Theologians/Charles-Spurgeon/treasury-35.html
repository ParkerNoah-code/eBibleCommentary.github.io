<p align="center">PSALM 34 <br/>
 </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">TITLE. <b>Psalm of David, when he changed his behavior 
    before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed</b>. Of this 
    transaction, which reflects no credit upon David's memory, we have a brief 
    account in 1 Samuel 21:1-15. Although the gratitude of the psalmist prompted 
    him thankfully to record the goodness of the Lord in vouchsafing an 
    undeserved deliverance—yet he weaves none of the incidents of the escape 
    into the narrative, but dwells only on the grand fact of his being heard in 
    the hour of peril. </p>
<p align="justify">We may learn from his example <i>not to parade our sins 
    before others</i>, as certain vainglorious professors are accustomed to do, 
    who seem as proud of their sins as old soldiers of their battles and their 
    wounds. David played the fool with singular dexterity, but he was not so 
    real a fool as to sing of his own exploits of folly. </p>
<p align="justify">In the original, the title does not teach us that the 
    psalmist composed this poem at the time of his escape from Achish the king, 
    or Abimelech of Gath, but that it is intended to commemorate that event, and 
    was suggested by it. It is well to mark our mercies with well-carved 
    memorials. God deserves our best handiwork. </p>
<p align="justify">David in view of the special peril from which he was 
    rescued, was at great pains with this Psalm, and wrote it with considerable 
    regularity, in almost exact accordance with the letters of the Hebrew 
    alphabet. This is the second <i>alphabetical Psalm</i>, the twenty-fifth 
    being the first.</p>
<p align="justify">DIVISION. The Psalm is split into two great divisions at 
    the close of Verse 10, when the Psalmist having expressed his praise to God, 
    turns in direct address to men. The first ten verses are A HYMN, and the 
    last twelve A SERMON. </p>
<p align="justify">For further assistance to the reader we may subdivide 
    thus:</p>
<p align="justify">In Verses 1-3, David vows to bless the Lord, and invites 
    the praise of others.</p>
<p align="justify">From Verses 4-7 David he relates his experience.</p>
<p align="justify">In Verses 8-10 he exhorts the godly to constancy of 
    faith.</p>
<p align="justify">In Verses 1-14, David gives direct exhortation.</p>
<p align="justify">He follows it up by didactic teaching from Verses 15-22 
    to the close.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. I will bless the Lord at all times. </p></b>He is 
    resolved and fixed<i>, I will!</i> He is personally and for himself 
    determined, let others so as they may. He is intelligent in head and 
    inflamed in heart—he knows to whom the praise is due, and what is due, and 
    for what and when. 
<p align="justify">To Jehovah, and not to second causes our gratitude is to 
    be rendered. The Lord has by right a monopoly in his creatures praise. Even 
    when a mercy may remind us of our sin with regard to it, as in this case 
    David's deliverance from the Philistine monarch was sure to do—we are not to 
    rob God of his honor because our conscience justly awards a censure to our 
    share in the transaction. </p>
<p align="justify">Though the hook was rusty—yet God sent the fish, and we 
    thank him for it. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">At all times</p></b>, in every situation, under every 
    circumstance, before, in and after trials, in bright days of glee, and dark 
    nights of fear. He would never be done praising, because never satisfied 
    that he had done enough; always feeling that he fell short of the Lord's 
    deservings. Happy is he whose fingers are wedded to his harp. <i>He who 
    praises God for mercies, shall never want a mercy for which to praise. </i>
    To bless the Lord is never unseasonable. 
<b>
<p align="justify">His praise shall continually be in my mouth</p></b>, not in 
    my heart merely, but in my mouth too. Our thankfulness is not to be a silent 
    thing; it should be one of the daughters of music. Our tongue is our glory, 
    and it ought to reveal the glory of God. 
<p align="justify">What a blessed mouthful is God's praise! How sweet, how 
    purifying, how perfuming! If men's mouths were always thus filled, there 
    would be no repining against God, or slander of neighbors.<i> If we 
    continually rolled this dainty morsel under our tongue—the bitterness of 
    daily affliction would be swallowed up in joy. </i>God deserves blessing 
    with the heart, and extolling with the mouth—good thoughts in the closet, 
    and good words in the world.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. My soul shall make her boast in the Lord.</p></b> 
    Boasting is a very natural propensity, and if it were used as in this case, 
    the more it were indulged the better. The exultation of this verse is no 
    mere <i>tongue </i>bragging, "the soul" is in it, the boasting is meant and 
    felt before it is expressed. 
<p align="justify">What scope there is for holy boasting in Jehovah! His 
    person, attributes, covenant, promises, works, and a thousand things 
    besides—are all incomparable, unparalleled, and matchless! We may cry them 
    up as we please, but we shall never be convicted of vain and empty speech in 
    so doing. </p>
<p align="justify">Truly he who writes these words of comment has nothing of 
    his own to boast of, but much to lament over—and yet none shall stop him of 
    his boast in God so long as he lives. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.</p></b> They are 
    usually grieved to hear boastings—they turn aside from vauntings and lofty 
    speeches. But boasting in the Lord is quite another matter; by this the most 
    lowly are consoled and encouraged. The confident expressions of tried 
    believers are a rich solace to their brethren of less experience. We ought 
    to talk of the Lord's goodness, on purpose that others may be confirmed in 
    their trust in a faithful God.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. O magnify the Lord with me. </p></b>Is this request 
    addressed to the humble? If so it is most fitting. Who can make God great, 
    but those who feel themselves to be little? He bids them help him to make 
    the Lord's fame greater among the sons of men. 
<p align="justify">Jehovah is infinite, and therefore cannot really be made 
    greater—but his name grows in <i>manifested glory </i>as he is made known to 
    his creatures, and thus he is said to be magnified. It is well when the soul 
    feels its own inability adequately to glorify the Lord—and therefore stirs 
    up others to the gracious work; this is good both for the man himself and 
    for his companions. </p>
<p align="justify">No praise can excel that which lays us prostrate under a 
    sense of our own nothingness, while divine grace like some topless Alp rises 
    before our eyes, and sinks us lower and lower in holy awe.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us exalt his name together. Social, congregated 
    worship is the outgrowth of one of the natural instincts of the new life. In 
    Heaven it is enjoyed to the full, and earth is most like Heaven where it 
    abounds.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. I sought the Lord, and he heard me.</p></b> It must 
    have been in a very confused manner that David prayed, and there must have 
    been much of self-sufficiency in his prayer, or he would not have resorted 
    to methods of such dubious morality as pretending to be mad and behaving as 
    a lunatic. Yet his poor limping prayer had an acceptance and brought him 
    support—the more reason for then celebrating the abounding mercy of the 
    Lord. 
<p align="justify">We may seek God even when we have sinned. If sin could 
    blockade the mercy-seat it would be all over with us, but the mercy is that 
    there are gifts even for the rebellious, and an advocate for men who sin.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And delivered me from all my fears.</p></b> God makes a 
    perfect work of it. He clears away both our fears and their causes, all of 
    them without exception. Glory be to his name—prayer sweeps the field, slays 
    all the enemies and even buries their bones. 
<p align="justify">We need not blush to speak of ourselves when in so doing 
    we honestly aim at glorifying God, and not at exalting ourselves. Some are 
    foolishly squeamish upon this point, but they should remember that<i> when 
    modesty robs God it is most immodest.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. They looked unto him, and were lightened.</p></b> 
    The psalmist avows that his case was not at all peculiar, it was matched in 
    the lives of all the faithful; they too, each one of them on looking to 
    their Lord were brightened up, their faces began to shine, their spirits 
    were uplifted. What a means of blessing one look at the Lord may be! <i>
    There is life, light, liberty, love, everything in fact, in a look at the 
    crucified One.
</i>
<p align="justify">Never did a sore heart look in vain to the good 
    Physician; never a dying soul turned its darkening eye to the brazen serpent 
    to find its virtue gone. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And their faces were not ashamed.</p></b> Their faces were 
    covered with joy, but not with blushes. He who trusts in God has no need to 
    be ashamed of his confidence, time and eternity will both justify his 
    reliance.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. This poor man cried.</p></b> Here he returns to his 
    own case. He was poor indeed, and so utterly friendless that his life was in 
    great jeopardy; but he cried in his heart to the protector of his people and 
    found relief.
<p align="justify">His prayer was a cry, for brevity and bitterness, for 
    earnestness and simplicity, for artlessness and grief. It was a poor man's 
    cry, but it was none the less powerful with Heaven, for the Lord heard him, 
    and to be heard by God is to be delivered; and so it is added that <b>the 
    Lord saved him out of all his troubles</b>. </p>
<p align="justify">At once and altogether David was clean rid of all his 
    woes. The Lord sweeps our griefs away as men destroy a hive of hornets, or 
    as the winds clear away the mists. Prayer can clear us of troubles as easily 
    as the Lord made riddance of the frogs and flies of Egypt when Moses 
    entreated him. </p>
<p align="justify">This verse is the psalmist's own personal testimony—he 
    being dead yet speaks. Let the afflicted reader take heart and be of good 
    courage.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. The angel of the Lord.</p></b> The covenant angel, 
    the Lord Jesus, at the head of all the bands of Heaven, surrounds with his 
    army the dwellings of the saints. Like hosts entrenched, so are the 
    ministering spirits encamped around the Lord's chosen, to serve and support, 
    to defend and console them. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Encamps round about those who fear him.</p></b> On every side 
    the watch is kept by warriors of sleepless eyes, and the Captain of the host 
    is one whose prowess none can resist. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And delivers them.</p></b> We little know how many 
    providential deliverances we owe to those unseen hands which are charged to 
    bear us up lest we dash our foot against a stone.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. O taste and see.</p></b> Make a trial, an inward, 
    experimental trial of the goodness of God. You cannot see except by tasting 
    for yourself; but if you taste you shall see, for this, like Jonathan's 
    honey, enlightens the eyes. 
<b>
<p align="justify">That the Lord is good. </p></b>You can only know this really 
    and personally by experience. There is the banquet with its oxen and 
    fatlings; its fat things full of marrow, and wine on the lees well refined; 
    but their sweetness will be all unknown to you except you make the blessings 
    of grace your own, by a living, inward, vital participation in them. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Blessed is the man that trusts in him.</p></b> Faith is the 
    soul's taste. They who test the Lord by their confidence always find him 
    good, and they become themselves blessed. The second clause of the verse, is 
    the argument in support of the exhortation contained in the first sentence.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. O fear the Lord, you his saints.</p></b> Pay to him 
    humble childlike reverence, walk in his laws, have respect to his will, 
    tremble to offend him, hasten to serve him. Fear not the wrath of men, 
    neither be tempted to sin through the virulence of their threats. Fear God, 
    and fear nothing else. 
<b>
<p align="justify">For there is no lack to those who fear him.</p></b> Jehovah 
    will not allow his faithful servants to starve. He may not give <i>luxuries</i>, 
    but the promise binds him to supply <i>necessities</i>, and he will not run 
    back from his word. Many whims and wishes may remain unfulfilled, but <i>
    real wants </i>the Lord will supply. 
<i>
<p align="justify">The fear of the Lord</p></i> or true piety is not only the 
    duty of those who avow themselves to be saints, that is, people set apart 
    and consecrated for holy duties, but it is also their path of safety and 
    comfort. Godliness has the promise of the life which now is. If we were to 
    die like dogs, and there were no hereafter—yet were it well for our own 
    happiness' sake to fear the Lord. Men seek a patron and hope to prosper. He 
    prospers surely who has the Lord Almighty to be his friend and defender.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. The young lions lack, and suffer hunger. </p></b>
    They are fierce, cunning, strong, in all the vigor of youth, and yet they 
    sometimes howl in their ravenous hunger. Even so crafty, designing, and 
    oppressing men, with all their sagacity and unscrupulousness, often come to 
    want. Yet simple-minded believers, who dare not act as the greedy lions of 
    earth, are fed with food necessary for them. To trust God is better policy 
    than the craftiest politicians can teach or practice. 
<b>
<p align="justify">But those who seek the Lord shall not want any good 
    thing.</p></b> No really good thing shall be denied to those whose first and 
    main end in life is to seek the Lord. Men may call them fools, but the Lord 
    will prove them wise. They shall win where the world's wiseacres lose their 
    all, and God shall have the glory of it.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. Come, you children. </p></b>Though a warrior and a 
    king, the psalmist was not ashamed to teach children. Teachers of youth 
    belong to the true peerage; their work is honorable, and their reward shall 
    be glorious. Perhaps the boys and girls of Gath had made sport of David in 
    his seeming madness, and if so, he here aims by teaching the rising race to 
    undo the mischief which he had done aforetime. <i>Children are the most 
    hopeful ones to teach—wise men who wish to propagate their principles take 
    care to win the ear of the young. 
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Hearken unto me, and I will teach you the fear of the 
    Lord.</p></b> So far as they can be taught by word of mouth, or learned by the 
    hearing of the ear, we are to communicate the faith and fear of God, 
    inculcating upon the rising generation the principles and practices of 
    piety. 
<p align="justify">This verse may be the address of every Sunday school 
    teacher to his class, and of every parent to his children. It is not without 
    instruction in the art of teaching. <i>We should be winning and attractive 
    to the youngsters</i>, bidding them "come," and not repelling them with 
    harsh terms. We must get them away, apart from toys and sports, and try to 
    occupy their minds with better pursuits. For we cannot well teach them while 
    their minds are full of other things. We must drive at the main point 
    always, and keep the fear of the Lord ever uppermost in our teachings, and 
    in so doing we may discreetly cast our own personality into the scale by 
    narrating our own experiences and convictions.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. Who is the man who desires life and loves 
    length of days that he may see good? </p></b>Life spent in happiness is the 
    desire of all, and he who can give the young a receipt for leading a happy 
    life deserves to be popular among them. Mere existence is not life—the art 
    of living, truly, really, and joyfully living, it is not given to all men to 
    know.
<i>
<p align="justify">To teach men how to live and how to die, is the aim of 
    all useful religious instruction.</p></i> The rewards of virtue are the baits 
    with which the young are to be drawn to morality. While we teach piety to 
    God, we should also dwell much upon morality towards man.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. Keep your tongue from evil. </p></b>Guard with 
    careful diligence that dangerous member, the tongue, lest it utter evil; for 
    that evil will recoil upon you, and mar the enjoyment of your life. <i>Men 
    cannot spit forth poison without feeling some of the venom burning their own 
    flesh. 
</i><b>
<p align="justify">And your lips from speaking deceit.</p></b> Deceit must be 
    very earnestly avoided by the man who desires happiness. <i>A crafty schemer 
    lives like a spy in the enemy's camp, in constant fear of exposure and 
    execution</i>. Clean and honest conversation, by keeping the conscience at 
    ease, promotes happiness—but lying and wicked talk stuffs our pillow with 
    thorns, and makes life a constant whirl of fear and shame! David had tried 
    the tortuous policy, but he here denounces it, and begs others as they would 
    live long and well, to avoid with care the doubtful devices of deceit.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14. Depart from evil. </p></b>Go away from it. Not 
    merely take your hands off—but yourself off. Do not live near the pest 
    house! Avoid the lion's lair! Leave the viper's nest! Set a distance between 
    yourself and temptation. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And do good. </p></b>Be practical, active, energetic, 
    persevering in good. Positive virtue, promotes negative virtue; he who does 
    good, is sure to avoid evil. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Seek peace.</p></b> Not merely prefer it, but with zeal and 
    care endeavor to promote it. Peace with <i>God</i>, with your own <i>heart</i>, 
    with your fellow <i>man</i>—search after this as the merchantman after a 
    precious pearl. 
<p align="justify">Nothing can more effectually promote our own happiness 
    than peace; strife awakens passions which eat into the heart with corroding 
    power. Anger is murder to one's own self, as well as to its objects. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And pursue it. </p></b>Hunt after it, chase it with eager 
    desire. It may soon be lost. Indeed, nothing is harder to retain than peace, 
    but do your best, and if enmity should arise let it be no fault of yours. 
    Follow after peace, even when it shuns you; be resolved never to be of a 
    contentious spirit. The peace which you thus promote will be returned into 
    your own bosom, and be a perennial spring of comfort to you.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 15. The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous.</p></b> 
    He observes them with approval and tender consideration. They are so dear to 
    him, that he cannot take his eyes off them. He watches each one of them as 
    carefully and intently, as if there were only that one creature in the whole 
    universe!
<b>
<p align="justify">His ears are open unto their cry.</p></b> Thus the Lord's <i>
    eyes </i>and <i>ears </i>are both turned his saints. His whole mind is 
    occupied about them. If they are slighted by all others, they are not 
    neglected by him. He hears their cry at once, even as a mother is sure to 
    hear her sick babe. The cry may be broken, plaintive, unhappy, feeble, 
    unbelieving—yet the Father's quick ear catches each note of lament or 
    appeal, and he is quick to answer his children's voice.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 16. The face of the Lord is against those who do 
    evil</p></b>. God is not indifferent to the deeds of sinners, but he sets his 
    face against them—being determined that they shall have no countenance and 
    support, but shall be thwarted and defeated. He is determinately resolved 
    that the ungodly shall not prosper—he sets himself with all his might to 
    overthrow them! 
<b>
<p align="justify">To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. </p></b>He 
    will stamp out their remembrance, their honor shall be turned into shame, 
    their names forgotten or accursed. Utter destruction shall be the lot of all 
    the ungodly!
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 17. The righteous cry.</p></b> Like Israel in Egypt, 
    they cry out under the heavy yoke of oppression, both of sin, temptation, 
    care, and grief. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And the Lord hears.</p></b> He is like the night watchman, 
    who no sooner hears the alarm bell, than he flies to relieve those who need 
    him.
<b>
<p align="justify">And delivers them out of all their troubles. </p></b>No <i>
    net </i>of trouble can so hold us, that the Lord cannot free us. Our 
    afflictions may be numerous and complicated—but prayer can set us free from 
    them all, for the Lord will show himself strong on our behalf.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 18. The Lord is near unto those who are of a broken 
    heart.</p></b> He is near in friendship to accept and console. Broken hearts 
    think God far away—when he is really most near them; their eyes are closed 
    so that they see not their best friend. Indeed, he is with them, and in 
    them, but they know it not. They run hither and thither, seeking peace in 
    their own works, or in experiences, or in proposals and resolutions—whereas 
    the Lord is near them, and the simple act of faith will reveal him. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And saves such as have a contrite spirit.</p></b> What a 
    blessed token for good is a repentant, mourning heart! Just when the sinner 
    condemns himself, the Lord graciously absolves him. If we chasten our own 
    spirits, the Lord will spare us. He never breaks with the rod of judgment, 
    those who are already sore with the rod of conviction. <i>Salvation </i>is 
    linked with <i>contrition</i>.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 19. Many are the afflictions of the righteous. </p></b>
    Thus are they made like Jesus their covenant Head. Scripture does not 
    flatter us like the story books with the idea that goodness will secure us 
    from trouble. On the contrary, we are again and again warned to expect 
    tribulation while we are in this fallen world. Our afflictions come from all 
    points of the compass, and are as many and as tormenting as the mosquitoes 
    of the tropics. 
<p align="justify">It is the earthly portion of the elect to find thorns and 
    briars growing in their pathway—yes, to lie down among them, finding their 
    rest broken and disturbed by sorrow.<b> </b></p>
<p align="justify">But the Lord delivers him out of them all. BUT, 
    blessed but, how it takes the sting out of the previous sentence! Through 
    troops of ills Jehovah shall lead his redeemed scatheless and triumphant. 
    There is an end to the believer's affliction, and a joyful end too. None of 
    his trials can hurt so much as a hair of his head, neither can the furnace 
    hold him for a moment after the Lord bids him come forth from it. Hard would 
    be the lot of the righteous if this promise, like a bundle of camphire, were 
    not bound up in it. BUT—this sweetens all. The same Lord who sends the 
    afflictions, will also recall them when his design is accomplished; but he 
    will never allow the fiercest of them to rend and devour his beloved.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 20. He keeps all his bones—not one of them is 
    broken. </p></b>David had come off with kicks and cuffs, but no broken bones. No 
    substantial injury occurs to the saints. Eternity will heal all their 
    wounds. Their real self is safe—they may have flesh wounds, but no part of 
    the essential fabric of their being shall be broken. 
<p align="justify">This verse may refer to <i>frequent providential 
    protections </i>given to the saints. But as godly men have had broken limbs 
    as well as others, it cannot absolutely be applied to bodily preservations. 
    It must, it seems to me, be <i>spiritually applied to great injuries of soul</i>, 
    which are forever prevented by divine love. </p>
<p align="justify">Not a bone of the mystical body of Christ shall be 
    broken, even as his corporeal frame was preserved intact. Divine love 
    watches over every believer as it did over Jesus. No fatal injury shall 
    happen to us, we shall neither be halt or maimed in the kingdom, but shall 
    be presented after life's trials are over, without spot or wrinkle or any 
    such thing—being preserved in Christ Jesus, and kept by the power of God 
    through faith unto salvation.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 21. Evil shall slay the wicked. </p></b>Their 
    adversaries shall be killing; they are not medicine, but poison. Ungodly men 
    only need rope enough, and they will hang themselves. Their own iniquities 
    shall be their punishment. <i>Hell itself is but sin fully developed</i>, 
    torturing those in whom it dwells. Oh! happy are they who have fled to Jesus 
    to find refuge from their former sins—such, and such only will escape. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And those who hate the righteous shall be desolate.</p></b> 
    They hated the best of company, and they shall have none. They shall be 
    forsaken, despoiled, wretched, despairing. God makes the viper poison 
    itself. What desolation of heart do the damned feel, and how greatly have 
    they deserved it!
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 22. The Lord redeems the soul of his servants</p></b>—with 
    price and with power, with blood and with water. All providential helps are 
    a part of the redemption by power, hence the Lord is said still to redeem. 
    All thus ransomed belong to him who bought them—this is the law of justice 
    and the verdict of gratitude. Joyfully will we serve him who so graciously 
    purchases us with his blood, and delivers us by his power. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And none who trust in him shall be desolate.</p></b> Faith is 
    the mark of the ransomed, and wherever it is seen, though in the least and 
    poorest of the saints, it ensures eternal salvation. Believer, you shall 
    never be deserted, forsaken, given up to ruin. God, even your God, is your 
    guardian and friend, and eternal bliss.
