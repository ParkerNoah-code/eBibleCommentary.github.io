          TITLE. A Song of degrees of David. Of course the superfine critics
          have pounced upon this title as inaccurate, but we are at liberty to
          believe as much or as little of their assertions as we may please.
          They declare that there are certain ornaments of language in this
          little ode which were unknown in the Davidic period. It may be so; but
          in their superlative wisdom they have ventured upon so many other
          questionable statements that we are not bound to receive this dictum.
          Assuredly the manner of the song is very like to David's, and we are
          unable to see why he should be excluded from the authorship. Whether
          it be his composition or not, it breathes the same spirit as that
          which animates the unchallenged songs of the royal composer.

          DIVISION. This short Psalm contains an acknowledgment of favor
          received by way of special deliverance (1-5), <br />
          then a grateful act of worship in blessing Jehovah (6, 7), <br />
          and, lastly, a declaration of confidence in the Lord for all future
          time of trial. May our experience lead us to the same conclusion as
          the saints of David's time. From all confidence in man may we be
          rescued by a holy reliance upon our God.<br />

            Verse 1. If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, now may
            Israel say.
          </p></b
        >The opening sentence is abrupt, and remains a fragment. By such a
        commencement attention was aroused as well as feeling expressed: and
        this is ever the way of poetic fire—to break forth in uncontrollable
        flame. The many words in italics in our authorized version will show the
        reader that the translators did their best to patch up the passage,
        which, perhaps, had better have been left in its broken grandeur, and it
        would then have run thus: "Had it not been Jehovah! He was for us, oh
        let Israel say! Had it not been Jehovah! He who was for us when men rose
        against us."
        <p align="justify">
          The glorious Lord became our ally; he took our part, and entered into
          treaty with us. If Jehovah were not our protector where would we be?
          Nothing but his power and wisdom could have guarded us from the
          cunning and malice of our adversaries; therefore, let all his people
          say so, and openly give him the honor of his preserving goodness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here are two "ifs," and yet there is no "if" in the matter. The Lord
          was on our side, and is still our defender, and will be so from
          henceforth, even forever. Let us with holy confidence exult in this
          joyful fact. We are far too slow in declaring our gratitude, hence the
          exclamation which should be rendered, "O let Israel say." We murmur
          without being stirred up to it, but our thanksgiving needs a spur, and
          it is well when some warm hearted friend bids us say what we feel.
          Imagine what would have happened if the Lord had left us, and then see
          what has happened because he has been faithful to us. Are not all the
          materials of a song spread before us? Let us sing unto the Lord.

            Verse 2. If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men
            rose up against us.
          </p></b
        >
        When all men combined, and the whole race of men seemed set upon
        stamping out the house of Israel, what must have happened if the
        covenant Lord had not interposed? When they stirred themselves, and
        combined to make an assault upon our quietude and safety, what would we
        have done in their rising if the Lord had not also risen? No one who
        could or would help was near, but the bare arm of the Lord sufficed to
        preserve his own against all the leagued hosts of adversaries.
        <p align="justify">
          There is no doubt as to our deliverer, we cannot ascribe our salvation
          to any second cause, for it would not have been equal to the
          emergency; nothing less than omnipotence and omniscience could have
          wrought our rescue. We set every other claimant on one side, and
          rejoice because the Lord was on our side.

        >They were so eager for our destruction that they would have made only
        one morsel of us, and have swallowed us up alive and whole in a single
        instant. The fury of the enemies of the church is raised to the highest
        pitch, nothing will content them but the total annihilation of God's
        chosen. Their wrath is like a fire which is kindled, and has taken such
        firm hold upon the fuel that there is no quenching it.

        <p align="justify">
          Anger is never more fiery than when the people of God are its objects.
          Sparks become flames, and the furnace is heated seven times hotter
          when God's elect are to be thrust into the blaze. The cruel world
          would make a full end of the godly seed, were it not that Jehovah bars
          the way. When the Lord appears, the cruel throats cannot swallow, and
          the consuming fires cannot destroy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Ah, if it were not Jehovah, if our help came from all the creatures
          united, there would be no way of escape for us: it is only because the
          Lord lives that his people are alive.

          <p align="justify">Verse 4. Then the waters had overwhelmed us.</p></b
        >
        Rising irresistibly, like the Nile, the flood of opposition would soon
        have rolled over our heads. Across the mighty waste of waters we should
        have cast an anxious eye, but looked in vain for escape.
        <p align="justify">
          The motto of a royal house is, "Tossed about but not submerged." We
          should have needed an epitaph rather than an epigram, for we should
          have been driven by the torrent and sunken, never to rise again. The
          stream had gone over our soul. The rushing torrent would have drowned
          our soul, our hope, our life. The figures seem to be the steadily
          rising flood, and the hurriedly rushing stream. Who can stand against
          two such mighty powers? Everything is destroyed by these unconquerable
          forces, either by being submerged or swept away.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When the world's enmity obtains a vent it both rises and rushes, it
          rages and rolls along, and spares nothing. In the great water floods
          of persecution and affliction who can help but Jehovah? But for him
          where would we be at this very hour? We have experienced seasons in
          which the combined forces of earth and Hell must have made an end of
          us had not omnipotent grace interfered for our rescue.

            Verse 5. Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.

        >The figure represents the waves as proud, and so they seem to be when
        they overleap the bulwarks of a frail bark, and threaten every moment to
        sink her. The opposition of men is usually embittered by a haughty scorn
        which derides all our godly efforts as mere fanaticism or obstinate
        ignorance.
        <p align="justify">
          In all the persecutions of the church a cruel contempt has largely
          mingled with the oppression, and this is overpowering to the soul. Had
          not God been with us our disdainful enemies would have made nothing of
          us, and dashed over us as a mountain torrent sweeps down the side of a
          hill, driving everything before it. Not only would our goods and
          possessions have been carried off, but our soul, our courage, our hope
          would have been borne away by the impetuous assault, and buried
          beneath the insults of our antagonists.

        <p align="justify">
          Let us pause here, and as we see what might have been, let us adore
          the guardian power which has kept us in the flood, and yet above the
          flood. In our hours of dire peril, we must have perished had not our
          Preserver prevailed for our safe keeping.

        Leaving the metaphor of a boiling flood, he compares the adversaries of
        Israel to <i>wild beasts who desired to make the godly their prey</i>.
        Their teeth are prepared to tear, and they regard the godly as their
        victims. The Lord is heartily praised for not permitting his servants to
        be devoured when they were between the jaws of the raging ones. It
        implies that none can harm us until the Lord permits: we cannot be their
        prey unless the Lord gives us up to them, and that our loving Lord will
        never do. Hitherto he has refused permission to any foe to destroy us,
        blessed be his name.

          >The more imminent the danger the more eminent the mercy which would

        >God be blessed forever for keeping us from the curse. Jehovah be
        praised for checking the fury of the foe, and saving his own. The verse
        reads like a merely negative blessing, but no blessing can be more
        positively precious. He has given us to his Son Jesus, and he will never
        give us to our enemies.

            Verse 7. Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the
            fowlers.
          </p></b
        >
        Our soul is like a bird for many reasons; but in this case the point of
        likeness is weakness, folly, and the ease with which it is enticed into
        the snare. Fowlers have many methods of taking small birds, and Satan
        has many methods of entrapping souls. Some are decoyed by evil
        companions, others are enticed by the love of dainties; hunger drives
        many into the trap, and fright impels numbers to fly into the net.
        Fowlers know their birds, and how to capture them; but the birds see not
        the snare so as to avoid it, and they cannot break it so as to escape
        from it.
        <p align="justify">
          Happy is the bird that has a deliverer strong, and mighty, and ready
          in the moment of peril: happier still is the soul over which the Lord
          watches day and night to pluck its feet out of the net. What joy there
          is in this song, "our soul is escaped." How the emancipated one sings
          and soars, and soars and sings again.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Blessed be God, many of us can make joyous music with these notes,
          "our soul is escaped." Escaped from our natural slavery; escaped from
          the guilt, the degradation, the habit, the dominion of sin; escaped
          from the vain deceits and fascinations of Satan; escaped from all that
          can destroy—we do indeed experience delight. What a wonder of grace it
          is! What a miraculous escape that we who are so easily misled should
          not have been permitted to die by the dread fowler's hand. The Lord
          has heard the prayer which he taught us to pray, and he has delivered
          us from evil.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">The snare is broken, and we are escaped!</p></b
        >The song is worth repeating; it is well to dwell upon so great a mercy.
        The snare may be false doctrine, pride, lust, or a temptation to indulge
        in worldliness, or to despair, or to presume; what a high favor it is to
        have it broken before our eyes, so that it has no more power over us. We
        see not the mercy while we are in the snare; perhaps we are so foolish
        as to deplore the breaking of the Satanic charm; the gratitude comes
        when the escape is seen, and when we perceive what we have escaped from,
        and by what hand we have been set free. Then our Lord has a song from
        our mouths and hearts as we make Heaven and earth ring with the notes,
        "the snare is broken, and we are escaped."
        <p align="justify">
          We have been tempted, but not taken; cast down, but not destroyed;
          perplexed, but not in despair; in deaths oft, but still alive—blessed
          be Jehovah! This song might well have suited our whole nation at the
          time of the Spanish Armada, the church in the days of the Jesuits, and
          each believer among us in seasons of strong personal temptation.

          who has fashioned us will watch over us; yes, he has done so, and
          rendered us help in the moment of jeopardy. He is our help and our
          shield, even he alone. He will to the end break every snare. He made
          Heaven for us, and he will keep us for Heaven; he made the earth, and
