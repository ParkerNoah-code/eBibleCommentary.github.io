        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.174)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Evening, November 8, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for
          it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things
          which are written in the book of the law to do them." -- Galatians
          3:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          MY HEARER, ART THOU a believer, or no? for, according to thine answer
          to that question, must be the style in which I shall address thee
          to-night. I would ask thee as a great favor to thine own soul, this
          evening to divest thyself of the thought that thou art sitting in a
          chapel, and hearing a minister who is preaching to a large
          congregation. Think thou art sitting in thine own house, in thine own
          chair, and think that I am standing by thee, with thy hand in mine,
          and am speaking personally to thee, and to thee alone; for that is how
          I desire to preach this night to each of my hearers -- one by one. I
          want thee, then, in the sight of God, to answer me this all important
          and solemn question before I begin -- Art thou in Christ, or art thou
          not? Hast thou fled for refuge to him who is the only hope for
          sinners? or art thou yet a stranger to the commonwealth of Israel,
          ignorant of God, and of his holy Gospel? Come -- be honest with thine
          own heart, and let thy conscience say yes, or no, for one of these two
          things thou art to-night -- thou art either under the wrath of God, or
          thou art delivered from it. Thou art to-night either an heir of wrath,
          or an inheritor of the kingdom of grace. Which of these two? Make no
          "ifs" or "ahs" in your answer. Answer straight forward to thine own
          soul; and if there be any doubt whatever about it, I beseech thee rest
          not till that doubt be resolved. Do not take advantage of that doubt
          to thyself, but rather take a disadvantage from it. Depend upon it,
          thou art more likely to be wrong than thou art to be right; and now
          put thyself in the scale, and if thou dost not kick the beam entirely,
          but if thou hangest between the two, and thou sayest, "I know not
          which," better that thou shouldst decide for the worst, though it
          should grieve thyself, than that thou shouldst decide for the better,
          and be deceived, and so go on presumptuously until the pit of hell
          shall wake thee from thy self-deception. Canst thou, then, with one
          hand upon God's holy word, and the other upon thine own heart, lifts
          thine eye to heaven, and say, "One thing I know, that whereas I was
          blind, now I see; I know that I have passed from death unto life, I am
          not now what I once was; I the chief of sinners am, but Jesus died for
          me.' And if I be not awfully deceived, I am this night "A sinner saved
          by blood, a monument of grace?'" My brother, God speed you; the
          blessing of the Most High be with you. My text has no thunders in it
          for you. Instead of this verse, turn to the 13th, and there read your
          inheritance -- "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law,
          being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that
          hangeth on a tree." So Christ was cursed in the stead of you, and you
          are secure, if you are truly converted, and really a regenerated child
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But my hearer, I am solemnly convinced that a large proportion of this
          assembly dare not say so; and thou to-night (for I am speaking
          personally to thee), remember that thou art one of those who dare not
          say this, for thou art a stranger to the grace of God. Thou durst not
          lie before God, and thine own conscience, therefore thou dost honestly
          say, "I know I was never regenerated; I am now what I always was, and
          that is the most I can say." Now, with you I have to deal, and I
          charge you by him who shall judge the quick and the dead, before whom
          you and I must soon appear, listen to the words I speak, for they may
          be the last warning you shall ever hear, and I charge my own soul
          also, be thou faithful to these dying men, lest haply on thy skirts at
          last should be found the blood of souls, and thou thyself shouldst be
          a castaway. O God, make us faithful this night and give the hearing
          ear, and the retentive memory, and the conscience touched by the
          Spirit, for Jesus' sake.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, to-night we shall try the prisoner; secondly, we shall declare
          his sentence; and thirdly, if we find him confessing and penitent, we
          shall proclaim his deliverance; but not unless we find him so.
        </p>
        <p>I. First, then, we are about to TRY THE PRISONER.</p>
        <p>
          The text says -- "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all
          things which are written in the book of the law to do them."
          Unconverted man, are you guilty, or not guilty? Have you continued "in
          all things that are written in the book of the law to do them?"
          Methinks you will not dare to plead, "Not guilty." But I will suppose
          for one moment that you are bold enough to do so. So, then, sir, you
          mean to assert that you have continued "in all things which are
          written in the book of the law." Surely the very reading of the law
          would be enough to convince thee that thou art in error. Dost thou
          know what the law is? Why, I will give thee what I may call the
          outside of it, but remember that within it there is a broader spirit
          than the mere words. Hear thou these words of the law -- "Thou shalt
          have no other gods before me." What! hast thou never loved anything
          better than God? Hast thou never made a god of thy belly, or of thy
          business, or of thy family, or of thine own person? Oh! surely thou
          durst not say thou art guiltless here. "Thou shalt not make unto thee
          any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above,
          or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the
          earth." What! hast thou never in thy life set up anything in the place
          of God? If thou hast not, I have, full many a time. And I wot, if
          conscience would speak truly, it would say, "Man, thou hast been a
          mammon worshiper, thou hast been a belly worshiper, thou hast bowed
          down before gold and silver; thou hast cast thyself down before honor,
          thou hast bowed before pleasure, thou hast made a god of thy
          drunkenness, a god of thy lust, a god of thy uncleanness, a god of thy
          pleasures!" Wilt thou dare to say that thou hast never taken the name
          of the Lord thy of God in vain? If thou hast never sworn profanely,
          yet surely in common conversation thou hast sometimes made use of
          God's name when thou oughtest not to have done so. Say, hast thou
          always hallowed that most holy name? Hast thou never called upon God
          without necessity? Hast thou never read his book with a trifling
          spirit? Hast thou never heard his gospel without paying reverence to
          it? Surely thou art guilty here. And as for that fourth commandment,
          which relates to the keeping of the Sabbath -- "Remember the Sabbath
          day to keep it holy," -- hast thou never broken it? Oh, shut thy mouth
          and plead guilty, for these four commandments were enough to condemn
          thee! "Honor thy father and thy mother." What! wilt thou say thou has
          kept that? Hast thou never been disobedient in thy youth? Hast thou
          never kicked against a mother's love, and striven against a father's
          rebuke? Turn over a page of your history till you come to your
          childhood; see if you cannot find it written there; ay, and your
          manhood too may confess that you have not always spoken to your
          parents as you should, or always treated them with that honor they
          deserved, and which God commanded you to give unto them. "Thou shalt
          not kill;" you may never have killed any, but have you never been
          angry? He that is angry with his brother is a murderer; thou art
          guilty here. "Thou shalt not commit adultery." Mayhap thou hast
          committed unclean things, and art here this very day stained with
          lust; but if thou hast been never so chaste, I am sure thou hast not
          been quite guiltless, when the Master says, "He that looketh on a
          woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery already with her in
          his heart." Has no lascivious thought crossed thy mind? Has no
          impurity ever stirred thy imagination? Surely if thou shouldest dare
          to say so, thou wouldest be brazen-faced with impudence. And hast thou
          never stolen? "Thou shalt not steal;" you are here in the crowd
          to-night with the product of your theft mayhap, you have done the
          deed, you have committed robbery; but if you have been never so
          honest, yet surely there have been times in which you have felt an
          inclination to defraud your neighbor, and there may have been some
          petty, or mayhap some gross frauds which you have secretly and
          silently committed, on which the law of the land could not lay its
          hand, but which nevertheless, was a breach of this law. And who dare
          say he has not borne false witness against his neighbor? Have we never
          repeated a story to our neighbor's disadvantage, which was untrue?
          Have we never misconstrued his motives? Have we never misinterpreted
          his designs? And who among us can dare to say that he is guiltless of
          the last -- "Thou shalt not covet?" for we have all desired to have
          more than God has given us; and at times our wandering heart has
          lusted after things which God has not bestowed upon us. Why, to plead
          not guilty, is to plead your own folly; for verily, my brethren, the
          very reading of the law is enough, when blessed by the Spirit, to make
          us cry, "Guilty, O Lord, guilty."
        </p>
        <p>
          But one cries, "I shall not plead guilty, for though I am well aware
          that I have not continued in all things which are written in the book
          of the law,' yet I have done the best I could." That is a lie --
          before God a falsehood. You have not! You have not done the best you
          could. There have been many occasions upon which you might have done
          better. Will that young man dare to tell me that he is doing the best
          he can now? that he cannot refrain from laughter in the house of God?
          It may be possible that it is hard for him to do so, but it is just
          possible he could, if he pleased, refrain from insulting his Maker to
          his face. Surely we have none of us done the best we could. At every
          period, at every time, there have been opportunities of escape from
          temptation. If we had had no freedom to escape from the sin, there
          might have been some excuse for it; but there have been turning points
          in our history when we might have decided for right or for wrong, but
          when we have chosen the evil and have eschewed the good, and have
          turned into that path which leadeth unto hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah, but," saith another, "I declare, sir, that while I have broken
          that law, without a doubt, I have been no worse than my
          fellow-creatures." And a sorry argument is that, for what availeth it
          thee? To be damned in a crowd is no more comfortable than to be damned
          alone. It is true, thou hast been no worse than thy fellow-creatures,
          but this will be of very poor service to thee. When the wicked are
          cast into hell, it will be very little comfort to thee that God shall
          say, "Depart ye cursed" to a thousand with thee. Remember, God's
          curse, when it shall sweep a nation into hell, shall be as much felt
          by every individual of the crowd, as if there were but that one man to
          be punished. God is not like our earthly judges. If their courts were
          glutted with prisoners, they might be inclined to pass over many a
          case lightly; but not so with Jehovah. He is so infinite in his mind,
          that the abundance of criminals will not seem to be any difficulty
          with him. He will deal with thee as severely and as justly as it there
          were never another sinner in all the world. And pray, what hast thou
          to do with other men's sins? Thou art not responsible for them. God
          made thee to stand or fall by thyself. According to thine own deeds
          thou shalt be judged. The harlot's sin may be grosser than thine, but
          thou wilt not be condemned for her iniquities. The murderers guilt may
          far exceed thy transgressions, but thou wilt not be damned for the
          murderer. Religion is a thing between God and thine own soul, O man;
          and therefore, I do beseech thee, do not look upon thy neighbor's, but
          upon thine own heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ay, but," cries another, "I have very many times striven to keep the
          law, and I think I have done so for a little." Hear ye the sentence
          read again -- "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things
          which are written in the book of the law to do them." Oh! sirs; it is
          not some hectic flush upon the cheek of consumptive irresolution that
          God counts to be the health of obedience. It is not some slight
          obedience for an hour that God will accept at the day of judgment. He
          saith "continueth;" and unless from my early childhood to the day when
          my gray hairs descend into the tomb, I shall have continued to be
          obedient to God, I must be condemned. Unless I have from the first
          dawn of reason, when I first began to be responsible, obediently
          served God, until, like a shock of corn, I am gathered into my
          Master's garner, salvation by works must be impossible to me, and I
          must (standing on my own footing), be condemned. It is not I say, some
          slight obedience that will save the soul. Thou hast not continued "in
          all things which are written in the book of the law," and therefore
          thou art condemned.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But," says another, "there are many things I have not done, but still
          I have been very virtuous." Poor excuse that, also. Suppose thou hast
          been virtuous; suppose thou hast avoided many vices: turn to my text.
          It is not my word, but God's -- turn to it -- "all things. It does not
          say "some things." -- "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all
          things which are written in the book of the law to do them." Now, hast
          thou performed all virtues? Hast thou shunned all vices? Dost thou
          stand up and plead, "I never was a drunkard?" -- Yet shalt thou be
          damned, if thou hast been a fornicator. Dost thou reply, "I never was
          unclean?" Yet thou hast broken the Sabbath. Dost thou plead guiltless
          of that charge? Dost thou declare thou hast never broken the Sabbath?
          Thou hast taken God's name in vain, hast thou not? Somewhere or other
          God's law can smite thee. It is certain (let thy conscience now speak
          and affirm what I assert) -- it is certain thou hast not continued "in
          all things which are written in the book of the law." Nay, more, I do
          not believe thou hast even continued in any one commandment of God to
          the full, for the commandment is exceeding broad. It is not the overt
          act, merely, that will damn a man; it is the thought, the imagination,
          the conception of sin, that is sufficient to ruin a soul. Remember, my
          dear hearers, I am speaking now God's own word, not a harsh doctrine
          of my own. If you had never committed one single act of sin, yet the
          thought of sin, the imagination of it would be enough to sweep your
          soul to hell for ever. If you had been born in a cell, and had never
          been able to come out into the world, either to commit acts of
          lasciviousness, murder, or robbery, yet the thought of evil in that
          lone cell might be enough to cast your soul for ever from the face of
          God. Oh! there is no man here that can hope to escape. We must every
          one of us bow our heads before God, and cry, "Guilty, Lord, guilty --
          every one of us guilty -- 'Cursed is every one that continueth not in
          all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.'" When
          I look into thy face, O law, my spirit shudders. When I hear thy
          thunders, my heart is melted like wax in the midst of my bowels. How
          can I endure thee? If I am to be tried at last for my life, surely I
          shall need no judge, for I shall be mine own swift accuser, and my
          conscience shall be a witness to condemn.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I need not enlarge further on this point. O thou that art out
          of Christ, and without God, dost thou not stand condemned before him?
          Off with all thy masks, and away with all excuses; let every one of us
          turn our idle pretences to the wind. Unless we have the blood and
          righteousness of Jesus Christ to cover us, we must every one of us
          acknowledge that this sentence shuts the gates of heaven against us,
          and only prepares us for the flames of perdition.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Thus have I singled out the character, and he is found guilty; now
          I have TO DECLARE THE SENTENCE.
        </p>
        <p>
          God's ministers love not such work as this. I would rather stand in
          this pulpit and preach twenty sermons on the love of Jesus, than one
          like this. It is very seldom that I meddle with the theme, because I
          do not know that it is often necessary; but I feel that if these
          things were kept altogether in the background, and the law were not
          preached, the Master would not own the gospel; for he will have both
          preached in their measure, and each must have its proper prominence.
          Now, therefore, hear me whilst I sorrowfully tell you what is the
          sentence passed upon all of you who this night are out of Christ.
          Sinner, thou art cursed to-night. Thou art cursed, not by some wizard
          whose fancied spell can only frighten the ignorant. Thou art cursed --
          not cursed by some earthly monarch who could turn his troops against
          thee, and swallow up thy house and thy patrimony quick. Cursed! Oh!
          what a thing a curse is anyhow! What an awful thing is the curse of a
          father. We have heard of fathers, driven to madness by the undutiful
          and ungracious conduct of their children, who have lifted their hands
          to heaven, and have implored a curse, a withering curse upon their
          children. We can not excuse the parent's mad and rash act. God forbid
          we should exempt him from sin; but oh, a father's curse must be awful.
          I can not think what it must be to be cursed by him that did beget me.
          Sure, it would put out the sunlight of my history for ever, if it were
          deserved. But to be cursed of God -- I have no words with which to
          tell what that must be. "Oh, no," you say, "that is a thing of the
          future; we do not care about the curse of God; it does not fall upon
          us now." Nay, soul, but it does. The wrath of God abideth on you even
          now. You have not yet come to know the fullness of that curse, but you
          are cursed this very hour. You are not yet in hell; not yet has God
          been pleased to shut up the bowels of his compassion, and cast you for
          ever from his presence; but notwithstanding all that, you are cursed.
          Turn to the passage in the book of Deuteronomy, and see how the curse
          is a present thing upon the sinner. In the 28th chapter of
          Deuteronomy, at the 15th verse, we read all this as the sentence of
          the sinner: "Cursed shalt thou be in the city" -- where you carry on
          your business God will curse you. "Cursed shalt thou be in the fields"
          -- where you take your recreation; where you walk abroad, there shall
          the curse reach you. "Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store. Cursed
          shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy land, the increase
          of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep. Cursed shalt thou be when
          thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out." There
          are some men upon whom this curse is very visible. Whatever they do is
          cursed. They get riches, but there is God's curse with the riches. I
          would not have some men's gold for all the stars, though they were
          gold: and if I might have all the wealth of the world, if I must have
          the miser's greed with it, I would rather be poor than have it. There
          art some men who are visibly cursed. Don't you see the drunkard? He is
          cursed, let him go where he may. When he goes into his house, his
          little children run up stairs to bed, for they are afraid to see their
          own father; and when they grow a little older, they begin to drink
          just as he did, and they will stand and imitate him; and they too will
          begin to swear, so that he is cursed in the fruit of his body. He
          thought it was not so bad for him to be drunk and to swear; but O what
          a pang shoots through the fathers conscience, if he has a conscience
          at all, when he sees his child following his footsteps. Drunkenness
          brings such a curse upon a man, that he can not enjoy what he eats. He
          is cursed in his basket, cursed in his store. And truly, though one
          vice may seem to develop the curse more than others, all sin brings
          the curse, though we can not always see it. O! thou that art out of
          God, and out of Christ, and a stranger to Jesus, thou art cursed where
          thou sittest, cursed where thou standest; cursed is the bed thou liest
          on; cursed is the bread thou eatest; cursed is the air thou breathest.
          All is cursed to thee. Go where thou mayest, thou art a cursed man.
          Ah! that is a fearful thought. O! there are some of you that are
          cursed to-night. O, that a man should say that of his brethren! but we
          must say it, or be unfaithful to your poor dying souls. O! would to
          God that some poor soul in this place would say, "Then I am cursed
          to-night; I am cursed of God, and cursed of his holy angels -- cursed!
          cursed! cursed! -- for I am under the law." I do think, God the Spirit
          blessing it, it wants nothing more to slay our carelessness than that
          one word -- "cursed!" "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all
          things which are written in the book of the law to do them."
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, my hearer, thou that art in this state, impenitent and
          unbelieving, I have more work to do before I close. Remember, the
          curse that men have in this life is as nothing compared with the curse
          that is to come upon them hereafter. In a few short years, you and I
          must die. Come, friend, I will talk to you personally again -- young
          man, we shall soon grow old, or, perhaps, we shall die before that
          time, and we shall lie upon our bed -- the last bed upon which we
          shall ever sleep -- we shall wake from our last slumber to hear the
          doleful tidings that there is no hope; the physician will feel our
          pulse, and solemnly assure our relatives that it is all over! And we
          shall lie in that still room, where all is hushed except the ticking
          of the clock, and the weeping of our wife and children; and we must
          die. O! how solemn will it be that hour when we must struggle with
          that enemy, Death! The death-rattle is in our throat -- we can scarce
          articulate -- we try to speak; the death-glaze is on the eye: Death
          hath put his fingers on those windows of the body, and shut out the
          light for ever; the hands well-nigh refuse to lift themselves, and
          there we are, close on the borders of the grave! Ah! that moment, when
          the Spirit sees its destiny; that moment, of all moments the most
          solemn, when the soul looks through the bars of its cage, upon the
          world to come! No, I can not tell you how the spirit feels, if it be
          an ungodly spirit, when it sees a fiery throne of judgment, and hears
          the thunders of Almighty wrath, while there is but a moment between it
          and hell. I can not picture to you what must be the fright which men
          will feel, when they realize what they often heard of! Ah! it is a
          fine thing for you to laugh at me to-night. When you go away, it will
          be a very fine thing to crack a joke concerning what the preacher
          said; to talk to one another, and make merry with all this. But when
          you are lying on your death-bed, you will not laugh. Now, the curtain
          is drawn, you can not see the things of the future, it is a very fine
          thing to be merry. When God has removed that curtain, and you learn
          the solemn reality, you will not find it in your hearts to trifle.
          Ahab, on his throne laughed at Micaiah. You never read that Ahab
          laughed at Micaiah when the arrow was sticking between the joints of
          his harness. In Noah's time, they laughed at the old man; they called
          him a gray-headed fool, I doubt not, because he told them that God was
          about to destroy the earth with a flood. But ah! ye scorners, ye did
          not laugh in that day when the cataracts were falling from heaven, and
          when God had unloosed the doors of the great deep, and bidden all the
          hidden waters leap upon the surface; then ye knew that Noah was right.
          And when ye come to die, mayhap ye will not laugh at me. You will say,
          when you lie there, "I remember such-and-such a night I strolled into
          Park street; I heard a man talk very solemnly; I thought at the time I
          did not like it, but I knew he was in earnest, I am quite certain that
          he meant good for me; oh, that I had hearkened to his advice; oh, that
          I had regarded his words! What would I give to hear him again!" Ah! it
          was not long ago that a man who had laughed and mocked at me full many
          a time, went down one Sabbath day to Brighton, to spend his day in the
          excursion -- he came back that night to die! On Monday morning, when
          he was dying, who do you suppose he wanted? He wanted Mr. Spurgeon!
          the man he had laughed at always; he wanted him to come and tell him
          the way to heaven, and point him to the Saviour. And although I was
          glad enough to go, it was doleful work to talk to a man who had just
          been Sabbath breaking, spending his time in the service of Satan, and
          had come home to die. And die he did, without a Bible in his house,
          without having one prayer offered for him except that prayer which I
          alone did offer at his bedside. Ah! it is strange how the sight of a
          death-bed may be blessed to the stimulating of our zeal. I stood some
          year or so ago, by the bedside of a poor boy, about sixteen years of
          age, who had been drinking himself to death, in a drinking bout, about
          a week before, and when I talked to him about sin and righteousness,
          and judgment to come, I knew he trembled, and I thought that he had
          laid hold on Jesus. When I came down from those stairs, after praying
          for him many a time, and trying to point him to Jesus, and having but
          a faint hope of his ultimate salvation, I thought to myself, O God! I
          would that I might preach every hour, and every moment of the day, the
          unsearchable riches of Christ; for what an awful thing it is to die
          without a Saviour. And then, I thought how many a time I had stood in
          the pulpit, and had not preached in earnest as I ought to have done;
          how I have coldly told out the tale of the Saviour, when I ought to
          have wept very showers of tears, in overwhelming emotion. I have gone
          to my bed full many a season, and have wept myself to sleep, because I
          have not preached as I have desired, and it will be even so to-night.
          But, oh, the wrath to come! the wrath to come! the wrath to come!
        </p>
        <p>
          My hearers, the matters I now talk of are no dreams, no frauds, no
          whims, no old wives' stories. These are realities, and you will soon
          know them. O sinner, thou that hast not continued in all things
          written in the book of the law; thou that hast no Christ; the day is
          coming when these things will stand before thee, as dread, solemn,
          real things. And then; ah! then; ah! then; ah! then what wilt thou do?
          -- "And after death the judgment." -- O, can ye picture --
        </p>
        <p>"The pomp of that tremendous day,</p>
        <p>When Christ with clouds shall come."</p>
        <p>
          I think I see that terrible day. The bell of time has tolled the last
          day. Now comes the funeral of damned souls. Your body has just started
          up from the grave, and you unwind your cerements, and you look up.
          What is that I see? O! what is that I hear? I hear one dread,
          tremendous blast, that shakes the pillars of heaven, and makes the
          firmament reel with affright; the trump, the trump, the trump of the
          arch-angel shakes creation's utmost bound. You look and wonder.
          Suddenly a voice is heard, and shrieks from some, and songs from
          others -- he comes -- he comes -- he comes; and every eye must see
          him. There he is; the throne is set upon a cloud, which is white as
          alabaster. There he sits. Tis He, the Man that died on Calvary -- I
          see his pierced hands -- but ah, how changed! No thorn-crown now. He
          stood at Pilate's bar, but now the whole earth must stand at his bar.
          But hark! the trumpet sounds again: the Judge opens the book, there is
          silence in heaven, a solemn silence: the universe is still. "Gather
          mine elect together, and my redeemed from the four winds of heaven."
          Swiftly they are gathered. As with a lightning flash, the angel's wing
          divides the crowd. Here are the righteous all in-gathered; and sinner,
          there art thou on the left hand, left out, left to abide the burning
          sentence of eternal wrath. Hark! the harps of heaven play sweet
          melodies; but to you they bring no joy, though the angels are
          repeating the Saviour's welcome to his saints. "Come ye blessed,
          inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundations of the
          world." You have had that moments respite, and now his face is
          gathering clouds of wrath, the thunder is on his brow; he looks on you
          that have despised him, you that scoffed his grace, that scorned his
          mercy, you that broke his Sabbath, you that mocked his cross, you that
          would not have him to reign over you; and with a voice louder than ten
          thousand thunders, he cries, "Depart, ye cursed. And then -- No, I
          will not follow you. I will not tell of quenchless flames: I will not
          talk of miseries of the body, and tortures for the spirit. But hell is
          terrible; damnation is doleful. Oh, escape! escape! Escape, lest
          haply, being where you are, you should have to learn what the horrors
          of eternity must mean, in the gulf of everlasting perdition. "Cursed
          is the man that hath not continued in all things that are written in
          the book of the law to do them."
        </p>
        <p>III. DELIVERANCE PROCLAIMED.</p>
        <p>
          "You have condemned us all," cries one. Yes, but not I -- God has done
          it. Are you condemned? Do you feel you are to night? Come, again, let
          me take thee by the hand, my brother: yes, I can look round upon the
          whole of this assembly, and I can say, there is not one now in this
          place whom I do not love as a brother. If I speak severely unto any of
          you, it is that you may know the right. My heart, and my whole spirit
          are stirred for you. My harshest words are far more full of love than
          the smooth words of soft-speaking ministers, who say, "Peace, peace,"
          where there is no peace. Do you think it is any pleasure to me to
          preach like this? Oh? I had far rather be preaching of Jesus; his
          sweet, his glorious person, and his all-sufficient righteousness. Now,
          come, we will have a sweet word before we have done. Do you feel you
          are condemned? Do you say, "O God, I confess thou wouldest be just, if
          thou shouldest do all this to me?" Dost thou feel thou canst never be
          saved by thine own works, but that thou art utterly condemned through
          sin? Dost thou hate sin? Dost thou sincerely repent? Then, let me tell
          thee how thou mayest escape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men and brethren, Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was crucified,
          dead, and buried; he is now risen, and he sitteth on the right hand of
          God, where he also maketh intercession for us. He came into this world
          to save sinners, by his death. He saw that poor sinners were cursed:
          he took the curse on his own shoulders, and he delivered us from it.
          Now, if God has cursed Christ for any man, he will not curse that man
          again. You ask me, then, "Was Christ cursed for me?" Answer me this
          question, and I will tell you -- Has God the Spirit taught you that
          you are accursed? Has he made you feel the bitterness of sin? Has he
          made you cry, "Lord, have mercy upon me, a sinner?" Then, my dear
          friend, Christ was cursed for you; and you are not cursed. You are not
          cursed now. Christ was cursed for you. Be of good cheer; if Christ was
          cursed for you, you can not be cursed again. "Oh!" says one, "if I
          could but think he was cursed for me." Do you see him bleeding on the
          tree? Do you see his hands and feet all dripping gore? Look unto him,
          poor sinner. Look no longer at thyself, nor at thy sin; look unto him,
          and be saved. All he asks thee to do is to look, and even that he will
          help thee to do. Come to him, trust him, believe on him. God the Holy
          Spirit has taught you that you are a condemned sinner. Now, I beseech
          you, hear this word and believe it: "This is a faithful saying, and
          worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the world to
          save sinners." Oh, can you say, "I believe this Word -- it is true --
          blessed be his dear name; it is true to me, for whatever I may not be,
          I know that I am a sinner; the sermon of this night convinces me of
          that, if there were nothing else; and, good Lord, thou knowest when I
          say I am a sinner, I do not mean what I used to mean by that word. I
          mean that I am a real sinner. I mean that if thou shouldest damn me, I
          deserve it; if thou shouldest cast me from thy presence forever, it is
          only what I have merited richly. O my Lord I am a sinner; I am a
          hopeless sinner, unless thou savest me; I am a helpless sinner, unless
          thou dost deliver me. I have no hope in my self-righteousness; and
          Lord, I bless thy name, there is one thing else, I am a sorrowful
          sinner, for sin grieves me; I can not rest, I am troubled. Oh, if I
          could get rid of sin, I would be holy, even as God is holy. Lord, I
          believe. But I hear an objector cry out, "What, sir, believe that
          Christ died for me simply because I am a sinner!" Yes; even so. "No,
          sir; but if I had a little righteousness; if I could pray well, I
          should then think Christ died for me." No, that would not be faith at
          all, that would be self-confidence. Faith believes in Christ when it
          sees sin to be black, and trusts in him to remove it all. Now, poor
          sinner, with all thy sin about thee, take this promise in thy hands,
          go home to-night, or if thou canst, do it before thou gettest home --
          go home, I say, up stairs, alone, down by the bed-side, and pour out
          thine heart, "O Lord, it is all true that that man said; I am
          condemned, and Lord, I deserve it. O Lord, I have tried to be better,
          and have done nothing with it all, but have only grown worse. O Lord,
          I have slighted thy grace, I have despised thy gospel: I wonder thou
          hast not damned me years ago; Lord, I marvel at myself; that thou
          sufferest such a base wretch as I am to live at all. I have despised a
          mother's teaching, I have forgotten a father's prayers. Lord, I have
          forgotten thee; I have broken thy Sabbath, taken thy name in vain. I
          have done everything that is wrong; and if thou dost condemn me, what
          can I say? Lord, I am dumb before thy presence. I have nothing to
          plead. But Lord; I come to tell thee to-night, thou hast said in the
          Word of God, "Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out."
          Lord, I come: my only plea is that thou hast said, This is a faithful
          saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the
          world to save sinners.' Lord, I am a sinner; he came to save me; I
          trust in it -- sink or swim -- Lord, this is my only hope: I cast away
          every other, and hate myself to think I ever should have had any
          other. Lord, I rely on Jesus only. Do but save me, and though I can
          not hope by my future life to blot out my past sin, O Lord, I will ask
          of thee to give me a new heart and a right spirit, that from this time
          forth even for ever I may run in the way of thy commandments: for,
          Lord, I desire nothing so much as to be thy child. Thou knowest, O
          Lord, I would give all, if thou wouldest but love me; and I am
          encouraged to think that thou dost love me; for my heart feels so. I
          am guilty, but I should never have known that I was guilty if thou
          hadst not taught it to me. I am vile, but I never should have known my
          vileness, unless thou hadst revealed it. Surely, thou wilt not destroy
          me, O God, after having taught me this. If thou dost, thou art just,
          but,
        </p>
        <p>"Save a trembling sinner, Lord,</p>
        <p>Whose hopes still hovering round thy Word,</p>
        <p>Would light on some sweet promise there;</p>
        <p>Some sure support against despair."</p>
        <p>
          If you can not pray such a long prayer as that, I tell you what to go
          home and say. Say this, "Lord Jesus, I know I am nothing at all; be
          thou my precious all in all."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, I trust in God there will be some to-night that will be able to
          pray like that, and if it be so, ring, the bells of heaven; sing, ye
          seraphim; shout, ye redeemed; for the Lord hath done it, and glory be
          unto his name, for ever and ever.<br />
