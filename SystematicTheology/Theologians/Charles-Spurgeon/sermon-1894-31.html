          My son, keep my words,<br />And lay up my commandments with thee.<br />Keep
          my commandments, and live;<br />And my law, as the apple of thine
          eye.<br />Bind them upon thy fingers;<br />Write them upon the table
          of thine heart.<br />Say unto Wisdom, Thou art my sister;<br />And
          call Understanding thy kinswoman:<br />That they may keep thee from
          the Strange Woman,<br />From the stranger which flattereth with her
          words.
        </p>
        <p>2</p>
        <p>
          For at the window of my house<br />I looked forth through my
          lattice;<br />And I beheld among the simple ones,<br />I discerned
          among the youths,<br />A young man,<br />Void of understanding,
        </p>
        <p>
          Passing through the street near her corner,<br />And he went the way
          to her house;<br />In the twilight, in the evening of the day,<br />In
          the blackness of night and the darkness;<br />And behold, there met
          him a Woman<br />With the attire of an harlot, and wily of heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          She is clamorous and wilful;<br />Her feet abide not in her house;<br />Now
          she is in the streets, now in the broad places, And lieth in wait at
          every corner.<br />So she caught him, and kissed him,<br />With an
          impudent face she said unto him:
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me;<br />This day have I paid
          my vows;<br />Therefore came I forth to meet thee,<br />Diligently to
          seek thy face,<br />And I have found thee.<br />I have spread my couch
          with carpets of tapestry,<br />With striped cloths of the yarn of
          Egypt;<br />I have perfumed my bed<br />With myrrh, aloes, and
          cinnamon.<br />Come, let us take our fill of love<br />Until the
          morning;<br />Let us solace ourselves with loves;<br />For the goodman
          is not at home,<br />He is gone a long journey:<br />He hath taken a
          bag of money with him;<br />He will come home at the full moon."
        </p>
        <p>
          With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield, With the
          flattering of her lips she forceth him away.
        </p>
        <p>
          He goeth after her straightway,<br />As an ox goeth to the
          slaughter,<br />Or as one in fetters to the correction of the fool;
          Till an arrow strike through his liver;<br />As a bird hasteth to the
          snare,<br />And knoweth not that it is for his life.
        </p>
        <p>3</p>
        <p>
          Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me,<br />And attend to the words
          of my mouth.<br />Let not thine heart decline to her ways,<br />Go not
          astray in her paths.<br />For she hath cast down many wounded:<br />Yea,
          all her slain are a mighty host.<br />Her house is the way to
          Sheol,<br />Going down to the chambers of death.
        </p>
        <p>4</p>
        <p>
          Doth not Wisdom cry,<br />And Understanding put forth her voice?<br />In
          the top of high places by the way,<br />Where the paths meet,<br />She
          standeth;<br />Beside the gates, at the entry of the city,<br />At the
          coming in at the doors,<br />She crieth aloud:
        </p>
        <p>
          Unto you, O men, I call;<br />And my voice is to the sons of men.<br />O
          ye simple, understand subtilty;<br />And ye fools, be ye of an
          understanding heart.<br />Hear, for I will speak excellent things;<br />And
          the opening of my lips shall be right things.<br />For my mouth shall
          utter truth;<br />And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the words of my mouth are righteousness;<br />There is nothing
          crooked or perverse in them.<br />They are all plain to him that
          understandeth,<br />And right to them that find knowledge<br />Receive
          my instruction, and not silver;<br />And knowledge rather than choice
          gold.<br />For wisdom is better than rubies;<br />And all the things
          that may be desired are not to be compared unto her.
        </p>
        <p>5</p>
        <p>
          I Wisdom have made subtilty my dwelling,<br />And find out knowledge
          and discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fear of the LORD is to hate evil;<br />Pride and arrogancy,<br />And
          the evil way,<br />And the froward mouth, do I hate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Counsel is mine,<br />And sound knowledge;<br />I am understanding,<br />I
          have might.
        </p>
        <p>
          By me kings reign,<br />And princes decree justice;<br />By me princes
          rule,<br />And nobles, even all the judges of the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love them that love me;<br />And those that seek me diligently shall
          find me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Riches and honour are with me;<br />Durable riches and
          righteousness;<br />My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine
          gold;<br />And my revenue than choice silver.
        </p>
        <p>
          I walk in the way of righteousness,<br />In the midst of the paths of
          judgement:<br />That I may cause those that love me to inherit
          substance, And that I may fill their treasuries.
        </p>
        <p>6</p>
        <p>
          The LORD formed me in the beginning of his way,<br />Before his works
          of old.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,<br />Or ever the
          earth was.<br />When there were no depths, I was brought forth,<br />When
          there were no fountains abounding with water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the mountains were settled,<br />Before the hills, was I
          brought forth:<br />While as yet he had not made the earth,<br />Nor
          the fields,<br />Nor the beginning of the dust of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he established the heavens, I was there:<br />When he set a
          circle upon the face of the deep:<br />When he made firm the skies
          above:<br />When the fountains of the deep became strong:<br />When he
          gave to the sea its bound,<br />That the waters should not transgress
          his commandment:
        </p>
        <p>
          When he marked out the foundations of the earth,<br />Then I was by
          him,<br />As a master workman,<br />And I was daily his delight,<br />Sporting
          always before him;<br />Sporting in his habitable earth;<br />And my
          delight was with the sons of men.
        </p>
        <p>7</p>
        <p>
          Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me:<br />For blessed are they
          that keep my ways.<br />Hear instruction, and be wise,<br />And refuse
          it not.<br />Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my
          gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors.<br />For whoso findeth me
          findeth life,<br />And shall obtain favour of the LORD;<br />But he
          that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul; All they that hate me
          love death.
