        <p>A Sermon</p>

        <p>|That clouds are the dust of his feet.| -- Nahum 1:3.</p>
        <p>
          IT IS POSSIBLE for a man to read too many books. We will not despise
          learning, we will not undervalue erudition, such acquisitions are very
          desirable; and, when his talents are sanctified to God, the man of
          learning frequently becomes in the hands ofthe Spirit far more useful
          than the ignorant and the unlearned; but at the same time, if a man
          acquire his knowledge entirely from books, he will not find himself to
          be a very wise man. There is such a thing as heaping so many books on
          your brains that they cannot work -- pouring such piles of type, and
          letters, and manuscripts, and papers, and prints, and pamphlets, and
          volumes, and tomes, and folios, upon your weary head, that your brains
          are absolutely buried and cannot move at all. I believe that many of
          us, whilst we have sought to learn by books, have neglected those
          great volumes which God has given us; we have neglected to study this
          great book, the Bible! moreover, perhaps, we have not been careful
          enough students of the great volume of nature, and we have forgotten
          that other great book, the human heart. For my own part, I desire to
          be somewhat a student of the heart; and I think I have learned far
          more from conversation with my fellow-men than I ever did from
          reading, and the examination of my own experience, and the workings of
          my own heart, have taught me far more of humanity than all the
          metaphysical books I have ever perused. I like to read the book of my
          fellow creatures; nothing delights me so much as when I see a
          multitude of them gathered together, or when I have the opportunity of
          having their hearts poured into mine, and mine into theirs. He will
          not be a wise man who does not study the human heart, and does not
          seek to know something of his fellows and of himself. But if there be
          one book I love to read above all others, next to the book of God, it
          is the volume of nature. I care not what letters they are that I read,
          whether they be the golden spellings of the name of God up yonder in
          the stars, or whether I read, in rougher lines, his name printed on
          the rolling floods, or see it hieroglyphed in the huge mountain, the
          dashing cataract, or the waving forest. Wherever I look abroad in
          nature I love to discern my Father's name spelled out in living
          characters; and if we had any fields a little greener than Moorfields,
          Smithfield, and Spafields, I would do as Isaac did, go into the fields
          at eventide and muse and meditate upon the God of nature. I thought in
          the cool of last evening. I would muse with my God, by his Holy
          Spirit, and see what message he would give me. There I sat and watched
          the clouds, and learned a lesson in the great hall of Nature's
          college. The first thought that struck me was this, as I saw the white
          clouds rolling in the sky -- soon shall I see my Saviour mounted on a
          great white throne, riding on the clouds of heaven, to call men to
          judgment. My imagination could easily picture the scene, when the
          quick and the dead should stand before his great white throne, and
          should hear his voice pronounce their changeless destiny. I
          remembered, moreover, that text in the Proverbs, |He that observeth
          the wind shall not sow and he that regardeth the clouds shall not
          reap.| I thought how many a time myself and my brother ministers have
          regarded the clouds. We have listened to the voice of prudence and of
          caution we have regarded the clouds, we have stops when we ought to
          have been sowing because we were afraid of the multitude, or we
          refused to reap and take in the people into our churches, because some
          good brother thought we were too hasty about the matter. I rose up and
          thought to myself, I will regard neither the clouds nor the winds, but
          when the wind blows a hurricane I will throw the seed with my hands,
          if peradventure the tempest may waft it further still; and when the
          clouds are thick, still I will reap, and rest assured that God will
          preserve his own wheat, whether I gather it under clouds or in the
          sunshine. And then, when I sat there musing upon God, thoughts struck
          me as the clouds careered along the skies thoughts which I must give
          to you this morning. I trust they were somewhat for my own
          instruction, and possibly they may be for yours. |The clouds are the
          dust of his feet.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Well, the first remark I make upon this shall be -- the way of God
          is generally a hidden one. This we gather from the text, by regarding
          the connection, |the Lord hath his way in the whirlwind and in the
          storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.| When God works his
          wonders he always conceals himself. Even the motion of his feet causes
          clouds to arise; and if these; clouds are but the dust of his feet,|
          how deep must be that dense darkness which veils the brow of the
          Eternal. If the small dust which he causes is of equal magnitude with
          our clouds -- if we can find no other figure to image |the dust of his
          feet| than the clouds of heaven, then, how obscure must be the motions
          of the Eternal one, how hidden and how shrouded in darkness! This
          great truth suggested by the text, is well borne out by facts. The
          ways of God are hidden ones. Cowper did not say amiss when he sang, --
        </p>
        <p>|He plants his footsteps in the sea,</p>
        <p>And rides upon the storm.|</p>
        <p>
          His footsteps cannot be seen, for, planted on the sea, the next wave
          washes them out; and placed in the storm, rioting as the air then is,
          every impression of his chariot wheels is soon erased. Look at God,
          and at whatever he has deigned to do, and you will always see him to
          have been a hidden God. He has concealed himself, and all his ways
          have been veiled in the strictest mystery. Consider his works of
          salvation. How did he hide himself when he determined to save mankind?
          He did not manifestly reveal himself to our forefathers. He gave them
          simply one dim lamp of prophecy which shone in words like these |The
          seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head;| and for four
          thousand years God concealed his Son in mystery, and no one understood
          what the Son of God was to be. The smoking incense beclouded their
          eyes, and while it showed something of Jesus, it did hide far more.
          The burning victim sent its smoke up towards the sky, and it was only
          through the dim mists of the sacrifice that the pious Jew could see
          the Saviour. Angels themselves, we are told, desired to look into the
          mysteries of redemption, yet though they stood with their eyes
          intently fixed upon it, until the hour when redemption developed
          itself on Cavalry, not a single angel could understand it. The
          profoundest sage might have sought to find out how God could be just
          and yet the justifier of the ungodly; but he would have failed in his
          investigations. The most intensely pious man might meditate, with the
          help of that portion of God's Spirit which was then given to the
          prophets, on this mighty subject, and he could not have discovered
          what the mystery of godliness was -- |God manifest in the flesh.| God
          marched in clouds, |He walked in the whirlwinds;| he did not deign to
          tell the world what he was about to do; for it is his plan to gird
          himself in darkness, and |the clouds are the dust of his feet.| Ah!
          and so it always has been in Providence as well as grace. God never
          condescends to make things very plain to his creatures. He always does
          rightly; and therefore, he wants his people always to believe that he
          does rightly. But if he showed them that he did so, there would be no
          room for their faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turn your eye along the page of history, and see how mysterious God's
          dealings have been. Who would conceive that a Joseph sold into Egypt
          would be the means of redeeming a whole people from famine? Who would
          suppose that when an enemy should come upon the land, it should be
          after all but the means of bringing glory to God? Who could imagine
          that a harlot's blood should mingle with the genealogy from which came
          the great Messiah, the Shiloh of Israel? Who could have guessed much
          less could have compassed, the mighty scheme of God? Providence has
          always been a hidden thing.
        </p>
        <p>|Deep in unfathomable mines</p>
        <p>Of never failing skill,</p>
        <p>He treasures up his bright designs,</p>
        <p>And works his sov'reign will.|</p>
        <p>
          And yet, beloved, you and I are always wanting to know what God is
          about. There is a war in the Crimea. We have had some great disasters
          at Sebastopol, and we are turning over the papers, and saying,
          |Whatever is God doing here?| What did he do in the last war? What was
          the benefit of it? We see that even Napoleon was the means of doing
          good, for he broke down the aristocracy and made all monarchs respect
          for the future, the power, and the rights of the people. We see what
          was the result even of that dread hurricane, that it swept away a
          pestilence which would have devoured full many more. But we ask, |What
          is God doing with this world?| We want to know what will be the
          consequences. Suppose we should humble Russia, where would it end? Can
          Turkey be maintained as a separate kingdom? And ten thousand other
          questions arise. Beloved, I always think, |let the potsherds strive
          with the potsherds of the earth,| and -- as a good old friend of mine
          says -- let them crack themselves, too, if they like. We will not
          interfere. If the potsherds will go smashing one another, why, then
          they must. We pray that old England may come off the safest of them
          all. But we are not much concerned to know the result. We believe that
          this war, as well as everything else, will have a beneficial tendency.
          We cannot see in history that this world ever went a step backwards.
          God is ever moving it in its orbit; and it has always progressed even
          when it seemed retrograding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, perhaps, ye are not agitated about Providence in a nation, you
          believe that there God does hide himself; but then there are matters
          concerning yourself, which you long to see explained. When I was in
          Glasgow. I went over an immense foundry, one of the largest in
          Scotland, and there I saw a very powerful steam engine which worked
          all the machinery in the entire building. I saw in that foundry such
          numberless wheels running round, some one way and some another, I
          could not make out what on earth they were all about. But, I daresay,
          if my head had been a little wiser, and I had been taught a little
          more of mechanics, I might have understood what every wheel was doing,
          though really they seemed only a mass of wheels very busy running
          round and doing nothing. They were all, however, working at something;
          and if I had stopped and asked |What is that wheel doing?| A mechanic
          may have said, |It turns another wheel.| |Well, and what is that wheel
          doing?| |There is another wheel dependent upon that, and that again is
          dependent on another.| Then, at last, he would have taken me and said,
          |This is what the whole machinery is doing.| Some ponderous bar of
          iron, perhaps, being grooved and cut, shaped and polished -- |this is
          what all the wheels are effecting: but I cannot tell separately what
          each wheel is doing.| All things are working together for good; but
          what the things separately are doing, it would be impossible to
          explain. Yet, thou child of Adam, with thy finite intellect, art
          continually stopping to ask, |Why is this?| The child lies dead in the
          cradle. Wherefore, was infancy snatched away? Oh, ruthless death,
          couldst thou not reap ripe corn; why snatch the rosebud? Would not a
          chaplet of withered leaves become thee better than these tender
          blossoms? Or, you are demanding of Providence, why hast thou taken
          away my property? Was I not left, by a parent, well-to-do, and some
          ravenous leech has swept all my substance away! It is all gone; why
          this, O God? Why not punish the unjust? why should the innocent be
          allowed thus to suffer? Why am I to be bereft of my all? Says another,
          |I launched into a business that was fair and honorable; I intended,
          if God had prospered me, to devote my wealth to him. I am poor, my
          business never prospers. Lord, why is this?| And another says, |Hero I
          am toiling from morning till night; and all I do I cannot extricate
          myself from my business, which takes me off so much from religion. I
          would fain live on less if I had more time to serve my God.| Ah!
          finite one! dost thou ask God to explain these things to thee? I tell
          thee, God will not do it, and God cannot do it -- for this reason:
          thou art not capable of understanding it. Should the emmet ask the
          eagle wherefore it dasheth aloft in the skies? Shall leviathan be
          questioned by a minnow? These creatures might explain their motions to
          creatures; but the Omnipotent Creator, the uncreated Eternal, cannot
          well explain himself to mortals whom he hath created. We cannot
          understand him. It is enough for us to know that his way always must
          be in darkness, and that we must never expect to see much in this
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. This second thought is -- GREAT THINGS WITH US ARE LITTLE THINGS
          WITH GOD. What great things clouds are to us! There we see them
          sweeping along the skies! Then they rapidly increase till the whole
          firmament gathereth blackness and a dark shadow is cast upon the
          world; we foresee the coming storm, and we tremble at the mountains of
          cloud, for they are great. Great things are they? Nay, they are only
          the dust of God's feet. The greatest cloud that ever swept the face of
          the firmament, was but one single particle of dust starting from the
          feet of the Almighty Jehovah. When clouds roll over clouds and the
          storm is very terrible, it is but the chariot of God, as it speeds
          along the heavens, raising a little dust around him! |The clouds are
          the dust of his feet.| Oh! could ye grasp this idea my friends, or had
          I words in which to put it into your souls, I am sure you would sit
          down in solemn awe of that great God who is our Father, or who will be
          our Judge. Consider, that the greatest things with man are little
          things with God. We call the mountains great, but what are they? They
          are but |the small dust of the balance.| We call the nations great,
          and we speak of mighty empires, but the nations before him are but as
          |a drop in the bucket.| We call the islands great and talk of ours
          boastingly -- |He taketh up the isles as a very little thing.| We
          speak of great men and of mighty -- |The inhabitants of the earth in
          his sight are but as grasshoppers.| We talk of ponderous orbs moving
          millions of miles from us -- in God's sight they are but little atoms
          dancing up and down in the sunbeam of existence. Compared with God
          there is nothing great. True, there are some things which are little
          with man that are great with God. Such are our sins which we call
          little, but which are great with him; and his mercies, which we
          sometimes think are little, he knows are very great mercies towards
          such great sinners as we are. Things which we reckon great are very
          little with God. If ye knew what God thought of our talk sometimes,
          you would be surprised at yourselves. We have some great trouble -- we
          go burdened with it, saying, |O Lord God! what a great trouble I am
          burdened with.| Why, methinks, God might smile at us, as we do
          sometimes at a little child who takes up a load too heavy for it (but
          which ye could hold between your fingers), and staggereth, and saith,
          |Father, what a weight I am carrying.| So there are people who stagger
          under the great trouble which they think they are bearing. Great,
          beloved! There are no great troubles at all: |the clouds are the dust
          of his feet.| If you would but so consider them, the greatest things
          with you are but little things with God. Suppose, now, that ye had all
          the troubles of all the people in the world, that they all came
          pouring on your devoted head: what are cataracts of trouble to God? --
          | Drops in the bucket.| What are whole mountains of grief to him? Why,
          |he taketh up the mountains as the dust of the balance.| And he can
          easily remove your trials. Sit not down then thou son of weariness and
          want, and say, |My troubles are too great.| Hear the voice of mercy:
          |Cast thy burden on the Lord and he will sustain thee, he will never
          suffer the righteous to be moved.| You shall hear two Christians talk.
          One of them will say, |O my troubles, and trials, and sorrows, they
          are so great I can hardly sustain them; I do not know how to support
          my afflictions from day to day.| The other says, |Ah! my troubles and
          trials are not less severe, but, nevertheless, they have been less
          than nothing. I could laugh at impossibilities, and say they shall be
          done.| What is the reason of the difference between these men? The
          secret is, that one of them carried his troubles, and the other did
          not. It does not matter to a porter how heavy a load may be, if he can
          find another to carry it all for him. But if he is to carry it all
          himself, of course he does not like a heavy load. So one man bears his
          troubles himself and gets his back nearly broken; but the other cast
          his troubles on the Lord. Ah! it does not matter how heavy troubles
          are if you can cast them on the Lord. The heavier they are so much the
          better, for the more you have got rid of, and the more there is laid
          upon the Rock. Never be afraid of troubles. However heavy they are,
          God's eternal shoulders can bear them. He, whose omnipotence is
          testified by revolving planets, and systems of enormous worlds, can
          well sustain you. Is his arm shortened, that he cannot save, or is he
          weary, that he cannot hold you fast? Your troubles are nothing to God,
          for the very |clouds are the dust of his feet.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And this cheers me, I assure you, in the work of the ministry; for any
          man who has his eyes open to the world at large, will acknowledge that
          there are many clouds brooding over England, and over the world. I
          received lately a letter from a gentleman at Hull, in which he tells
          me that he sympathizes with my views concerning the condition of the
          church at large. I do not know whether Christendom was ever worse off
          than it is now. At any rate, I pray God it never may be. Read the
          account of the condition of the Suffolk churches where the gospel is
          somewhat flourishing, and you will be surprised to find that they have
          had scarcely any increase at all in the year. So you may go from
          church to church, and find scarcely any that are growing. Here and
          there a chapel is filled with people; here and there you find an
          earnest minister; here and there an increasing church; here and there
          a good prayer-meeting; but these are only like green spots. Wherever I
          have gone through England, I have been always grieved to see how the
          glory of Zion is under a cloud; how the precious saints of Zion,
          comparable to fine gold have become like earthen pitchers, the work of
          the hands of the potter. It is not for me to set myself up as
          universal censor of the church, but I must be honest and say, that
          spiritual life, and fire, and zeal, and piety, seemed to be absent in
          ten thousand instances. We have abundance of agencies, we have good
          mechanism but the church, now-a-days is very much like a large steam
          engine, without any fire, without any hot water in the boiler, without
          any steam. There is everything but steam, everything but life. England
          is veiled in clouds. Not clouds of infidelity. I care not one fig for
          all the infidels in England, and I do not think it worth Mr. Grant's
          trouble to go after them. Nor am I afraid of popery for old England. I
          do not think she will go back to that -- I am sure she never will.
          But, I am afraid of this deadness, this sloth, this indifference, that
          has come over our churches. The church wants shaking, like the man on
          the mountain-top does when the cold benumbs him into a deadly slumber.
          The churches are gone to sleep for want of zeal, for want of fire.
          Even those who hold sound doctrine are beginning to slumber. Oh may
          God stir the church up! One great black cloud, only broken here and
          there by a few rays of sunlight, seems to be hanging over the entire
          of this our happy island. But, beloved, there is comfort, |for the
          clouds are the dust of his feet.| He can scatter them in a moment. He
          can raise up his chosen servants, who have only to put their mouth to
          the trumpet, and one blast shall awaken the sleeping sentinels, and
          startle the sleeping camp. God has only to send out again some
          evangelist, some flying angel, and the churches shall start up once
          more, and she who has been clothed in sackcloth, shall doff her
          garments of mourning and put on a garment of praise, instead of the
          spirit of heaviness. The day is coming, I hope, when Zion shall sit,
          not without her diadem, crownless; but with her crown on her head, she
          shall grasp her banner, take her shield, and, like that heroic maiden
          of old who roused a whole nation, shall go forth conquering and to
          conquer. We hope thus much, because |the clouds are the dust of his
          feet.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Aye, and what clouds rest on the world at large! What black clouds of
          Catholic superstition, Mahommedanism, and idolatry. But what are all
          these things? We do not care about them at all, brethren. Some say
          that I am getting very enthusiastic about the latter-day glory, and
          the coming of our Saviour Jesus Christ. Well, I don't know. I get all
          the happier the more enthusiastic I am, so I hope I shall keep on at
          it, for I believe there is nothing so comforts a servant of God as to
          believe that his Master is coming. I hope to see him. I should not be
          surprised to see Jesus Christ to-morrow morning. He may come then. |In
          such an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh.| He who learns to
          watch for Christ, will never be surprised when he cometh. Blessed
          shall that servant be, whom, when his Lord cometh, he shall find busy
          about his duty. But some say he cannot come yet; there are so many
          clouds, and so much darkness in the sky, it cannot be expected that
          the sun will rise yet. Is that a fair reason? Do the clouds ever
          impede the sun? The sun moves on despite all the mists; and Jesus
          Christ can come clouds or no clouds. We do not want light before he
          appears; he will come and give us light, afterwards, scattering the
          darkness with the glory of his own eyes. But you say, |How are these
          idolatrous systems to be cast down?| God could do it in an hour if he
          pleased. Religion never moves by years and weeks. Even false religions
          grow like mushrooms; much more true ones. False religions attained
          colossal proportion in a very few years. Take the case of
          Mahommedanism -- the new-born faith of Islam became the religion of
          millions in an increditable short period and if a false religion could
          spread so quickly, shall not a true one run along like fire amidst the
          stubble, when God shall speak the word? Clouds are but |dust of his
          feet.| A little while ago some of us were fretting about this
          Mormonism, and we said, |It will never be broken up.| Some stupid
          fellows in America began to kill the poor Mormonites, and so carve
          them into saints, which was the very way to establish them. Christians
          trembled, and said, |What can this be? We shall have Sodom over
          again.| But did you read the Times newspaper of Thursday last? You
          will there see a wonderful instance of how God can scatter the clouds
          and make them dust of his feet. He has caused to come out of the
          ground, near Salt Lake, at Utah, thousands of crickets, and all kinds
          of noxious insects, that devour the crops; creatures that have not
          been seen in Utah before, with swarms of locusts, have made their
          appearance; and the people, being so far from civilized nations,
          cannot of course carry much corn across the desert, so that they will
          be condemned to starve or else separate and break up. It seems to all
          appearance that the whole settlement of the Mormonites must entirely
          be broken up, and that by an army of caterpillars, crickets, and
          locusts.

          III. Now, one more remark. |The clouds are the dust of his feet.| Then
          we learn from that, that THE MOST TERRIBLE THINGS IN NATURE HAVE NO
          TERROR TO A CHILD OF GOD. Sometimes clouds are very fearful things to
          mariners; they expect a storm when they see the clouds and darkness
          gathering. A cloud to many of us, when it forebodes a tempest is a
          very unpleasant thing. But let me read my text, and you will see what
          I mean by my remark that the most terrible things in nature are not
          terrible to the saints. The clouds are the dust of HIS feet,| -- of
          God's feet. Do you not see what I mean? There is nothing terrible now,
          because it is only the dust of my Father's feet. Did you ever know a
          child who was afraid of the dust of his father's feet? Nay; if the
          child sees the dust of his father's feet in the distance, what does he
          do? He rejoices because it is his father, and runs to meet him. So the
          most awful things in nature, even the clouds, have lost all their
          terror to a child of God, because he knows they are but the dust of
          his Father's feet. If we stand in the midst of the lightning storm, a
          flash rives yon cedar, or splits the oak of the forest; another flash
          succeeds, and then another, till the whole firmament becomes a sea of
          flame. We fear not, for they are only the flashes of our Father's
          sword as he waves it in the sky. Hark to the thunder as it shakes the
          earth, causes the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests; we
          shake not at the sound.
        </p>
        <p>|The God that rules on high,</p>
        <p>And thunders when he please,</p>
        <p>That rides upon the stormy sky,</p>
        <p>And manages the seas.</p>
        <p>|This awful God is ours,</p>
        <p>Our Father and our love.|</p>
        <p>
          We are not afraid, for we hear our Father's voice. And what favored
          child ever quaked at his Father's speech. We love to hear that voice;
          although it is deep, bass, sonorous, yet we love its matchless melody,
          for it issues from the depths of affection. Put me to sea, and let the
          ship be driven along, that wind is my Father's breath let the clouds
          gather, they are the dust of my Father's feet; let the waterspout
          appear from heaven, it is my Father dipping his hand in the laver of
          his earthly temple. The child of God feareth nothing. All things are
          his Father's; and divested now of everything that is terrible, he can
          look upon them with complacency, for he says, |The clouds are the dust
          of his feet.|
        </p>
        <p>|He drives his chariot through the sky,</p>
        <p>Beneath his feet his thunders roar;</p>
        <p>He shakes the earth, he veils the sky,</p>
        <p>My soul, my soul, this God adore --</p>
        <p>He is thy Father, and thy love.|</p>
        <p>
          Fall down before his feet and worship him, for he hath loved thee by
          his grace. You know there are many fearful events which may befall us;
          but we are never afraid of them, if we are saints, because they are
          the dust of his feet. Pestilence may ravage this fair city once again;
          the thousands may fall, and the funeral march be constantly seen in
          our streets. Do we fear it? Nay; the pestilence is but one of our
          Father's servants, and we are not afraid of it, although it walketh in
          darkness. There may be no wheat, the flocks may be cut off from the
          herd and the stall; nevertheless, famine and distress are our Father's
          doings, and what our Father does we will not view with alarm. There is
          a man there with a sword in his hand -- he is an enemy, and I fear him
          My father has a sword, and I fear him not; I rather love to see him
          have a sword, because I know he will only use it for my protection.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is to come a sight more grand, more terrific, more sublime,
          and more disastrous than anything earth hath yet witnessed; there is
          to come a fire before which Sodom's fire shall pale to nothingness;
          and the conflagration of continents shall sink into less than nothing
          and vanity. In a few more years, my friends, Scripture assures us,
          this earth and all that is therein, is to be burned up. That deep
          molten mass which now lies in the bosom of our mother earth is to
          burst up -- the solid matter is be melted down into one vast globe of
          fire; the wicked -- shrieking, wailing, and cursing, shall become a
          prey to these flames that shall blaze upward from the breast of earth;
          comets shall shoot their fires from heaven; all the lightnings shall
          launch their bolts upon this poor earth, and it shall become a mass of
          fire. But does the Christian fear it? No. Scripture tell us we shall
          be caught up together with the Lord in the air, and shall be for ever
          with the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. To conclude. The fourth observation is, ALL THINGS IN NATURE ARE
          CALCULATED TO TERRIFY THE UNGODLY MAN. Ungodly men and women now
          present in this place of worship, it is a very solemn fact that you
          are at enmity with God; that having sinned against God, God is angry
          with you -- not angry with you today, but angry with you every day,
          angry with you every hour and every moment. It is, moreover, a most
          sad and solemn fact that there is a day coming, I, ungodly men, when
          this anger of God will burst out, and when God will utterly destroy
          and devour you. Now listen to me for a moment, while I try to make all
          nature preach to you a solemn warning, and the wide world itself a
          great high priest, holding up its finger and calling you to flee for
          mercy to Jesus Christ, the King of kings. Sinner, hast thou ever seen
          the clouds as they roll along the sky? Those clouds are the dust of
          the feet of Jehovah. If these clouds are but the dust, what is he
          himself? And then, I ask thee, O man, art thou not foolish in the
          extreme to be at war with such a God as this? If |the clouds are the
          dust of his feet, now foolish art thou to be his enemy. Dost thou
          think to stand before his majesty? I tell thee, he will snap thy spear
          as if it were but a reed. Wilt thou hide thyself in the mountains?
          They shall be melted at his presence; and though thou cry to the rocks
          to hide thee, they would fail to give thee aught of concealment before
          his burning eyes. O do but consider, my dear fellow creatures, you who
          are at enmity with God, would it not be folly if you were to oppose
          yourself to an angel? Would it not be the utmost stupidity if you were
          to commence a war even with her majesty the Queen? I know it would,
          because ye have no power to stand against them; but consider how much
          more mighty is the Eternal God. Why, man, he could put his finger upon
          you at this moment and crush you as I could an insect. Yet this God is
          your enemy; you are hating him, you are at war with him! Consider,
          moreover, O man, that thou hast grievously rebelled against him; that
          thou hast incensed his soul, and he is angry, and jealous, and furious
          against every sinner. Consider what you will do in that great day,
          when God shall fall upon you. Some of you believe in a god that has no
          anger, and no hatred towards the wicked. Such a god is not the God of
          Scripture? He is a god who punishes the ungodly. Let me ask the
          question of inspiration: Canst thou stand before his indignation?
          Canst thou abide the fierceness of his anger? When his fury is poured
          out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him, bethink thee,
          sinner, will it be a good thing to be in the hands of the Almighty,
          who will rend thee in sunder? Wilt thou think it easy to lie down in
          hell with the breath of the Eternal fanning the flames? Wilt thou
          delight thyself to think that God will invent torments for thee,
          sinner, to make thy doom most cursed if thou dost not repent and turn
          to him? What, man! are the terrors of Jehovah nothing to thee? Dost
          thou not tremble and shake before the fierceness of his fury? Ah! thou
          mayest laugh now; thou mayest go away, my hearer, and smile at what I
          have said; but the day shall declare it: the hour is coming -- and it
          may be soon -- when the iron hand of the Almighty shall be upon thee;
          when all thy senses shall be the gates of misery, thy body the house
          of lamentation, and thy soul the epitome of woe. Then thou wilt not
          laugh and despise him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now to finish up, let me just give you one word more; for,
          beloved, wherefore do we use these threats; wherefore do we speak of
          them? It is but the word of the angel, who, pressing Lot upon the
          shoulder, said, |Look not behind thee stay not in all the plain,| and
          then pointing to the fire behind, said, |On! on! lest the fiery sleet
          overtake thee, and the hail of the Eternal shall overwhelm thee!| We
          only mentioned that fire behind, that the Spirit might make you flee
          to the mountain lest ye should be consumed. Do you ask where that
          mountain is? We tell you there is a cleft in the Rock of Ages where
          the chief of sinners may yet hide himself -- |Jesus Christ for us men,
          and for our salvation, came down from heaven;| and whoever here this
          morning is a sinner, we now invite to come to Christ. Ye Pharisees who
          do not own the title, I preach no gospel to you; ye self-righteous,
          self-sufficient ones, I have nought whatever to say to you, except
          what I have said -- the voice of threatening. But, whoever will
          confess himself a sinner, has the warrant this morning to come to
          Jesus Christ. Sinnership is the only title to salvation. If you
          acknowledge yourselves to be sinners, Christ died for you. And if you
          put your trust in him, and believed that he died for you, you may rely
          upon him, and say, |Lord, I will be saved by thy grace.| Your merits
          are good for nothing; you can get no benefit by them. Your own work is
          useless; you err like the man in the prison working the treadmill --
          you never get anything by it -- grinding oyster shells without any
          benefit to yourself. Come to Jesus Christ. Believe in him; and after
          you have believed in him, he will set you working -- working a new
          work. He will give you works, if you will have but faith -- even faith
          is his gift. O may he give it to you now, my hearers, for; he giveth
          liberally and upbraideth not.| |Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
          be baptized, and thou shalt be saved.|
