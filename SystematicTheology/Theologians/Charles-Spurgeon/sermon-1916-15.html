          "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? That is to say, My God, my God, why hast
          thou forsaken me?" -- Matthew 27:46.
        </p>
        <p>
          IF any one of us, lovers of the Lord Jesus Christ had been anywhere
          near the cross when he uttered those words, I am sure our hearts would
          have burst with anguish, and one thing is certain -- we should have
          heard the tones of that dying cry as long as ever we lived. There is
          no doubt that at certain times they would come to us again, ringing
          shrill and clear through the thick darkness. We should remember just
          how they were uttered, and the emphasis where it was placed, and I
          have no doubt we should turn that text over, and over, and over in our
          minds. But there is one thing, I think, we should never have done if
          we had heard it -- therefore, I am not going to do it -- we should
          never preach from it. It would have been too painful a recollection
          for us ever to have used it as a text. No; we should have said, "It is
          enough to hear it." Fully understand it, who can? And to expound it,
          since some measure of understanding might be necessary to the
          exposition -- that surely were a futile attempt. We should have laid
          that by; we should have put those words away as too sacred, too
          solemn, except for silent reflection and quiet, reverent adoration. I
          felt when I read these words again, as I have often read them, that
          they seemed to say to me, "You cannot preach from us," and, on the
          other hand, felt as Moses did when he put off his shoe from off his
          foot in the presence of the burning bush, because the place whereon he
          stood was holy ground. Beloved, there is another reason why we should
          not venture to preach from this text, namely, that it is probably an
          expression out of the lowest depths of our Saviour's sufferings. With
          him into the seas of grief we can descend some part of the way; but
          when he comes where all God's waves and billows go over him, we cannot
          go there. We may, indeed, drink of his cup, and be baptized with his
          baptism, but never to the full extent; and, therefore, where our
          fellowship with Christ cannot conduct us to the full, though it may in
          a measure -- we shall not venture; not beyond where our fellowship
          with him would lead us aright, lest we blunder by speculation, and
          "darken counsel by words without knowledge." Moreover, it comes
          forcibly upon my mind that though every word here is emphatic, we
          should be pretty sure to put the emphasis somewhere or other too
          little. I do not suppose we should be likely to put it anywhere too
          much. It has been well said that every word in this memorable cry
          deserves to have an emphasis laid upon it. If you read it, "My God, my
          God, why hast thou forsaken me? I marvel not that my disciples should,
          but why hast thou gone, my Father, God? Why couldst thou leave me?"
          there is a wondrous meaning there. Then take it thus, "My God, my God,
          why hast thou forsaken me? I know why thou hast smitten me; I can
          understand why thou dost chasten me; but why hast thou forsaken me?
          Wilt thou allow me no ray of love from the brightness of thine eyes --
          no sense of thy presence whatsoever?" This was the wormwood and the
          gall of all the Saviour's bitter cup. Then God forsook him in his
          direst need. Or if you take it thus, "My God, my God, why hast thou
          forsaken me?" there comes another meaning. "Me, thy well beloved,
          thine eternal well beloved, shine innocent, thy harmless, thine
          afflicted Son -- why hast thou forsaken me? "Then, indeed, it is a
          marvel of marvels not that God should forsake his saints, or appear to
          do so, or that he should forsake sinners utterly, but that he should
          forsake his only Son. Then, again, we might with great propriety throw
          the whole force of the verse upon the particle of interrogation,
          "Why." "My God, my God, why, ah! why hast thou forsaken me? What is
          thy reason? What thy motive? What compels thee to this, thou Lord of
          love? The sun is eclipsed, but why is the Son of thy love eclipsed?
          Thou hast taken away the lives of men for sin, but why takest thou
          away thy love, which is my life, from me who hath no sin? Why and
          wherefore actest thou thus?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as I have said, every word requires more emphasis than I can
          throw into it, and some part of the text would be quite sure to be
          left and not dealt with as it should be; therefore, we will not think
          of preaching upon it, but instead thereof we will sit down and commune
          with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must know that the words of our text are not only the language of
          Christ, but they are the language of David. You who are acquainted
          with the Psalms know that the 22nd Psalm begins with just these words,
          so that David said what Jesus said; and I gather from this that many a
          child of God has had to say precisely what the Lord Jesus, the
          first-born of the family, uttered upon the cross. Now as God's
          children are brought into the same circumstances as Christ, and Christ
          is considered the exemplar, my object to-night will be simply this --
          not to expound the words, but to say to believers who come into a
          similar plight, Do as Jesus did. If you come into his condition, lift
          up your hearts to God, that you may act as he did in that condition.
          So we shall make the Saviour now not a study for our learning, but an
          example for reproduction. The first out of these points in which, I
          think, we should imitate him is this: --
        </p>
        <p>I. UNDER DESERTION OF SOUL, THE LORD JESUS STILL TURNS TO GOD.</p>
        <p>
          At that time when he uttered these words, God had left him to his
          enemies. No angel appeared to interpose and destroy the power of Roman
          or Jew. He seemed utterly given up. The people might mock at him, and
          they might put him to what pain they pleased j at the same time a
          sense of God's love to him as man was taken from him. The comfortable
          presence of God, which had all his life long sustained him, began to
          withdraw from him in the garden, and appeared to be quite gone when he
          was just in the article of death upon the cross; and meanwhile the
          waves of God's wrath on account of sin began to break over his spirit,
          and he was in the condition of a soul deserted by God. Now sometimes
          believers come into the same condition, not to the same extent, but in
          a measure. Yesterday they were full of joy, for the love of God was
          shed abroad in their hearts, but to-day that sense of love is gone;
          they droop; they feel heavy. Now the temptation will be at such times
          for them to sit down and look into their own hearts; and if they do,
          they will grow more wretched every moment, until they will come well
          nigh to despair; for there is no comfort to be found within, when
          there is no light from above. Our signs and tokens within are like
          sundials. We can tell what is o'clock by the sundial when the sun
          shines, but if it does not what is the use of the sundial? And so
          marks of evidence may help us when God's love is shed abroad in the
          soul, but when that is done, marks of evidence stand us in very little
          stead. Now observe our Lord. He is deserted of God, but instead of
          looking in, and saying, "My soul, why art thou this? Why art thou
          that? Why art thou cast down? Why dost thou mourn?" he looks straight
          away from that dried-up well that is within, to those eternal waters
          that never can be stayed, and which are always full of refreshment. He
          cries, "My God." He knows which way to look, and I say to every
          Christian here, it is a temptation of the devil, when you are
          desponding, and when you are not enjoying your religion as you did, to
          begin peering and searching about in the dunghill of your own
          corruptions, and stirring over all that you are feeling, and all you
          ought to feel, and all you do not feel, and all that. Instead of that
          look from within, look above, look to your God again, for the light
          will come there.
        </p>
        <p>
          And you will notice that our Lord did not at this time look to any of
          his friends. In the beginning of his sufferings he appeared to seek
          oonsolation from his disciples, but he found them sleeping for sorrow;
          therefore, on this occasion he did not look to them in any measure. He
          had lost the light or God's countenance, but he does not look down in
          the darkness and say, "John, dear faithful John, art thou there? Hast
          thou not a word for him whose bosom was a pillow for thy head? Mother
          Mary, art thou there? Canst thou not say one soft word to thy dying
          son to let him know there is still a heart that does not forget him?"
          No, beloved; our Lord did not look to the creature. Man as he was, and
          we must regard him as such in uttering this cry, yet he does not look
          to friend or brother, helper or human arm. But though God be angry, as
          it were, yet he crieth, "My God." Oh! it is the only cry that befits a
          believer's lips. Even if God seems to forsake thee, keep on crying to
          him. Do not begin to look in a pet and a jealous humour to creatures,
          but still look to thy God. Depend upon it, he will come to thee sooner
          or later. He cannot fail thee. He must help thee. Like a child if its
          mother strike it, still if it be in pain it cries for its mother; it
          knows her love; it knows its deep need of her, and that she alone can
          supply its need. Oh! beloved, do the same. Is there one in this house
          who has lately lost his comforts, and Satan has said, "Don't pray"?
          Beloved, pray more than ever you did. If the devil says, "Why, God is
          angry; what is the use of praying to him?" he might have said the same
          to Christ -- "Why dost thou pray to one who forsaketh thee?" But
          Christ did pray "My God" still, though he says, "Why dost thou forsake
          me?" Perhaps Satan tells you not to read the Bible again. It has not
          comforted you of late; the promises have not come to your soul. Dear
          brother, read and read more; read double as much as ever you did. Do
          not think that, because there is no light coming to you, the wisest
          way is to get away from the light. No; stay where the light is. And
          perhaps he even says to you, "Don't attend the house of God again;
          don't go to the communion table. Why, surely you won't wish to commune
          with God when he hides his face from you." I say the words of wisdom,
          for I speak according to the example of Christ; come still to your God
          in private and in public worship, and come still, dear brother, to the
          table of fellowship with Jesus, saying, "Though he slay me, vet will I
          trust in him, for I have nowhere else to trust; and though he hide his
          face from me, vet will I cry after him, and my cry shall not be "My
          friends," but "My God"; and my eye shall not look to my soul, my
          friends, or my feelings, but I will look to my God. and even to him
          alone. That is the first lesson, not an easy one to learn, mark you --
          easier to hear than you will find it to practice. but "the Spirit
          helpeth our infirmities." The second lesson is this -- observe that:
          --
        </p>
        <p>
          II. THOUGH UNDER A SENSE OF DESERTION, OUR MASTER DOES NOT RELAX HIS
          HOLD OF HIS GOD.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe it, "My God" -- it is one hand he grips him with; "My God" --
          it is the other hand he grasps him with. Both united in the cry, "My
          God." He believes that God is still his God. He uses the possessive
          particle twice, "My God, my God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it is easy to believe that God is ours when he smiles upon us, and
          when we have the sweet fellowship of his love in our hearts; but the
          point for faith to attend to, is to hold to God when he gives the hard
          words, when his providence frowns upon thee, and when even his Spirit
          seems to be withdrawn from thee. Oh! let go every thing, but let not
          go thy God. If the ship be tossed and ready to sink, and the tempest
          rages exceedingly, cast out the ingots, let the gold go, throw out the
          wheat, as Paul's companions did. Let even necessaries go, but oh!
          still hold to thy God; give not up thy God; say still, notwithstanding
          all, "In the teeth of all my feelings, doubts, and suspicions, I hold
          him yet; he is my God; I will not let him go."
        </p>
        <p>
          You know that in the text our Lord calls God in the original his
          "strong one" -- "Eli, Eli" -- "my strong one, my mighty one." So let
          the Christian, when God turns away the brightness of his presence,
          still believe that all his strength lies in God, and that, moreover,
          God's power is on his side. Though it seemed to crush him, yet faith
          says, "It is a power that will not crush me. If he smite me, what will
          I do? I will lay hold upon his arm, and he will put strength in me. I
          will deal with God as Jacob did with the angel. If he wrestle with me,
          I will borrow strength from him, and I will wrestle still with him
          until I get the blessing from him." Beloved, we must neither let go
          God, nor let go our sense of his power to save us. We must hold to our
          possession of him, and hold to the belief that he is worth possessing,
          that he is God allsufficient, and that he is our God still.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I would like to put this personally to any tried child of God
          here. Are you going to let go your God because you have lost his
          smile? Then I ask you, Did you base your faith upon his smile? for if
          you did, you mistook the true ground of faith. The ground of a
          believer's confidence is not God's smile, but God's promise. It is not
          his temporary sunshine of his love, but his deep eternal love itself,
          as it reveals itself in the covenant and in the promises. Now the
          present smile of God may go, but God's promise does not go; and if you
          believe upon God's promise, that is just as true when God frowns as
          when he smiles. If you are resting upon the covenant, that covenant is
          as true in the dark as in the light. It stands as good when your soul
          is without a single gleam of oonsolation as when your heart is flooded
          with sacred bliss. Oh! Come then to this. The promise is as good as
          ever. Christ is the same as ever; his blood is as great a plea as
          ever; and the oath of God is as immutable as ever. We must get away
          from all building upon our apprehensions of God's love. It is the love
          itself we must build on -- not on our enjoyment of his presence, but
          on his faithfulness and on his truth. Therefore, be not cast down, but
          still call him, "My God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, I may put it to you, if, because God frowns, you give him
          up, what else do you mean to do? Why, is not it better to trust in an
          angry God than not to trust in God at all? Suppose thou leavest off
          the walk of faith, what wilt thou do? The carnal man never knew what
          faith was, and, therefore, gets on pretty fairly in his own blind,
          dead way; but you have been quickened and made alive, enlightened, and
          if you give up your faith, what is to become of you? Oh! hold to him
          then.
        </p>
        <p>"For if shine eye oi faith be dim,</p>
        <p>Still hold on Jesus, sink or swim;</p>
        <p>Still at his footstool bow the knee</p>
        <p>And Israel's God thy strength shall be."</p>
        <p>Don't give him up.</p>
        <p>
          Moreover, if faith give up her God because he frowns, what sort of a
          faith was it? Canst thou not believe in a frowning God? What, hast
          thou a friend who did the other day but give thee a rough word, and
          thou saidst, "At one time I could die for that man," and because he
          gives you one rough word, are you going to give him up? Is this thy
          kindness to thy friends Is this thy confidence in thy God? But how Job
          played the man! Did he turn against his God when he took away his
          comforts from him? No; he said, "The Lord gave, and the Lord bath
          taken away, and blessed be the name of the Lord." And do you not know
          how he put it best of all when he said, "Though he slay me, yet will I
          trust in him "? Yes, if thy faith be only a fair-weather faith, if
          thou canst only walk with God when he sandals thee in silver, and
          smooths the path beneath thy feet, what faith is this? Where didst
          thou get it from? But the faith that can foot it with the Lord through
          Nebuchadnezzar's furnace of fire, and that can go walking with him
          through the valley of the shadow of death -- this is the faith to be
          had and sought after, and God grant it to us, for that was the faith
          that was in the heart of Christ when forsaken of God. He yet says, "My
          God."
        </p>
        <p>
          We have learnt two lessons. Now we have learnt them -- (we have gone
          over them, but have we learnt them?) -- may we practice them, and turn
          to God in ill times, and not relinquish our hold. The third lesson is
          this: --
        </p>
        <p>
          III. ALTHOUGH OUR LORD UTTERED THIS DEEP AND BITTER CRY OF PAIN, YET
          LEARN FROM HIS SILENCE.
        </p>
        <p>
          He never uttered a single syllable of murmuring, or brought any
          accusation against his God. "My God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
          There! look at those words. Can you see any blots in them? I cannot.
          They are crystallised sorrow. but there is no defilement of sin. It
          was just (I was about to say) what an angel could have said, if he
          could have suffered; it is what the Son of God did say, who was purer
          than angels, when he was suffering. Listen to Job, and we must not
          condemn Job, for we should not have been half so good as he, I
          daresay; but he does let his spirit utter itself sometimes in
          bitterness. He curses the day of his birth and so on; but the Lord
          Jesus does not do that. There is not a syllable about "cursed be the
          day in which I was born in Bethlehem, and in which I came amongst such
          a rebellious race as this" -- nor not a word, not a word. And even the
          best of men when in sorrow have at least wished that things were not
          just so. David, when he had lost Absalom, wished that he had died,
          instead of Absalom. But Christ does not appear to want things altered.
          He does not say, "Lord, this is a mistake. Would God I had died by the
          hands of Herod when he sought my life, or had perished when they tried
          to throw me down the hill of Capernaum." No; nothing of the kind.
          There is grief, but there is no complaining; there is sorrow, but
          there is no rebellion. Now this is the point, beloved, I want to bring
          to you. If you should suffer extremely, and it should ever come to
          that terrible pinch that even God's love and the enjoyment of it
          appears to be gone, put your finger to your lip and keep it there. "I
          was dumb with silence; I opened not my mouth, because thou didst it."
          Believe that he is a good God still. Know that assuredly he is working
          for thy good, even now, and let not a syllable escape thee by way of
          murmuring, or if it does, repent of it and recall it. Thou hast a
          right to speak to God, but not to murmur against him, and if thou
          wouldst be like thy Lord, thou wouldst say just this, "Why hast thou
          forsaken me?" But thou wilt say no more, and there wilt thou leave
          him, and if' there oome no answer to thy question thou wilt be content
          to be without an answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now again, I say, this is a lesson I can teach, but I do not know if I
          can practice it, and I do not know that you can. Only, again, "the
          Spirit helpeth our infirmities," and he will enable us when we come to
          "lama sabachthani" to come so far, but not to go farther -- to stop
          there with our Lord. The fourth lesson which, I think, we should learn
          is this: --
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. OUR LORD, WHEN HE DOES CRY, CRIES WITH THE INQUIRING VOICE OF A
          LOVING CHILD.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My God, why, ah! why hast thou forsaken me?" He asks a question not
          in curiosity, but in love. Loving, sorrowful complaints he brings.
          "Why, my God? Why? Why?" Now this is a lesson to us, because we ought
          to endeavour to find out why it is that God hides himself from us. No
          Christian ought to be content to live without full assurance of faith.
          No believer ought to be satisfied to live a moment without knowing to
          a certainty that Christ is his, and if he does not know it, and
          assurance is gone, what ought he to do? Why, he should never be
          content until he has gone to God with the question, "Why have I not
          this assurance? Why have I not thy presence? Why is it that I cannot
          live once I did in the light of thy countenance "And, beloved, the
          answer to this question in our case will sometimes be, "I have
          forsaken thee, my child, because thou hast forsaken me. Thou hast
          grown cold of heart by slow degrees; grey hairs have come upon thee,
          and thou didst not know; and I have made thee know it to make thee see
          thy backsliding, and sorrowfully repent of it." Sometimes the answer
          will be, "My child, I have forsaken thee because thou hast set up an
          idol in thy heart. Thou lovest thy child too much, thy gold too much,
          thy trade too much; and I cannot come into thy soul unless I am thy
          Lord, thy love, thy bridegroom, and thy all." Oh! we shall be glad to
          know these answers, because the moment we know them our heart will
          say: --
        </p>
        <p>"The dearest idol I heve known,</p>
        <p>Whate'er that idol be,</p>
        <p>Help me to tear it from its throne,</p>
        <p>And worship only thee."</p>
        <p>
          Sometimes the Lord's answer will be, "My child, I have gone from thee
          for a little to try thee, to see if thou lovest me." A true lover will
          love on under frowns. It is only the superficial professor that wants
          sweetmeats every day, and only loves his God for what he gets out of
          him; but the genuine believer loves him when he smites him, when he
          bruises him with the bruises of a cruel one. Why, then we will say, "O
          God, if this is why thou dost forsake us, we will love thee still, and
          prove to thee that thy grace has made our souls to hunger and thirst
          for thee." Depend upon it, the best way to get away from trouble, or
          to get great help under it, is to run close in to God. In one of
          Quarles's poems he has the picture of a man striking another with a
          great nail. Now the further off the other is, the heavier it strikes
          him. So the man whom God is smiting runs close in, and he cannot be
          hurt at all. O my God, my God, when away from thee affliction stuns
          me, but I will close with thee, and then even my affliction I will
          take to be a cause of glory, and glory in tribulations also, so that
          thy blast shall not sorely wound my spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, I leave this point with the very same remark I made before. To
          cry to God with the enquiry of a child is the fourth lesson of the
          text. Oh! learn it well. Do practice it when You are in trouble much.
          If you are in such a condition at this time, practice it now, and in
          the pew say, "Show me wherefore thou contendest with me. Search me and
          try me, and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the
          way everlasting." Now the fifth observation is one to be treasured up:
          --
        </p>
        <p>
          V. THAT OUR LORD, THOUGH HE WAS FORSAKEN OF GOD, STILL PURSUED HIS
          FATHER'S WORK -- the work he came to do. "My God, why hast thou
          forsaken me?" But, mark you, he does not leave the cross; he does not
          unloose the nails as he might have done with a will; he did not leap
          down amidst the assembled mockers, and scorn them in return, and chase
          them far away. but he kept on bleeding, suffering, even until he could
          say, "It is finished," and he did not give up the ghost till it was
          finished. Now, beloved, I find it, and I daresay you do, a very easy
          and pleasant thing to go on serving God when I have got a full sense
          of his love, and Christ shining in my face, when every text brings joy
          to my heart, and when I see souls converted, and know that God is
          going with the Word to bless it. That is very easy, but to keep on
          serving God when you get nothing for it but blow -- when there is no
          success, and when your own heart is in deep darkness of spirit -- I
          know the temptation. Perhaps you are under it. Because you have not
          the joy you once had, you say, "I must give up preaching; I must give
          up that Sunday School. If I have not the light of God's countenance,
          how can I do it? I must give it up." Beloved, you must do no such
          thing. Suppose there were a loyal subject in a nation, and he had done
          something or other which grieved the king, and the king on a certain
          day turned his face from him, do you think that loyal subject would go
          away and neglect his duty because the king frowned? No; methinks he
          would say to himself, "I do not know why the king seemed to deal
          hardly with me. He is a good king, and I know he is good, if he does
          not see any good in me, and I will work for him more than ever. I will
          prove to him that my loyalty does not depend upon his smiles. I am his
          loyal subject, and will stand to him still." What would you say to
          your child if you had to chasten him for doing wrong, if he were to go
          away and say, "I shall not attend to the errand that father has sent
          me upon, and I shall do no more in the house that father has commanded
          me to do, because father has beaten me this morning"? Ah! what a
          disobedient child! If the scourging had its fit effect upon him, he
          would say, "I will wrong thee no more, father, lest thou smite me
          again." So let it be with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, should not our gratitude compel us to go on working for God?
          Has not he saved us from hell? Then we may say, with the old heathen,
          "Strike, so long as thou forgivest." Yes, if God forgives, he may
          strike if he will. Suppose a judge should forgive a malefactor
          condemned to die, but he should say to him, "Though you are not to be
          executed as you deserve, yet, for all that, you must be put in prison
          for some years," he would say, "Ah! my Lord, I will take this lesser
          ohastisement, so long as my life is saved." And oh! if our God has
          saved us from going down to the pit by putting his own Son to death on
          our behalf, we will love him for that, if we never have anything more.
          If, between here and heaven, we should have to say, like the elder
          brother, "Thou never gayest me a kid that I might make merry with my
          friends." we will love him still; and if he never does anything to us
          between here and glory, but lay us on a sick bed, and torture us
          there, yet still we will praise and bless him, for he has saved us
          from going down to the pit; therefore, we will love him as long as we
          live. Oh! if you think of God as you ought to do, you will not be at
          ups and downs with him, but you will serve him with all your heart,
          and soul, and might, whether you are enjoying the light of his
          countenance or not. Now to close. Our Lord is an example for us in one
          other matter. He is to us our type of what shall happen to us, for
          whereas he said, "Why hast thou forsaken me?": --
        </p>
        <p>VI. HE HAS RECEIVED A GLORIOUS ANSWER.</p>
        <p>
          And so shall every man that, in the same spirit in the hour of
          darkness, asks the same question. Our Lord died. No answer had he got
          to the question, but the question went on ringing through earth, and
          heaven, and hell. Three days he slept in the grave, and after a while
          he went Into heaven, and my imagination, I think, may be allowed if I
          say that as he entered there the echo of his words, "Why hast thou
          forsaken me?" just died away, and then the Father gave him the
          practical answer to the question; for there, all along the golden
          streets, stood white-robed bands, all of them singing their redeemer's
          praise, all of them chanting the name of Jehovah and the Lamb; and
          this was a part of the answer to his question. God had forsaken Christ
          that these chosen spirits might live through him; they were the reward
          for the travail of his soul; they were the answer to his question; and
          ever since then, between heaven and earth, there has been constant
          commerce. Ii your eyes were opened that you could see, you would
          perceive in the sky not falling stars, shooting downwards, but stars
          rising upward from England, many every hour from America, from all
          countries where the gospel is believed, and from heathen lands where
          the truth is preached and God is owned, for you would see every now
          and then down on earth a dying bed, but upwards through the skies,
          mounting among the stars, another spirit shot upward to complete the
          constellations of the glorified. And as these bright ones, all
          redeemed by his sufferings, enter heaven, they bring to Christ fresh
          answers to that question, "Why hast thou forsaken me?" And if stooping
          from his throne in glory the Prince of life takes view of the sons of
          men who are lingering here, even in this present assembly, he will see
          to-night a vast number of us met together around this table, I hope
          the most, if not all, of us redeemed by his blood and rejoicing in his
          salvation; and the Father points down to-night to this Tabernacle, and
          to thousands of similar scenes where believers cluster around the
          table of fellowship with their Lord, and he seems to say to the
          Saviour, "There is my answer to thy question, 'Why hast thou forsaken
          me?'"
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, beloved, we shall have an answer to our question something like
          that. When we get to heaven, perhaps not until then, God will tell us
          why he forsook us. When I tossed upon my bed three months ago in weary
          pain that robbed me of my night's rest, and my day's rest too, I asked
          why it was I was there, but I have realized since the reason, for God
          helped me afterwards so to preach that many souls were ingathered.
          Often you will find that God deserts you that he may be with you after
          a nobler sort -- hides the light, that afterwards the light of seven
          suns at once may break in upon your spirit, and there you shall learn
          that it was for his glory that he left you, for his glory that he
          tried your faith. Only mind you stand to that. Still cry to him, and
          still call him God, and never complain, hut ask him why, and pursue
          his work still under all difficulties; so being like Christ on earth,
          you shall be like Christ above, as to the answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot sit down without saying just this word. God will never
          forsake his people for ever. But as many of you as are not his people,
          if you have not believed in him, he will forsake you for ever, and for
          ever, and for ever; and if you ask, "Why hast thou forsaken me? "you
          will get, your answer in the echo of your words, "Thou hast forsaken
          me." "How shall ye escape if ye neglect so great salvation?"! "Believe
          in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved."
        </p>
        <p>"But if your ears refuse</p>
        <p>The language of his grace,</p>
        <p>And hearts grow hard like stubborn Jews,</p>
        <p>That unbelieving race;</p>
        <p>The Lord in vengeance drest</p>
        <p>Shall life his hand and swear,</p>
        <p>'You that despised my promised rest</p>
        <p>Shall have no portion there.'"</p>
        <p>God grant it may never be so with you, for Christ's sake. Amen</p>
