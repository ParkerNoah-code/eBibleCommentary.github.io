          Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? -- --
          Declare, if thou hast understanding -- -- <br />Who determined the
          measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who stretched the line upon
          it?<br />Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened?<br />Or who
          laid the corner stone thereof;<br />When the morning stars sang
          together,<br />And all the sons of God shouted for joy?<br />Or who
          shut up the sea with doors,<br />When it brake forth, and issued out
          of the womb;<br />When I made the cloud the garment thereof,<br />And
          thick darkness a swaddling band for it,<br />And prescribed for it my
          decree,<br />And set bars and doors,<br />And said, "Hitherto shalt
          thou come, but no further; And here shall thy proud waves be
          stayed?"<br />Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days began,
          And caused the dayspring to know its place;<br />That it might take
          hold of the ends of the earth,<br />And the wicked be shaken out of
          it?<br />It is changed as clay under the seal;<br />And all things
          stand forth as a garment:<br />And from the wicked their light is
          withholden,<br />And the high arm is broken.<br />Hast thou entered
          into the springs of the sea?<br />Or hast thou walked in the recesses
          of the deep?<br />Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee?<br />Or
          hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death? Hast thou
          comprehended the breadth of the earth?<br />
          -- -- Declare, if thou knowest it all -- -- <br />Where is the way to
          the dwelling of light,<br />And as for darkness, where is the place
          thereof;<br />That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof,<br />And
          that thou shouldest discern the paths to the house thereof? -- --
          Doubtless, thou knowest, for thou wast then born, And the number of
          thy days is great! -- -- <br />Hast thou entered the treasuries of the
          snow,<br />Or hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail,<br />Which I
          have reserved against the time of trouble,<br />Against the day of
          battle and war?<br />By what way is the light parted,<br />Or the east
          wind scattered upon the earth?<br />Who hath cleft a channel for the
          waterflood,<br />Or a way for the lightning of the thunder;<br />To
          cause it to rain on a land where no man is;<br />On the wilderness,
          wherein there is no man;<br />To satisfy the waste and desolate
          ground;<br />And to cause the tender grass to spring forth?<br />Hath
          the rain a father?<br />Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?<br />Out
          of whose womb came the ice?<br />And the hoary frost of heaven, who
          hath gendered it? The waters are hidden as with stone,<br />And the
          face of the deep is frozen.<br />Canst thou bind the cluster of the
          Pleiades,<br />Or loose the bands of Orion?<br />Canst thou lead forth
          the signs of the Zodiac in their season? Or canst thou guide the Bear
          with her train?<br />Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens?<br />Canst
          thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth? Canst thou lift up
          thy voice to the clouds,<br />That abundance of waters may cover
          thee?<br />Canst thou send forth lightnings, that they may go, And say
          unto thee, Here we are?<br />Who hath put wisdom in the inward
          parts?<br />Or who hath given understanding to the mind?<br />Who can
          number the clouds by wisdom?<br />Or who can pour out the bottles of
          heaven,<br />When the dust runneth into a mass,<br />And the clods
          cleave fast together?<br />Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lioness?<br />Or
          satisfy the appetite of the young lions,<br />When they couch in their
          dens,<br />And abide in the covert to lie in wait?<br />Who provideth
          for the raven his food,<br />When his young ones cry unto God,<br />And
          wander for lack of meat?<br />Knowest thou the time when the wild
          goats of the rock bring forth? Or canst thou mark when the hinds do
          calve?<br />Canst thou number the months that they fulfil?<br />Or
          knowest thou the time when they bring forth?<br />They bow themselves,
          they bring forth their young,<br />They cast out their sorrows.<br />Their
          young ones are in good liking,<br />They grow up in the open field;<br />They
          go forth, and return not again.<br />Who hath sent out the wild ass
          free?<br />Or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?<br />Whose
          house I have made the wilderness,<br />And the salt land his dwelling
          place;<br />He scorneth the tumult of the city,<br />Neither heareth
          he the shoutings of the driver.<br />The range of the mountains is his
          pasture,<br />And he searcheth after every green thing.<br />Will the
          wild-ox be content to serve thee?<br />Or will he abide by thy
          crib?<br />Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow? Or
          will he harrow the valleys after thee?<br />Wilt thou trust him,
          because his strength is great? Or wilt thou leave to him thy
          labour?<br />Wilt thou confide in him, that he will bring home thy
          seed, And gather the corn of thy threshing-floor?<br />The wing of the
          ostrich rejoiceth;<br />But are her pinions and feathers kindly?<br />For
          she leaveth her eggs on the earth,<br />And warmeth them in the
          dust,<br />And forgetteth that the foot may crush them,<br />Or that
          the wild beast may trample them.<br />She is hardened against her
          young ones, as if they were not hers: Though her labour be in vain,
          she is without fear;<br />Because God hath deprived her of wisdom,<br />Neither
          hath he imparted to her understanding.<br />What time she lifteth up
          herself on high,<br />She scorneth the horse and his rider.<br />Hast
          thou given the horse his might?<br />Hast thou clothed his neck with
          the quivering mane? Hast thou made him to leap as a locust?<br />The
          glory of his snorting is terrible.<br />He paweth in the valley, and
          rejoiceth in his strength: He goeth out to meet the armed men.<br />He
          mocketh at fear and is not dismayed;<br />Neither turneth he back from
          the sword.<br />The quiver rattleth against him,<br />The flashing
          spear and the javelin.<br />He swalloweth the ground with fierceness
          and rage;<br />Neither standeth he still at the voice of the trumpet.
          As oft as the trumpet soundeth he saith, Aha!<br />And he smelleth the
          battle afar off,<br />The thunder of the captains, and the
          shouting.<br />Doth the hawk soar by thy wisdom,<br />And stretch her
          wings toward the south?<br />Doth the eagle mount up at thy
          command,<br />And make her nest on high?<br />She dwelleth on the
          rock, and hath her lodging there, Upon the crag of the rock and the
          strong hold.<br />From thence she spieth out the prey;<br />Her eyes
          behold it afar off.<br />Her young ones also suck up blood:<br />And
          where the slain are, there is she.
