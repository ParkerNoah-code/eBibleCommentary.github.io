        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1185)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, July 26th, 1874, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |Unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things
          saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the
          creation of God; I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot:
          I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and
          neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. Because thou
          sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing;
          and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and
          blind, and naked: I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire,
          that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be
          clothed, and [that] the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and
          anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. As many as I
          love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. Behold,
          I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the
          door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. To
          him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as
          I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.| --
          Rev.3:14-21
        </p>
        <p>
          No Scripture ever wears out. The epistle to the church of Laodicea is
          not an old letter which may be put into the waste basket and be
          forgotten; upon its page still glow the words, |He that hath an ear,
          let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.| This Scripture
          was not meant to instruct the Laodiceans only, it has a wider aim. The
          actual church of Laodicea has passed away, but other Laodiceas still
          exist -- indeed, they are sadly multiplied in our day, and it has ever
          been the tendency of human nature, however inflamed with the love of
          God, gradually to chill into lukewarmness. The letter to the
          Laodiceans is above all others the epistle for the present times.
        </p>
        <p>
          I should judge that the church at Laodicea was once in a very fervent
          and healthy condition. Paul wrote a letter to it which did not claim
          inspiration, and therefore its loss does not render the Scriptures
          incomplete, for Paul may have written scores of other letters besides.
          Paul also mentions the church at Laodicea in his letter to the church
          at Colosse; he was, therefore, well acquainted with it, and as he does
          not utter a word of censure with regard to it, we may infer that the
          church was at that time in a sound state. In process of time it
          degenerated, and cooling down from its former ardour it became
          careless, lax, and indifferent. Perhaps its best men were dead,
          perhaps its wealth seduced it into worldliness, possibly its freedom
          from persecution engendered carnal ease, or neglect of prayer made it
          gradually backslide; but in any case it declined till it was neither
          cold nor hot. Lest we should ever get into such a state, and lest we
          should be in that state now, I pray that my discourse may come with
          power to the hearts of all present, but especially to the consciences
          of the members of my own church. May God grant that it may tend to the
          arousing of us all.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. My first point will be THE STATE INTO WHICH CHURCHES ARE VERY APT
          TO FALL. A church may fall into a condition far other than that for
          which it has a repute. It may be famous for zeal and yet be lethargic.
          The address of our Lord begins, |I know thy works,| as much as to say,
          |Nobody else knows you. Men think better of you than you deserve. You
          do not know yourselves, you think your works to be excellent; but I
          know them to be very different.| Jesus views with searching eyes all
          the works of his church. The public can only read reports, but Jesus
          sees for himself. He knows what is done, and how it is done, and why
          it is done. He judges a church not merely by her external activities,
          but by her internal pieties; he searches the heart, and tries the
          reins of the children of men. He is not deceived by glitter; he tests
          all things, and values only that gold which will endure the fire. Our
          opinion of ourselves and Christ's opinion of us may be very different,
          and it is a very sad thing when it is so. It will be melancholy indeed
          if we stand out as a church notable for earnestness and distinguished
          for success, and yet are not really fervent in spirit, or eager in
          soul-winning. A lack of vital energy where there seems to be most
          strength put forth, a lack of real love to Jesus where apparently
          there is the greatest devotedness to him, are sad signs of fearful
          degeneracy. Churches are very apt to put the best goods into the
          window, very apt to make a fair show in the flesh, and like men of the
          world, they try to make a fine figure upon a very slender estate.
          Great reputations have often but slender foundations, and lovers of
          the truth lament that it should be so. Not only is it true of
          churches, but of every one of us as individuals, that often our
          reputation is in advance of our deserts. Men often live on their
          former credit, and trade upon their past characters, having still a
          name to live, though they are indeed dead. To be slandered is a dire
          affliction, but it is, upon the whole, a less evil than to be thought
          better than we are; in the one case we have a promise to comfort us,
          in the second we are in danger of self-conceit. I speak as unto wise
          men, judge ye how far this may apply to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The condition described in our text is, secondly, one of mournful
          indifference and carelessness. They were not cold, but they were not
          hot; they were not infidels, yet they were not earnest believers; they
          did not oppose the gospel, neither did they defend it; they were not
          working mischief, neither were they doing any great good; they were
          not disreputable in moral character, but they were not distinguished
          for holiness; they were not irreligious, but they were not
          enthusiastic in piety nor eminent for zeal: they were what the world
          calls |Moderates,| they were of the Broad-church school, they were
          neither bigots nor Puritans, they were prudent and avoided fanaticism,
          respectable and averse to excitement. Good things were maintained
          among them, but they did not make too much of them; they had
          prayer-meetings, but there were few present, for they liked quiet
          evenings at home: when more attended the meetings they were still very
          dull, for they did their praying very deliberately and were afraid of
          being too excited. They were content to have all things done decently
          and in order, but vigour and zeal they considered to be vulgar. Such
          churches have schools, Bible-classes, preaching rooms, and all sorts
          of agencies; but they might as well be without them, for no energy is
          displayed and no good comes of them. They have deacons and elders who
          are excellent pillars of the church, if the chief quality of pillars
          be to stand still, and exhibit no motion or emotion. They have
          ministers who may be the angels of the churches, but if so, they have
          their wings closely clipped, for they do not fly very far in preaching
          the everlasting gospel, and they certainly are not flames of fire:
          they may be shining lights of eloquence, but they certainly are not
          burning lights of grace, setting men's hearts on fire. In such
          communities everything is done in a half-hearted, listless,
          dead-and-alive way, as if it did not matter much whether it was done
          or not. It makes one's flesh creep to see how sluggishly they move: I
          long for a knife to cut their red tape to pieces, and for a whip to
          lay about their shoulders to make them bestir themselves. Things are
          respectably done, the rich families are not offended, the sceptical
          party is conciliated, and the good people are not quite alienated:
          things are made pleasant all round. The right things are done, but as
          to doing them with all your might, and soul, and strength, a Laodicean
          church has no notion of what that means. They are not so cold as to
          abandon their work, or to give up their meetings for prayer, or to
          reject the gospel; if they did so, then they could be convinced of
          their error and brought to repentance; but on the other hand they are
          neither hot for the truth, nor hot for conversions, nor hot for
          holiness, they are not fiery enough to burn the stubble of sin, nor
          zealous enough to make Satan angry, nor fervent enough to make a
          living sacrifice of themselves upon the altar of their God. They are
          |neither cold not hot.|
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a horrible state, because it is one which in a church wearing
          a good repute renders that reputation a lie. When other churches are
          saying, |See how they prosper! see what they do for God!| Jesus sees
          that the church is doing his work in a slovenly, make-believe manner,
          and he considers justly that it is deceiving its friends. If the world
          recognizes such a people as being very distinctly an old-fashioned
          puritanic church, and yet there is unholy living among them, and
          careless walking, and a deficiency of real piety, prayer, liberality,
          and zeal, then the world itself is being deceived, and that too in the
          worst way, because it is led to judge falsely concerning Christianity,
          for it lays all these faults upon the back of religion, and cries out,
          |It is all a farce! The thing is a mere pretence! Christians are all
          hypocrites!| I fear there are churches of this sort. God grant we may
          not be numbered with them!
        </p>
        <p>
          In this state of the church there is much self-glorification, for
          Laodicea said, |I am rich and increased with goods, and have need of
          nothing.| The members say, |Everything goes on well, what more do we
          want? All is right with us.| This makes such a condition very
          hopeless, because reproofs and rebukes fall without power, where the
          party rebuked can reply, |We do not deserve your censures, such
          warnings are not meant for us.| If you stand up in the pulpit and talk
          to sleepy churches, as I pretty frequently do, and speak very plainly,
          they often have the honesty to say, |There is a good deal of truth in
          what the man has said|: but if I speak to another church, which really
          is half asleep, but which thinks itself to be quite a model of
          diligence, then the rebuke glides off like oil down a slab of marble,
          and no result comes of it. Men are less likely to repent when they are
          in the middle passage between hot and cold, than if they were in the
          worst extremes of sin. If they were like Saul of Tarsus, enemies of
          God, they might be converted; but if, like Gamaliel, they are neither
          opposed nor favouring, they will probably remain as they are till they
          die. The gospel converts a sincerely superstitious Luther, but
          Erasmus, with his pliant spirit, flippant, and full of levity, remains
          unmoved. There is more hope of warning the cold than the lukewarm.
        </p>
        <p>
          When churches get into the condition of half-hearted faith, tolerating
          the gospel, but having a sweet tooth for error, they do far more
          mischief to their age than downright heretics.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is harder a great deal to work for Jesus with a church which is
          lukewarm than it would be to begin without a church. Give me a dozen
          earnest spirits and put me down anywhere in London, and by God's good
          help we will soon cause the wilderness and the solitary place to
          rejoice; but give me the whole lot of you, half-hearted, undecided,
          and unconcerned, what can I do? You will only be a drag upon a man's
          zeal and earnestness. Five thousand members of a church all lukewarm
          will be five thousand impediments, but a dozen earnest, passionate
          spirits, determined that Christ shall be glorified and souls won, must
          be more than conquerors; in their very weakness and fewness will
          reside capacities for being the more largely blessed of God. Better
          nothing than lukewarmness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas, this state of lukewarmness is so congenial with human nature
          that it is hard to fetch men from it. Cold makes us shiver, and great
          heat causes us pain, but a tepid bath is comfort itself. Such a
          temperature suits human nature. The world is always at peace with a
          lukewarm church, and such a church is always pleased with itself. Not
          too worldly, -- no! We have our limits! There are certain amusements
          which of course a Christian must give up, but we will go quite up to
          the line, for why are we to be miserable? We are not to be so greedy
          as to be called miserly, but we will give as little as we can to the
          cause. We will not be altogether absent from the house of God, but we
          will go as seldom as we can. We will not altogether forsake the poor
          people to whom we belong, but we will also go to the world's church,
          so as to get admission into better society, and find fashionable
          friends for our children. How much of this there is abroad! Compromise
          is the order of the day. Thousands try to hold with the hare and run
          with the hounds, they are for God and Mammon, Christ and Belial, truth
          and error, and so are |neither hot nor cold.| Do I speak somewhat
          strongly? Not so strongly as my Master, for he says, |I will spue thee
          out of my mouth.| He is nauseated with such conduct, it sickens him,
          and he will not endure it. In an earnest, honest, fervent heart nausea
          is created when we fall in with men who dare not give up their
          profession, and yet will not live up to it; who cannot altogether
          forsake the work of God, but yet do it in a sluggard's manner,
          trifling with that which ought to be done in the best style for so
          good a Lord and so gracious a Saviour. Many a church has fallen into a
          condition of indifference, and when it does so it generally becomes
          the haunt of worldly professors, a refuge for people who want an easy
          religion, which enables them to enjoy the pleasures of sin and the
          honours of piety at the same time; where things are free and easy,
          where you are not expected to do much, or give much, or pray much, or
          to be very religious; where the minister is not so precise as the old
          school divines, a more liberal people, of broad views, free-thinking
          and free-acting, where there is full tolerance for sin, and no demand
          for vital godliness. Such churches applaud cleverness in a preacher;
          as for his doctrine, that is of small consequence, and his love to
          Christ and zeal for souls are very secondary. He is a clever fellow,
          and can speak well, and that suffices. This style of things is all too
          common, yet we are expected to hold our tongue, for the people are
          very respectable. The Lord grant that we may be kept clear of such
          respectability!
        </p>
        <p>
          We have already said that this condition of indifference is attended
          with perfect self-complacency. The people who ought to be mourning are
          rejoicing, and where they should hang out signals of distress they are
          flaunting the banners of triumph. |We are rich, we are adding to our
          numbers, enlarging our schools, and growing on all sides; we have need
          of nothing. What can a church require that we have not in abundance?|
          Yet their spiritual needs are terrible. This is a sad state for a
          church to be in. Spiritually poor and proud. A church crying out to
          God because it feels itself in a backsliding state; a church mourning
          its deficiency, a church pining and panting to do more for Christ, a
          church burning with zeal for God, and therefore quite discontented
          with what it has been able to do; this is the church which God will
          bless: but that which writes itself down as a model for others, is
          very probably grossly mistaken and is in a sad plight. This church,
          which was so rich in its own esteem, was utterly bankrupt in the sight
          of the Lord. It had no real joy in the Lord; it had mistaken its joy
          in itself for that. It had no real beauty of holiness upon it; it had
          mistaken its formal worship and fine building and harmonious singing
          for that. It had no deep understanding of the truth and no wealth of
          vital godliness, it had mistaken carnal wisdom and outward profession
          for those precious things. It was poor in secret prayer, which is the
          strength of any church; it was destitute of communion with Christ,
          which is the very life blood of religion; but it had the outward
          semblance of these blessings, and walked in a vain show. There are
          churches which are poor as Lazarus as to true religion, and yet are
          clothed in scarlet and fare sumptuously every day upon the mere form
          of godliness. Spiritual leanness exists side by side with vain-glory.
          Contentment as to worldly goods makes men rich, but contentment with
          our spiritual condition is the index of poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, this church of Laodicea had fallen into a condition which
          had chased away its Lord. The text tells us that Jesus said, |I stand
          at the door and knock.| That is not the position which our Lord
          occupies in reference to a truly flourishing church. If we are walking
          aright with him, he is in the midst of the church, dwelling there, and
          revealing himself to his people. His presence makes our worship to be
          full of spirituality and life; he meets his servants at the table, and
          there spreads them a feast upon his body and his blood; it is he who
          puts power and energy into all our church-action, and causes the word
          to sound out from our midst. True saints abide in Jesus and he in
          them. Oh, brethren, when the Lord is in a church, it is a happy
          church, a holy church, a mighty church, and a triumphant church; but
          we may grieve him till he will say, |I will go and return to my place,
          until they acknowledge their offence and seek my face.| Oh, you that
          know my Lord, and have power with him, entreat him not to go away from
          us. He can see much about us as a people which grieves his Holy
          Spirit, much about any one of us to provoke him to anger. Hold him, I
          pray you, and do not let him go, or if he be gone, bring him again to
          his mother's house, into the chamber of her that bare him, where, with
          holy violence, we will detain him and say, |Abide with us, for thou
          art life and joy, and all in all to us as a church. Ichabod is written
          across our house if thou be gone, for thy presence is our glory and
          thy absence will be our shame.| Churches may become like the temple
          when the glory of the Lord had left the holy place, because the image
          of jealousy was set up and the house was defiled. What a solemn
          warning is that which is contained in Jeremiah 7:12-15, |But go ye now
          unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first,
          and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel. And
          now, because ye have done all these works, saith the Lord, and I spake
          unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called
          you, but ye answered not; therefore I will do unto this house, which
          is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I
          gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh. And I will
          cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even
          the whole seed of Ephraim.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now let us consider, secondly, THE DANGER OF SUCH A STATE. The
          great danger is, first, to be rejected of Christ. He puts it, |I will
          spue thee out of my mouth,| -- as disgusting him, and causing him
          nausea. Then the church must first be in his mouth, or else it could
          not be spued from it. What does this mean? Churches are in Christ's
          mouth in several ways, they are used by him as his testimony to the
          world; he speaks to the world through their lives and ministries. He
          does as good as say, |O sinners, if ye would see what my religion can
          do, see here a godly people banded together in my fear and love,
          walking in peace and holiness.| He speaks powerfully by them, and
          makes the world see and know that there is a true power in the gospel
          of the grace of God. But when the church becomes neither cold nor hot
          he does not speak by her, she is no witness for him. When God is with
          a church the minister's words come out of Christ's mouth. |Out of his
          mouth went a two-edged sword,| says John in the Revelation, and that
          |two-edged sword| is the gospel which we preach. When God is with a
          people they speak with divine power to the world, but if we grow
          lukewarm Christ says, |Their teachers shall not profit, for I have not
          sent them, neither am I with them. Their word shall be as water spilt
          on the ground, or as the whistling of the wind.| This is a dreadful
          thing. Better far for me to die than to be spued out of Christ's
          mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he also ceases to plead for such a church. Christ's special
          intercession is not for all men, for he says of his people, |I pray
          for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given
          me.| I do not think Christ ever prays for the church of Rome -- what
          would he pray for, but her total overthrow? Other churches are nearing
          the same fate; they are not clear in his truth or honest in obedience
          to his word: they follow their own devices, they are lukewarm. But
          there are churches for which he is pleading, for he has said, |For
          Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will
          not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and
          the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.| Mighty are his
          pleadings for those he really loves, and countless are the blessings
          which comes in consequence. It will be an evil day when he casts a
          church out of that interceding mouth, and leaves her unrepresented
          before the throne because he is none of his. Do you not tremble at
          such a prospect? Will you not ask for grace to return to your first
          love? I know that the Lord Jesus will never leave off praying for his
          own elect, but for churches as corporate bodies he may cease to pray,
          because they become anti-Christian, or are mere human gatherings, but
          not elect assemblies, such as the church of God ought to be. Now this
          is the danger of any church if it declines from its first ardour and
          becomes lukewarm. |Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and
          repent, and do thy first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly,
          and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.|
        </p>
        <p>
          What is the other danger? This first comprehends all, but another evil
          is hinted at, -- such a church will be left to its fallen condition,
          to become wretched, -- that is to say, miserable, unhappy, divided,
          without the presence of God, and so without delight in the ways of
          God, lifeless, spiritless, dreary, desolate, full of schisms, devoid
          of grace, and I know not what beside, that may come under the term
          |wretched.| Then the next word is |miserable,| which might better be
          rendered |pitiable.| Churches which once were a glory shall become a
          shame. Whereas men said, |The Lord has done great things for them,|
          they shall now say, |see how low they have fallen! What a change has
          come over the place! What emptiness and wretchedness! What a blessing
          rested there for so many years, but what a contrast now!| Pity will
          take the place of congratulation, and scorn will follow upon
          admiration. Then it will be |poor| in membership, poor in effort, poor
          in prayer, poor in gifts and graces, poor in everything. Perhaps some
          rich people will be left to keep up the semblance of prosperity, but
          all will be empty, vain, void, Christless, lifeless. Philosophy will
          fill the pulpit with chaff, the church will be a mass of worldliness,
          the congregation an assembly of vanity. Next, they will become blind,
          they will not see themselves as they are, they will have no eye upon
          the neighborhood to do it good, no eye to the coming of Christ, no eye
          for his glory. They will say, |We see,| and yet be blind as bats.
          Ultimately they will become |naked,| their shame will be seen by all,
          they will be a proverb in everybody's mouth. |Call that a church!|
          says one. |Is that a church of Jesus Christ?| cries a second. Those
          dogs that dared not open their mouths against Israel when the Lord was
          there will begin to howl when he is gone, and everywhere will the
          sound be heard, |How are the mighty fallen, how are the weapons of war
          broken.|
        </p>
        <p>
          In such a case as that the church will fail of overcoming, for it is
          |to him that overcometh| that a seat upon Christ's throne is promised;
          but that church will come short of victory. It shall be written
          concerning it even as of the children of Ephraim, that being armed and
          carrying bows they turned their backs in the day of battle. |Ye did
          run well,| says Paul to the Galatians, |what did hinder you that ye
          should not obey the truth?| Such a church had a grand opportunity, but
          it was not equal to the occasion, its members were born for a great
          work, but inasmuch as they were unfaithful, God put them aside and
          used other means. He raised up in their midst a flaming testimony for
          the gospel, and the light thereof was cast athwart the ocean, and
          gladdened the nations, but the people were not worthy of it, or true
          to it, and therefore he took the candlestick out of its place, and
          left them in darkness. May God prevent such an evil from coming upon
          us: but such is the danger to all churches if they degenerate into
          listless indifference.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Thirdly, I have to speak of THE REMEDIES WHICH THE LORD EMPLOYS.
          I do earnestly pray that what I say may come home to all here,
          especially to every one of the members of this church, for it has come
          very much home to me, and caused great searching of heart in my own
          soul, and yet I do not think I am the least zealous among you. I
          beseech you to judge yourselves, that you be not judged. Do not ask me
          if I mean anything personal. I am personal in the most emphatic sense.
          I speak of you and to you in the plainest way. Some of you show plain
          symptoms of being lukewarm, and God forbid that I should flatter you,
          or be unfaithful to you. I am aiming at personality, and I earnestly
          want each beloved brother and sister here to take home each
          affectionate rebuke. And you who come from other churches, whether in
          America or elsewhere, you want arousing quite as much as we do, your
          churches are not better than ours, some of them are not so good, and I
          speak to you also, for you need to be stirred up to nobler things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, then, the first remedy. Jesus gives a clear discovery as to the
          church's true state. He says to it -- |Thou are lukewarm, thou art
          wretched and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.| I rejoice to
          see people willing to know the truth, but most men do not wish to know
          it, and this is an ill sign. When a man tells you that he has not
          looked at his ledger, or day-book, or held a stock-taking for this
          twelvemonths, you know whereabouts he is, and you say to your manager,
          |Have you an account with him? Then keep it as close as you can.| When
          a man dares not know the worst about his case, it is certainly a bad
          one, but he that is right before God is thankful to be told what he is
          and where he is. Now, some of you know the faults of other people, and
          in watching this church you have observed weak points in many places,
          -- have you wept over them? Have you prayed over them? If not, you
          have not watched as you should do for the good of your brethren and
          sisters, and, perhaps, have allowed evils to grow which ought to have
          been rooted up: you have been silent when you should have kindly and
          earnestly spoken to the offenders, or made your own example a warning
          to them. Do not judge your brother, but judge yourself: if you have
          any severity, use it on your own conduct and heart. We must pray the
          Lord to use this remedy, and make us know just where we are. We shall
          never get right as long as we are confident that we are so already.
          Self-complacency is the death of repentance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord's next remedy is gracious counsel. He says, |I counsel thee
          to buy of me gold tried in the fire.| Does not that strike you as
          being very like the passage in Isaiah, |Come ye, buy, and eat; yea,
          come, buy wine and milk without money and without price?| It is so,
          and it teaches us that one remedy for lukewarmness is to begin again
          just as we began at first. We were at a high temperature at our first
          conversion. What joy, what peace, what delight, what comfort, what
          enthusiasm we had when first we knew the Lord! We bought gold of him
          then for nothing, let us go and buy again at the same price.
        </p>
        <p>
          If religion has not been genuine with us till now, or if we have been
          adding to it great lumps of shining stuff which we thought was gold
          and was not, let us now go to the heavenly mint and buy gold tried in
          the fire, that we may be really rich. Come, let us begin again, each
          one of us. Inasmuch as we may have thought we were clothed and yet we
          were naked, let us hasten to him again, and at his own price, which is
          no price, procure the robe which he has wrought of his own
          righteousness, and that goodly raiment of his Spirit, which will
          clothe us with the beauty of the Lord. If, moreover, we have come to
          be rather dim in the eye, and no longer look up to God and see his
          face, and have no bright vision of the glory to be revealed, and
          cannot look on sinners with weeping eyes, as we once did, let us go to
          Jesus for the eye-salve, just as we went when we were stone blind at
          first, and the Lord will open our eyes again, and we shall behold him
          in clear vision as in days gone by. The word from Jesus is, |Come near
          to me, I pray you, my brethren. If you have wandered from me, return;
          if you have been cold to me I am not cold to you, my heart is the same
          to you as ever, come back to me, my brethren. Confess your evil deeds,
          receive my forgiveness, and henceforth let your hearts burn towards
          me, for I love you still and will supply all your needs.| That is good
          counsel, let us take it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now comes a third remedy, sharp and cutting, but sent in love, namely,
          rebukes and chastenings. Christ will have his favoured church walk
          with great care, and if she will not follow him fully by being shown
          wherein she has erred, and will not repent when kindly counselled, he
          then betakes himself to some sharper means. |As many as I love I
          rebuke and chasten.| The word here used for |love| is a very choice
          one; it is one which signifies an intense personal affection. Now,
          there are some churches which Christ loves very specially, favouring
          them above others, doing more for them than for others, and giving
          them more prosperity; they are the darlings of his heart, his
          Benjamins. Now, it is a very solemn thing to be dearly loved by God.
          It is a privilege to be coveted, but mark you, the man who is so
          honoured occupies a position of great delicacy. The Lord thy God is a
          jealous God, and he is most jealous where he shows most love. The Lord
          lets some men escape scot free for awhile after doing many evil
          things, but if they had been his own elect he would have visited them
          with stripes long before. He is very jealous of those whom he has
          chosen to lean upon his bosom and to be his familiar friends. Your
          servant may do many things which could not be thought of by your child
          or your wife; and so is it with many who profess to be servants of God
          -- they live a very lax life, and they do not seem to be chastened for
          it, but if they were the Lord's own peculiarly beloved ones he would
          not endure such conduct from them. Now mark this, if the Lord exalts a
          church, and gives it a special blessing, he expects more of it, more
          care of his honour, and more zeal for his glory than he does of any
          other church; and when he does not find it, what will happen? Why,
          because of his very love he will rebuke it with hard sermons, sharp
          words, and sore smitings of conscience. If these do not arouse it he
          will take down the rod and deal out chastenings. Do you know how the
          Lord chastens churches? Paul says, |For this cause some are sickly
          among you, and many sleep.| Bodily sickness is often sent in
          discipline upon churches, and losses, and crosses, and troubles are
          sent among the members, and sometimes leanness in the pulpit,
          breakings out of heresy and divisions in the pew, and lack of success
          in all church work. All these are smitings with the rod. It is very
          sad, but sometimes that rod does not fall on that part of the church
          which does the wrong. Sometimes God may take the best in the church,
          and chasten them for the wrong of others. You say, |How can that be
          right?| Why, because they are the kind of people who will be most
          benefited by it. If a vine wants the knife, it is not the branch that
          bears very little fruit which is trimmed, but the branch which bears
          much fruit is purged because it is worth purging. In their case the
          chastening is a blessing and a token of love. Sorrow is often brought
          upon Christians by the sins of their fellow-members, and many an
          aching heart there is in this world that I know of, of brethren and
          sisters who love the Lord and want to see souls converted, but they
          can only sigh and cry because nothing is done. Perhaps they have a
          minister who does not believe the gospel, and they have fellow-members
          who do not care whether the minister believes it or not, they are all
          asleep together except those few zealous souls who besiege the throne
          of grace day and night, and they are the ones who bear the burden of
          the lukewarm church. Oh, if the chastening comes here, whoever bears
          it, may the whole body be the better for it, and may we never rest
          till the church begins to glow with the sacred fire of God, and boil
          with enthusiastic desire for his glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last remedy, however, is the best of all to my mind. I love it
          best and desire to make it my food when it is not my medicine. The
          best remedy for backsliding churches is more communion with Christ.
          |Behold,| saith he, |I stand at the door and knock.| I have known this
          text preached upon to sinners numbers of times as though Christ
          knocked at their door and they had to open it, and so on. The preacher
          has never managed to keep to free grace for this reason, that the text
          was not meant to be so used, and if men will ride a text the wrong
          way, it will not go. This text belongs to the church of God, not to
          the unconverted. It is addressed to the Laodicean church. There is
          Christ outside the church, driven there by her unkindness, but he has
          not gone far away, he loves his church too much to leave her
          altogether, he longs to come back, and therefore he waits at the
          doorpost. He knows that the church will never be restored till he
          comes back, and he desires to bless her, and so he stands waiting,
          knocking and knocking, again and again; he does not merely knock once,
          but he stands knocking by earnest sermons, by providences, by
          impressions upon the conscience, by the quickenings of his Holy
          Spirit; and while he knocks he speaks, he uses all means to awaken his
          church. Most condescendingly and graciously does he do this, for
          having threatened to spue her out of his mouth, he might have said, |I
          will get me gone; and I will never come back again to thee,| that
          would have been natural and just; but how gracious he is when, having
          expressed his disgust he says, |Disgusted as I am with your condition,
          I do not wish to leave you; I have taken my presence from you, but I
          love you, and therefore I knock at your door, and wish to be received
          into your heart. I will not force myself upon you, I want you
          voluntarily to open the door to me.| Christ's presence in a church is
          always a very tender thing. He never is there against the will of the
          church, it cannot be, for he lives in his people's wills and hearts,
          and |worketh in them to will and to do of his own good pleasure.| He
          does not break bolt and bar and come in as he often does into a
          sinner's heart, carrying the soul by storm, because the man is dead in
          sin, and Christ must do it all, or the sinner will perish; but he is
          here speaking to living men and women, who ought also to be loving men
          and women, and he says, |I wish to be among you, open the door to me.|
          We ought to open the door at once, and say, |Come in, good Lord, we
          grieve to think we should ever have put thee outside that door at
          all.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And then see what promises he gives. He says he will come and sup with
          us. Now, in the East, the supper was the best meal of the day, it was
          the same as our dinner; so that we may say that Christ will come and
          dine with us. He will give us a rich feast, for he himself is the
          daintiest and most plenteous of all feasts for perishing souls. He
          will come and sup with us, that is, we shall be the host and entertain
          him: but then he adds, |and he with me,| that is, he will be the host
          and guest by turns. We will give him of our best, but poor fare is
          that, too poor for him, and yet he will partake of it. Then he shall
          be host, and we will be guest, and oh, how we will feast on what he
          gives! Christ comes, and brings the supper with him, and all we do is
          to find the room. The Master says to us, |Where is the guest chamber?|
          and then he makes ready and spreads his royal table. Now, if these be
          the terms on which we are to have a feast together, we will most
          willingly fling open the doors of our hearts and say, |Come in, good
          Lord.| He says to you, |Children, have you any meat?| and if you are
          obliged to say, |No, Lord,| he will come in unto you none the less
          readily, for there are the fish, the net is ready to break, it is so
          full, and here are more upon the coals ready. I warrant you, if we sup
          with him, we shall be lukewarm no longer. The men who live where Jesus
          is soon feel their hearts burning. It is said of a piece of scented
          clay by the old Persian moralist that the clay was taken up and
          questioned. |How camest thou to smell so sweetly, being nothing but
          common clay?| and it replied, |I laid for many a year in the sweet
          society of a rose, until at last I drank in its perfume|; and we may
          say to every warm-hearted Christian, |How camest thou so warm?| and
          his answer will be, |My heart bubbleth up with a good matter, for I
          speak of the things which I have made touching the King. I have been
          with Jesus, and I have learned of him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, brethren and sisters, what can I say to move you to take this
          last medicine? I can only say, take it, not only because of the good
          it will do you, but because of the sweetness of it. I have heard say
          of some persons that they were pledged not to take wine except as a
          medicine, but then they were very pleased when they were ill: and so
          if this be the medicine, |I will come and sup with him, and he with
          me,| we may willingly confess our need of so delicious a remedy. Need
          I press it on you? May I not rather urge each brother as soon as he
          gets home today to see whether he cannot enter into fellowship with
          Jesus? and may the Spirit of God help him!
        </p>
        <p>
          This is my closing word, there is something for us to do in this
          matter. We must examine ourselves, and we must confess the fault if we
          have declined in grace. An then we must not talk about setting the
          church right, we must pray for grace each one for himself, for the
          text does not say, |If the church will open the door,| but |If any man
          hear my voice and open the door.| It must be done by individuals: the
          church will only get right by each man getting right. Oh, that we
          might get back into an earnest zeal for our Lord's love and service,
          and we shall only do so by listening to his rebukes, and then falling
          into his arms, clasping him once again, and saying, |My Lord and my
          God.| That healed Thomas, did it not? Putting his fingers into the
          print of the nails, putting his hand into the side, that cured him.
          Poor, unbelieving, staggering Thomas only had to do that and he became
          one of the strongest of believers, and said, |My Lord and my God.| You
          will love your Lord till your soul is as coals of juniper if you will
          daily commune with him. Come close to him, and once getting close to
          him, never go away from him any more. The Lord bless you, dear
          brethren, the Lord bless you in this thing.
