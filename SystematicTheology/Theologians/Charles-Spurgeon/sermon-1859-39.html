        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.263)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, July 17th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what
          work thou didst in their days, in the times of old." -- Psalm 44:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          PERHAPS there are no stories that stick by us so long as those which
          we hear in our childhood, those tales which are told us by our
          fathers, and in our nurseries. It is a sad reflection that too many of
          these stories are idle and vain, so that our minds in early infancy
          are tinctured with fables, and inoculated with strange and lying
          narratives. Now, among the early Christians and the old believers in
          the far-off times, nursery tales were far different from what they are
          now, and the stories with which their children were amused were of a
          far different class from those which fascinated us in the days of our
          babyhood. No doubt, Abraham would talk to young children about the
          flood, and tell them how the waters overspread the earth, and how Noah
          alone was saved in the ark. The ancient Israelites, when they dwelt in
          their own land, would all of them tell their children about the Red
          Sea, and the plagues which God wrought in Egypt when he brought his
          people out of the house of bondage. Among the early Christians we know
          that it was the custom of parents to recount to their children
          everything concerning the life of Christ, the acts of the apostles,
          and the like interesting narratives. Nay, among our puritanic
          ancestors such were the stories that regaled their childhood. Sitting
          down by the fireside, before those old Dutch tiles with the quaint
          eccentric drawings upon them of the history of Christ, mothers would
          teach their children about Jesus walking on the water, or of his
          multiplying the loaves of bread, or of his marvellous transfiguration,
          or of the crucifixion of Jesus. Oh, how I would that the like were the
          tales of the present age, that the stories of our childhood would be
          again the stories of Christ, and that we would each of us believe
          that, after all, there can be nothing so interesting as that which is
          true, and nothing more striking than those stories which are written
          in sacred writ; nothing that can more truly move the heart of a child
          than the marvellous works of God which he did in the olden times. It
          seems that the psalmist who wrote this most musical ode had heard from
          his father, handed to him by tradition, the stories of the wondrous
          things which God had done in his day; and afterwards, this sweet
          singer in Israel taught it to his children, and so was one generation
          after another led to call God blessed, remembering his mighty acts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my dear friends, this morning I intend to recall to your minds
          some of the wondrous things which God has done in the olden time. My
          aim and object will be to excite your minds to seek after the like;
          that looking back upon what God has done, you may be induced to look
          forward with the eye of expectation, hoping that he will again stretch
          forth his potent hand and his holy arm, and repeat those mighty acts
          he performed in ancient days.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I shall speak of the marvellous stories which our fathers have
          told us, and which we have heard of the olden time; secondly, I shall
          mention some disadvantages under which these old stories labour wit
          regard to the effect upon our minds; and, then, I shall draw the
          proper inferences from those marvellous things which we have heard,
          that the Lord did in the days of yore.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. To begin then, with THE WONDERFUL STORIES WE HAVE HEARD OF THE
          LORD'S ANCIENT DOINGS.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have heard that God has at times done very mighty acts. The plain
          everyday course of the world hath been disturbed with wonders at which
          men have been exceedingly amazed. God hath not always permitted his
          church to go on climbing by slow degrees to victory, but he hath been
          pleased at times to smite one terrible blow, and lay his enemies down
          upon the earth, and bid his children march over their prostrate
          bodies. Turn back then, to ancient records, and remember what God hath
          done. Will ye not remember what he did at the Red Sea, how he smote
          Egypt and all its chivalry, and covered Pharaoh's chariot and horse in
          the Red Sea? Have ye not heard tell how God smote Og, king of Bashan,
          and Sihon, king of the Amorites, because they withstood the progress
          of his people? Have ye not learned how he proved that his mercy
          endureth for ever, when he slew those great kings and cast the mighty
          ones down from their thrones? Have you not read, too, how God smote
          the children of Canaan, and drove out the inhabitants thereof, and
          gave the land to his people, to be a possession by lot for ever? Have
          you not heard how when the hosts of Jabin came against them, the stars
          in their courses fought against Sisera? The river of Kishon swept them
          away, "that ancient river, the river Kishon," and there was none of
          them left? Hath it not been told you, too, how by the hand of David,
          God smote the Philistines, and how by his right hand he smote the
          children of Ammon? Have you not heard how Midian was put to confusion,
          and the myriads of Arabia were scattered by Asa in the day of his
          faith? And have you not heard, too, how the Lord sent a blast upon the
          hosts of Sennacherib, so that in the morning they were all dead men?
          Tell -- tell ye these, his wonders! Speak of them in your streets.
          Teach them to your children. Let them not be forgotten, for the right
          hand of the Lord hath done marvellous things, his name is known in all
          the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wonders, however, which most concern us, are those of the
          Christian era; and surely these are not second to those under the Old
          Testament. Have you never read how God won to himself great renown on
          the day of Pentecost? Turn ye to this book of the record of the
          wonders of the Lord and read. Peter the fisherman stood up and
          preached in the name of the Lord his God. A multitude assembled and
          the Spirit of God fell upon them; and it came to pass that three
          thousand in one day were pricked in their heart by the hand of God,
          and believed on the Lord Jesus Christ. And know you not how the twelve
          apostles with the disciples went everywhere preaching the Word, and
          the idols fell from their thrones? The cities opened wide their gates,
          and the messengers of Christ walked through the streets and preached.
          It is true that at first they were driven hither and thither, and
          hunted like partridges upon the mountains: but do ye not remember how
          the Lord did get unto himself a victory, so that in a hundred years
          after the nailing of Christ to the cross, the gospel had been preached
          in every nation, and the isles of the sea had heard the sound thereof?
          And have you forgotten how the heathen were baptized, thousands at a
          time, in every river? What stream is there in Europe that cannot
          testify to the majesty of the gospel? What city is there in the land
          that cannot tell how God's truth has triumphed, and how the heathen
          has forsaken his false god, and bowed his knee to Jesus the crucified?
          The first spread of the gospel is a miracle never to be eclipsed.
          Whatever god may have done at the Red Sea, he hath done still more
          within a hundred years after the time when Christ first came into the
          world. It seemed as if a fire from heaven ran along the ground.
          Nothing could resist its force. The lightning shaft of truth shivered
          every pinnacle of the idol temple, and Jesus was worshipped from the
          rising of the sun to the going down of the same.
        </p>
        <p>This is one of the things we have heard of the olden times.</p>
        <p>
          And have ye never heard of the mighty things which God did by
          preachers some hundreds of years from that date? Hath it not been told
          you concerning Chrysostom, the golden-mouthed, how, whenever he
          preached, the church was thronged with attentive hearers; and there,
          standing and lifting up holy hands, he spake with a majesty
          unparalleled, the word of God in truth and righteousness; the people
          listening, hanging forward to catch every word, and anon breaking the
          silence with the clapping of their hands and the stamping of their
          feet; then silent again for a while, spell-bound by the mighty orator;
          and again carried away with enthusiasm, springing to their feet,
          clapping their hands, and shouting for joy again? Numberless were the
          conversions in his day. God was exceedingly magnified, for sinners
          were abundantly saved. And have your fathers never told you of the
          wondrous things that were done afterwards when the black darkness of
          superstition covered the earth, when Popery sat upon her throne and
          stretched her iron rod across the nations and shut the windows of
          heaven, and quenched the very stars of God and made thick darkness
          cover the people? Have ye never heard how Martin Luther arose and
          preached the gospel of the grace of God, and how the nations trembled,
          and the world heard the voice of God and lived? Have you not heard of
          Zwingle among the Swiss, and of Calvin in the city of Geneva, and of
          the mighty works that God did by them? Nay, as Britons have ye
          forgotten the mighty preacher of the truth -- have your ears ceased to
          tingle with the wondrous tale of the preachers that Wickliffe sent
          forth into every market town and every hamlet of England, preaching
          the gospel of God? Oh, doth not history tell us that these men were
          like fire-brands in the midst of the dry stubble; that their voice was
          as the roaring of a lion, and their going forth like the springing of
          a young lion. Their glory was as the firstling of a bullock; they did
          push the nation before them, and as for the enemies, they said,
          "Destroy them." None could stand before them, for the Lord their God
          had girded them with might.
        </p>
        <p>
          To come down a little nearer to our own times, truly our fathers have
          told us the wondrous things which God did in the days of Wesley and of
          Whitefield. The churches were all asleep. Irreligion was the rule of
          the day. The very streets seemed to run with iniquity, and the gutters
          were filled full with the iniquity of sin. Up rose Whitefield and
          Wesley, men whose hearts the Lord had touched, and they dared to
          preach the gospel of the grace of God. Suddenly, as in a moment, there
          was heard the rush as of wings, and the church said: "Who are these
          that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?" They come!
          they come! numberless as the birds of heaven, with a rushing like
          mighty winds that are not to be withstood. Within a few years, from
          the preaching of there two men, England was permeated with evangelical
          truth. The Word of God was known in every town, and there was scarcely
          a hamlet into which the Methodists had not penetrated. In those days
          of the slow-coach, when Christianity seemed to have bought up the old
          wagons in which our fathers once travelled -- where business runs with
          steam, there oftentimes religion creeps along with its belly on the
          earth, -- we are astonished at these tales, and we think them wonders.
          Yet let us believe them; they come to us as substantial matters of
          history. And the wondrous things which God did in the olden times, by
          his grace he will yet do again. He that is mighty hath done great
          things and holy is his name.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a special feature to which I would call your attention with
          regard to the works of God in the olden time; they derive increasing
          interest and wonder from the fact that they were all sudden things.
          The old stagers in our churches believe that things must grow, gently,
          by degrees; we must go step by step onward. Concentrated action and
          continued labour, they say, will ultimately bring success. But the
          marvel is, all God's works have been sudden. When Peter stood up to
          preach, it did not take six weeks to convert the three thousand. They
          were converted at once and baptized that very day; they were that hour
          turned to God, and become as truly disciples of Christ as they could
          have been if their conversion had taken seventy years. So was it in
          the day of Martin Luther: it did not take Luther centuries to break
          through the thick darkness of Rome. God lit the candle and the candle
          burned, and there was the light in an instant -- God works suddenly.
          If anyone could have stood in Wurtemburg, and have said: "Can Popery
          be made to quail, can the Vatican be made to shake?" The answer would
          have been: -- "No; it will take at least a thousand years to do it.
          Popery, the great serpent, has so twisted itself about the nations,
          and bound them so fast in its coil, that they cannot be delivered
          except by a long process." "Not so," however, did God say. He smote
          the dragon sorely, and the nations went free; he cut the gates of
          brass, and broke in sunder the bars of iron, and the people were
          delivered in an hour. Freedom came not in the course of years, but in
          an instant. The people that walked in darkness saw a great light, and
          upon them that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, did the light
          shine. So was it in Whitefield's day. The rebuking of a slumbering
          church was not the work of ages; it was done at once. Have ye never
          heard of the great revival under Whitefield? Take as an instance that
          at Camslang. He was preaching in the church-yard to a great
          congregation, that could not get into any edifice; and while
          preaching, the power of God came upon the people, and one after
          another fell down as if they were smitten; and at least it was
          estimated that not less than three thousand persons were crying out at
          one time under the conviction of sin. He preached on, now thundering
          like Boanerges, and then comforting like Barnabas, and the work
          spread, and no tongue can tell the great things that God did under
          that one sermon of Whitefield. Not even the sermon of Peter on the day
          of Pentecost was equal to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          So has it been in all revivals; God's work has been done suddenly. As
          with a clap of thunder has God descended from on high; not slowly, but
          on cherubim right royally doth he ride; on the wings of the mighty
          wind does he fly. Sudden has been the work; men could scarce believe
          it true, it was done in so short a space of time. Witness the great
          revival which is going on in and around Belfast. After carefully
          looking at the matter, and after seeing some trusty and well-beloved
          brother who lived in that neighborhood, I am convinced,
          notwithstanding what enemies may say, that it is a genuine work of
          grace, and that God is doing wonders there. A friend who called to see
          me yesterday, tells me that the lowest and vilest men, the most
          depraved females in Belfast, have been visited with this extraordinary
          epilepsy, as the world calls it; but with this strange rushing of the
          spirit, as we have it. Men who have been drunkards have suddenly felt
          an impulse compelling them to pray. They have resisted; they have
          sought to their cups in order to put it out; but when they have been
          swearing, seeking to quench the Spirit by their blasphemy, God has at
          last brought them on their knees, and they have been compelled to cry
          for mercy with piercing shrieks, and to agonize in prayer; and then
          after a time, the Evil one seems to have been cast out of them, and in
          a quiet, holy, happy frame of mind, they have made a profession of
          their faith in Christ, and have walked in his fear and love. Roman
          Catholics have been converted. I thought that an extraordinary thing;
          but they have been converted very frequently indeed in Ballymena and
          in Belfast. In fact, I am told the priests are now selling small
          bottles of holy water for people to take, in order that they may be
          preserved from this desperate contagion of the Holy Spirit. This holy
          water is said to have such efficacy, that those who do not attend any
          of the meetings are not likely to be meddled with by the Holy Spirit
          -- so the priests tell them. But if they go to the meetings, even this
          holy water cannot preserve them -- they are as liable to fall prey to
          the Divine influence. I think they are just as likely to do so without
          as with it. All this has been brought about suddenly, and although we
          may expect to find some portion of natural excitement, yet I am
          persuaded it is in the main a real, spiritual, and abiding work. There
          is a little froth on the surface, but there is a deep running current
          that is not to be resisted, sweeping underneath, and carrying
          everything before it. At least there is something to awaken our
          interest, when we understand that in the small town of Ballymena on
          market day, the publicans have always taken one hundred pounds for
          whiskey, and now they cannot take a sovereign all day long in all the
          public houses. Men who were once drunkards now meet for prayer, and
          people after hearing one sermon will not go until the minister has
          preached another, and sometimes a third; and at last he is obliged to
          say: "You must go, I am exhausted." Then they will break up into
          groups in their streets and in their houses, crying out to God to let
          this mighty work spread, that sinners may be converted unto him.
          "Well," says one, "we cannot believe it." Very likely you cannot, but
          some of us can, for we have heard it with our ears, and our fathers
          have told us the mighty works that God did in their days, and we are
          prepared to believe that God can do the same works now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I must here remark again, in all these old stories there is one very
          plain feature. Whenever God has done a mighty work it has been by some
          very insignificant instrument. When he slew Goliath it was by little
          David, who was but a ruddy youth. Lay not up the sword of Goliath -- I
          always thought that a mistake of David -- lay up, not Goliath's sword,
          but lay up the stone, and treasure up the sling in God's armory for
          ever. When God would slay Sisera, it was a woman that must do it with
          a hammer and a nail. God has done his mightiest works by the meanest
          instruments: that is a fact most true of all God's works -- Peter the
          fisherman at Pentecost, Luther the humble monk at the Reformation,
          Whitefield the potboy of the Old Bell Inn at Gloucester in the time of
          the last century's revival; and so it must be to the end. God works
          not by Pharaoh's horses or chariot, but he works by Moses' rod; he
          doth not his wonders with the whirlwind and the storm; he doth them by
          the still small voice, that the glory may be his and the honour all
          his own. Doth not this open a field of encouragement to you and to me?
          Why may not we be employed in doing some mighty work for God here?
          Moreover, we have noticed in all these stories of God's mighty works
          in the olden time, that wherever he has done any great thing it has
          been by someone who has had very great faith. I do verily believe at
          this moment that, if God willed it, every soul in this hall would be
          converted now. If God chose to put forth the operations of his own
          mighty Spirit, not the most obdurate heart would be able to stand
          against it. "He will have mercy upon whom he will have mercy." He will
          do as he pleases; none can stay his hand. "Well," says one, "but I do
          not expect to see any great things." Then, my dear friend, you will
          not be disappointed, for you will not see them; but those that expect
          them shall see them. Men of great faith do great things. It was
          Elijah's faith that slew the priests of Baal. If he had the little
          heart that some of you have, Baal's priests had still ruled over the
          people, and would never have been smitten with the sword. It was
          Elijah's faith that bade him say: "If the Lord be God, follow him, but
          if Baal, then follow him." And again: "Choose one bullock for
          yourselves, cut it in pieces, lay it on wood and put no fire under,
          call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of
          Jehovah." It was his noble faith that bade him say: "Take the prophets
          of Baal; let not one of them escape"; and he brought them down to the
          brook Kishon, and slew them there -- a holocaust to God. The reason
          why God's name was so magnified, was because Elijah's faith in God was
          so mighty and heroic. When the Pope sent his bull to Luther, Luther
          burned it. Standing up in the midst of the crowd with the blazing
          paper in his hand he said: "See here, this is the Pope's bull." What
          cared he for all the Popes that were ever in or out of hell? And when
          he went to Worms to meet the grand Diet, his followers said: "You are
          in danger, stand back." "No," said Luther, "if there were as many
          devils in Worms as there are tiles on the roofs of the houses, I would
          not fear; I will go" -- and into Worms he went, confident in the Lord
          his God. It was the same with Whitefield; he believed and he expected
          that God would do great things. When he went into his pulpit he
          believed that God would bless the people, and God did do so. Little
          faith may do little things, but great faith shall be greatly honoured.
          O God! our fathers have told us this, that whenever they had great
          faith Thou hast always honoured it by doing mighty works.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will detain you no longer on this point, except to make one
          observation. All the mighty works of God have been attended with great
          prayer, as well as with great faith. Have you ever heard of the
          commencement of the great American revival? A man unknown and obscure,
          laid it up in his heart to pray that God would bless his country.
          After praying and wrestling and making the soul-stirring enquiry:
          "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Lord, what wilt thou have me to
          do?" he hired a room, and put up an announcement that there would be a
          prayer-meeting held there at such-and-such an hour of the day. He went
          at the proper hour, and there was not a single person there; he began
          to pray, and prayed for half an hour alone. One came in at the end of
          the half-hour, and then two more, and I think he closed with six. The
          next week came around, and there might have been fifty dropped in at
          different times; at last the prayer-meeting grew to a hundred, then
          others began to start prayer-meetings; at last there was scarcely a
          street in New York that was without a prayer-meeting. Merchants found
          time to run in, in the middle of the day, to pray. The prayer-meetings
          became daily ones, lasting for about an hour; petitions and requests
          were sent up, these were simply asked and offered before God, and the
          answers came; and many were the happy hearts that stood up and
          testified that the prayer offered last week had been already
          fulfilled. Then it was when they were all earnest in prayer, suddenly
          the Spirit of God fell upon the people, and it was rumored that in a
          certain village a preacher had been preaching in thorough earnest, and
          there had been hundreds converted in a week. The matter spread into
          and through the Northern States -- these revivals of religion became
          universal, and it has been sometimes said that a quarter of a million
          people were converted to God through the short space of two or three
          months. Now the same effect was produced in Ballymena and Belfast by
          the same means. The brother thought that it lay at his heart to pray,
          and he did pray; then he held a regular prayer-meeting; day after day
          they met together to entreat the blessing, and fire descended and the
          work was done. Sinners were converted, not by ones or twos but by
          hundreds and thousands, and the Lord's name was greatly magnified by
          the progress of his gospel. Beloved, I am only telling you facts. Make
          each of you your own estimate of them if you please.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Agreeable to my division,, I have now to make a few observations
          upon THE DISADVANTAGES UNDER WHICH THESE OLD STORIES FREQUENTLY
          LABOUR. When people hear about what God used to do, one of the things
          they say is: "Oh, that was a very long while ago." They imagine that
          times have altered since then. Says one: "I can believe anything about
          the Reformation -- the largest accounts that can possibly be given, I
          can take in." "And so could I concerning Whitefield and Wesley," says
          another, "all that is quite true, they did labour vigorously and
          successfully, but that was many years ago. Things were in a different
          state then from what they are now." Granted; but I want to know what
          the things have to do with it. I thought it was God that did it. Has
          God changed? Is he not an immutable God, the same yesterday, to-day
          and for ever? Does not that furnish an argument to prove that what God
          has done at one time he can do at another? Nay, I think I may push it
          a little further, and say what he has done once, is a prophecy of what
          he intends to do again -- that the mighty works which have been
          accomplished in the olden time shall all be repeated, and the Lord's
          song shall be sung again in Zion, and he shall again be greatly
          glorified. Others among you say, "Oh, well I look upon these things as
          great prodigies -- miracles. We are not to expect them every day."
          That is the very reason why we do not get them. If we had learnt to
          expect them, we should no doubt obtain them, but we put them up on the
          shelf, as being out of the common order of our moderate religion, as
          being mere curiosities of Scripture history. We imagine such things,
          however true, to be prodigies of providence; we cannot imagine them to
          be according to the ordinary working of his mighty power. I beseech
          you, my friends, abjure that idea, put it out of your mind. Whatever
          God has done in the way of converting sinners is to be looked upon as
          a precedent, for "his arm is not shortened that He cannot save, not is
          his ear heavy that He cannot hear." If we are straitened at all, we
          are not straitened in ourselves, and with earnestness seek that God
          would restore to us the faith of the men of old, that we may richly
          enjoy his grace as in the days of old. Yet there is yet another
          disadvantage under which there old stories labour. The fact is, we
          have not seen them. Why, I may talk to you ever so long about
          revivals, but you won't believe them half so much, nor half so truly,
          as if one were to occur in your very midst. If you saw it with your
          own eyes, then you would see the power of it. If you had lived in
          Whitefield's day, or had heard Grimshaw preach, you would believe
          anything. Grimshaw would preach twenty-four times a week: he would
          preach many times in the course of a sultry day, going from place on
          horseback. That man did preach. It seemed as if heaven would come down
          to earth to listen to him. He spoke with a real earnestness, with all
          the fire of zeal that ever burned in mortal breast, and the people
          trembled while they listened to him, and said, "Certainly this is the
          voice of God." It was the same with Whitefield. The people would seem
          to move to and fro while he spoke, even as the harvest field is moved
          with the wind. So mighty was the energy of God that after hearing such
          a sermon the hardest-hearted men would go away and say: "There must be
          something in it, I never heard the like." Can you not realize these as
          literal facts? Do they stand up in all their brightness before your
          eyes? Then I think the stories you have heard with your ears should
          have a true and proper effect upon your lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. This brings me in the third place to the PROPER INFERENCES THAT
          ARE TO BE DRAWN FROM THE OLD STORIES OF GOD'S MIGHTY DEEDS.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would that I could speak with the fire of some of those men whose
          names I have mentioned. Pray for me, that the Spirit of God may rest
          upon me, that I may plead with you for a little time with all my
          might, seeking to exhort and stir you up, that you may get a like
          revival in your midst. My dear friends, the first effect which the
          reading of the history of God's mighty works should have upon us, is
          that of gratitude and praise. Have we nothing to sing about to-day? --
          then let us sing concerning days of yore. If we cannot sing to our
          well-beloved a song concerning what he is doing in our midst, let us,
          nevertheless, take down our harps from the willows, and sing an old
          song, and bless and praise his holy name for the things which he did
          to his ancient church, for the wonders which he wrought in Egypt, and
          in all the lands wherein he led his people, and from which he brought
          them out with a high hand and with an outstretched arm. When we have
          thus begun to praise God for what he has done, I think I may venture
          to impress upon you one other great duty. Let what God has done
          suggest to you the prayer that he would repeat the like signs and
          wonders among us. Oh! men and brethren, what would this heart feel if
          I could but believe that there were some among you who would go home
          and pray for a revival of religion -- men whose faith is large enough,
          and their love fiery enough to lead them from this moment to exercise
          unceasing intercessions that God would appear among us and do wondrous
          things here, as in the times of former generations. Why, look you here
          in this present assembly what objects there are for our compassion.
          Glancing round, I observe one and another whose history I may happen
          to know, but how many are there still unconverted -- men who trembled
          and who know they have, but have shaken off their fears, and once more
          are daring their destiny, determined to be suicides to their own souls
          and to put away from them that grace which once seemed as if it were
          striving in their hearts. They are turning away from the gates of
          heaven, and running post-haste to the doors of hell; and will not you
          stretch out your hands to God to stop them in this desperate resolve?
          If in this congregation there were but one unconverted man and I could
          point him out and say: "There he sits, one soul that has never felt
          the love of God, and never has been moved to repentance," with what
          anxious curiosity would every eye regard him? I think out of thousands
          of Christians here, there is not one who would refuse to go home and
          pray for that solitary unconverted individual. But, oh! my brethren,
          it is not one that is in danger of hell fire; here are hundreds and
          thousands of our fellow-creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shall I give you yet another reason why you should pray? Hitherto all
          other means have been used without effect. God is my witness how often
          I have striven in this pulpit to be the means of the conversion of
          men. I have preached my very heart out. I could say no more than I
          have said, and I hope the secrecy of my chamber is a witness to the
          fact that I do not cease to feel when I cease to speak; but I have a
          heart to pray for those of you who are never affected, or who, if
          affected, still quench the Spirit of God. I have done my utmost. Will
          not you come to the help of the Lord against the mighty? Will not you
          r prayers accomplish that which my preaching fails to do? Here they
          are; I commend them to you. Men and women whose hearts refuse to melt,
          whose stubborn knees will not bend; I give them up to you and ask you
          to pray for them. Carry their cases on your knees before God. Wife!
          never cease to pray for your unconverted husband. Husband! never stop
          your supplication till you see your wife converted. And, O fathers and
          mothers! have you no unconverted children? have you not brought them
          here many and many a Sunday, and they remain just as they have been?
          You have sent them first to one chapel and then to another, and they
          are just what they were. The wrath of God abideth on them. Die they
          must; and should they die now, to a certainty you are aware that the
          flames of hell must engulf them. And do you refuse to pray for them?
          Hard hearts, brutish souls, if knowing Christ yourself ye will not
          pray for those who come of your own loins -- your children according
          to the flesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear friends, we do not know what God may do for us if we do but pray
          for a blessing. Look at the movement we have already seen; we have
          witnessed Exeter Hall, St. Paul's Cathedral, and Westminster Abbey,
          crammed to the doors, but we have seen no effect as yet of all these
          mighty gatherings. Have we not tried to preach without trying to pray?
          It is not likely that the church has been putting forth its preaching
          hand but not its praying hand? O dear friends! let us agonize in
          prayer, and it shall come to pass that this Music Hall shall witness
          the sighs and groans of the penitent and the songs of the converted.
          It shall yet happen that this vast host shall not come and go as now
          it does, but little the better; but men shall go out of this hall,
          praising God and saying: -- "It was good to be there; it was none
          other than the house of God, and the very gate of heaven." Thus much
          to stir you up to prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another inference we should draw is that all the stories we have heard
          should correct any self-dependence which may have crept into our
          treacherous hearts. Perhaps we as a congregation have begun to depend
          upon our numbers and so forth. We may have thought: "Surely God must
          bless us through the ministry." Now let the stories which our fathers
          have told us remind you, and remind me, that God saves not by many nor
          by few; that it is not in us to do this but God must do it all; it may
          be that some hidden preacher, whose name has never been known, will
          yet start up in this city of London and preach the Lord with greater
          power than bishops or ministers have ever know before. I will welcome
          him; God be with him; let him come from where he may; only let God
          speed him, and let the work be done. Mayhap, however, God intends to
          bless the agency used in this place for your good and for your
          conversion. If so, I am thrice happy to think such should be the case.
          But place no dependence upon the instrument. No, when men laughed at
          us and mocked us most, God blessed us most; and now it is not a
          disreputable thing to attend the Music Hall. We are not so much
          despised as we once were, but I question whether we have so great a
          blessing as once we had. We would be willing to endure another pelting
          in the pillory, to go through another ordeal with every newspaper
          against us, and with every man hissing and abusing us, if God so
          pleases, if he will but give us a blessing. Only let him cast out of
          us any idea that our own bow and sword will get us victory. We shall
          never get a revival here unless we believe that it is the Lord, and
          the Lord alone, that can do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having made this statement, I will endeavour to stir you up with
          confidence that the result may be obtained that I have pictured, and
          that the stories we have heard of the olden time, may become true in
          our day. Why should not every one of my hearers be converted? Is there
          any limitation in the Spirit of God? Why should not the feeblest
          minister become the means of salvation to thousands? Is God's arm
          shortened? My brethren, when I bid you pray that God would make the
          ministry quick and powerful, like a two-edged sword, for the salvation
          of sinners, I am not setting you a hard, much less an impossible,
          task. We have but to ask and to get. Before we call, God will answer;
          and while we are yet speaking he will hear. God alone can know what
          may come of this morning's sermon, if he chooses to bless it. From
          this moment you may pray more; from this moment God may bless the
          ministry more. From this hour other pulpits may become more full of
          life and vigour than before. From this same moment the Word of God may
          flow, and run, and rush, and get to itself an amazing and boundless
          victory. Only wrestle in prayer, meet together in your houses, go to
          your closets, be instant, be earnest in season and out of season,
          agonize for souls, and all that you have heard shall be forgotten in
          what you shall see; and all that others have told you shall be as
          nothing compared with what you shall hear with your ears and behold
          with your eyes in your own midst. Oh ye, to whom all this is as an
          idle tale, who love not God,, neither serve him, I beseech you stop
          and think for a moment. Oh, Spirit of God, rest on thy servant while a
          few sentences are uttered, and make them mighty. God has striven with
          some of you. You have had your times of conviction. You are trying
          now, perhaps, to be infidels. You are trying to say now -- "There is
          no hell -- there is no hereafter." It will not do. You know there is a
          hell and all the laughter of those who seek to ruin your souls cannot
          make you believe that there is not. You sometimes try to think so, but
          you know that God is true. I do not argue with you now. Conscience
          tells you that God will punish you for sin. Depend upon it -- you will
          find no happiness in trying to stifle God's Spirit. This is not the
          path to bliss, to quench those thoughts which would lead you to
          Christ. I beseech you, take off your hands from God's arm; resist not
          still His Spirit. Bow the knee and lay hold of Christ and believe on
          him. It will come to this yet. God the Holy Spirit will have you. I do
          trust that in answer to many prayers he intends to save you yet. Give
          way now, but oh, remember if you are successful in quenching the
          Spirit, your success will be the most awful disaster that can ever
          occur to you, for if the Spirit forsake you, you are lost. It may be
          that this is the last warning you will ever have. The conviction you
          are now trying to put down and stifle may be the last you will have,
          and the angel standing with the black seal and the wax may be now
          about to drop it upon your destiny, and say, "Let him alone. He
          chooses drunkenness -- he chooses lust -- let him have them;; and let
          him reap the wages in the everlasting fires of hell." Sinners, believe
          on the Lord Jesus: repent and be converted every one of you. I am bold
          to say what Peter did. Breaking through every bond of every kind that
          could bind my lip, I exhort you in God's name -- Repent and escape
          from damnation. A few more months and years, and ye shall know what
          damnation means, except ye repent. Oh! fly to Christ while yet the
          lamp holds out and burns, and mercy is still preached to you. Grace is
          still presented; accept Christ, resist him no longer; come to him now.
          The gates of mercy are wide open too-day; come now, poor sinner, and
          have thy sins forgiven. When the old Romans used to attack a city, it
          was sometimes their custom to set up at the gate a white flag, and if
          the garrison surrendered while that white flag was there, their lives
          were pared. After that the black flag was put up, and then every man
          was put to the sword. The white flag is up to-day; perhaps to-morrow
          the black flag will be elevated upon the pole of the law; and then
          there is no repentance or salvation either in this world or in that
          which is to come. An old eastern conqueror when he came to a city used
          to light a brazier of coals, and, setting it high upon a pole he
          would, with sound of trumpet proclaim, that if they surrendered while
          the lamp held out and burned he would have mercy upon them, but that
          when the coals were out he would storm the city, pull it stone from
          stone, sow it with salt, and put men, women, and children, to a bloody
          death. To-day the thunders of God bid you to take the like warning.
          There is your light, the lamp, the brazier of hot coals. Year after
          year the fire is dying out, nevertheless there is coal left. Even now
          the wind of death is trying to blow out the last live coal. Oh!
          sinner, turn while the lamp continues to blaze. Turn now, for when the
          last coal is dead thy repentance cannot avail thee. Thy everlasting
          yelling in torment cannot move the heart of God; thy groans and briny
          tears cannot move him to pity thee. To-day if ye will hear his voice,
          harden not your hearts as in the provocation. Oh, to-day lay hold on
          Christ, "Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way,
          when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put
          their trust in him."<br />
