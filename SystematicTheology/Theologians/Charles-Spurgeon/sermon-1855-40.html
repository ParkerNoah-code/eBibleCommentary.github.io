        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.43)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, September 9, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn
          cometh in in his season." -- Job 5:26.
        </p>
        <p>
          WE DO NOT BELIEVE all that Job's friends said. They spoke very often
          as uninspired men, for we find them saying many things that are not
          true; and if we read the book of Job through, we might say with regard
          to them, "miserable comforters are ye all," for they did not speak
          concerning God's servant, Job, the thing that was right. But,
          nevertheless, they gave utterance to many holy and pious sentences,
          which are well worthy of regard, as having come from the lips of three
          men distinguished in their age for their learning, talent, and
          ability; three grey-headed sires, who from experience were able to
          speak what they knew. Their mistakes are not to be wondered at,
          because they had not then that clear, bright, shining light, which we
          enjoy in these modern times. They had few opportunities to meet
          together; there were but few prophets in those days who taught them
          the things of the kingdom. We only marvel that without the light of
          the gospel revelation they were able to discover so much of the truth
          as they did. However I must make a remark concerning this chapter,
          that I cannot but regard it as being in the main, not so much the
          utterance of the man -- who here speaks -- Eliphaz the Temanite -- but
          the very word of God; not so much the simple saying of the unwise
          comforter who upbraided Job, as the speech of the great Comforter who
          consoles his people, and who only utters the thing that is right. The
          opinion is justified by the fact that this chapter is quoted by the
          apostle Paul. Eliphaz says, in the 13th verse, "He taketh the wise in
          their own craftiness." And we find the apostle Paul in the
          Corinthians, saying, "As it is written, he taketh the wise in their
          own craftiness;" thus giving sanction to this passage as having been
          inspired of God, at all events as being most certainly truthful. Most
          certainly the experience of such a man as Eliphaz is worthy of much
          regard: and when speaking of the general condition of God's people,
          that they are hid from the scourge of the tongue, "that they are not
          afraid of destruction when it cometh," that they laugh at destruction
          and famine, and so on, we may accept his words as being proven by
          experience, and authenticated by inspiration. "Thou shalt come to thy
          grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season."
          Here is a very beautiful comparison, the comparison of the aged
          Christian -- for that I take it lies on the surface of the text -- to
          a shock of corn. Go into the harvest field, and you shall see how much
          the wheat reminds you of the aged believer. How much anxiety has been
          expended on that field! When the seed first sprung up the farmer
          dreaded lest the worm should bite the tender shoots, and the blade
          should be devoured, or lest some sharp frost should consume the infant
          plant and cause it to wither and die. And, then, month after month, as
          the seasons came, how did he anxiously look towards heaven and long
          that the rains might come, or that the genial sunshine might pour out
          its vivifying floods of light upon the field. When it has come to
          somewhat of maturity, how greatly has he feared lest the mildew and
          blast should shrivel up the precious ears. It stands in the fields
          now, and in some respects he is freed from his anxiety. The months of
          his travail are over. He has waited patiently for the precious fruits
          of the soil, but now they are there. And so with the grey-headed man.
          How many years of anxiety have been expended upon him! In his youth
          how likely did it seem that he might be smitten down by death, and yet
          he has passed safely through youth, manhood, and age. What varied
          accidents have been warded from him! How has the shield of the
          Providential Keeper been over his head to keep him from the shafts of
          the pestilence, or from the heavy hand of accident that might have
          smitten his life! How many anxieties has he had himself! How many
          troubles has he passed through! Look upon the hoary-headed veteran!
          Mark the scars that troubles have inflicted upon his forehead! And
          see, deep written in his breast, the dark mementos of the sharp
          struggles and trials he has endured! And now his anxieties are
          somewhat over; he is come very nearly to the haven of rest. A few
          short years of trial and trouble shall land him on fair Canaan's
          coast, and we look upon him with the same pleasure that the farmer
          regards the wheat, because the anxiety is over and the time of rest is
          now approaching. Mark how weak the stem has become! how every wind
          shakes it to and fro; it is withered and dried! See how the head hangs
          down to earth, as if it were about to kiss the dust, and show whence
          it had its origin! So, mark you the aged man; tottering are his steps,
          "they that look out of the windows are darkened, the grinders cease
          because they are few, and the grasshopper has become a burden." Yet
          even in that weakness there is glory. It is not the weakness of the
          tender blade, it is the weakness of the full ripe corn, it is a
          weakness that shows its maturity, it is a weakness that gilds it with
          glory. Even as the colour of the wheat is golden, so that it looks
          more beauteous than when the greenness of its verdure is on it, so the
          grey-headed man has a crown of glory on his head. He is glorious in
          his weakness, more than the young man in his strength, or the maiden
          in her beauty. Is not a shock of corn a beautiful picture of the state
          of man, moreover, because very soon it must be taken home? The reaper
          is coming. Even now I hear the sickle sharpening. The reaper hath well
          edged it, and he shall soon cut the corn down. See! he is coming
          across the field to reap his harvest; and then, by-and-bye, it shall
          be carried into the barn and safely housed, no more subject to blight,
          or mildew, or insect, or disease. There it shall be secured, where no
          snow can fall upon it, no winds can molest it. It shall be safe and
          secure; and joyful shall be the time when harvest home shall be
          proclaimed, and the shock of corn, fully ripe, shall be carried into
          the farmer's garner. Such is the aged man. He, too, shall soon be
          taken home. Death is even now sharpening his sickle, and the angels
          are getting ready their chariot of gold to bear him up to the skies.
          The barn is built; the house is provided; soon the great Master shall
          say, "Bind up the tares in bundles to burn, and gather the wheat into
          my barn."
        </p>
        <p>
          This morning, we shall consider the death of Christians in general;
          not of the aged Christian merely, for we shall show you that while
          this text does seem to bear upon the aged Christian, in reality it
          speaks with a loud voice to every man who is a believer. "Thou shalt
          come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in
          his season."
        </p>
        <p>
          There are four things we shall mark in the text. First, we shall
          consider that death is inevitable, because it says, "Thou shalt come."
          Secondly, that death is acceptable, because it does not read, "I will
          make thee go to thy grave," but "thou shalt come there." Thirdly, that
          death is always timely: "Thou shalt come to thy grave in full age."
          Fourthly, that death to the Christian is always honourable, for the
          promise declareth to him, "Thou shalt go to thy grave in full age,
          like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The first remark, namely, that death, even to the Christian, is
          INEVITABLE, is very trite, simple and common, and we need scarcely
          have made it, but we found it necessary, in order to introduce one or
          two remarks upon it. How hacknied is the thought, that all men must
          die, and therefore, what can we say upon it? And yet we blush not to
          repeat it, for while it is a truth so well known, there is none so
          much forgotten; while we all believe it in the theory and receive it
          in the brain, how seldom it is impressed on the heart? The sight of
          death makes us remember it. The tolling of the solemn bell speaks to
          us of it. We hear the deep-tongued voice of time as the bell tolls the
          hours and preaches our mortality. But very usually we forget it. Death
          is inevitable to all. But I wish to make an observation concerning
          death, and that is, that while it is written, "It is appointed unto
          all men once to die," yet a time shall come when some Christian men
          shall not die at all. We know that had Adam never sinned he would not
          have died, for death is the punishment of sin, and we know that Enoch
          and Elijah were translated to heaven without dying. Therefore it does
          seem to follow, that death is not absolutely necessary for a
          Christian. And, moreover, we are told in Scripture, that there are
          some who shall be "alive and remain," when Jesus Christ shall come;
          and the apostle says, "I tell you a mystery -- we shall not all sleep,
          but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
          at the last trump." There shall be some who shall be found living, of
          whom the apostle says, "Then we which are alive and remain shall be
          caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the
          air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord." We know that flesh and
          blood cannot inherit the kingdom; but it is possible that they may be
          refined by some spiritual process, which shall preclude the necessity
          of dissolution. Oh! I have thought of that idea very much, and I have
          wondered whether it should not be possible that some of us might be in
          that happy number who shall not see death. Even if we are not, there
          is something very cheering in the thought: Christ did so conquer death
          that he not only delivers the lawful captive out of the prison, but he
          saves a band from the jaws of the monster, and leads them by his den
          unharmed! He not only resuscitates the dead, and puts new life into
          those that are slain by the fell scythe, but some he actually takes to
          heaven by a bye-road. He says to death -- "Avaunt, thou monster! On
          these thou shalt never put thy hand! These are chosen men and women,
          and thy cold fingers shall never freeze the current of their soul. I
          am taking them straight to heaven without death. I will transport them
          in their bodies up to heaven without passing through thy gloomy
          portals, or having been captives in thy dreary land of shades." How
          glorious is the thought, that Christ has vanquished death; that some
          men shall not die. But you will say to me, "How can that be? for the
          body has mortality mingled with its very essence." We are told it is
          true, by eminent men, that there is a necessity in nature that there
          should be death, since one animal must prey upon another; and even
          could all animals be taught to give up their prey, they must feed upon
          plants, and so devour certain minute insects which had hidden thereon.
          Death therefore seems to be the law of nature. Be it remembered; that
          men have already lived far beyond the present allotted term, and it
          does seem most easy to conceive that the creature, which can subsist a
          thousand years, could exceed that period. But this objection is not
          valid, since the saints will not live for ever in this world, but will
          be removed to a habitation where laws of glory shall supersede laws of
          nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now comes a sweet thought, that death to the Christian is
          always ACCEPTABLE -- "Thou shalt come to thy grave." Old Caryl makes
          this remark on this verse -- "A willingness and a cheerfulness to die.
          Thou shalt come, thou shalt not be dragged or hurried to thy grave, as
          it is said of the foolish rich man, Luke 12. This night shall thy soul
          be taken from thee. But thou shalt come to thy grave, thou shalt die
          quietly and smilingly, as it were; thou shalt go to thy grave, as it
          were upon thine own feet, and rather walk than be carried to thy
          sepulchre." The wicked man, when he dies, is driven to his grave, but
          the Christian comes to his grave. Let me tell you a parable. Behold
          two men sat together in the same house: when Death came to each of
          them. He said to one, "Thou shalt die." The man looked at him -- tears
          suffused his eyes, and tremblingly he said, "O Death, I cannot, I will
          not die." He sought out a physician, and said to him, "I am sick, for
          Death hath looked upon me. His eyes have paled my cheeks, and I fear I
          must depart. Physician, there is my wealth, give me health and let me
          live." The physician took his wealth, but gave him not his health with
          all his skill. The man changed his physician and tried another, and
          thought that perhaps he might spin out the thread of life a little
          longer. But, alas! Death came and said, "I have given thee time to try
          thy varied excuses, come with me; thou shalt die." And he bound him
          hand and foot, and made him go to that dark land of shades. As the man
          went, he clutched at every side post by the way; but Death, with iron
          hands, still pulled him on. There was not a tree that grew along the
          way but he tried to grasp it, but Death said, "Come on! thou art my
          captive, and thou shalt die." And unwillingly as the laggard
          schoolboy, who goeth slowly to school, so did be trace the road with
          Death. He did not come to his grave, but Death fetched him to it --
          the grave came to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Death said to the other man, "I am come for thee." He smilingly
          replied, "Ah, Death! I know thee, I have seen thee many a time. I have
          held communion with thee. Thou art my Master's servant, thou hast come
          to fetch me home. Go, tell my Master I am ready; whene'er he pleases,
          Death, I am ready to go with thee." And together they went along the
          road, and held sweet company. Death said to him, "I have worn these
          skeleton bones to frighten wicked men; but I am not frightful. I will
          let thee see myself. The hand that wrote upon Belshazzar's wall was
          terrible because no man saw anything but the hand; but," said Death.
          "I will show thee my whole body. Men have only seen my bony hand, and
          have been terrified." And as they went along, Death ungirded himself
          to let the Christian see his body and he smiled, for it was the body
          of an angel. He had wings of cherubs, and a body glorious as Gabriel.
          The Christian said to him, "Thou art not what I thought thou wast: I
          will cheerfully go with thee." At last Death touched the believer with
          his hand -- it was even as when the mother doth in sport smite her
          child a moment. The child loves that loving pinch upon the arm, for it
          is a proof of affection. So did Death put his finger on the man's
          pulse, and stopped it for a moment, and the Christian found himself by
          Death's kind finger changed into a spirit; yea, found himself brother
          to the angels; his body had been etherealized, his soul purified, and
          he himself was in heaven. You tell me this is only a parable; but let
          me give you some facts that shall back it up. I will tell you some of
          the death-bed sayings of dying saints, and show you that, to them,
          Death has been an agreeable visitant, of whom they were not afraid.
          You will not disbelieve dying men. It were ill to act the hypocrite's
          part at such a time. When the play is over men will take off the mask:
          and so with these men when they came to die -- they stood out in
          solemn unclothed reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, let me tell you what Dr. Owen said -- that celebrated prince of
          Calvinists. While his works are to be found, I am not afraid that men
          shall lack arguments to defend the Gospel of Free-grace. A friend
          called to tell Dr. Owen that he had put to press his "Meditations on
          the Glory of Christ." There was a momentary gleam in his languid eye
          as he answered, "I am glad to hear it. Oh!" said he, "the long-wished
          for time has come at last, in which I shall see that glory in another
          manner than I have ever done, or was capable of doing in this world."
        </p>
        <p>
          But, you may say, this man was a mere theologian, let us hear a poet
          speak. George Herbert, after some severe struggles, and having
          requested his wife and nieces, who were weeping in extreme anguish, to
          leave the room, he committed his will to Mr. Woodnott's care, crying
          out, "I am ready to die -- Lord, forsake me not now, my strength
          faileth; but grant me mercy for the merits of my Lord Jesus. And now,
          Lord receive my soul." Then he laid himself back and breathed out his
          life to God. Thus the poet dies. That glorious fancy of his, that
          might have pictured gloomy things if it had pleased, was only filled
          with rapturous sight of angels. As he used to say himself, "Methinks I
          hear the church bells of heaven ringing." And methinks he did hear
          them when he came near the river Jordan.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But," you will say, "one was a theologian, and the other a poet -- it
          might have been all fancy." Now learn what an active man, a
          missionary, said -- Brainard.
        </p>
        <p>
          He said, "I am almost in eternity. I long to be there. My work is
          done. I have done with all my friends. All the world is now nothing to
          me. Oh, to be in heaven, to praise and glorify God with his holy
          angels." That is what Brainard said. He who counted all things but
          loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and went
          among wild untutored Indians to preach the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is possible you may say, "These were men of ages gone by." Now,
          you shall have men of modern times.
        </p>
        <p>
          And first, hear what the great and eminent Scotch preacher, Haldane,
          said. He raised himself a little, and distinctly repeated these words,
          " When Christ who is our life shall appear, then we shall appear with
          him in glory." He was then asked if he thought he was going home. He
          answered, "Perhaps not quite yet." Mrs. Haldane affectionately said,
          "Then you will not leave us very soon. He replied with a smile, "To
          depart and to be with Christ is far better." On being asked if he felt
          much peace and happiness, he twice repeated, "Exceeding great and
          precious promises." He then said, "But I must rise." Mrs. Haldane
          said," You are not able to get up." He smiled, and answered, "I shall
          be satisfied when I awake with his likeness." She said, "Is that what
          rising up you meant?" He replied, "Yes, that is the rising I meant. I
          must rise!"
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, what said Howard -- the great philanthropist, the man who
          while possessing true religion, and being the most eminent and
          distinguished of Christians, would from his plain common sense mode of
          acting, never be suspected of being a fanatic and an enthusiast? A few
          days before his death, when the symptoms of his disease began to
          assume a most alarming appearance, he said to Admiral Priestman, "You
          endeavour to divert my mind from dwelling on death; but I entertain
          very different sentiments. Death has no terror for me. I always look
          forward to it with cheerfulness, if not with pleasure."
        </p>
        <p>
          But perhaps you may say, "We never knew any of these people. We should
          like to hear of somebody whom we did know." Well, you shall hear of
          one whom you have heard me affectionately mention. He was not of our
          denomination, but he was a very prince in Israel -- I refer to Joseph
          Irons. Many of you heard the sweet and blessed things that proceeded
          out of his lips, and will perhaps be able to verify what is said of
          him. At intervals he repeated short portions of Scripture, and select
          sentences, such as, "How long, Lord?" "Come, Lord Jesus!" "I long to
          go home, to be at rest." Seeing his dear wife shedding tears, he said,
          "Do not weep for me; I am waiting for that far more exceeding and
          eternal weight of glory." After a pause, to recover his breath, he
          added, "He that has preserved me thus far, will never leave, or
          forsake me. Fear not: all is well. Christ is precious. I am going
          home, for I am a shock of corn fully ripe." Now that is a man you did
          know, many of you. And it proves the fact that I have asserted, that
          to a Christian, death is acceptable come when it may. I am sure I can
          say, with many of my brethren, here, that could I now have the
          greatest favour conferred on me that mortals could desire, I would ask
          that I might die. I never wish to have the choice given to me; but to
          die is the happiest thing man can have, because it is to lose anxiety,
          it is to slay care, it is to have the peculiar sleep of the beloved.
          To the Christian, then, death must be acceptable.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Christian has nothing to lose by death. You say he has to lose his
          friends. I am not so sure of that. Many of you have may more friends
          in heaven than on earth; some Christians have more dearly beloved ones
          above than below. You often count your family circle, but do you do as
          that little girl of whom Wordsworth speaks, when she said, "Master, we
          are seven." Some of them were dead and gone to heaven, but she would
          have it that they were all brothers and sisters still. Oh I how many
          brothers and sisters we have up stairs in the upper room in our
          Father's house; how many dear ones, linked with us in the ties of
          relationship, for they are as much our relations now as they were
          then! Though in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in
          marriage, yet in that great world, who has said that the ties of
          affection shall be severed, so that we shall not even there claim
          kindred with one another, as well as kindred with Jesus Christ? What
          have we to lose by death? Come when he may, should we not open the
          door for him? I would love to feel like that woman who said, when she
          was dying, "I feel like a door on the latch, ready to be opened to let
          my Lord in." Is not that a sweet state, to have the house ready, so
          that it will require no setting in order? When death comes to a wicked
          man, he finds him moored fast, he snaps his cable, and drives his ship
          to sea; but when he comes to the Christian, he finds him winding up
          the anchor, and he says, "When thou hast done thy work, and shipped
          the anchor, I will take thee home." With sweet breath he blows on him,
          and the ship is wafted gently to heaven, with no regrets for life, but
          with angels at the brow, spirits guiding the rudder, sweet songs
          coming through the cordage, and canvass silvered o'er with light.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Then thirdly, the Christian's death is always TIMELY -- "Thou
          shalt come to thy grave in a full age." "Ah!" says one, "that is not
          true. Good people do not live longer than others. The most pious man
          may die in the prime of his youth." But look at my text. It does not
          say, thou shalt come to thy grave in old age -- but in a "full age."
          Well, who knows what a "full age" is? A "full age" is whenever God
          likes to take his children home. There are some fruits you know that
          are late in coming to perfection, and we do not think their flavour is
          good till Christmas, or till they have gone through the frost; while
          some are fit for table now. All fruit: do not get ripe and mellow at
          the same season. So with Christians. They are at a "full age" when God
          chooses to take them home. They are at "full age" if they die at
          twenty one; they are not more if they live to be ninety. Some wines
          can be drunk very soon after the vintage. Others need to be kept. But
          what does this matter, if when the liquor is broached it is found to
          have its full flavour? God never broaches his cask till the wine has
          prefected itself. There are two mercies to a Christian. The first is
          that he will never die too soon; and the second, that he will never
          die too late.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, he will never die too soon. Spencer, who blazed out so
          brilliantly some years ago, preached so wonderfully, that many
          expected that a great light would shine steadily, and that many would
          be guided to heaven; but when suddenly the light was quenched in
          darkness, and he was drowned while yet in his youth, men wept, and
          said, "Ah! Spencer died too soon." So it has been sung of Kirk White,
          the poet, who worked so laboriously at his studies. Like the eagle who
          finds that the arrow that smote him was winged by a feather from his
          own body, so was his own study the means of his death; and the poet
          said he died too soon. It was untrue. He did not die too soon; no
          Christian ever does. But say some, "How useful might they have been
          had they have lived." Ah! but how damaging they might have been! And
          were it not better to die than to do something afterwards that would
          disgrace themselves, and bring disgrace to the Christian character?
          Were it not better for them to sleep while their work was going on,
          than to break it down afterwards? We have seen some sad instances of
          Christian men who have been very useful in God's cause, but have
          afterwards had sad falls, and have dishonoured Christ, though they
          were saved and brought back at last. We could almost wish that they
          had died rather than lived. You don't know what might have been the
          career of those men who were taken away so soon. Are you quite sure
          they would have done so much good? Might they not have done much evil?
          Could we have a dream of the future, and see what they might have
          been, we should say, "Ah Lord! let it stop while it is well." Let him
          sleep while the music playeth, there may be hideous sounds afterwards.
          We long not to keep awake to hear the dreary notes. The Christian dies
          well: he does not die too soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the Christian never dies too late. That old lady there is
          eighty years old. She sits in a miserable room, shivering by a handful
          of fire. She is kept by charity. She is poor and miserable. "What's
          the good of her?" says everybody: "she has lived too long. A few years
          ago she might have been of some use; but now look at her! She can
          scarcely eat unless her food is put into her mouth. She cannot move;
          and what good can she be?" Do not you find fault with your Master's
          work. He is too good a husbandman to leave his wheat in the field too
          long and let it shale out. Go and see her; and you will be reproved.
          Let her speak: she can tell you things you never knew in all your
          life. Or, if she does not speak at all, her silent unmurmuring
          serenity, her constant submission, teaches you how to bear suffering.
          So that there is something you can learn from her yet. Say not the old
          leaf hangeth too long on the tree. An insect may yet twist itself
          therein, and fashion it into its habitation. O say not the old sear
          leaf ought to have been blown off long ago. The time is coming when it
          shall fall gently on the soil; but it remaineth to preach to
          unthinking men the frailty of their lives. Hear what God says to each
          of us: -- "Thou shalt come to thy grave in full age." Cholera! thou
          mayest fly across the land and taint the air: I shall die in a "full
          age." I may preach to-day, and as many days as I please in the week,
          but I shall die at a full age. However ardently I may labour, I shall
          die at a full age. Affliction may come to drain my very life's blood,
          and dry up the very sap and marrow of my being. Ah! but affliction
          thou shalt not come too soon -- I shall die at a full age. And thou
          waiting-man! and thou tarrying woman! thou art saying, "O Lord, how
          long? how long? Let me come home." Thou shalt not be kept from thy
          beloved Jesus one hour more than is necessary; thou shalt have heaven
          as soon as thou art ready for it. Heaven is ready enough for thee, and
          thy Lord will say, "Come up higher!" when thou hast arrived at a full
          age -- but never before nor after.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Now the last thing is, that a Christian will die with HONOUR:
          "Thou shalt come to thy grave like a shock of corn cometh in in his
          season." You hear men speak against funeral honours, and I certainly
          do enter my protest against the awful extravagance with which many
          funerals are conducted, and the absurdly stupid fashions that are
          often introduced. It would be a happy thing if some persons could
          break through them, and if widows were not obliged to spend the money
          which they need so much themselves, upon a needless ceremony, which
          makes death not honourable, but rather despicable. But, methinks that
          while death should not be flaunted out with gaudy plumes, there is
          such a thing as an honourable funeral which every one of us may desire
          to have. We do not wish to be carried away just as a bundle of tares,
          we would prefer that devout men should carry us to the grave and make
          much lamentation over us. Some of us have seen funerals that were very
          like a "harvest home." I can remember the funeral of a sainted
          minister under whom I once sat. The pulpit was hung in black, and
          crowds of people came together; and when an aged veteran in the army
          of Christ rose up to deliver the funeral oration over his remains,
          there stood a weeping people lamenting that a prince had fallen that
          day in Israel. Then, verily, I felt what Mr. Jay must have experienced
          when he preached the funeral sermon for Rowland Hill, "Howl fir tree,
          the cedar is fallen," there was such a melancholy grandeur there. And
          yet my soul seemed lit up with joy, to think it possible that some of
          us might share in the same affection, and that the same tears might be
          wept over us when we come to die. Ah! my brethren here, my brethren in
          office, my brethren in this church, it may somewhat cheer your hearts
          to know that when you depart, your death will be to us a source of the
          deepest grief and most piercing sorrow. Your burial shall not be that
          prophesied for Jehoiakim -- the burial of an ass, with none to weep
          over him; but devout men will assemble and say, "Here lies the deacon
          who for years served his Master so faithfully." "Here lies the
          Sunday-school teacher" will the child say "who early taught me the
          Saviour's name;" and if the minister should fall, methinks a crowd of
          people following him to the tomb would well give him such a funeral as
          a shock of corn hath when "it cometh in in his season." I believe we
          ought to pay great respect to the departed saints' bodies. "The memory
          of the just is blessed." And even ye little saints in the church,
          don't think you will be forgotten when you die. You may have no
          grave-stone; but the angels will know where you are as well without a
          grave-stone as with it. There will be some who will weep over you; you
          will not be hurried away, but will be carried with tears to your
          grave.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, methinks, there are two funerals for every Christian: one, the
          funeral of the body; and the other, the soul. Funeral did I say of the
          soul? No I meant not so; I meant not so; it is a marriage of the soul
          for as soon as it leaves the body the angel reapers stand ready to
          carry it away. They may not bring a fiery chariot as erst they had for
          Elijah; but they have their broad spreading wings. I rejoice to
          believe that angels will come as convoys to the soul across the
          ethereal plains. Lo! angels at the head support the ascending saint
          and lovingly they look upon his face as they bear him upwards; and
          angels at the feet assist in wafting him up yonder through the skies,
          And as the husbandmen come out from their houses and cry, "A joyous
          harvest home," so will the angels come forth from the gates of heaven
          and say, "Harvest home! harvest home! Here is another shock of corn
          fully ripe gathered in to the garner." I think the most honourable and
          glorious thing we shall ever behold, next to Christ's entrance into
          heaven, and his glory there, is the entrance of one of God's people
          into heaven. I can suppose it is made a holiday whenever a saint
          enters, and that is continually, so that they keep perpetual holiday.
          Oh! methinks there is a shout that cometh from heaven whenever a
          Christian enters it, louder than the noise of many waters. The
          thundering acclamations of a universe are drowned, as if they were but
          a whisper, in that great shout which all the ransomed raise, when they
          cry "Another, and yet another comes;" and the song is still swelled by
          increasing voices, as they chant, "Blessed husbandman, blessed
          husbandman, thy wheat is coming home; shocks of corn fully ripe are
          gathering into thy garner." Well, wait a little, beloved. In a few
          years more you and I shall be carried through the ether on the wings
          of angels. Methinks I die, and the angels approach. I am on the wings
          of cherubs. Oh, how they bear me up -- how swiftly and yet how softly.
          I have left mortality with all its pains. Oh, how rapid is my flight!
          Just now I passed the morning star. Far behind me now the planets
          shine. Oh, how swiftly do I fly, and how sweetly! Cherubs! what sweet
          flight is yours, and what kind arms are these I lean upon. And on my
          way ye kiss me with the kisses of love and affection. Ye call me
          brother. Cherubs; am I your brother? I who just now was captive in a
          tenement of clay -- am I your brother? "Yes!" they say. Oh, hark! I
          hear music strangely harmonious! What sweet sounds come to my ears! I
          am nearing Paradise. þTis e'en so. Do not spirits approach with songs
          of joy? "Yes!" they say. And ere they can answer, behold they come --
          a glorious convoy! I catch a sight of them as they are holding a great
          review at the gates of Paradise. And, ah! there is the golden gate. I
          enter in; and I see my blessed Lord. I can tell you no more. All else
          were things unlawful for flesh to utter. My Lord! I am with thee --
          plunged into thee -- lost in thee just as a drop is swallowed in the
          ocean -- as one single tint is lost in the glorious rainbow! Am I lost
          in thee, thou glorious Jesus? And is my bliss consummated? Is the
          wedding-day come at last? Have I really put on the marriage garments?
          And am I thine? Yes! I am. There is nought else now for me. In vain
          your harps, ye angels. In vain all else. Leave me a little while. I
          will know your heaven by-and-bye. Give me some years, yea give me some
          ages to lean here on this sweet bosom of my Lord; give me half
          eternity, and let me bask myself in the sunshine of that one smile.
          Yes; give me this. Didst speak, Jesus? "Yes, I have loved thee with an
          everlasting love, and now thou art mine! thou art with me." Is not
          this heaven? I want nought else. I tell you once again, ye blessed
          spirits, I will see you by-and-bye. But with my Lord I will now take
          my feast of loves. Oh, Jesus! Jesus! Jesus! Thou art heaven! I want
          nought else. I am lost in thee!
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, is not this to go to "the grave in full age, like as a shock
          of corn," fully ripe? The sooner the day shall come, the more we shall
          rejoice. Oh, tardy wheels of time! speed on your flight. Oh, angels,
          wherefore come ye on with laggard wings? Oh! fly through the ether and
          outstrip the lightning's flash! Why may I not die? Why do I tarry
          here? Impatient heart, be quiet a little while. Thou art not fit for
          heaven yet, else thou wouldst not be here. Thou hast not done thy
          work, else thou wouldst have thy rest. Toil on a little longer; there
          is rest enough in the grave. Thou shalt have it there. On! on!
        </p>
        <p>"With my scrip on my back, and my staff in my hand,</p>
        <p>I'll march on in haste thro' an enemy's land.</p>
        <p>Though the way may be rough it cannot be long;</p>
        <p>So I'll smooth it with hope, and I'll cheer it with song.</p>
        <p>
          "My dear friends, you who are not converted, I have no time to say
          anything to you on this morning. I wish I had. But I pray that all I
          have said may be yours. Poor hearts, I am sorry I cannot tell you this
          is yours now. I would I could preach to every one of you, and say that
          you all shall be in heaven. But God knoweth there are some of you that
          are on the road to hell; and do not suppose you will enter heaven, if
          you go hell's road. No body would expect, if he proceeded to the
          north, to arrive at the south. Nay; God must change thine heart. By
          simple trust in Jesus, if thou givest thyself up to his mercy, even
          though the vilest of the vile, thou shalt sing before his face. And
          methinks, poor sinner, thou wilt say to me, as a poor woman did last
          Wednesday, after I had been preaching, when I believe every-body had
          been crying, from the least to the greatest, and even the preacher in
          the pulpit. As I went down, I said to one, "Are you chaff or wheat?"
          And she said, "Ah !I trembled to-night, sir." I said to another,
          "Well, sister, I hope we shall be in Paradise soon." And she replied,
          "You may, sir." And I came to another, and said, "Well, do you think
          you will be gathered with the wheat?" And she answered, "One thing I
          can say -- if God ever lets me get into heaven, I will praise him with
          all my might. I will sing myself away, and shall never think I can
          sing loud enough." It reminded me of what an old disciple once said:
          "If the Lord Jesus does but save me he shall never hear the last of
          it." Let us praise God, then, eternally --
        </p>
        <p>"While life, or thought, or being lasts,</p>
        <p>Or immortality endures!"</p>
        <p>Now may the Three-One God dismiss you with his blessing.</p>
