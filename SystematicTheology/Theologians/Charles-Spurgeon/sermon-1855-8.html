        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.9)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, February 18th, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>
          "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." -- 2 Corinthians
          3:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          LIBERTY is the birthright of every man. He may be born a pauper; he
          may be a foundling; his parentage may be altogether unknown; but
          liberty is his inalienable birthright. Black may be his skin; he may
          live uneducated and untaught; he may be poor as poverty itself; he may
          never have a foot of land to call his own; he may scarce have a
          particle of clothing, save a few rags to cover him; but, poor as he
          is, nature has fashioned him for freedom -- he has a right to be free,
          and if he has not liberty, it is his birthright, and he ought not to
          be content until he wins it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Liberty is the heirloom of all the sons and daughters of Adam. But
          where do you find liberty unaccompanied by religion? True it is that
          all men have a right to liberty, but it is equally true that you do
          not meet it in any country save where you find the Spirit of the Lord.
          "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." Thank God, this
          is a free country. This is a land where I can breathe the air and say
          it is untainted by the groan of a single slave; my lungs receive it,
          and I know there has never been mingled with its vapours the tear of a
          single slave woman shed over her child which has been sold from her.
          This land is the home of liberty. But why is it so? I take it, it is
          not so much because of our institutions as because the Spirit of the
          Lord is here -- the spirit of true and hearty religion. There was a
          time, remember, when England was no more free than any other country,
          when men could not speak their sentiments freely, when kings were
          despots, when Parliaments were but a name. Who won our liberties for
          us? Who have loosed our chains? Under the hand of God, I say, the men
          of religion -- men like the great and glorious Cromwell, who would
          have liberty of conscience, or die -- men who, if they could not reach
          kings' hearts, because they were unsearchable in cunning, would strike
          kings low, rather than they would be slaves. We owe our liberty to men
          of religion, to men of the stern Puritanical school -- men who scorned
          to play the craven and yield their principles at the command of man.
          And if we ever are to maintain our liberty (as God grant we may) it
          shall be kept in England by religious liberty -- by religion. This
          Bible is the Magna Charta of old Britain. its truths, its doctrines
          have snapped our fetters, and they never can be riveted on again,
          whilst men, with God's Spirit in their hearts, go forth to speak its
          truths. In no other land, save where the Bible is unclasped -- in no
          other realm, save where the gospel is preached, can you find liberty.
          Roam through other countries, and you speak with bated breath; you are
          afraid; you feel you are under an iron hand; the sword is above you;
          you are not free. Why? Because you are under the tyranny engendered by
          a false religion: you have not free Protestantism there; and it is not
          till Protestantism comes that there can be freedom. It is where the
          Spirit of the Lord is that there is liberty, and nowhere else. Men
          talk about being free: they describe model governments, Platonic
          republics, or Owenite paradises; but they are dreamy theorists; for
          there can be no freedom in the world, save, "where the spirit of the
          Lord is."
        </p>
        <p>
          I have commenced with this idea, because I think worldly men ought to
          be told that if religion does not save them, yet it has done much for
          them -- that the influence of religion has won them their liberties.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the liberty of the text is no such freedom as this: it is an
          infinitely greater and better one. Great as civil or religious liberty
          may be, the liberty of my text transcendently exceeds. There is a
          liberty, dear friends, which Christian men alone enjoy; for even in
          Great Britain there are men who taste not the sweet air of liberty.
          There are some who are afraid to speak as men, who have to cringe and
          fawn, and bow, and stoop, to any one; who have no will of their own,
          no principles, no voice, no courage, and who cannot stand erect in
          conscious independence. But he is the free man, whom the truth makes
          free. He who has grace in his heart is free; he cares for no one; he
          has the right upon his side; he has God within him -- the indwelling
          Spirit of the Holy Ghost; he is a prince of the blood royal of heaven;
          he is a noble, having the true patent of nobility; he is one of God's
          elect, distinguished, chosen children, and he is not the man to bend,
          or meanly cringe. No! -- sooner would he walk the burning furnace with
          Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego -- sooner would he be cast into the
          lion's den with Daniel, than yield a point of principle. He is a free
          man. "Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty" in its
          fullest, highest, and widest sense. God give you friends, to have that
          "Spirit of the Lord;" for without it, in a free country, ye may still
          be bondsmen; and where there are no serfs in body, ye may be slaves in
          soul. The text speaks of Spiritual liberty; and now I address the
          children of God. Spiritual liberty, brethren, you and I enjoy if we
          have "the Spirit of the Lord" within us. What does this imply? It
          implies that there was a time when we had not that Spiritual liberty
          -- when we were slaves. But a little while ago all of us who now are
          free in Christ Jesus, were slaves of the devil: we were led captives
          at his will. We talked of free-will, but free will is a slave. We
          boasted that we could do what we pleased; but oh! what a slavish and
          dreamy liberty we had. It was a fancied freedom. We were slaves to our
          lusts and passions -- slaves to sin; but now we are freed from sin; we
          are delivered from our tyrant; a stronger than he has cast out the
          strong man armed, and we are free.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now examine a little more closely, in what our liberty
          consists.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. And first, my friends, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
          liberty" from the Bondage of Sin. Ah! I know I shall speak feelingly
          to some of you when I talk about the bondage of sin. You know what
          that misery means. Of all bondage and slavery in this world, there is
          none more horrible than the bondage of sin. Tell me of Israel in Egypt
          preparing their tale of bricks unsupplied with straw; tell me of the
          negro beneath the lash of his cruel task-master, and I confess it is a
          bondage fearful to be borne; but there is one far worse -- the bondage
          of a convinced sinner when he is brought to feel the burden of his
          guilt; the bondage of a man when once his sins are baying him, like
          hounds about a weary stag; the bondage of a man when the burden of sin
          is on his shoulder -- a burden too heavy for his soul to bear -- a
          burden which will sink him for ever in the depths of everlasting
          torment, unless he doth escape from it. Methinks I see such a person.
          He hath ne'er a smile upon his face; dark clouds hath gathered on his
          brow; solemn and serious he stands; his very words are sighs; his
          songs are groans; his smiles are tears; and when he seems most happy,
          hot drops of grief roll in burning showers, scalding furrows on his
          cheek. Ask him what he is, and he tells you he is "a wretch undone."
          Ask him how he is, and he confesses that he is "misery incarnate." Ask
          him what he shall be, and he says, "he shall be lost in flames for
          ever, and there is no hope." Behold him alone in his retirement: when
          he lays his head on his pillow, up he starts again: at night he dreams
          of torment, and by day he almost feels that of which he dreamed. Such
          is the poor convinced sinner under bondage. Such have I been in my
          days, and such have you been, friends. I speak to those who understand
          it. You have passed through that gloomy Slough of Despond; you have
          gone through that dark vale of penitence: you have been made to drink
          the bitter cup of repentance: and I know you will say, "Amen" when I
          declare that of all bondage this is the most painful -- the bondage of
          the law, the bondage of corruption. "O wretched man that I am, who
          shall deliver me" from it? But the Christian is free; he can smile
          now, though he wept before; he can rejoice now, whereas he lamented.
          "There is," he says, "no sin upon my conscience now; there is no crime
          upon my breast; I need not walk through the earth fearful of every
          shadow, and afraid of every man I meet, for sin is washed away; my
          spirit is no more guilty; it is pure, it is holy; there no longer
          resteth the frown of God upon me; but my Father smiles: I see his eyes
          -- they are glancing love: I hear his voice -- it is full of
          sweetness. I am forgiven, I am forgiven, I am forgiven! All hail, thou
          breaker of fetters! glorious Jesus! Ah! that moment when first the
          bondage passed away I Methinks I recollect it now. I saw Jesus on his
          cross before me; I thought on him, and as I mused upon his death and
          sufferings, methought I saw him cast a look on me; and when he gazed
          on me, I looked at him, and
        </p>
        <p>said,</p>
        <p>"Jesus, lover of my soul,</p>
        <p>Let me to thy bosom fly."</p>
        <p>
          He said "come," and I flew to him and clasped him; and when he let me
          go again, I wondered where my burden was. It was gone! There, in the
          sepulchre, it lay, and I felt light as air; like a winged sylph, I
          could fly over mountains of trouble and despair; and oh! what liberty
          and joy I had! I could leap with ecstasy for I had much forgiven, and
          now I was freed from sin." Beloved, this is the first liberty of the
          children of God. "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty"
          from the bondage of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Liberty from the Penalty of Sin. -- What is it? Eternal death --
          torment for ever -- that is the sad penalty of sin. It is no sweet
          thing to fear that if I died now I might be in hell. It is no pleasant
          thought for me to stand here and believe that if I dropped down I must
          sink into the arms of Satan and have him for my tormentor. Why, sirs,
          it is a thought that would plague me; it is a thought that would be
          the bitterest curse of my existence. I would fain be dead and rotting
          in the tomb rather than walk the earth with the thought that I might
          suffer such a penalty as this. There are some of you here who know
          right well that if you die hell is your portion. You don't attempt to
          deny it; you believe the Bible, and there you read your doom, "He that
          believeth not shall be damned." You cannot put yourselves among
          believers. You are still without Christ. Have any of you been brought
          into such a condition that you believe yourself so full of sin that
          God could not be just if he did not punish you? Have you not felt that
          you have so rebelled against God by secret crimes, ay, I say, by
          secret crimes, and by open transgression, that if he did not punish
          you he must cease to be God and lay aside his sceptre? And then you
          have trembled, and groaned, and cried out under the fear of the
          penalty of sin. You thought when you dreamed, that you saw that
          burning lake whose waves are fire, and whose billows are ever blazing
          brimstone; and each day you walked the earth it was with fear and
          dread lest the next step should let you into the pit which is without
          a bottom. But Christian, Christian, you are free from the penalty of
          sin. Do you know it? Can you recognize the fact? You are free at this
          moment from the penalty of sin. Not only are you forgiven, but you
          never can be punished on account of your sins however great and
          enormous they may have been.
        </p>
        <p>"The moment a sinner believes,</p>
        <p>And trusts in his crucified God;</p>
        <p>His pardon at once he receives,</p>
        <p>Salvation in full through his blood,"</p>
        <p>
          and he never can be punished on account of sin. Talk of the punishment
          of a believer! there is not such a thing. The afflictions of this
          mortal life are not punishments for sin to Christians; they are
          fatherly chastisements, and not the punishments of a judge. For me
          there is no hell; let it smoke and burn, if I am a believer I shall
          never have my portion there. For me there are no eternal racks, no
          torments, for if I am justified, I cannot be condemned. Jesus hath
          suffered the punishment in my stead, and God would be unjust if he
          were to punish me again; for Christ has suffered once, and satisfied
          justice for ever. When conscience tells me I am a sinner, I tell
          conscience I stand in Christ's place, and Christ stands in mine. True,
          I am a sinner; but Christ died for sinners. True, I deserve
          punishment; but if my ransom died, will God ask for the debt twice?
          Impossible! He has cancelled it. There never was, and never shall be
          one believer in hell. We are free from punishment, and we never need
          quake on account of it. However horrible it may be -- If it is
          eternal, as we know it is -- it is nothing to us, for we never can
          suffer it. Heaven shall open its pearly portals to admit us; but
          hell's iron gates are barred for ever against every believer. Glorious
          liberty of the children of God!
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But there is one fact more startling than both of these things, and
          I dare say some of you will demur to it; nevertheless it is God's
          truth, and if you don't like it, you must leave it! There is liberty
          from the guilt of sin. This is the wonder of wonders. The Christian is
          positively not guilty any longer the moment he believes. Now, if Her
          Majesty in her goodness spares a murderer by giving him a free pardon,
          that man cannot be punished: but still he will be a guilty man; she
          may give him a thousand pardons, and the law cannot touch him, but
          still he will guilty; the crime will always be on his head, and he
          will be branded as a murderer as long as he lives. But the Christian
          is not only delivered from the bondage and from the punishment, but he
          is positively absolved from the guilt. Now this is something at which
          you will stand amazed. You say, "What? is a Christian no more a sinner
          in God's sight ?" I answer, he is a sinner as considered in himself;
          but in the person of Christ he is no more a sinner than the angel
          Gabriel; for snowy as are angelic wings, and spotless as are cherubic
          robes, an angel cannot be more pure than the poor blood-washed sinner
          when he is made whiter than snow. Do you understand how it is that the
          very guilt of the sinner is taken away? Here I stand to-day a guilty
          and condemned traitor; Christ comes for my salvation, he bids me heave
          my cell, "I will stand where you are; I will be your substitute; I
          will be the sinner; all your guilt is to be imputed to me; I will die
          for it, I will suffer for it; 1 will have your sins." Then stripping
          himself of his robes, he says, "There, put them on; you shall be
          considered as if you were Christ; you shall be the righteous one. I
          will take your place, you take mine." Then he casts around me a
          glorious robe of perfect righteousness; and when I behold it, I
          exclaim, "Strangely, my soul, art thou arrayed, with my elder
          brother's garments on." Jesus Christ's crown is on my head, his
          spotless robes are round my loins, and his golden sandals are the
          shoes of my feet. And now is there any sin? The sin is on Christ; the
          righteousness is on me. Ask for the sinner, Justice! Let the voice of
          Justice cry, "Bring forth the sinner!" The sinner is brought. Who doth
          the executioner lead forth? It is the incarnate Son of God. True, he
          did not commit the sin; he was without fault; but it is imputed to
          him: be stands in the sinner's place. Now Justice cries, "Bring forth
          the righteous, the perfectly righteous." Whom do I see? Lo, the Church
          is brought; each believer is brought. Justice says, "Are these
          perfectly righteous?" "Yes they are. What Christ did is theirs; what
          they did is laid on Christ; his righteousness is theirs; their sins
          are his." I appeal to you, ye ungodly. This seems strange and
          startling, does it not? You have set it down to hyper-calvinism, and
          you laugh at it. Set it down for what you please, sirs. God has set it
          up as his truth; he has made us righteous through the imputed
          righteousness of Jesus Christ. And now, if I am a true believer, I
          stand here freed from every sin. There is not a crime against me in
          the book of God; it is blotted out for ever; it is cancelled; and not
          only can I never be punished, but I have nothing to be punished for.
          Christ has atoned for my sins, and I have received his righteousness.
          "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Furthermore, the Christian man, whilst delivered from the guilt and
          punishment of sin, is likewise delivered from the dominion of it.
          Every living man before he is converted, is a slave to lust. Profane
          men glory in free living and free thinking. They call this free living
          -- a full glass, a Bacchanalian revel, shouting, wantonness,
          chambering. -- Free living, sir! Let the slave hold up his fetters and
          jingle them in my ears, and say, "This is music, and I am free." The
          man is a poor maniac. Let the man chained in his cell, the madman of
          Bethlehem, tell me he is a king, and grin a horrible smile; I say,
          "Ah, poor wretch, I know wherefore he counteth that he is a king; he
          is demented, and is mad." So it is with the worldling who says he is
          free. Free sir! you are a slave. You think you are happy; but at
          night, when you lay yourself upon your bed, how many times have you
          tossed from side to side sleepless and ill at ease; and when you
          awaked have you not said, "Ah! that yesterday -- that yesterday !" And
          though you plunged into another day of sin, that "yesterday," like a
          hell-dog, barked at you, and followed at your heels. You know it, sir,
          -- sin is a bondage and a slavery. And have you ever tried to get rid
          of that slavery? "Yes," you say, "I have." But I will tell you what
          has been the end of it. When you have tried, you have bound your
          fetters firmer than ever; you have riveted your chains. A sinner
          without grace attempting to reform him self is like Sisyphus rolling
          the stone up hill, which always comes down with greater force. A man
          without grace attempting to save himself, is engaged in as hopeless a
          task as the daughters of Danaus, when they attempted to fill a vast
          vessel with bottomless buckets. He has a bow without a string, a sword
          without a blade, a gun without powder. He needs strength. I grant you,
          he may produce a hollow reformation; he may earth up the volcano, and
          sow flowers around its crater; but when it once begins to stir again,
          it shall move the earth away, and the hot lava shall roll over all the
          fair flowers which he had planted, and devastate both his works and
          his righteousness. A sinner without grace is a slave: he cannot
          deliver himself from his sins. But not so the Christian! Is he a slave
          to his sin? Is a true-born heir of God a slave? Oh, no. He does not
          sin, because he is born of God; he does not live in uncleanness,
          because he is an heir of immortality. Ye beggars of the earth may
          stoop to deeds of wrong, but princes of heaven's blood must follow
          acts of right. Ye poor worldlings, mean and pitiful wretches in God's
          sight -- -ye may live in dishonesty and unrighteousness, but the heir
          of heaven cannot; he loves his Lord; he is free from the power of sin;
          his work is righteousness, and his end his everlasting life. We are
          free from the dominion of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Once more: "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" in
          all holy acts of love -- liberty from a slavish fear of law. Many
          people are honest because they are afraid of the policeman. Many are
          sober because they are afraid of the eye of the public. Many persons
          are seemingly religious because of their neighbours. There is much
          virtue which is like the juice of the grape -- it has to be squeezed
          before you get it; it is not like the generous drop of the honeycomb,
          distilling willingly and freely. I am bold to say, that if a man be
          destitute of the grace of God, his works are only works of slavery; he
          feels forced to do them. I know before I came into the liberty of the
          children of God, if I went to God's house, I went because I thought I
          must do it; if I prayed, it was because I feared some misfortune would
          happen in the day if I did not; if I ever thanked God for a mercy, it
          was because I thought I should not get another if I were not thankful;
          if I performed a righteous deed, it was with the hope that very likely
          God would reward me at last, and I should be winning some crown in
          heaven. A poor slave, a mere Gibeonite, hewing wood and drawing water.
          If I could have left off doing it, I should have loved to do so. If I
          could have had my will, there would have been no chapel-going for me,
          no religion for me -- I would have lived in the world and followed the
          ways of Satan, if I could have done as I pleased. As for
          righteousness, it was slavery; sin would have been my liberty. But
          now, Christian, what is your liberty? What makes you come to the house
          of God to day?
        </p>
        <p>"Love made your willing feet</p>
        <p>In swift obedience move."</p>
        <p>
          What makes you bend your knee in prayer? It is because you like to
          talk with your Father who seeth in secret. What is it that opens your
          purses, and makes you give liberally? It is because you love the poor
          children of God, and you feel, so much being given to you, that it is
          a privilege to give something back to Christ. What is it that
          constrains you to live honestly, righteously, and soberly ? Is it the
          rear of the jail? No; you might pull the jail down; you might
          annihilate the convict settlements; you might hurl all chains into the
          sea; and we should be just as holy as we are now. Some people say,
          "Then, sir, you mean to say that Christians may live as they like." I
          wish they could, sir. If I could live as I liked, I would, always live
          holily. If a Christian could live as he liked, he would always live as
          he ought. It is a slavery to him to sin; righteousness is his delight.
          Oh! if I could but live as I list, I would list to live as I ought. If
          I could but live as I would I would live as God commands me. The
          greatest happiness of a Christian is to be holy. It is no slavery to
          him. Put him where you will, he will not sin, Expose him to any
          temptation, if it were not for that evil heart still remaining, you
          would never find him sinning. Holiness is his pleasure; sin is his
          slavery. Ah! ye poor bondsmen who come to church and chapel because ye
          must; ah! ye poor slavish moralists that are honest because of the
          gyves, and sober because of the prison; ah! ye poor slaves! We are not
          so; we are not under the law, but under grace. Call us Antinomians if
          you will; we will even glory in the scandalous title; we are freed
          from the law, but we are freed from it that we may obey it more than
          ever we did. The true-born child of God serves his Master more than
          ever he did. As old Erskine says: --
        </p>
        <p>"Slight now his loving presence if they can;</p>
        <p>No, no; his conquering kindness leads the van.</p>
        <p>When everlasting love exerts the sway,</p>
        <p>They judge themselves most kindly bound to obey;</p>
        <p>Bound by redeeming love in stricter sense,</p>
        <p>Than ever Adam was in innocence."</p>
        <p>
          6. But to conclude. "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
          liberty" from the Fear of Death. O death! how many a sweet cup hast
          thou made bitter. O death! how many a revel hast thou broken up. O
          death! how many a gluttonous banquet hast thou spoiled. O death! how
          many a sinful pleasure hast thou turned into pain. Take ye, my
          friends, the telescope this morning, and look through the vista of a
          few years, and what see you ? Grim death in the distance grasping his
          scythe. He is coming, coming, coming; and what is behind him? Ay, that
          depends upon your own character. If ye are the sons of God, there is
          the palm-branch; if ye are not, ye know what followeth death -- Hell
          follows him. O death! thy spectre hath haunted many a house where sin
          otherwise would have rioted. O death! thy chilly hand hath touched
          many a heart that was big with lust, and made it start affrighted from
          its crime. Oh! how many men are slaves to the fear of death. Half the
          people in the world are afraid to die. There are some madmen who can
          march up to the cannon's mouth; there are some fools who rush with
          bloody hands before their Maker's tribunal; but most men fear to die.
          Who is the man that does not fear to die? I will tell you. The man
          that is a believer. Fear to die! Thank God, I do not. The cholera may
          come again next summer -- I pray God it may not; but if it does, it
          matters not to me: I will toil and visit the sick by night and by day,
          until I drop; and if it takes me, sudden death is sudden glory. And so
          with the weakest saint in this hall; the prospect of dissolution does
          not make you tremble. Sometimes you fear, but oftener you rejoice. You
          sit down calmly and think of dying. What is death ? It is a low porch
          through which you stoop to enter heaven. What is life ? It is a narrow
          screen that separates us from glory, and death kindly removes it! I
          recollect a saying of a good old woman, who said, "Afraid to die, sir!
          I have dipped my foot in Jordan every morning before break fast for
          the last fifty years, and do you think I am afraid to die now ?" Die!
          beloved: why we die hundred of times; we "die daily ;" we die every
          morning; we die each night when we sleep; by faith we die; and so
          dying will be old work when we come to it. We shall say, "Ah, death!
          you and I have been old acquaintances; I have had thee in my bedroom
          every night; I have talked with thee each day; I have had the skull
          upon my dressing table; and I have ofttimes thought of thee. Death!
          thou art come at last, but thou art a welcome guest; thou art an angel
          of light, and the best friend I have had." Why, then, dread death;
          since there is no fear of God's leaving you when you come to die! Here
          I must tell you that anecdote of the good Welch lady, who, when she
          lay a-dying, was visited by her minister. He said to her, "Sister, are
          you sinking?" She answered him not a word, but looked at him with an
          incredulous eye. He repeated the question, "Sister, are you sinking ?"
          She looked at him again, as if she could not believe that he would ask
          such a question. At last, rising a little in the bed, she said,
          "Sinking! Sinking! Did you ever know a sinner sink through a rock? If
          I had been standing on the sand, I might sink; but, thank God I am on
          the Rock of Ages, and there is no sinking there." How glorious to die!
          Oh, angels, come! Oh, cohorts of the Lord of hosts, stretch, stretch
          your broad wings and lift us up from earth; O, winged seraphs, bear us
          far above the reach of these
        </p>
        <p>inferior things; but till ye come, I'll sing,</p>
        <p>"Since Jesus is mine, I'll not fear undressing --</p>
        <p>But gladly put off these garments of clay,</p>
        <p>To die in the Lord is a covenant blessing;</p>
        <p>Since Jesus to glory, though death lead the way."</p>
        <p>
          And now, dear friends, I have shown you as briefly as I can the
          negative side of this liberty. I have tried to tell you, as well as I
          could put it in a few words, what we are freed from. But there are two
          sides to such questions as this. There are some glorious things that
          we are free to. Not only are we freed from sin in every sense from the
          law, and from the fear of death; but we are free to do something. I
          shall not occupy many moments, but shall just run over a few things we
          are free to; for, my brother Christians, "Where the Spirit of the Lord
          is, there is liberty;" and that liberty gives us certain rights and
          privileges.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, we are free to heaven's charter. There is heaven's
          charter -- the Magna Charta -- the Bible; and, my brother, you are
          free to it. There is a choice passage here: "When thou passest through
          the river I will be with thee, and the floods shall not overflow thee
          ;" thou art free to that. Here is another: "Mountains may depart, and
          hills may be removed; but my lovingkindness shall not depart:" you are
          free to that. Here is another: "Having loved his own, he loved them
          unto the end." you are free to that. "Where the Spirit of the Lord is,
          there is liberty." Here is a chapter touching election: you are free
          to that if you are elect. Here is another, speaking of the
          non-condemnation of the righteous, and their justification; you are
          free to that. You are free to all that is in the Bible. Here is a
          never-failing treasure filled with boundless stores of grace. It is
          the bank of heaven: you may draw from it as much as you please without
          let or hindrance. Bring nothing with you, except faith. Bring as much
          faith as you can get, and you are welcome to all that is in the Bible.
          There is not a promise, not a word in it, that is not yours. In the
          depths of tribulation let it comfort you. Mid waves of distress let it
          cheer you. When sorrows surround thee, let it be thy helper. This is
          thy father's love-token: let it never be shut up and covered with
          dust. Thou art free to it -- use, then, thy freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, recollect that thou art free to the throne of grace. It is the
          privilege of Englishmen, that they can always send a petition to
          Parliament; and it is the privilege of a believer, that he can always
          send a petition to the throne of God. I am free to God's throne. If I
          want to talk to God to-morrow morning, I can. If to-night I wish to
          have conversation with my Master, I can go to him. I have a right to
          go to his throne. It matters not how much I may have sinned. I go and
          ask for pardon. It signifies nothing how poor I am -- I go and plead
          his promise that he will provide all things needful. I have a right to
          go to his throne at all times -- in midnight's darkest hour, or in
          noontide's heat. Where'er I am; if fate command me to the utmost verge
          of the wide earth, I have still constant admission to his throne. Use
          that right, beloved -- use that right. There is not one of you that
          lives up to his privilege. Many a gentleman will live beyond his
          income, spending more than he has coming in; but there is not a
          Christian that does that -- I mean that lives up to his spiritual
          income. Oh, no! you have an infinite income -- an in come of promises
          -- an income of grace; and no Christian ever lived up to his income.
          Some people say, "If I had more money I should have a larger house,
          and horses, and carriage, and so on." Very well and good; but I wish
          the Christian would do the same. I wish they would set up a larger
          house, and do greater things for God; look more happy, and take those
          tears away from their eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"Religion never was designed</p>
        <p>To make our pleasures less."</p>
        <p>
          With such stores in the bank, and so much in hand, that God gives you,
          you have no right to be poor. Up! rejoice! rejoice! The Christian
          ought to live up to his income, and not below it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, if you have the "Spirit of the Lord," dear friends, you have a
          right to enter into the city. There are many of the freemen of the
          City of London here, I dare say, and that is a great privilege, very
          likely. I am not a freeman of London, but I am a freeman of a better
          city.
        </p>
        <p>"Saviour, if of Zion's city,</p>
        <p>I, by grace, a member am,</p>
        <p>Let the world revile or pity,</p>
        <p>I will glory in thy name."</p>
        <p>
          You have a right to the freedom of Zion's city, and you do not
          exercise it. I want to have a word with some of you. You are very good
          Christian people. but you have never joined the church yet. You know
          it is quite right, that he that believeth should be baptized; but I
          suppose you are afraid of being drowned, for you never come. Then the
          Lord's table is spread once every month, and it is free to all God's
          children, but you never approach it. Why is that? It is your banquet.
          I do not think if I were an alderman I should omit the city banquet;
          and being a Christian, I cannot omit the Christian banquet, it is the
          banquet of the saints.
        </p>
        <p>"Ne'er did angels taste above</p>
        <p>Redeeming grace and dying love."</p>
        <p>
          Some of you never come to the Lord's table; you neglect his
          ordinances. He says, "This do in remembrance of me." You have obtained
          the freedom of the city, but you won't take it up. You have a right to
          enter in through the gates into the city, but you stand outside. Come
          in brother; I will give you my hand. Don't remain outside the church
          any longer, for you have a right to come in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, to conclude, you have the freedom of Jerusalem, the mother of us
          all. That is the best gift. We are free to heaven. When a Christian
          dies, he knows the open sesame that can open the gates of heaven, he
          knows the pass-word that can make the gates wide open fly; he has the
          white stone whereby he shall be known as a ransomed one, and that
          shall pass him at the barrier; he has the passport that shall let him
          into the dominions of Jehovah; he has liberty to enter into heaven.
          Methinks I see you, ye unconverted, in the land of shades, wandering
          up and down to find your portion. Ye come to the porch of heaven. It
          is great and lofty. The gate hath written o'er it, "The righteous only
          are admitted here." As ye stand, ye look for the porter. A tall
          archangel appeareth from above the gate, and ye say, "Angel, let me
          in." "Where is thy robe?" Thou searchest, and thou hast none; thou
          hast only some few rags of thine own spinning, but no wedding garment.
          "Let me in," sayest thou, "for the fiends are after me to drag me to
          yonder pit. Oh, let me in." But with a quiet glance the angel lifteth
          up his finger and saith, "Read up there;" and thou readest, "None but
          the righteous enter here." Then thou tremblest; thy knees knock
          together; thy hands shake. Were thy bones of brass they might melt;
          and were thy ribs of iron they might be dissolved Ah! there thou
          standest, shivering, quaking, trembling; but not long, for a voice
          which frights thee from thy feet and lays thee prostrate, cries,
          "Depart ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his
          angels." O dear hearers, shall that be your portion? My friends, as I
          love you, -- I do this morning, and hope I ever shall, -- shall this
          be your lot? Will you not have freedom to enter into the city? Will
          you not seek that Spirit which giveth liberty? Ah! I know ye will not
          have it if left to yourselves; some of you perhaps never will. O God,
          grant that that number may be but few, but may the number of the saved
          be great indeed!
        </p>
        <p>"Turn, then my soul unto thy rest,</p>
        <p>The ransom of thy great High Priest,</p>
        <p>Hath set the captive free.</p>
        <p>Trust to his efficacious blood,</p>
        <p>Nor fear thy banishment from God,</p>
        <p>Since Jesus died for thee."<br /></p>
