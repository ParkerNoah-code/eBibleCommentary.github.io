          1. Praise ye Jehovah; invoke his name: announce his works among the
          peoples.2. Sing ye to him: sing psalms to him: speak ye of all his
          wonders.3. Rejoice ye in his holy name: let the heart of those who
          seek Jehovah rejoice.4. Seek ye Jehovah, and his strength: seek his
          face continually.5. Remember the marvelous works which he hath
          performed; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth.

          1 Praise ye Jehovah, etc. The object of these opening words simply is,
          that the offspring of Abraham should place all their blessedness in
          the free adoption of God. It was indeed a blessing not to be despised
          that they had been created men, that they had been cherished in the
          world by God's fatherly care, and that they had received sustenance at
          his hand; but it was a far more distinguished privilege to have been
          chosen to be his peculiar people. While the whole human race are
          condemned in Adam, the condition of the Israelites was so different
          from all other nations, as to give them ground to boast, that they
          were consecrated to God. This is the reason why the prophet heaps
          together so many words in commendation of this grace. He does not
          treat of the government of the whole world as he did in the preceding
          psalm, but he celebrates the fatherly favor which God had manifested
          towards the children of Israel. He indeed names in general his works,
          and his wonders, but he limits both to that spiritual covenant by
          which God made choice of a church, that might lead on earth a heavenly
          life. He does not intend to include as among these wonders, that the
          sun, moon, and stars, daily rise to give light to the world, that the
          earth produces its fruit in its seasons, that every living creature is
          supplied with abundance of all good things for its food, and that the
          human family are liberally provided with so many conveniences; but he
          celebrates the sovereign grace of God, by which he chose for himself
          from amongst the lost race of Adam a small portion to whom he might
          show himself to be a father. Accordingly, he enjoins them to rejoice
          in the name of God, and to call upon him; a privilege by which the
          Church alone is distinguished. Whence it follows, that this language
          is addressed to none but true believers, whom God would have to glory
          in his name, since he has taken them under his special protection.

          4 Seek ye Jehovah, and his strength Although he had in the preceding
          verse characterized the faithful by the honorable designation, those
          who seek God, yet he again exhorts them to earnestness in seeking him,
          which is not an unnecessary exhortation. Seeking God, it is true, is
          the mark by which all genuine saints are particularly distinguished
          from the men of the world; but they come far short of seeking him with
          due ardor; and, accordingly, they have always need of incitements, to
          urge them on to this exercise, although they run of their own accord.
          Those whom the prophet here stirs up to seek God are not fickle
          persons, nor such as are altogether indolent, and who cleave to the
          impurities of earth, but those who with a prompt and ready mind
          already aim at doing this; and he thus stimulates them, because he
          perceives that they are obstructed by many impediments from advancing
          in their course with sufficient rapidity. However willing then we may
          be, we have notwithstanding, need of such incitement to correct our
          slowness. The strength and face of God, doubtless refer to that kind
          of manifestation by which God, accommodating himself to the rudeness
          of the times, drew at that time true believers to himself. The ark of
          the covenant is in many other places called both the strength and the
          face of God, because by that symbol the people were reminded, that he
          was near them, and also really experienced his power. The more
          familiarly then God showed himself to them, with the more promptitude
          and alacrity would the prophet have them to apply their hearts in
          seeking him; and the aid by which God relieves our weakness should
          prove an additional stimulus to our zeal. Modesty also is recommended
          to us, that, mindful of our slowness in seeking God, we may keep the
          way which he has prescribed to us, and may not despise the rudiments
          through which he by little and little conducts us to himself. It is
          added continually, that no person may grow weary in this exercise, or,
          inflated with a foolish opinion of having reached perfection, may
          neglect the external aids of piety, as is done by many, who, after
          having advanced a few degrees in the knowledge of God, exempt
          themselves from the common rank of others, as if they were elevated
          above the angels. Again, the injunction is given to remember the
          marvelous works which God had performed, in the deliverance of his
          people from Egypt, when he displayed his power in new and unusual
          ways. By the judgments of his mouth, some understand the law. But as I
          read all the three expressions, his marvelous works, his wonders, and
          the judgments of his mouth, as referring to one series of events, I
          prefer explaining it rather of the miracles by which God subdued the
          pride of Pharaoh. Still, however, there is some doubt as to the reason
          of this manner of speaking. Some are of opinion, that these miracles
          are called the judgments of God's mouth, because he had foretold them
          by Moses, which is highly probable. At the same time, the expression
          might be taken more simply, as denoting that the power of God was
          manifested in an extraordinary manner in these miracles; from which it
          would be easy to gather, that they were performed by him. I do not
          mean to exclude the ministry of Moses, whom God had raised up to be a
          prophet to the Egyptians, that in denouncing what was to come to pass,
          he might show that nothing happened by chance. Yet I think there is an
          allusion to the manifest character of the miracles, as if it had been
          said, Although God had not uttered a word, the facts themselves
          evidently showed, that he was the deliverer of his people.<br />
