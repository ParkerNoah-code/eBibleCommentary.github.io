        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.249)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, April 24th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>

          "And it shall come to pas in the last days that the mountain of the
          Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and
          shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow unto it."
          -- Isaiah 2:2., &amp; Micah 4:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE PROPHETS OF GOD wore anciently called seers, for they had a
          supernatural sight which could pierce through the gloom of the future
          and behold the things which are not seen as yet, but which God hath
          ordained for the last times. They frequently described what they saw
          with spiritual eyes after the form or fashion of something which could
          be seen by the eye of nature. The vision was so substantial that they
          could picture it in words, so that we also may behold in open vision,
          the glorious things which they beheld after a supernatural sort. Let
          us imagine Isaiah as he stood upon Mount Zion. He looked about him and
          there were "the mountains that are round about Jerusalem" far outvying
          it in height, but yielding to Zion in glory. Dearer to his soul than
          even the snow-capped glories of Lebanon which glittered afar off was
          that little hill of Zion, for there upon its summit stood the temple,
          the shrine of the living God. the place of his delight, the home of
          song, the house of sacrifice, the great gathering-place whither the
          tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord. to serve Jehovah, the God of
          Abraham. Standing at the gate of that glorious temple which had been
          piled by the matchless art of Solomon, he looked into the future and
          he saw, with tearful eye, the structure burned with fire; he beheld it
          cast down and the plough driven over its foundations. He saw the
          people carried away into Babylon, and the nation cast off for a
          season. Looking once more through the glass he beheld the temple
          rising from its ashes, with glory outwardly diminished, but really
          increased. He saw on till he beheld Messiah himself in the form of a
          little babe carried into the second temple; he saw him there, and he
          rejoiced; but ere he had time for gladness his eye glanced onward to
          the cross; he saw Messias nailed to the tree; he beheld his back
          ploughed and mangled with the whip. "Surely he hath borne our griefs
          and carried our sorrows," arid the prophet, and he paused awhile to
          bemoan the bleeding Prince of the House of David. His eye was now
          doomed to a long and bitter weeping, for he saw the invading hosts of
          the Romans setting up the standard of desolation in the city. He saw
          the holy city burned with fire and utterly destroyed. His spirit was
          almost melted in him. But once more he flew through time with eagle
          wing, and scanned futurity with eagle eye; he soared aloft in
          imagination, and began to sing of the last days -- the end of
          dispensations and of time. He saw Messias ones again on earth. He saw
          that little hill of Zion rising to the clouds -- reaching to heaven
          itself. He beheld the New Jerusalem descending from above, God
          dwelling among men, and all the nations flowing to the tabernacle of
          the Most High God, where they paid him holy worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall not, to-day, look through all the dim vista of Zion's
          tribulations. We will leave the avenue of troubles and of trials
          through which the church has passed and is to pass, and we will come,
          by faith, to the last days; and may God help us while we indulge in a
          glorious vision of that which is to be ere long, when "the mountain of
          the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and
          shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it."
          The prophet saw two things in the vision. He saw the mountain exalted,
          and he beheld the nations flowing to it. Now will you use your
          imagination for a moment; for there is a picture here which I can
          scarcely compare to anything, except one of Martin's magnificent
          paintings, in which he throws together such masses of light and shade
          that the imagination is left at liberty to stretch her wings and fly
          to the utmost height. In the present instance, you will not be able to
          outstrip the reality, however high you may endeavor to soar; for that
          which is in our text will certainly be greater than that which the
          preacher can utter, or that which you may be able to conceive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transport yourselves for a moment to the foot of Mount Zion. As you
          stand there, you observe that it is but a very little hill. Bashan is
          far loftier, and Carmel and Sharon outvie it. As for Lebanon, Zion is
          but a little hillock compared with it. If you think for a moment of
          the Alps, or of the loftier Andes, or of the yet mightier Himalayas,
          this mount Zion seems to be a very little hill, a mere mole-hill
          insignificant, despicable, and obscure. Stand there for a moment,
          until the Spirit of God touches your eye, and you shall see this hill
          begin to grow. Up it mounts, with the temple on its summit, till it
          outreaches Tabor. Onward it grows, till Carmel, with its perpetual
          green, is left behind, and Salmon, with its everlasting snow sinks
          before it. Onward still it grows, till the snowy peaks of Lebanon are
          eclipsed. Still onward mounts the hill, drawing with its mighty roots
          other mountains and hills into its fabric; and onward it rises, till
          piercing the clouds it reaches above the Alps; and onwards still, till
          the Himalayas seem to be sucked into its bowels, and the greatest
          mountains of the earth appear to be but as the roots that strike out
          from the side of the eternal hill; and there it rises till you can
          scarcely see the top, as infinitely above all the higher mountains of
          the world as they are above the valleys. Have you caught the idea, and
          do you see there afar off upon the lofty top, not everlasting snows,
          but a pure crystal table-land, crowned with a gorgeous city, the
          metropolis of God, the royal palace of Jesus the King. The sun is
          eclipsed by the light which shines from the top of this mountain; the
          moon ceases from her brightness, for there is now no night: but this
          one hill, lifted up on high, illuminates the atmosphere, and the
          nations of them that are saved are walking in the light thereof. The
          hill of Zion hath now outsoared all others, and all the mountains and
          hills of the earth are become as nothing before her. This is the
          magnificent picture of the text. I do not know that in all the compass
          of poetry there is an idea so massive and stupendous as this -- a
          mountain heaving, expanding, swelling, growing, till all the high
          hills become absorbed, and that which was but a little rising ground
          before, becomes a hill the top whereof reacheth to the seventh
          heavens. Now we have here a picture of what the church is to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of old, the church was like Mount Zion, a very little hill. What saw
          the nations of the earth when they looked upon it? -- a humble man
          with twelve disciples. But that little hill grew, and some thousands
          were baptized in the name of Christ; it grew again and became mighty.
          The stone cut out of the mountain without hands began to break in
          pieces kingdoms, and now at this day the hill of Zion stands a lofty
          hill. But still, compared with the colossal systems of idolatry, she
          is but small. The Hindoo and the Chinese turn to our religion, and
          say, "It is an infant of yesterday; ours is the religion of ages." The
          Easterns compare Christianity to some miasma that creeps along the
          fenny lowlands, but their systems they imagine to be like the Alps,
          outsoaring the heavens in height. Ah, but we reply to this, "Your
          mountain crumbles and your hill dissolves, but our hill of Zion has
          been growing, and strange to say, it has life within its bowels, and
          grow on it shall, grow on it must, till all the systems of idolatry
          shall become less than nothing before it, till false gods being cast
          down, mighty systems of idolatry being overthrown, this mountain shall
          rise above them all, and on, and on, and on, shall this Christian
          religion grow, until converting into its mass all the deluded
          followers of the heresies and idolatries of man, the hill shall reach
          to heaven, and God in Christ shall be all in all." Such is the destiny
          of our church, she is to be an all-conquering church, rising above
          every competitor.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may more fully explain this in two or three ways. The church will
          be like a high mountain, for she will be pre-eminently conspicuous. I
          believe that at this period the thoughts of men are more engaged upon
          the religion of Christ than upon any other. It is true, and there be
          few that will deny it, that every other system is growing old: gray
          hairs are scattered here and there, although the followers of these
          religions know it. As for Mahomet, has he not become now effete with
          grey old age? And the sabre once so sharp to slay the unbeliever hath
          it not been blunted with time and rested into its scabbard? As for the
          old idolatries, the religion of Confucius, or of Budha, where are
          their missionaries, where the old activity that made minor idolatries
          bow before them? They are now content to be confined within their own
          limit, they feel that their hour is come that they can grow no
          further, for their strong man is declining into old age. But the
          Christian religion has become more conspicuous now than ever it was.
          In every part of the world all people are thinking of it; the very
          gates of Japan -- once fast closed -- are now open to it, and soon
          shall the trumpet voice of the gospel be heard there, and the name of
          Jesus the Son of the Highest shall there be proclaimed by the lips of
          his chosen servants. The hill is already growing, and mark you, it is
          to grow higher yet; it is to be so conspicuous, that in every hamlet
          of the world the name of Christ shall be known and feared. There shall
          not be a Bedouin in his tent, there shall not be a Hottentot in his
          kraal, there shall not be a Laplander in the midst of his eternal
          snow, or an African in that great continent of thirst, that shall not
          have heard of Christ. Rising higher, and higher, and higher, from
          north to south, from east to west, this mountain shall be beheld; not
          like the star of the north which cannot be seen in the south, nor like
          the "cross" of the south which must give way before the "bear" of the
          north -- this mountain, strange to say it, contrary to nature shall be
          visible from every land. Far-off islands of the sea shall behold it,
          and they that are near shall worship at the foot thereof. It shall be
          pre-eminently conspicuous in clear, cloudless radiance gladdening the
          people of the earth. This I think is one meaning of the text, when the
          prophet declares "that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be
          established in the top of the mountains. and shall be exalted above
          the hills."
        </p>
        <p>
          This, however, is but a small part of the meaning. He means that the
          church of Christ shall become awful and venerable in her grandeur. It
          has never been my privilege to be able to leave this country for any
          time, to stand at the foot of the loftier mountain" of Europe, but
          even the little hills of Scotland, where half way up the mist is
          slumbering, struck me with some degree of awe. These are some of God's
          old works, high and lofty, talking to the stars, lifting up their
          heads above the clouds as though they were ambassadors from earth
          ordained to speak to God in silence far aloft. But poets tell us --
          and travelers who have but little poetry say the same -- that standing
          at the foot of some of the stupendous mountains of Europe, and of
          Asia, the soul is subdued with the grandeur of the scene. There, upon
          the father of mountains, lie the eternal snows glittering in the
          sun-light, and the spirit wonders to see such mighty things as these?
          such massive ramparts garrisoned with storms. We seem to be but as
          insects crawling at their base, while they appear to stand like
          cherubims before the throne of God, sometimes covering their face with
          clouds of mist, or at other times lifting up their while heads, and
          singing their silent and eternal hymn before the throne of the Most
          High. There is something awfully grand in a mountain, but how much
          more so in such a mountain as is described in our text, which is to be
          exalted above all hills, and above all the highest mountains of the
          earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The church is to be awful in her grandeur. Ah! now she is despised;
          the infidel barketh at her, it is all he can do; the followers of old
          superstitions as yet pay her but little veneration. The religion of
          Christ, albeit that it has to us all the veneration of eternity about
          it -- "For his goings forth were of old, even from everlasting" -- yet
          to men who know him not Christianity seems to be but a young upstart,
          audaciously contending with hoary-headed systems of religion. Ay, but
          the day shall come when men shall bow before the name of Christ, when
          the cross shall command universal homage, when the name of Jesus shall
          stay the wandering Arab and make him prostrate his knee at the hour of
          prayer, when the voice of the minister of Christ shall be as mighty as
          that of a king, when the bishops of Christ's church shall be as
          princes in our midst, and when the sons and daughters of Zion shall be
          every man of them a prince, and every daughter a queen. The hour
          cometh, yea, and now draweth nigh, when the mountain of the Lord's
          house in her awful grandeur shall be established on the top of the
          mountains.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is yet, however, a deeper and larger meaning. It is just this --
          that the day is coming when the church of God shall have absolute
          supremacy. The church of Christ now has to fight for her existence.
          She hath many foes, and mighty ones too, who would snatch the chaplet
          from her brow, blunt her sword, and stain her banners in the dust; but
          the day shall come when all her enemies shall die; there shall not be
          a dog to move his tongue against her. she shall be so mighty that
          there shall be nought left to compete with her. As for Rome, you shall
          seek but find it not. It shall be hurled like a millstone in the
          flood. As for Mahomed's lustful superstition, they shall ask for it,
          but the imposter shall not be found. As for false gods, talk to the
          bittern and the owl, to the mole, and to the bat, and they shall tell
          you where they shall be discovered. The church of Christ at that time
          shall not have kings of the earth to bind her, and to control her, as
          if she were but a puny thing, nor shall she have them to persecute her
          and lift up their iron arm to crush her; but she, then, shall be the
          queen and empress of all nations; she shall reign over all kings; they
          shall bow down and lick the dust of her feet; her golden sandals shall
          tread upon their necks; she, with her scepter, with her rod of iron,
          shall break empires in pieces like earthen vessels. She shall say,
          "Overturn! overturn! overturn! until he come, whose right it is; and I
          will give it HIM" The destiny of the church is universal monarchy.
          What Alexander fought for, what Ceasar died to obtain, what Napoleon
          wasted an his life to achieve, that Christ shall have: -- the
          universal monarchy of the broad acres of the earth. "The sea is his,
          and he made it, and his hands formed the dry land." The whole earth
          shall come, and worship, and bow down, and kneel before the Lord our
          Maker; for every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall confess that
          Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have now, I think, the meaning of the text, -- the church growing
          and rising up till she becomes conspicuous, venerable, and supreme.
          And now let me pause here a moment, to ask how this is to be done.
        </p>
        <p>
          How is this to be done? I reply, there are three things which will
          ensure the growth of the church. The first is the individual exertion
          of every Christian. I do not think that all the exertions of the
          church of Christ will ever be able to reach the climax of our text. I
          think we shall see something more than natural agency, even though
          employed by the Spirit, before the church of Christ shall be exalted
          to that supremacy of which I have spoken; but, nevertheless, this is
          to contribute to it. In the olden times, when men raised cairns to the
          memory of departed kings, it was usual to put a heap of stones over
          the tomb, and every passer-by threw another stone. In course of age.
          those mounds grew into small hills. Now the church of Christ in the
          present day is growing something in that way. Each Christian converted
          to Christ throws his stone; we each do our measure. By the grace of
          God let us each make sure of one stone being deposited there, and
          strive to add another by laboring to be the instruments of bringing
          someone else to Christ; in this way the church will grow; and as year
          after year rolls on, each Christian serving his Master, the church
          will increase; and it shall come to pass in the last times, that even
          by the efforts of Christ's people, owned by God the Holy Spirit, this
          mountain shall be highly exalted in the midst of the hills.
        </p>
        <p>
          This however, although all that we can do, is not, I think, all that
          we have to expect. We can do no more, but we may expect more. Besides,
          the church of Christ differs from all other mountains in this: -- that
          she has within her a living influence. The ancients fabled that under
          Mount Etna, Vulcan was buried. Some great giant, they thought, lay
          there entombed; and when he rolled over and over, the earth began to
          tremble, and the mountains shook, and fire poured forth. We believe
          not the fable, but the church of God, verily, is like this living
          mountain. Christ seems to be buried within her; and when he moves
          himself his church rises with him. Once he was prostrate in the
          garden; then Zion was but a little hill; then he rose, and day-by-day
          as he is lifted up his church rises with him; and in the day when he
          shall stand on Mount Zion, then shall his church be elevated to her
          utmost height. The feet is, that the church, though a mountain, is a
          volcano -- not one that spouts fire, but that hath fire within her;
          and this inward fire of living truth, and living grace, makes her
          bulge out, expands her side, and lifts her crest, and onwards she must
          tower, for truth is mighty, and it must prevail -- grace is mighty,
          and must conquer -- Christ is mighty, and he must be King of kings.
          Thus you see that there is something more than the individual
          exertions of the church; there is a something within her that must
          make her expand and grow, till she overtops the highest mountains,
        </p>
        <p>
          But mark you, the great hope of the church, although it is reckoned
          madness by some to say it, is the second advent of Christ. When he
          shall come, then shall the mountain of the Lord's house be exalted
          above the hills. We know not when Jesus may come. All the prophets of
          modern times have only been prophets from the fact that they have made
          profit by their speculations; but with the solitary exception of that
          pun upon the word, I believe they have not the slightest claim upon
          your credit; not even men who are doctors of divinity, who can spoil
          an abundance of paper with their prophesies of second Adventism; "Of
          that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of God."
          Christ may come this morning; while I am addressing you Christ may
          suddenly appear in the clouds of heaven. he may not come for many a
          weary age. but come he must; in the last days he must appear; and when
          Christ shall come he will make short work of that which is so long a
          labor to his church. His appearance will immediately convert the Jews.
          They have looked for Messias a king. there he is, in more than regal
          splendor. They shall see him. they shall believe on him; he will then
          tell them that he is the Messiah whom their fathers crucified. Then
          will they look on him whom they have pierced, and they will mourn for
          their sin, and gathering round their great Messiah in glorious march
          they shall enter and be settled in their own land. They shall once
          more become a great and mighty nation, nay, a Jew shall become a very
          prince among men, firstborn in the church of God. Then shall the
          fullness of the Gentiles be converted and all kindreds and people
          shall serve the Son of David. Mark, the church is to rise first, and
          when the church has risen to eminence and greatness, the nations will
          flow unto her. Her rising will not be owing to the nations, but to the
          advent of Christ, and after she has become great, conspicious, and
          supreme, then will the nations flow to her. I am looking for the
          advent of Christ, it is this that cheers me in the battle of life --
          the battle and cause of Christ. I look for Christ to come, somewhat as
          John Bunyan described the battle of Captain Credence with Diabolus.
          The inhabitants of the town of Mansoul fought hard to protect their
          city from the prince of darkness, and at last a pitch battle was
          fought outside the walls. The captains and the brave men of arms
          fought all day till their swords were knitted to their hands with
          blood; many and many a weary hour did they seek to drive back the
          Diabolians. The battle seemed to waver in the balance, sometimes
          victory was on the side of faith, and anon, triumph seemed to hover
          over the crest of the prince of hell; but just as the sun was setting,
          trumpets were heard in the distance, Prince Emmanuel was coming, with
          trumpets sounding, and with banners flying, and while the men of
          mansoul passed onwards sword in hand, Emmanuel attacked their foes in
          the rear, and getting the enemy between them twain, they went on,
          driving their enemies at the swords point, till at last, trampling
          over their dead bodies, they met, and hand to hand the victorious
          church saluted its victorious Lord. Even so must it be. We must fight
          on day-by-day and hour-by-hour; and when we think the battle is almost
          decided against us, we shall hear the trump of the archangel, and the
          voice of God, and he shall come, the Prince of the kings of the earth:
          at his name, with terror they shall melt, and like snow driven before
          the wind from the bare side of Salmon shall they fly away; and we, the
          church militant, trampling over them, shall salute our Lord, shouting,
          "Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, the Lord God Omnipotent
          reigneth." Thus then, have I explained the first part of the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second part of the text we have to consider, is this sentence
          -- "AND ALL NATIONS SHALL FLOW UNTO IT." Here is a figure, perhaps not
          so sublime, but quite as beautiful as the first. Still endeavor to
          retain in your minds the picture of this stupendous mountain, reaching
          above the clouds, seen by all mankind, in either hemisphere, a wonder
          of nature which could not be accomplished by the ordinary rules of
          art, but which divine wisdom will be able to perform. Well, wonder of
          wonders, you see all the nations of the earth converging to this great
          mountain, as to a common center. Once in the year all the people of
          Israel were wont to go to the little hill of Zion; and now, once for
          all, you see, not Israel, but all the nations of the earth comming to
          this great hill of Zion, to worship the Most High God. The white sails
          are on the Atlantic, and the ships are dying before the wind, even as
          the bird flitteth through the sky. What bear they? What is their noble
          cargo? Lo! they come from far, bringing the sons and daughters of Zion
          from the ends of the earth. See you there the camel and the dromedary,
          the great caravan passing over the pathless desert? What are these and
          what is their costly freight? Lo they are bringing the daughters of
          God, and the sons of Zion up to the Most High God, to worship him.
          From all parts of the earth you see them coming -- from the freezing
          cold and from the burning heat, from the far-off islands of the sea,
          and from the barren sands they come; they come, all converging towards
          the great center of their high and holy worship. This we are not to
          understand of course, literally, but as a figure of the great
          spiritual fact that all the souls of men shall tend to Christ, and to
          union with his church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, I beg you carefully to observe the figure. It does not say they
          shall come to it, but they shall "flow unto it." Understand the
          metaphor. It implies first their number. Now our churches are
          increased, converts drop into the churches; drop after drop the pool
          is filled. But in those days they shall flow into it; now it is but
          the pouring out of water from the bucket; then it shall be as the
          rolling of the cataract from the hillside, it shall flow into it. Now
          our converts, however numerous, are comparatively few, but then a
          nation shall be born in a day. The people shall renounce their gods at
          once. Whole nations shall of a sudden by an irresistible impulse flow
          into the church, not one by one, but in one vast mass. The power of
          God shall be seen in bringing whore rations into the church of God.
          You have seen the river flowing onward to the sea, with its banks all
          swollen, bearing its enormous contribution to the boundless ocean. So
          shall it be in the last days; each nation shall be like a river,
          rolling towards the foot of this great mountain, the church of the
          living God. Happy, happy, happy day, when India and China with their
          teeming myriads, and all the nations of the earth, with their
          multitude of tongues, shall flow into the mountain of God!
        </p>
        <p>
          But the text conveys the idea not only of numbers, but of -- (I know
          the exact word, but then I do not like to use it, for fear some should
          not know the meaning of it, it means that the nations of the earth
          shall come willingly to it) -- spontaneity. That was the word I wanted
          to use; but wherefore should we use big words; when we might find
          little ones. They are to come willingly to Christ; not to be driven,
          not to be pumped up, not to be forced to it, but to be brought up by
          the word of the Lord, to pay him willing homage; they are to flow to
          it. Just as the river naturally flows down-hill by no other force than
          that which is its nature, so shall the grace of God be so mightily
          given to the sons of men, that no acts of parliament, no state
          churches, no armies will be used to make a forced conversion. "The
          nations shall flow unto it." Of themselves, made willing in the day of
          God's power, they shall flow to it. Whenever the church of God is
          increased by unwilling converts it loses strength; whenever men join
          the church because of oppression, which would drive them to make a
          profession of religion, they do not flow, the church is weakened, end
          not strengthened, but in those days the converts shall be voluntarily
          won -- shall come in willingly by divine grace; they shall flow unto
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But yet again, this represents the power of the work of conversion.
          They "shall flow to it." Imagine an idiot endeavoring to stop the
          river Thames. He gets for himself a boat, and there he stands,
          endeavoring to push back the stream. He objects to it flowing towards
          the sea. and with his hands he tries to put it back. Would you not
          soon hear laughter along the banks? Ah, fool, to attempt to stop the
          stream! Now, the word "flow," here conveys just the idea. "The nations
          shall flow unto it." The Secularist may rise up and say, "Oh, why be
          converted to this fanatical religion? Look to the things of time." The
          false priests may rouse themselves with all their anger to defy
          Christ, and endeavor to keep their slaves; but all their attempts to
          stop conversion will be like an idiot seeking to drive back a mighty
          stream with his puny hands. "All nations shall flow unto it." What an
          idea it is! Oh, take your stand to-day, like prophets of the Lord, and
          look into the future. To day the church appears like the dry bed of a
          torrent; here I stand, and I see a little water flowing in a secret
          and thread-like stream, amongst the stones. So little is it that I can
          scarcely detect it, but I take the glass of prophecy, I look far
          onward, and I see a rolling mass of water, such as is sometimes seen
          in the rapid rivers of Africa; and there it is, coming with thundering
          sound. Wait for a few more years, and that torrent, like Kishon's
          mighty river, sweeping all before it, shall fill this dry bed, and
          swell on, and on, and on, with tumultuous waves of joy, till it meets
          the ocean of Christ's universal reign, and loses itself in God. Here
          you see, then, you have more than your imagination can grasp. This
          stupendous mountain, and all the nations of the earth -- vast numbers
          with immense force -- spontaneously coming up to the house of the
          living God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I shall close by a practical address, very brief, and I trust
          very earnest. Is it not a great subject for praise that the nations of
          the earth may flow to the hill of God and to his house? If I were to
          tell you that all the nations of Europe were climbing the sides of the
          Alps, you would ask me, "And what benefit do they gain thereby? They
          must pass over the slippery fields of ice and they may lose their
          lives in the midst of the bottomless chasms that are overhung by the
          mighty precipices; they may suddenly be overwhelmed and buried in the
          all-destroying avalanche, and should they reach the summit they must
          fall down exhausted. What is there that men should covet in those
          barren heights; rarefied air and cold would soon destroy them, should
          they attempt to exist there." Ah, but it is not so with God's hill.
          There shall be no snow upon its summit, but the warmth and light of
          Jehovah's love, there shall be no chasms in its side wherein souls may
          be destroyed, for there shall be a way, and a highway, (the unclean
          shall not pass over it) a way so easy that the wayfaring man shall not
          err therein.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mountains of which we read in Scripture were some of them such,
          that if they were accessible no one would desire to climb them. There
          were bounds set round about Sinai, but had there been no bounds who
          would hare wished to ascend it? A mountain that burned with fire, and
          upon which there was a sound as of a trumpet waxing exceeding loud and
          long. No, brethren, we are not come to a mountain like Sinai with its
          supernatural thunders; we are not come to a hill bare, and barren, and
          bleak, and difficult to climb, like the mountains of earth; but the
          hill of God, though it is a high hill, is a hill up which on hands and
          knees the humble penitent may readily ascend. Ye are come to a
          mountain which is not forbidden to you. there are no bounds set about
          it to keep you off, but you are freely bidden and freely invited to
          come to it. And the God who invited you will give you grace to come.
          If he has given you the will to come, he will give you grace to climb
          the sides of the hill, till you shall reach its upper glories, and
          stand on its summit transported with delight. While I am talking about
          the nations that will flow to Christ, might we not weep to think that
          there are so many in this congregation that are not flowing to Christ
          but are going from him? Ah! soul; what are the splendours of the
          Millennium to thee, if thou art his enemy? For when he tramples his
          foes in his hot displeasure, thy blood shall stain his garments, even
          as the garments of the wine-pressers are stained with the blood of the
          grape. Tremble, sinner, for the advent of Christ must be thy
          destruction though it shall be the church's Joy and comfort. Ye say,
          "Come quickly." Know ye not that to you the day of the Lord is
          darkness and not light, for that day burneth as an oven, and they that
          are proud and do wickedly shall be as stubble, and the fire shall
          consume them with burning heat. Oh! ye people that to-day hear the
          words of Jesus! ye are now this day invited to come to the mountain of
          his church, on which stands his cross and his throne. Ye weary, heavy
          laden, sin-destroyed sin-ruined souls, ye that know and feel your need
          of Jesus ye that weep because of sin, ye are bidden to come now to
          Christ's cross. to look to him who shed his brood for the ungodly, and
          looking to him, you shall find peace and rest; so that when he cometh
          with rainbow wreath, and robes of storm, you shall be able to see him,
          not with alarm and terror, but with joy and gladness. for you shall
          say, "Here he is, the man who died for me has come to claim me, he who
          bought me has come to receive me; my judge is my Redeemer, and I will
          rejoice in him." Oh! turn ye, ye English heathens -- turn ye unto God!
          ye inhabitants of London, some of you as vile as the inhabitants of
          Sodom. turn ye, turn ye to God! O Lord Jesus! by thy grace turn every
          one of us to thyself! Bring in thine elect; let thy redeemed rejoice
          in thee; and then let the fullness of the nations flow unto then, and
          thine shall be the glory, for ever and ever.
