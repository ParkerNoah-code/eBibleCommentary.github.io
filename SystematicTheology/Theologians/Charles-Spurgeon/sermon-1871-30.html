          |Come on let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come
          to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our
          enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.
          Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with
          their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and
          Raamses. But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied
          and grew.| -- Exodus 1:10-12.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE children of this world are wise in their generation. Their policy
          may be short-sighted and their stratagems crooked, nevertheless the
          world admires the wisdom of their counsels, and makes light of the
          craftiness of their projects. In their opposition to the Christian
          church, the men of the world might certainly have been as well able to
          outwit her by the variety of their manoeuvres as to overwhelm her by
          the force of their numbers, were it not that there is an unseen One in
          her midst, who is more than a match for the guile of their hearts and
          the might of their hosts. Looking back at the early struggles of the
          Hebrew race to gain a footing among the nations, it is very clear that
          had the contest been merely between Pharaoh and Israel, the Egyptian
          king could exercise power and policy enough to defeat the sons of
          Jacob and reduce them to serfdom; but when a new name is brought in,
          and the contest appears to be truly between Pharaoh and Jehovah the
          God of Israel, it is quite another matter, and a far different issue
          may be counted upon. There is one behind the curtain that takes
          Israel's part. He sees through all Pharaoh's plots. Or ever his
          thoughts have ripened into plans they are forestalled; fast as they
          are set up they are upset; for every intrigue there is a reprisal.
          Thus he taketh the wise in their own craftiness. The whole history of
          the long feud between the seed of the woman and the seed of the
          serpent illustrates the subtlety of the serpent's seed, and the
          simplicity of the woman's seed; but still more does it bring to light
          the infinite wisdom of him who rules the seed of the woman; and who
          will in the end bruise the serpent's head, and give unto his people
          and the cause they have espoused a complete triumph. Whatever has been
          done by the enemies in rage or in recklessness, God has always met it
          calmly and quietly. He has shown himself ready for every emergency.
          And he has not only baffled and utterly defeated all the inventions of
          wicked men, but he has turned their strange devices to good account,
          for the development of his own sovereign purposes. Be has made his
          enemies work for him, aiding the enterprise they eschewed: he has
          turned their curse into a blessing: he has made evil productive of
          good: he has extracted sweetness out of their bitter spleen, and
          distilled healthful medicine out of their deadly animosity. He hath
          his way in the whirlwind: the clouds are the dust of his feet. He does
          not only meet evil with good, but he takes the evil, and subjects it
          to his own eternal purpose, and from it brings forth a course of
          events that results in his own glory, the benefit of his children, and
          the fulfillment of their destiny.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of this general principle we shall now proceed to consider three
          special illustrations. First, the circumstances of the children of
          Israel; secondly, the history of the church of Christ; thirdly, the
          experience of individual Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. IN THE CASE OF ISRAEL, it did seem to be a deep-laid plot, very
          politic and crafty indeed, that as the kings of Egypt, themselves of
          an alien race, had subdued the Egyptians, they should prevent the
          other alien race, the Israelites, from conquering them. Instead of
          murdering them wholesale, it did seem a wise though a cruel thing to
          make them slaves; to divide them up and down the country; to subject
          them to toil till their spirits were broken; to appoint them to the
          most menial work in the land, that they might be crushed down and
          their spirits become so base that they would not dare to rebel. Thus
          we may suppose it was hoped that their physical strength would be so
          relaxed, and their circumstances so reduced, that the clan would soon
          be insignificant if not utterly extinct. But God met and overruled
          this policy in various ways. |The more they afflicted them, the more
          they multiplied.| The census proved the error of their calculation.
          The cause looked likely, but it was not productive of the consequence
          expected. Had it been another people, the tactics might have been
          successful; but they were God's people, endeared to him by their
          ancestry, ennobled in his sight by their covenant destiny, and
          encompassed with his favor as with a shield. No conspiracy formed
          against them could thrive. And so it came to pass, that like certain
          herbs which spring up when trodden down, or like certain trees that
          grow taller if loaded with weights, Israel rose superior to all her
          disadvantages. |The more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied
          and grew.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The glory of God shines forth conspicuously in the use to which he
          turned the persecutions they endured. The severe treatment they had to
          bear from the enemy became to them a salutary discipline. This cometh
          of the Lord of Hosts, who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in
          working. From that time the children of Israel began to feel a disgust
          with Egypt. They had settled down very quietly in Goshen, and thought
          that it was their rest. They had imbibed much of the manners and
          customs of the Egyptians. We have it on record that they worshipped
          the gods of Egypt. They seemed greatly to have appreciated what they
          afterwards called the luxuries of the land -- the leeks, the garlics,
          the onions, the melons, and the cucumbers. They appear to have been
          almost naturalised to that country. They were little better than
          Egyptians. Perhaps persons travelling, except by certain tones of
          language and contour of countenance, would scarcely have known but
          what they were descendants of Ham. But now their masters treat them
          cruelly, and they loathe the Egyptians. They are scattered up and down
          throughout the land, and Goshen is no longer dear to them. The, are
          treated like strangers, and they feel they are strangers. Now that
          they hear from morning till night the taskmaster's oath, and the crack
          of the cruel whip, and are subjected to incessant toil and bondage,
          they think far less of Egypt than they used to do. This is what the
          Lord designed. He never intended that his people Israel should be
          absorbed into any other family. He never meant them to be other than
          sojourners on that soil. He had some better thing for them than that
          they should dwell in that land, and be as the heathen were. God was
          thus answering one purpose. And he did more than this. Now they began
          to remember, as their bondage waxed more and more severe, the God of
          their fathers whom they had forgotten. I have reminded you that they
          had fallen into the worship of the gods of Egypt; but now they turn
          with abhorrence from the gods of their oppressors, and they bethink
          themselves of the covenant which Jehovah had made with Abraham, and
          with Isaac and Jacob, and they betook themselves to their knees. In
          secret, they utter their groanings before the Most High, and when
          their taskmasters make them smart, they lift their eyes, suffused with
          bitter tears, and silently appeal to heaven, to the God of their
          fathers, that he would have mercy upon them. They had forgotten to
          pray until then. The mass of them had been unused to call upon the
          name of the Lord; but now the scourge drives them to seek help from
          above. Their terrors, their pains, their griefs, and their vexations
          compel them to lift up that cry to heaven which came into the ears of
          Jehovah, and moved his hand to help them.
        </p>
        <p>
          More than that, remember that it was necessary for this people to be
          altogether rescued from that land which for many a year had taxed
          their labor and bounded their enterprise, because it was not the land
          which had been promised them as an inheritance. It was God's intention
          and covenant purpose to give them the Land of Canaan, a land that
          flowed with milk and honey. But it is not very easy to induce a
          nation, numbering some millions, to leave a country in which they have
          been born and nourished and found a home. Only some very fearful evil
          can induce them to expatriate themselves. Had Moses gone to the
          children of Israel before the time of their bondage, and said, |Up I
          get you hence unto the land which the Lord swears that he will give it
          to you,| he would have seemed to them as one that mocked: they would
          have laughed him to scorn. In order to cut loose the bonds that bound
          them to Egypt, the sharp knife of affliction must be used; and
          Pharaoh, though he knew it not, was God's instrument in weaning them
          from the Egyptian world, and helping them as his church to take up
          their separate place in the wilderness, and receive the portion which
          God had appointed for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more -- and here you may see the wisdom of God -- the very means
          which Pharaoh devised for the effectual crushing of the people -- the
          destruction of the male children -- became the direct, nay, the divine
          provision for educating a deliverer for them. Moses had never been, in
          all probability, trained in the courts of Pharaoh if he had not been
          put in the basket of bulrushes on the brink of the Nile; and his
          mother would certainly never have put him there if there had not been
          a pitiless edict that the male children should be put to death. Moved
          by maternal instinct to save her child, and moved by faith in God not
          to obey the king's command, she places her child in the ark. Pharaoh's
          daughter finds the child, compassionates its cry, extricates it from
          peril, loves it fondly, adopts it capriciously, and educates it in the
          very court of Pharaoh. That child grows up to be the man who should
          vex the fields of Zoan -- the man of God, who with a high hand and an
          outstretched arm, would lead forth the slaves of Egypt to become a
          great nation, which God should bless. So you see the Lord in all
          points meets Pharaoh and foils him. This Pharaoh was the great
          representative in those days of the power of evil, and he stands still
          to the Christian church as the type of the seed of the serpent. But
          the Lord withstands him, despoils him of his purpose, and turns all he
          does to the very highest and best end. Such the narrative, full of
          instruction, and charged with portent, that serves as a type of the
          Lord's doing when he makes bare his arm for the salvation of his own
          heritage.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Let us now carry the same thought a stage farther, and take a
          brief survey of THE HISTORY OF THE CHILDREN OF GOD. The like means
          will appear in manifold operation. Men meditate mischief, but it
          miserably miscarries. God grants protection to the persecuted, and
          provides an escape from the most perilous exposure. Full often the
          darkest conspiracy is brought to the direst confusion. No sooner does
          Christ gather a church in any place, be it a renowned empire or a
          paltry village, than opposition is stirred up. |If ye were of the
          world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the
          world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world
          hateth you.| |I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and
          between thy seed and her seed,| is the first check for the serpent's
          wiles, the first ray of hope for his helpless victims; and the
          prediction will continue to be fulfilled till at last, according to
          the word of the Lord, the tares are bound in bundles to burn them, and
          the wheat is gathered into his garner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever there has been a great persecution raised against the
          Christian church, God has overruled it, as he did in the case of
          Pharaoh's oppression of the Israelites, by making the aggrieved
          community more largely to increase. The early persecutions in Judea
          promoted the spread of the gospel; hence, when after the death of
          Stephen the disciples were all scattered abroad throughout the regions
          of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles, the result is thus given:
          |Therefore they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching
          the word.| So, too, when Herod stretched forth his hands to vex
          certain of the church, and killed James, the brother of John, with the
          sword; what came of it? Why Luke tells us in almost the same words
          that Moses had used: |The word of God grew and multiplied.| Those
          terrible and bloody persecutions under the Roman Emperor by no means
          stayed the progress of the gospel; but strangely enough seemed to
          press forward for the crown of martyrdom. The church probably never
          increased at a greater ratio than as when her foes were most fierce to
          assail and most resolute to destroy her. It was so in after times. The
          Reformation in this country and throughout Europe never went on so
          prosperously as when it was most vigorously opposed. You shall find in
          any individual church that wherever evil men have conspired together,
          and a storm of opposition has burst forth against the saints, the
          heart of the Lord has been moved with compassion, and the hand of the
          Lord has been raised to succor, till we have come to look upon
          opposition as an omen of good, and persecution for righteousness' sake
          as a tearful seed-time, quickly to be followed by a harvest of joy. We
          have looked on our adversaries, though they seemed like stormy
          petrels, as being the index of a favorable wind to the good barque of
          Christ's church. Persecution seems to be the wave that, when it leaps
          up around her, speeds her course. Let the mountains be removed, and
          cast into the midst of the sea; but after long experience of Jehovah's
          faithfulness towards his people, we are confident that his church
          shall not be moved: in quietude shall she possess her soul.
          Persecution has evidently aided the increase of the church by the
          scattering abroad of earnest teachers. We are very apt to get hived --
          too many of us together -- and our very love of one another renders it
          difficult to part us and scatter us about. Persecution therefore is
          permitted to scatter the hive of the church into various swarms, and
          each of these swarms begins to make honey. We are all like the salt if
          we be true Christians, and the proper place for the salt is not massed
          in a box, but scattered by handfuls over the flesh which it is to
          preserve. We are of good service when we are kept together in great
          bands: happy we certainly are in the presence of each other; but we
          are to separate and scatter, and we shall conquer as we are scattered
          abroad. You remember the days of our Puritan forefathers, when the
          dominant church of the day determined to crush out pure evangelism. To
          what extent did it succeed? Did it destroy their faith and their
          confidence? Nay, my brethren; by driving them out of an apostate
          church, and compelling them to take up their stand as separated
          believers without the camp, bearing Christ's reproach and cross, an
          everlasting testimony for pure truth was enshrined. Was the crisis
          prolonged? Were deeds of violence legalised? By the increasing rigour
          of such persecution, our forefathers were constrained to leave their
          native shores, and they had to pass in the May Flower, and afterwards
          in some succeeding vessels, across the blue Atlantic, sadly but surely
          to found another center for the proclamation of the gospel, and upon
          the wide continent of a new world they became the progenitors of
          another nation holding fast the fundamentals of the faith, and
          rejoicing in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free. There
          might have been no church in the United States if it had not been that
          our sires were driven to the wilds amongst the Red Indians, there to
          establish themselves, and set up a banner for the truth as it is in
          Jesus. It will always be so. I could almost wish that in this island,
          though I dread calamity, I could almost wish, for the Master's honor,
          that some irresistible impulse should force his disciples to go abroad
          to the regions beyond our present sphere of life and labor. I rejoice,
          though I love not to miss my friends, when I find them led or driven,
          it may be, to emigration, whether it be to Australia, Canada or
          anywhere else, because I trust that if they are living seed they will
          be as a handful of corn sown in the land, the fruit whereof shall
          shake like Lebanon. Christian men are sometimes called to leave
          positions of great comfort and to occupy stations of great hardship.
          They may account it a reverse of fortune, while God designs it as an
          appointment to especial service. If they bear Christ's gospel with
          them to a people sitting in darkness, that will be great gain in the
          long run to the church. Your being sent to a village, though you like
          it not, may be a lasting blessing to the hamlet. Your residing among
          strangers, when you would far rather find a more congenial home among
          your own kindred, may be for the good of that neighborhood. Who knows?
          Where should lamps be set up but in dark places? Where should we have
          a guard for Christ's army, but where the enemy is most likely to make
          the assault? Be patient, then, my brethren, amidst the persecutions or
          trials you may be called upon to bear; and be thankful that they are
          so often overruled for the growth of the church, the spread of the
          gospel, and the honor of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, beloved, persecution in the church -- even when it does not
          take the form of burning or imprisonment, but of slander, of cruel
          mockings, jesting, jeering, and venomous spite -- in whatever form it
          is sent, persecution helps to keep up the separation between the
          church and the world. I fear most the rich when they bring gifts. I
          loathe the world most when it fawns and flatters. When I heard of a
          lady who had put on Christ by baptism, that the cold shoulder was
          given her in all the circles in which she moved; did I, think you,
          feel more disposed to condole or to congratulate? It was said that now
          she had but few invitations to such places and such society as she had
          previously frequented; and I rejoiced, and thanked God for it. I was
          glad of it, for I felt she was farther removed from temptation. When I
          heard of a young man that, after he joined the church, those in his
          workshop met him at once with loud laughter and reproached him with
          bitter scorn. I was thankful, because now he could not take up the
          same position with themselves. He was a marked man: they who knew him
          discovered that there was such a thing as Christianity, and such a one
          as an earnest defender of it. It is no evil to the church, depend upon
          it, to have a great gulf fixed between her and the world. The worst
          thing that ever could happen for us is, when affinities are made
          between the sons of God and the children of Belial. This brought on
          the Deluge; and if it could ever be carried out thoroughly again, it
          would bring on judgments terrible to think of. It is ill for the
          worldly, since |they that are far from God shall perish;| but it is a
          thousand times worse for the professing when they play foul with their
          profession, for so it is written, |Thou hast destroyed all them that
          go a whoring from thee.| Summary vengeance is their lot. |Come out
          from among them, and be ye separate, and touch not the unclean thing;
          and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be
          my sons and daughters.| This is a text that needs to be thundered in
          trumpet tone. What says the great King unto the spouse? |Forget also
          thine own people, and thy father's house; so shall the King greatly
          desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.| |Be not
          conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your
          mind.| Too much laxness, giving way to the world a friendship foil of
          fascination brings on leanness of spirit, and causes us to be scarcely
          known as Christians, weakens our testimony, and in every way promotes
          Satan's ends. But when persecution breaks forth, barriers are set up,
          and distinctive colors are worn, so the two camps are kept in open
          hostility, and when brought to battle with each other, the church is
          kept pure with armor bright; victory waits her march, and her
          champions win their laurels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, persecution in the Christian church acts like a winnowing fan
          to the heaps gathered on the threshing-floor. In these soft and silken
          days any man may be a Christian professor. Oftentimes it pays well to
          make a profession of godliness. Men think the better of you: it brings
          customers to the shop. No one knows how many conveniences may attach
          to the profession of religion: albeit, if it be pretense without
          pretext, everlasting destruction awaits such violation of truth, for
          God will surely avenge hypocrisy. But in days of persecution, to
          profess Christ is very inconvenient. Then to be baptised in water may
          involve a baptism of blood. Then for the soul to burn with zeal for
          Christ would probably be followed with the body being burnt at the
          stake. Then a word for Jesus would bring a word of conviction from the
          judge's mouth, and, close at the heels of that word, death. Then they
          who loved not Christ betook themselves to the other side; the cowards
          and the spies shrunk away. Demas went, and Judas went, and all of that
          brood, to their own company, and then only the true and the brave, the
          regenerate, the elect of God were left. They stood fast and firm --
          all the stronger for losing such ill company. Then in those days the
          church was like a heap of golden wheat, all winnowed and clean grain,
          fit for a burnt offering to the Most High, to be offered up as a meat
          offering upon his altar. Her martyrs were amongst her noblest sons,
          the very glory of the church and of the Lord Jesus Christ. So you see
          persecution is overruled for this great good. It ought never to be,
          while there are sinners in this world -- it ought never to be that the
          Christian escapes opposition. I take it that if a man makes an advance
          in life, comes to a position of fame, he ought to win it, ought to
          fight for it. Men ought not to be crowned until first of all they have
          striven for the mastery; and it should be so in the church of God that
          we must fight if we would reign. It should not be that we should think
          it an easy thing and a light matter to be a follower of him whose life
          was sorrow, and whose death was the death of the cross. If we are to
          be conformed to him, it cannot be by ease and sloth. Not the downy
          couch, but the crown of thorns; not the triumph, but the shame, must
          be the portion of the imitators of the Crucified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Persecution has a further beneficial use in the church of God, and it
          is this. It may be that the members of the church want it. It is a
          sorrowful thing that slander should be so often used against God's
          people; it is a grievous thing that their little faults should be
          severely criticised and magnified; but, on the whole, it is good and
          profitable. It is a great blessing to be made to walk carefully. The
          Roman who professed that he would like to have a window in his bosom,
          that everybody might see his heart, would have wished, I should think,
          before long for a shutter to that window; yet it is no slight stimulus
          to a man's own circumspection for him to know that he is observed by
          unfriendly eyes. Our life ought to be such as will bear criticism. As
          Christian men we serve a jealous God, and our works will have to stand
          the test of fire at the last great day. The wood, and the hay, and the
          stubble that we have builded will be consumed, and only the gold, the
          silver, and the precious stones will remain. Are we, therefore, to be
          afraid of the ordinary ordeal of human censure and malignity? If we
          run with the footmen and they weary us, what shall we do when we
          contend with horses? And if in this land of comparative peace we are
          weary, what shall we do in the swelling of Jordan? This is the
          opposition appointed for us. It is through much tribulation we are to
          inherit the kingdom; and if we be sincere, and honest and true, we
          shall not flinch at this: we shall feel that God will overrule it for
          our sanctification, by making us take heed unto our ways, because the
          wicked watch our paths.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this persecution, dear brethren, has a further usefulness. Often
          does it happen that the enmity of the world drives the Christian
          nearer to his God. How many prayers have been offered up as the result
          of persecution that would never have been offered else, heaven alone
          can tell! How many a groan, and sigh, and tear, acceptable to God,
          have been forced from true hearts by their sufferings, God alone
          knows! Ah! in the soft days, the summer days of peace and prosperity,
          we are apt to gad abroad after vain delights; but when the winter
          comes, with its keen and cutting blast, we haste to our own abode, we
          cleave to our own hearth, we love to dwell with our own kindred. Even
          so right frequently, with hearts all chill and cheerless, we have
          sought the house of our Father and our God, drawn near to his altar,
          and found a refreshment we fain could wish that we might never leave.
          Why, oh! why, are we so fickle? If we could find succor and solace
          apart from the Rock, away from the Sun, absent from our Lord, our
          wayward hearts would do so; but when the waters of affliction have
          covered all the earth, then we fly back to our Noah, our ark, and find
          rest for the sole of our foot. The friendship of this world is enmity
          to God. It rivals God's friendship, it deceives and deludes many
          hearts; but when the world frowns, it is a blessed frown that makes me
          seek my Savior's smile. Anything that drives me to my knees is good.
          Anything that makes me trust in the promise, and wait only upon God
          because my expectation is from him, is healthful to my soul, infuses
          courage, and inspires confidence, and invests her with fresh strength.
          O brethren, the very glory of the church is to live nearer to God. The
          more she thinks of her great and glorious Head, and the more she leans
          upon the invisible arm of the Eternal, the more invincible she is
          persecution in driving her to her stronghold is overruled to her help.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet, further, the dark days of fiendish persecution have witnessed
          bright deeds of Christian heroism never to be forgotten. How often
          have the richest and the ripest fruits of the Spirit been put forth by
          the Lord's people when they have been most grieved and smitten! Then
          the saints have been like clusters thrown into the winepress; but who
          shall bring forth the red wine? Whose but the feet of God's enemies
          shall tread the grapes? And as with exultation they bruise and trample
          down, they shall crush nothing in the dust but husks: the living wine
          shall flow, and God shall receive the whole of it. They work -- these
          foes work -- and think that with axes they can break down our carved
          work, and cast fire into the sanctuary of God, but all the while they
          burn not the true sanctuary: they burn but the base wooden erection
          with which man has defaced the living temple. Let them burn on: they
          do no hurt, but good ensues. If you read |Foxe's Book of Martyrs,| or
          any of the martyrologies of earlier ages, you will find there
          patience, self-denial, consecration, confidence in God, and all the
          finer graces of temper in full bloom, perfuming the air with their
          fragrance. One is astonished at what our poor, weak humanity has been
          able to endure for the truth, when strengthened by the Spirit of God.
          Verily, humble and weak, and timid women have shown true mettle,
          waxing valiant, and cheering on men of muscle and sinew, whose hearts
          had grown faint. We could mention the names of many saints, if this
          were the time, who have endured torment as severe as inquisitors could
          devise, or relentless executioners could inflict, and yet they have
          not denied their Lord. This is the patience of the saints, I think,
          when the martyrs perished in the Roman Amphitheatre, and the cruel
          crowd looked down to watch their agonies as their bones were crushed
          between the jaws of wild beasts; angels gathered in tiers, invisible
          multitudes of them gathered, and looked on with eyes of admiration at
          the spectacle of mortal men ravished with the love of God, waving the
          banner of immortal truth, while from frightful wounds and horrid
          gashes their life-blood streamed. Oh! what God can do by us when he
          works in us! Perhaps heaven itself, save when it gazed upon the cross,
          never saw a nobler spectacle than when men and women, who bore the
          cross of Christ in their hearts, gave themselves up wholly as living
          sacrifices unto him. The church looks fairer and shines brighter when
          she is in the furnace. Not the smell of fire doth pass upon her. Her
          Lord is with her, and if the fire be heated seven times hotter, his
          glory is seven times the brighter. Thus, again, the principle of the
          text is brought out: |the more they afflicted them, the more they
          multiplied.| Their enemies try to deal wisely with them to put them
          down, but their wisdom is folly. God has blessed the church by her
          persecution.
        </p>
        <p>
          And do you not think that persecution and opposition -- such little
          oppositions as we meet with now; little indeed, compared with those of
          olden times -- are permitted for our good, as in Israel's case, to
          make us feel that this is not our rest, and cause us to long for the
          better land? Perhaps, dear Christian, if you lived in a Christian
          household, where all the wonted order helped your piety, if you were
          put into the conservatory of a gracious providence, you might be
          content to dwell below always. We soon take root in this soil, for we
          are earthy by nature, and we cling to earth -- like to its like. But
          when there comes the jeer, the unkind remark, the cruel innuendo, the
          bitter sarcasm, then we feel, |This is not my rest: I must seek better
          company than this, a better land, and a better portion than I shall
          find this side of Jordan.| And then we long for the home-bringing,
          when the King, the Husband, shall fetch home his spouse, and the
          marriage shall be consummated in the skies. Oh! how sometimes, when
          the world has been very very cold you have longed for the warm bosom
          of your Savior! You would have nestled in the world's bosom if you
          could, but when she would not receive you but thrust you forth, then
          you came to your true self, and exercised your right senses, and you
          said, |I will return unto my husband. It was better with me then than
          now.| O that our hearts were always set on heaven! There is our
          treasure: there let our hearts be also. There is our Lord and King: to
          him should our hearts fly. There are the best ones of our families,
          our relations, who are everlastingly our associates, brethren and
          sisters whose brotherhood and sisterhood no death can bring to an end
          --
        </p>
        <p>|There my best friends my kindred dwell,</p>
        <p>There God my Savior reigns.|</p>
        <p>
          We ought to long for that land: and I say the whip of persecution is
          helpful, because it makes us learn that this is the house of bondage,
          and moves us to long after and seek for the land of liberty -- the
          land of joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now I close this address by just very briefly hinting that
          THIS GREAT GENERAL TRUTH APPLIES TO ALL BELIEVERS; but I will make a
          practical use of it. Dear brother, dear sister, are you passing
          through great trials? Very well then, to meet them I pray that God's
          grace may give you greater faith; and if your trials increase more and
          more, so may your strength increase. You will be acting after God's
          manner, guided by his wisdom, if you seek to get more faith out of
          more trial, for that trial does strengthen faith, through divine
          grace, experience teaches us, and as we make full proof of the
          faithfulness of God, our courage, once apt to waver, is confirmed. Do
          pray the Lord that when the trials multiply you may get faith
          wherewith to meet them; that out of the eater you may get meat; and
          out of the strong find strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, too, if you know the truth of God to be at any time assailed, and
          your own mind is beset with doubt about any doctrine, always ask God
          so to open that particular truth to your understanding, and endear it
          to your heart, that by the assaults you are enabled to repel your
          faith may be the more confirmed. Oh! there is a light way of holding
          truth, and there is a tenacious way of grasping it. I have held
          doctrines, as it were, in my hand, like a boy's ball, that might be
          thrown away. But it is another thing when the King prints the mark of
          the doctrine right into your very soul, so that you could no more part
          with it than you could part with life itself. Trials often burn
          doctrines into us, and heresies and infidelities make the good
          confession dear in our sight as a prize which we could never part
          with. Thus opposition to the truth leads to the multiplication of
          evidences in its support, and the more we are assailed with the
          arguments of science, falsely so-called, the firmer we adhere to the
          oracles of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or it may be, dear Christian worker, that of late you have met with a
          great many discouragements. You seem to have labored in vain, and
          spent your strength for nought. Ask then, in prayer, and act
          accordingly, that the more you are defeated the less you may be
          disposed to yield; but rather that you may be endowed with fresh
          energy for the service, and strive with increased assurance for the
          victory. When you feel |I am foiled in that point,| say,
          |Nevertheless, I cannot be beaten: I belong to a seed that cannot be
          vanquished. If I did not belong to the house of Israel, I might have
          been destroyed and overcome; but none can stand against the Hebrew
          race, against true Israelites -- they must win the day.| Therefore,
          settle it in your mind that if you do not win souls one day, you will
          another; and if you cannot press into your enemies' territory in one
          part you will in another; and if he defeats you at any time, then
          multiply your efforts to do good. Always take revenge on Satan if he
          defeats you, by trying to do ten times more good than you did before.
          It is in some such way that a dear brother now preaching the gospel,
          whom God has blessed with a very considerable measure of success, may
          trace the opening of his career to a circumstance that occurred to
          myself. Sitting in my pulpit one evening, in a country village, where
          I had to preach, my text slipped from my memory, and with the text
          seemed to go all that I had thought to speak upon it. A rare thing to
          happen to me; but I sat utterly confounded. I could find nothing to
          say. With strong crying I lifted up my soul to God to pour out again
          within my soul of the living water that it might gush forth from me
          for others; and I accompanied my prayer with a vow that if Satan's
          enmity thus had brought me low, I would take so many fresh men whom I
          might meet with during the week, and train them for the ministry, so
          that with their hands and tongues I would avenge myself on the
          Philistines. The brother I have alluded to came to me the next
          morning. I accepted him at once as one whom God had sent, and I helped
          him, and others after him, to prepare for the service, and to go forth
          in the Savior's name to preach the gospel of the grace of God. Often
          when we fear we are defeated, we ought to say, |I will do all the
          more. Instead of dropping from this work, now will I make a general
          levy, and a sacred conscription upon all the powers of my soul, and I
          will gather up all the strength I ever had in reserve, and make from
          this moment a tremendous life-long effort to overcome the powers of
          darkness, and win for Christ fresh trophies of victory.| After this
          fashion you will have an easier time of it, for if you do more good
          the more you are tempted, Satan will not so often tempt you. When he
          knows that all the more you are afflicted so much the more you
          multiply, very likely he will find it wiser to let you alone, or try
          you in some other method than that of direct and overt opposition. So
          whenever you have a trial, take it as a favor; whenever God holds in
          one hand the rod of affliction, he has a favor in the other hand; he
          never strikes a child of his but he has some tender blessing in store.
          If he visits you with unwonted affliction, you will have unusual
          delight; the Lord will open new windows for you, and show his beauty
          as he shows it not to others recording as your tribulations abound, so
          also shall your consolations abound in Christ Jesus. In the deeper
          waters you shall find him nearer, for he has said, |When thou passest
          through the waters, I will be with thee.| He will be with you always,
          but he has promised to come to you specially and peculiarly, and, as
          it were, by appointment, when you are driven out into the wilderness,
          or harassed by the foe. He comforteth those that are cast down.
          Rejoice, therefore, in your afflictions, if so be you have faith to
          believe that they shall be blessed for your good.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is all this to the unconverted? Ah, sirs! while the men of God
          flourish in adversity, the men of this world are ruined by their
          prosperity. Even the cup of pleasure and sensual enjoyment, of which
          ye delight to drink, has its bitter dregs which ye shall be compelled
          to swallow. Yet even now all your days are not passed in sunshine. You
          have your troubles; but you have no God to resort to. You will have
          many sorer plagues than you have ever yet been visited with; but if
          you continue in unbelief, you will still have no God to trust in.
          Perhaps you go to some friends in any emergency now, but no friend can
          help you in the dying hour. No brother can go with you through the
          swellings of Jordan. O friendless one, O Christless sinner! dost thou
          not want God to be thy helper, and Christ to be thy friend? If thou
          dost, then on the cross behold the Savior. Turn to him thine eye:
          penitently trust him: rely upon him, and he is ours, and then
          henceforth the Lord of Hosts shall be with you, and God of Jacob shall
          be your refuge, and your afflictions also shall work your good. May
          God bless each one of you, for Jesus' sake. Amen.
        </p>

          MR. SPURGEON hopes to be permitted to preach on July 2. He is most
          thankful to inform all friends that be is better in health, and trusts
          be may be able again to occupy the pulpit of the Tabernacle from
          Sabbath to Sabbath.<br />
