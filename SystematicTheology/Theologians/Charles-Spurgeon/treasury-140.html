 </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">TITLE. A Song of Degrees. We have now reached the last of 
    the Gradual Psalms. The Pilgrims are going home, and are singing the last 
    song in their Psalter. They leave early in the morning, before the day has 
    fully commenced, for the journey is long for many of them. While yet the 
    night lingers they are on the move. As soon as they are outside the gates 
    they see the guards upon the temple wall, and the lamps shining from the 
    windows of the chambers which surround the sanctuary; therefore, moved by 
    the sight, they chant a farewell to the perpetual attendants upon the holy 
    shrine. Their parting exhortation arouses the priests to pronounce upon them 
    a blessing out of the holy place: this blessing is contained in the third 
    verse. The priests as good as say, "You have desired us to bless the Lord, 
    and now we pray the Lord to bless you."</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The Psalm teaches us to pray for those who are 
    continually ministering before the Lord, and it invites all ministers to 
    pronounce blessings upon their loving and prayerful people</p></i>.<br/>
 
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. Behold.</p></b> By this call, the pilgrims bespeak 
    the attention of the night watch. They shout to them: Behold! The retiring 
    pilgrims stir up the holy brotherhood of those who are appointed to keep the 
    watch of the house of the Lord. Let them look around them upon the holy 
    place, and everywhere "behold" reasons for sacred praise. Let them look <i>
    above </i>them at night and magnify him who made Heaven and earth, and 
    lighted the one with stars and the other with his love. Let them see to it 
    that their hallelujahs never come to an end.
<p align="justify">Their departing brethren arouse them with the shrill cry 
    of "Behold!" Behold!—see, take care, be on the watch, diligently mind your 
    work, and incessantly adore and bless Jehovah's name. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Bless the LORD.</p></b> Think well of Jehovah, and speak well 
    of him. Adore him with reverence, draw near to him with love, delight in him 
    with exultation. Be not content with praise, such as all his works render to 
    him; but, as his saints, see that you "bless" him. He blesses you; 
    therefore, be zealous to bless him. The word "bless" is the characteristic 
    word of the Psalm. 
<p align="justify">The first two verses stir us up to bless Jehovah, and in 
    the last verse Jehovah's blessing is invoked upon the people. Oh to abound 
    in blessing! May blessed and blessing be the two words which describe our 
    lives. Let others flatter their fellows, or bless their lucky stars, or 
    praise themselves; as for us, we will bless Jehovah, from whom all blessings 
    flow.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">All you servants of the LORD.</p></b> It is your office to 
    bless him; take care that you lead the way therein. Servants should speak 
    well of their masters. Not one of you should serve him as of compulsion, but 
    all should bless him while you serve him; yes, bless him for permitting you 
    to serve him, fitting you to serve him, and accepting your service.
<p align="justify">To be a servant of Jehovah is an incalculable honor, a 
    blessing beyond all estimate. To be a servant in his house, is even more a 
    delight and a glory: if those who are ever with the Lord, and dwell in his 
    own temple, do not bless the Lord, who will? </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Which by night stand in the house of the LORD. </p></b>We can 
    well understand how the holy pilgrims half envied those consecrated ones who 
    guarded the temple, and attended to the necessary offices thereof through 
    the hours of night. To the silence and solemnity of night, there was added 
    the awful glory of the place where Jehovah had ordained that his worship 
    should be celebrated, blessed were the priests and Levites who were ordained 
    to a service so sublime. That these should bless the Lord throughout their 
    nightly vigils was most fitting: the people would have them mark this, and 
    never fail in the duty. They were not to move about like so many machines, 
    but to put their hearts into all their duties, and worship spiritually in 
    the whole course of their duty. It would be well to watch, but better still 
    to be "watching unto prayer" and praise. 
<p align="justify">When night settles down on a church the Lord has his 
    watchers and holy ones still guarding his truth, and these must not be 
    discouraged, but must bless the Lord even when the darkest hours draw on. Be 
    it ours to cheer them, and lay upon them this charge—to bless the Lord at 
    all times, and let his praise be continually in their mouths.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. Lift up your hands in the sanctuary.</p></b> In the 
    holy place they must be busy, full of strength, wide awake, energetic, and 
    moved with holy ardor. Hands, heart, and every other part of their manhood 
    must be upraised, elevated, and consecrated to the adoring service of the 
    Lord. 
<p align="justify">As the angels praise God day without night, so must the 
    angels of the churches be instant in season and out of season. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And bless the LORD.</p></b> This is their main business. They 
    are to bless men by their <i>teaching</i>, but they must yet more bless 
    Jehovah with their <i>worship</i>. Too often men look at public worship only 
    from the side of its usefulness to the people; but the other matter is of 
    even higher importance. <i>We must see to it that the Lord God is adored, 
    extolled, and had in reverence.</i> 
<p align="justify">For a second time the word "bless" is used, and applied 
    to Jehovah. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and let every other soul bless him. 
    There will be no drowsiness about even midnight devotion, if the heart is 
    set upon blessing God in Christ Jesus, which is the gospel translation of 
    God in the sanctuary.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3.</p></b> This last verse is the answer from the 
    temple to the pilgrims preparing to depart as the day breaks. It is the 
    ancient blessing of the high priest condensed, and poured forth upon each 
    individual pilgrim. 
<b>
<p align="justify">The LORD that made Heaven and earth bless you out of 
    Zion. </p></b>You are scattering and going to your homes one by one; may the 
    blessing come upon you one by one. You have been up to Jehovah's city and 
    temple at his bidding; return each one with such a blessing as only he can 
    give—divine, infinite, effectual, eternal. 
<p align="justify">You are not going away from Jehovah's works or glories, 
    for he made the Heaven above you and the earth on which you dwell. He is 
    your Creator, and he can bless you with untold mercies. He can create joy 
    and peace in your hearts, and make for you a new Heaven and a new earth. May 
    the Maker of all things make you to abound in blessings. </p>
<p align="justify">The blessing comes from the City of the Great King, from 
    his appointed ministers, by virtue of his covenant, and so it is said to be 
    "out of Zion." </p>
<p align="justify">To this day the Lord blesses each one of his people 
    through his church, his gospel, and the ordinances of his house. It is in 
    communion with the saints that we receive untold blessings. May each one of 
    us obtain yet more of the blessing which comes from the Lord alone. Zion 
    cannot bless us; the holiest ministers can only wish us a blessing; but 
    Jehovah can and will bless each one of his waiting people. So may it be at 
    this good hour.</p>
<p align="justify">Do we desire it? Let us then bless the Lord ourselves. 
    Let us do it a second time. Then we may confidently hope that the third time 
    we think of blessing, we shall find ourselves conscious receivers of it from 
    the ever blessed One. Amen.</p>
