          1. He has therefore, in His work of recapitulation, summed up all
          things, both waging war against our enemy, and crushing him who had at
          the beginning led us away captives in Adam, and trampled upon his
          head, as thou canst perceive in Genesis that God said to the serpent,
          "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy
          seed and her seed; He shall be on the watch for (observabit ) thy
          head, and thou on the watch for His heel." For from that time, He who
          should be born of a woman, [namely] from the Virgin, after the
          likeness of Adam, was preached as keeping watch for the head of the
          serpent. This is the seed of which the apostle says in the Epistle to
          the Galatians, "that the law of works was established until the seed
          should come to whom the promise was made." This fact is exhibited in a
          still clearer light in the same Epistle, where he thus speaks: "But
          when the fulness of time was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a
          woman." For indeed the enemy would not have been fairly vanquished,
          unless it had been a man [born] of a woman who conquered him. For it
          was by means of a woman that he got the advantage over man at first,
          setting himself up as man's opponent. And therefore does the Lord
          profess Himself to be the Son of man, comprising in Himself that
          original man out of whom the woman was fashioned (ex quo ea qu√¶
          secundum mulierem est plasmatio facta est), in order that, as our
          species went down to death through a vanquished man, so we may ascend
          to life again through a victorious one; and as through a man death
          received the palm [of victory] against us, so again by a man we may
          receive the palm against death.

          2. Now the Lord would not have recapitulated in Himself that ancient
          and primary enmity against the serpent, fulfilling the promise of the
          Creator (Demiurgi), and performing His command, if He had come from
          another Father. But as He is one and the same, who formed us at the
          beginning, and sent His Son at the end, the Lord did perform His
          command, being made of a woman, by both destroying our adversary, and
          perfecting man after the image and likeness of God. And for this
          reason He did not draw the means of confounding him from any other
          source than from the words of the law, and made use of the Father's
          commandment as a help towards the destruction and confusion of the
          apostate angel. Fasting forty days, like Moses and Elias, He
          afterwards hungered, first, in order that we may perceive that He was
          a real and substantial man -- for it belongs to a man to suffer hunger
          when fasting; and secondly, that His opponent might have an
          opportunity of attacking Him. For as at the beginning it was by means
          of food that [the enemy] persuaded man, although not suffering hunger,
          to transgress God's commandments, so in the end he did not succeed in
          persuading Him that was an hungered to take that food which proceeded
          from God. For, when tempting Him, he said, "If thou be the Son of God,
          command that these stones be made bread." But the Lord repulsed him by
          the commandment of the law, saying, "It is written, Man doth not live
          by bread alone." As to those words [of His enemy,] "If thou be the Son
          of God," [the Lord] made no remark; but by thus acknowledging His
          human nature He baffled His adversary, and exhausted the force of his
          first attack by means of His Father's word. The corruption of man,
          therefore, which occurred in paradise by both [of our first parents]
          eating, was done away with by [the Lord's] want of food in this world.
          But he, being thus vanquished by the law, endeavoured again to make an
          assault by himself quoting a commandment of the law. For, bringing Him
          to the highest pinnacle of the temple, he said to Him, "If thou art
          the Son of God, cast thyself down. For it is written, That God shall
          give His angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they shall
          bear thee up, lest perchance thou dash thy foot against a stone;" thus
          concealing a falsehood under the guise of Scripture, as is done by all
          the heretics. For that was indeed written, [namely], "That He hath
          given His angels charge concerning Him;" but "cast thyself down from
          hence" no Scripture said in reference to Him: this kind of persuasion
          the devil produced from himself. The Lord therefore confuted him out
          of the law, when He said, "It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt
          the Lord thy God;" pointing out by the word contained in the law that
          which is the duty of man, that he should not tempt God; and in regard
          to Himself, since He appeared in human form, [declaring] that He would
          not tempt the Lord his God. The pride of reason, therefore, which was
          in the serpent, was put to nought by the humility found in the man
          [Christ], and now twice was the devil conquered from Scripture, when
          he was detected as advising things contrary to God's commandment, and
          was shown to be the enemy of God by [the expression of] his thoughts.
          He then, having been thus signally defeated, and then, as it were,
          concentrating his forces, drawing up in order all his available power
          for falsehood, in the third place "showed Him all the kingdoms of the
          world, and the glory of them," saying, as Luke relates, "All these
          will I give thee, -- for they are delivered to me; and to whom I will,
          I give them, -- if thou wilt fall down and worship me." The Lord then,
          exposing him in his true character, says, "Depart, Satan; for it is
          written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou
          serve." He both revealed him by this name, and showed [at the same
          time] who He Himself was. For the Hebrew word "Satan" signifies an
          apostate. And thus, vanquishing him for the third time, He spurned him
          from Him finally as being conquered out of the law; and there was done
          away with that infringement of God's commandment which had occurred in
          Adam, by means of the precept of the law, which the Son of man
          observed, who did not transgress the commandment of God.

          3. Who, then, is this Lord God to whom Christ bears witness, whom no
          man shall tempt, whom all should worship, and serve Him alone? It is,
          beyond all manner of doubt, that God who also gave the law. For these
          things had been predicted in the law, and by the words (sententiam) of
          the law the Lord showed that the law does indeed declare the Word of
          God from the Father; and the apostate angel of God is destroyed by its
          voice, being exposed in his true colours, and vanquished by the Son of
          man keeping the commandment of God. For as in the beginning he enticed
          man to transgress his Maker's law, and thereby got him into his power;
          yet his power consists in transgression and apostasy, and with these
          he bound man [to himself]; so again, on the other hand, it was
          necessary that through man himself he should, when conquered, be bound
          with the same chains with which he had bound man, in order that man,
          being set free, might return to his Lord, leaving to him (Satan) those
          bonds by which he himself had been fettered, that is, sin. For when
          Satan is bound, man is set free; since "none can enter a strong man's
          house and spoil his goods, unless he first bind the strong man
          himself." The Lord therefore exposes him as speaking contrary to the
          word of that God who made all things, and subdues him by means of the
          commandment. Now the law is the commandment of God. The Man proves him
          to be a fugitive from and a transgressor of the law, an apostate also
          from God. After [the Man had done this], the Word bound him securely
          as a fugitive from Himself, and made spoil of his goods, -- namely,
          those men whom he held in bondage, and whom he unjustly used for his
          own purposes. And justly indeed is he led captive, who had led men
          unjustly into bondage; while man, who had been led captive in times
          past, was rescued from the grasp of his possessor, according to the
          tender mercy of God the Father, who had compassion on His own
          handiwork, and gave to it salvation, restoring it by means of the Word
          -- that is, by Christ -- in order that man might learn by actual proof
          that he receives incorruptibility not of himself, but by the free gift
          of God.
