          SUBJECT. It would be idle to inquire into the particular period when
          this delightful poem was composed, for there is nothing in its title
          or subject to assist us in the inquiry. The heading, "To the Chief
          Musician, a Psalm of David," informs us that David wrote it, and that
          it was committed to the Master of the service of song in the sanctuary
          for the use of the assembled worshipers. In his earliest days the
          psalmist, while keeping his father's flock, had devoted himself to the
          study of <i>God's two great books—nature and Scripture</i>; and he had
          so thoroughly entered into the spirit of these two only volumes in his
          library that he was able with a devout criticism to compare and
          contrast them, magnifying the excellency of the Author as seen in
          both.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How foolish and wicked are those who instead of accepting the two
          sacred tomes, and delighting to behold the same divine hand in each,
          spend all their wits in endeavoring to find discrepancies and
          contradictions. We may rest assured that the true "Vestiges of
          Creation" will never contradict Genesis, nor will a correct "Cosmos"
          be found at variance with the narrative of Moses.
          <i

          DIVISION. This song very distinctly divides itself into three parts,
          very well described by the translators in the ordinary heading of our

            Verse 1. "The heavens declare the glory of God."
          </p></b
        >The <i>book of nature </i>has three leaves, Heaven, earth, and sea, of
        which Heaven is the first and the most glorious, and by its aid we are
        able to see the beauties of the other two. Any book without its first
        page would be sadly imperfect, and especially the great Natural Bible,
        since its first pages, the sun, moon, and stars, supply light to the
        rest of the volume, and are thus the keys, without which the writing
        which follows would be dark and undiscerned. Man walking erect was
        evidently made to scan the skies, and he who begins to read creation by
        studying the stars begins the book at the right place.
        <p align="justify">
          The <b>heavens </b>are plural for their variety, comprising <br />
          the <i>watery </i>heavens with their clouds of countless forms, <br />
          the <i>aerial </i>heavens with their calms and tempests, <br />
          the <i>solar </i>heavens with all the glories of the day, and <br />
          the <i>starry </i>heavens with all the marvels of the night.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What the Heaven of heavens must be has not entered into the heart of
          man, but there in chief all things are telling the glory of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Every part of creation has more instruction in it than human mind will
          ever exhaust, but the <i>celestial </i>realm is peculiarly rich in
          spiritual lore.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The heavens <b>declare</b>, or are declaring, for the continuance of
          their testimony is intended by the participles employed. Every moment
          God's existence, power, wisdom and goodness, are being sounded abroad
          by the heavenly heralds which shine upon us from above. He who would
          guess at divine sublimity should gaze upward into the starry vault. He
          who would imagine infinity must peer into the boundless expanse. He
          who desires to see divine wisdom should consider the balancing of the
          orbs. He who would know divine fidelity must mark the regularity of
          the planetary motions. He who would attain some conceptions of divine
          power, greatness, and majesty, must estimate the forces of attraction,
          the magnitude of the fixed stars, and the brightness of the whole
          celestial train.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is not merely glory that the heavens declare, but
          <b> the glory of God</b>, for they deliver to us such unanswerable
          arguments for a conscious, intelligent, planning, controlling, and
          presiding Creator, that no unprejudiced person can remain unconvinced
          by them. The testimony given by the heavens is no mere hint, but a
          plain, unmistakable declaration; and it is a declaration of the most
          constant and abiding kind. Yet for all this, to what avail is the
          loudest declaration to a deaf man, or the clearest showing to one
          spiritually blind?

        <i
          >The expanse is full of the works of the Lord's skillful, creating
          hands</i
        >; hands being attributed to the great creating Spirit to set forth his
        care and workmanlike action, and to meet the poor comprehension of
        mortals. It is humbling to find that even when the most devout and
        elevated minds are desirous to express their loftiest thoughts of God,
        they must use words and metaphors drawn from the earth. We are children,
        and must each confess, "I think as a child, I speak as a child."
        <p align="justify">
          In the expanse above us God flies, as it were, his starry flag to show
          that the King is at home, and hangs out his escutcheon that atheists
          may see how he despises their denunciations of him.

          God-declaring book of nature; the mock-spirituality of some believers,

        should injure our faith in the other. Dr. M'Cosh has well said, "We have
        often mourned over the attempts made to set the works of God against the
        Word of God, and thereby excite, propagate, and perpetuate jealousies
        fitted to separate parties that ought to live in closest union. In
        particular, we have always regretted that endeavors should have been
        made to depreciate nature with a view of exalting revelation; it has
        always appeared to us to be nothing else than the degrading of one part
        of God's work, in the hope thereby of exalting and recommending another.
        <i>Let not science and religion be reckoned as opposing citadels</i>,
        frowning defiance upon each other, and their troops brandishing their
        armor in hostile attitude. They have too many common foes, if they would
        but think of it, in ignorance and prejudice, in passion and vice, under
        all their forms, to admit of their lawfully wasting their strength in a
        useless warfare with each other. Science has a foundation, and so has
        religion; let them unite their foundations, and the basis will be
        broader, and they will be two compartments of one great fabric reared to
        the glory of God. Let one be the outer and the other the inner court. In
        the one, let all look, and admire and adore; and in the other, let those
        who have faith kneel, and pray, and praise. Let the one be the sanctuary
        where human learning may present its richest incense as an offering to
        God, and the other the holiest of all, separated from it by a veil now
        rent in twain, and in which, on a blood-sprinkled mercy-seat, we pour
        out the love of a reconciled heart, and hear the oracles of the living

          The margin gives us another rendering, which is more literal, and
          involves less repetition; "no speech, no words, their voice is not
          heard;" that is to say, their teaching is not addressed to the ear,
          and is not uttered in articulate sounds. It is pictorial, and directed
          to the eye and heart; it touches not the sense by which faith comes,
          for faith comes by hearing. Jesus Christ is called the Word, for he is
          a far more distinct display of Godhead than all the heavens can
          afford. They are, after all, but dumb instructors; neither star nor
          sun can arrive at a word, but Jesus is the express image of Jehovah's
          person, and his name is the Word of God.

        Although the heavenly bodies move in solemn silence—yet in
        <i>reason's ear </i>they utter precious teachings. They give forth no
        literal words, but yet their instruction is clear enough to be so
        described. Horne says that the phrase employed indicates a language of
        signs, and thus we are told that the heavens speak by their significant
        actions and operations. Nature's words are like those of the deaf and
        dumb, but grace tells us plainly of the Father.
        <p align="justify">
          By <b>their line</b> is probably meant the measure of their domain
          which, together with their testimony, has gone out to the utmost end
          of the habitable earth. No man living beneath the copes of Heaven
          dwells beyond the bounds of the diocese of God's Court-preachers; it
          is easy to escape from the light of ministers, who are as stars in the
          right hand of the Son of Man; but even then men, with a conscience yet
          unseared, will find a <i>Nathan </i>to accuse them, a <i>Jonah </i>to
          warn them, and an <i> Elijah </i>to threaten them in the silent stars
          of night. To gracious souls the voices of the heavens are more
          influential far, they feel the sweet influences of the Pleiades, and
          are drawn towards their Father God by the bright bands of Orion.

        It is God's Word, rather than man's comment on God's Word which is made
        mighty with souls. When the <i>law drives </i>and the
        <i>gospel draws</i>, the action is different but the end is one, for by
        God's Spirit the soul is made to yield, and cries, "Turn me, and I shall
        be turned." Try men's depraved nature with philosophy and reasoning, and
        it laughs your efforts to scorn, but the Word of God soon works a
        transformation.
        <b> <p align="justify">"The testimony of the Lord is sure."</p></b>God
        bears his testimony against sin, and on behalf of righteousness. He
        testifies of our fall and of our restoration. This testimony is plain,
        decided, and infallible, and is to be accepted as sure. God's witness in
        his Word is so sure that we may draw solid comfort from it both for time
        and eternity, and so sure that no attacks made upon it however fierce or
        subtle can ever weaken its force. What a blessing that in a world of
        uncertainties we have something sure to rest upon!

          As a <i>law </i>or plan the Word of God converts, and then as a
          <i>testimony </i>it instructs. It is not enough for us to be converts,
          we must continue to be disciples. If we have felt the power of truth,
          we must go on to prove its certainty by experience. The perfection of
          the gospel converts, but its sureness edifies. If we would be edified
          it befits us not to stagger at the promise through unbelief, for a
          doubted gospel cannot make us wise, but truth of which we are assured
          will be our establishment.

        destroyed. Both in the Word and in the heart, when the Lord writes, he
        says with Pilate, "What I have written, I have written." He will make no
        erasures himself, much less allow others to do so. The revealed will of
        God is never changed; even Jesus came not to destroy but to fulfill, and
        even the ceremonial law was only changed as to its shadow, the substance
        intended by it is eternal. When the governments of nations are shaken
        with revolution, and ancient constitutions are being repealed, it is

        all of them together, or each of them apart—are manifestly just, and

        Jehovah, as revealed in the law, or illustrated in the history of his

        Bible truth is enriching to the soul in the highest degree. The metaphor

        desired with a miser's avidity, but with more than that. As spiritual
        treasure is more noble than mere material wealth, so should it be

        arising from a right understanding of the divine testimonies are of the
        most delightful order; earthly enjoyments are utterly contemptible, if

        our Remembrancer, and the Keeper of our Conscience. Alas, that so few
        men will take the warning so graciously given. None but servants of God
        will do so, for they alone regard their Master's will. Servants of God
        not only find his service delightful in itself, but they receive good
        recompense.

        conscience is in itself no slender reward for obedience. He who wears
        the herb called <i>heart's-ease </i>in his bosom is truly blessed.
        However, the main reward is yet to come, and the word here used hints as
        much, for it signifies the heel, as if the reward would come to us at
        the end of life when the work was done—not while the labor was in hand,
        but when it was gone and we could see the heel of it.

        A question which is its own answer. It rather requires a note of
        exclamation than of interrogation. By the law is the knowledge of sin,
        and
        <i

          and heinousness of his sins. He best knows himself who best knows the

        not know, rather than on the mount of congratulation as to what he does
        know. We have heard of a <i> comedy of errors</i>, but to a godly man
        this is more like a <i>tragedy</i>. Many books have a few lines of
        errata at the end, but our errata might well be as large as the volume
        if we could but have sense enough to see them. Augustine wrote in his
        older days a series of Retractations; ours might make a library if we
        had enough <i>grace </i>to be convinced of our mistakes and to confess
        them.

        <p align="justify">
          Secret sins, like private conspirators, must be hunted out, or they
          may do deadly mischief—it is well to be much in prayer concerning
          them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In the Lateran Council of the Church of Rome, a decree was passed that
          every true believer must confess his sins, all of them, once a year to
          the priest, and they affixed to it this declaration, that there is no
          hope of pardon but in complying with that decree.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What can equal the absurdity of such a decree as that? Do they suppose
          that they can count their sins as easily as they can count their
          fingers? Why, if we could receive pardon for all our sins by telling
          every sin we have committed in one hour, there is not one of us who
          would be able to enter Heaven, since, besides the sins that are known
          to us and that we may be able to confess—there are a vast mass of
          sins, which are as truly sins as those which we lament, but which are
          secret, and come not beneath our eye.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If we had eyes like those of God, we would think very differently of
          ourselves. The transgressions which we see and confess are but like
          the farmer's small samples which he brings to market, when he has left
          his granary full at home. We have but a very few sins which we can
          observe and detect, compared with those which are hidden from
          ourselves and unseen by our fellow-creatures.

        This earnest and humble prayer teaches us that
        <i>saints may fall into the worst of sins unless restrained by grace</i
        >, and that therefore they must watch and pray lest they enter into
        temptation.

          There is a natural proneness to sin in the best of men, and they must

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Presumptuous sins are peculiarly dangerous. All sins are great sins,
          but yet some sins are greater than others. Every sin has in it the
          very venom of rebellion, and is full of the essential marrow of
          traitorous rejection of God. But there are some sins which have in
          them a greater development of the essential mischief of rebellion, and
          which wear upon their faces more of the brazen pride which defies the
          Most High.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is wrong to suppose that because all sins will condemn us, that
          therefore one sin is not greater than another. The fact is, that while
          all transgression is a greatly grievous and sinful thing—yet there are
          some transgressions which have a deeper shade of blackness, and a more
          double scarlet-dyed hue of criminality than others.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The presumptuous sins of our text are the chief and worst of all
          sins—they rank head and foremost in the list of iniquities. It is
          remarkable that though an atonement was provided under the Jewish law
          for every kind of sin, there was this one exception: "But the soul
          that sins presumptuously shall have no atonement—it shall be cut off
          from the midst of the people."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          And now under the Christian dispensation, although in the sacrifice of
          our blessed Lord there is a great and precious atonement for
          presumptuous sins, whereby sinners who have erred in this manner are
          made clean—yet without doubt, presumptuous sinners, dying without
          pardon, must expect to receive a double portion of the wrath of God,
          and a more terrible portion of eternal punishment in the pit that is
          dug for the wicked. For this reason is David so
          <i
