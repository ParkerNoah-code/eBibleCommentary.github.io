        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.999)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, July 9th, 1871, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is
          grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:
          the grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the Spirit of the Lord
          bloweth upon it surely the people is grass. The grass withereth, the
          flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.| --
          Isaiah 40:6-8.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by
          the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. For all flesh is
          as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass
          withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: but the word of the
          Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is
          preached unto you.| -- 1 Peter 1:23-25.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE passage in Isaiah which I have just read in your hearing may be
          used as a very eloquent description of our mortality, and if a sermon
          should be preached from it upon the frailty of human nature, the
          brevity of life, and the certainty of death, no one could dispute the
          appropriateness of the text. Yet I venture to question whether such a
          discourse would strike the central teaching of the prophet. Something
          more than the decay of our material flesh is intended here; the carnal
          mind, the flesh in another sense, was intended by the Holy Ghost when
          he bade his messenger proclaim those words. It does not seem to me
          that a mere expression of the mortality of our race was needed in this
          place by the context; it would hardly keep pace with the sublime
          revelations which surround it, and would in some measure be a
          digression from the subject in hand. The notion that we are here
          simply and alone reminded of our mortality does not square with the
          New Testament exposition of it in Peter, which I have also placed
          before you as a text. There is another and more spiritual meaning here
          beside and beyond that which would be contained in the great and very
          obvious truth that all of us must die.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at the chapter in Isaiah with care. What is the subject of it? It
          is the divine consolation of Zion. Zion had been tossed to and fro
          with conflicts; she had been smarting under the result of sin. The
          Lord, to remove her sorrow, bids his prophets announce the coming of
          the long-expected Deliverer, the end and accomplishment of all her
          warfare and the pardon of all her iniquity. There is no doubt that
          this is the theme of the prophecy; and further, there is no sort of
          question about the next point, that the prophet goes on to foretell
          the coming of John the Baptist as the harbinger of the Messiah. We
          have no difficulty in the explanation of the passage, |Prepare ye the
          way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God;|
          for the New Testament again and again refers this to the Baptist and
          his ministry. The object of the coming of the Baptist and the mission
          of the Messiah, whom he heralded, was the manifestation of divine
          glory. Observe the fifth verse: |The glory of the Lord shall be
          revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the
          Lord hath spoken it.| Well, what next? Was it needful to mention man's
          mortality in this connection? We think not. But there is much more
          appropriateness in the succeeding verses, if we see their deeper
          meaning. Do they not mean this? In order to make room for the display
          of the divine glory in Christ Jesus and his salvation, there would
          come a withering of all the glory wherein man boasts himself: the
          flesh should be seen in its true nature as corrupt and dying, and the
          grace of God alone should be exalted. This would be seen under the
          ministry of John the Baptist first, and should be the preparatory work
          of the Holy Ghost in men's hearts, in all time, in order that the
          glory of the Lord should be revealed and human pride be for ever
          confounded.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Spirit blows upon the flesh, and that which seemed vigorous
          becomes weak, that which was fair to look upon is smitten with decay;
          the true nature of the flesh is thus discovered, its deceit is laid
          bare, its power is destroyed, and there is space for the dispensation
          of the ever-abiding word, and for the rule of the Great Shepherd,
          whose words are spirit and life. There is a withering wrought by the
          Spirit which is the preparation for the sowing and implanting by which
          salvation is wrought.
        </p>
        <p>
          The withering before the sowing was very marvellously fulfilled in the
          preaching of John the Baptist. Most appropriately he carried on his
          ministry in the desert, for a spiritual desert was all around him; he
          was the voice of one crying in the wilderness. It was not his work to
          plant, but to hew down. The fleshly religion of the Jews was then in
          its prime. Phariseeism stalked through the streets in all its pomp;
          men complacently rested in outward ceremonies only, and spiritual
          religion was at the lowest conceivable ebb. Here and there might be
          found a Simeon and an Anna, but for the most part men knew nothing of
          spiritual religion, but said in their hearts: |We have Abraham to our
          father,| and this is enough. What a stir he made when he called the
          lordly Pharisees a generation of vipers! How he shook the nation with
          the declaration, |Now also the axe is laid unto the root of the
          trees|! Stern as Elias, his work was to level the mountains, and lay
          low every lofty imagination. That word, |Repent,| was as a scorching
          wind to the verdure of self-righteousness, a killing blast for the
          confidence of ceremonialism. His food and his dress called for fasting
          and mourning. The outward token of his ministry declared the death
          amid which he preached, as he buried in the waters of Jordan those who
          came to him. |Ye must die and be buried, even as he who is to come
          will save by death and burial.| This was the meaning of the emblem
          which he set before the crowd. His typical act was as thorough in its
          teaching as were his words; and as if that were not enough, he warned
          them of a yet more searching and trying baptism with the Holy Ghost
          and with fire, and of the coming of one whose fan was in his hand,
          thoroughly to purge his floor. The Spirit in John blew as the rough
          north wind, searching and withering, and made him to be a destroyer of
          the vain gloryings of a fleshly religion, that the spiritual faith
          might be established.
        </p>
        <p>
          When our Lord himself actually appeared, he came into a withered land,
          whose glories had all departed. Old Jesse's stem was bare, and our
          Lord was the branch which grew out of his root. The scepter had
          departed from Judah, and the lawgiver from between his feet, when
          Shiloh came. An alien sat on David's throne, and the Roman called the
          covenant-land his own. The lamp of prophecy burned but dimly, even if
          it had not utterly gone out. No Isaiah had arisen of late to console
          them, nor even a Jeremiah to lament their apostacy. The whole economy
          of Judaism was as a worn-out vesture; it had waxed old, and was ready
          to vanish away. The priesthood was disarranged. Luke tells us that
          Annas and Caiaphas were high priests that year -- two in a year or at
          once, a strange setting aside of the laws of Moses. All the
          dispensation which gathered around the visible, or as Paul calls it,
          the |worldly| sanctuary, was coming to a close; and when our Lord had
          finished his work, the veil of the temple was rent in twain, the
          sacrifices were abolished, the priesthood of Aaron was set aside, and
          carnal ordinances were abrogated, for the Spirit revealed spiritual
          things. When he came who was made a priest, |not after the law of a
          carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life,| there was
          |a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and
          unprofitableness thereof.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Such are the facts of history; but I am not about to dilate upon them:
          I am coming to your own personal histories -- to the experience of
          every child of God. In every one of us it must be fufilled that all
          that is of the flesh in us, seeing it is but as grass, must be
          withered, and the comeliness thereof must be destroyed. The Spirit of
          God, like the wind, must pass over the field of our souls, and cause
          our beauty to be as a fading flower. He must so convince us of sin,
          and so reveal ourselves to ourselves, that we shall see that the flesh
          profiteth nothing; that our fallen nature is corruption itself, and
          that |they who are in the flesh cannot please God.| There must be
          brought home to us the sentence of death upon our former legal and
          carnal life, that the incorruptible seed of the word of God, implanted
          by the Holy Ghost, may be in us, and abide in us for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          The subject of this morning is the withering work of the Spirit upon
          the souls of men, and when we have spoken upon it, we shall conclude
          with a few words upon the implanting work, which always follows where
          this withering work has been performed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Turning then to THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT IN CAUSING THE GOODLINESS OF
          THE FLESH TO FADE, let us, first, observe that the work of the Holy
          Spirit upon the soul of man in withering up that which is of the
          flesh, is very unexpected. You will observe in our text, that even the
          speaker himself, though doubtless one taught of God, when he was
          bidden to cry, said, |What shall I cry?| Even he did not know that in
          order to the comforting of God's people, there must first be
          experienced a preliminary visitation. Many preachers of God's gospel
          have forgotten that the law is the schoolmaster to bring men to
          Christ. They have sown on the unbroken fallow ground and forgotten
          that the plough must break the clods. We have seen too much of trying
          to sew without the sharp needle of the Spirit's convincing power.
          Preachers have labored to make Christ precious to those who think
          themselves rich and increased in goods: and it has been labor in vain.
          It is our duty to preach Jesus Christ even to self-righteous sinners,
          but it is certain that Jesus Christ will never be accepted by them
          while they hold themselves in high esteem. Only the sick will welcome
          the physician. It is the work of the Spirit of God to convince men of
          sin, and until they are convinced of sin, they will never be led to
          seek the righteousuess which is of God by Jesus Christ. I am
          persuaded, that wherever there is a real work of grace in any soul, it
          begins with a pulling down: the Holy Ghost does not build on the old
          foundation. Wood, hay, and stubble will not do for him to build upon.
          He will come as the fire, and cause a conflagration of all proud
          nature's Babels. He will break our bow and cut our spear in sunder,
          and burn our chariot in the fire. When every sandy foundation is gone,
          then, but not till then, behold he will lay in our souls the great
          foundation stone, chosen of God, and precious. The awakened sinner,
          when he asks that God would have mercy upon him, is much astonished to
          find that, instead of enjoying a speedy peace, his soul is bowed down
          within him under a sense of divine wrath. Naturally enough he
          enquires: |Is this the answer to my prayer? I prayed the Lord to
          deliver me from sin and self, and is this the way in which he deals
          with me? I said, Hear me,' and behold he wounds me with the wounds of
          a cruel one. I said, Clothe me,' and lo! He has torn off from me the
          few rags which covered me before, and my nakedness stares me in the
          face. I said, Wash me,' and behold he has plunged me in the ditch till
          mine own clothes do abhor me. Is this the way of grace?| Sinner, be
          not surprised: it is even so. Perceivest thou not the cause of it? How
          canst thou be healed while the proud flesh is in thy wound? It must
          come out. It is the only way to heal thee permanently: it would be
          folly to film over thy sore, or heal thy flesh, and leave the leprosy
          within thy bones. The great physician will cut with his sharp knife
          till the corrupt flesh be removed, for only thus can a sure healing
          work be wrought in thee. Dost thou not see that it is divinely wise
          that before thou art clothed thou shouldst be stripped! What, wouldst
          thou have Christ's lustrous righteousness outside whiter than any
          fuller can make it, and thine own filthy rags concealed within? Nay,
          man; they must be put away; not a single thread of thine own must be
          left upon thee. It cannot be that God should cleanse thee until he has
          made thee see somewhat of thy defilement; for thou wouldst never value
          the precious blood which cleanses us from all sin if thou hadst not
          first of all been made to mourn that thou art altogether an unclean
          thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The convincing work of the Spirit, wherever it comes, is unexpected,
          and even to the child of God in whom this process has still to go on,
          it is often startling. We begin again to build that which the Spirit
          of God had destroyed. Having begun in the spirit, we act as if we
          would be made perfect in the flesh; and then when our mistaken
          upbuilding has to be levelled with the earth, we are almost as
          astonished as we were when first the scales fell from our eyes. In
          some such condition as this was Newton when he wrote: --
        </p>
        <p>|I asked the Lord that I might grow</p>
        <p>In faith and love and every grace,</p>
        <p>Might more of his salvation know,</p>
        <p>And seek more earnestly his face.</p>
        <p>Twas he who taught me thus to pray,</p>
        <p>And he, I trust, has answered prayer;</p>
        <p>But it has been in such a way</p>
        <p>As almost drove me to despair.</p>
        <p>I hop'd that in some favour'd hour,</p>
        <p>At once he'd answer my request,</p>
        <p>And by his love's constraining power</p>
        <p>Subdue my sins, and give me rest.</p>
        <p>Instead of this, he made me feel</p>
        <p>The hidden evils of my heart.</p>
        <p>And let the angry powers of hell</p>
        <p>Assault my soul in ev'ry part.|</p>
        <p>
          Ah, marvel not, for thus the Lord is wont to answer his people. The
          voice which saith, |Comfort ye, comfort ye my people,| achieves its
          purpose by first making them hear the cry, |All flesh is grass, and
          all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field.|
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Furthermore, this withering is after the usual order of the divine
          operation. If we consider well the way of God, we shall not be
          atonished that he beginneth with his people by terrible things in
          righteousness. Observe the method of creation. I will not venture upon
          any dogmatic theory of geology, but there seems to be every
          probability that this world has been fitted up and destroyed, refitted
          and then destroyed again, many times before the last arranging of it
          for the habitation of men. |In the beginning God created the heaven
          and the earth;| then came a long interval, and at length, at the
          appointed time, during seven days, the Lord prepared the earth for the
          human race. Consider then the state of matters when the great
          architect began his work. What was there in the beginning? Originally,
          nothing. When he commanded the ordering of the earth how was it? |The
          earth was without form and void; and darkness was upon the face of the
          deep.| There was no trace of another's plan to interfere with the
          great architect. |With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him,
          and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and
          showed to him the way of understanding.| He received no contribution
          of column or pillar towards the temple which he intended to build. The
          earth was, as the Hebrew puts it, Tohu and Bohu, disorder and
          confusion -- in a word, chaos. So it is in the new creation. When the
          Lord new creates us, he borrows nothing from the old man, but makes
          all things new. He does not repair and add a new wing to the old house
          of our depraved nature, but he builds a new temple for his own praise.
          We are spiritually without form and empty, and darkness is upon the
          face of our heart, and his word comes to us, saying, |Light be,| and
          there is light, and ere long life and every precious thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          To take another instance from the ways of God. When man has fallen,
          when did the Lord bring him the gospel? The first whisper of the
          gospel, as you know, was, |I will put enmity between thee and the
          woman, between thy seed and her seed. He shall bruise thy head.| That
          whisper came to man shivering in the presence of his Maker, having
          nothing more to say by way of excuse; but standing guilty before the
          Lord. When did the Lord God clothe our parents? Not until first of all
          he had put the question, |Who told thee that thou wast naked?| Not
          until the fig-leaves had utterly failed did the Lord bring in the
          covering skin of the sacrifice, and wrap them in it. If you will
          pursue the meditation upon the acts of God with men, you will
          constantly see the same thing. God has given us a wonderful type of
          salvation in Noah's ark; but Noah was saved in that ark in connection
          with death; he himself, as it were, immured alive in a tomb, and all
          the world besides left to destruction. All other hope for Noah was
          gone, and thee the ark rose upon the waters. Remember the redemption
          of the children of Israel out of Egypt: it occurred when they were in
          the saddest plight, and their cry went up to heaven by reason of their
          bondage. When no arm brought salvation, then with a high hand and an
          outstretched arm the Lord brought forth his people. Everywhere before
          the salvation there comes the humbling of the creature, the overthrow
          of human hope. As in the back woods of America before there can be
          tillage, the planting of cities, the arts of civilization, and the
          transactions of commerce, the woodman's axe must hack and hew: the
          stately trees of centuries must fall: the roots must be burned, the
          odd reign of nature disturbed. The old must go before the new can
          come. Even thus the Lord takes away the first, that he may establish
          the second. The first heaven and the first earth must pass away, or
          there cannot be a new heaven and a new earth. Now, as it has been
          outwardly, we ought to expect that it would be the same within us and
          when these witherings and facings occur in our souls, we should only
          say |It is the Lord, let him do as seemeth him good.|
        </p>
        <p>
          3. I would have you notice, thirdly, that we are taught in our text
          how universal this process is in its range over the hearts of all
          those upon whom the Spirit works. The withering is a withering of
          what? Of part of the flesh and some portion of its tendencies? Nay,
          observe, |All flesh is grass; and all the goodliness thereof| -- the
          very choice and pick of it -- |is as the flower of the field,| and
          what happens to the grass? Does any of it live? |The grass withereth,|
          all of it. The flower, will not that abide? So fair a thing, has not
          that an immortality? No, it fades: it utterly falls away. So wherever
          the Spirit of God breathes on the soul of man, there is a withering of
          everything that is of the flesh, and it is seen that to be carnally
          minded is death. Of course, we all know and confess that where there
          is a work of grace, there must be a destruction of our delight in the
          pleasures of the flesh. When the Spirit of God breathes on us, that
          which was sweet becomes bitter; that which was bright becomes dim. A
          man cannot love sin and yet possess the life of God. If he takes
          pleasure in fleshly joys wherein he once delighted, he is still what
          he was: he mince the things of the flesh, and therefore he is after
          the flesh, and he shall die. The world and the lusts thereof are to
          the unregenerate as beautiful as the meadows in spring, when they are
          bedecked with flowers, but to the regenerate soul they are a
          wilderness, a salt land, and not inhabited. Of those very things
          wherein we once took delight we say, |Vanity of vanities; all is
          vanity.| We cry to be delivered from the poisonous joys of earth, we
          loathe them, and wonder that we could once riot in them. Beloved
          hearers, do you know what this kind of withering means? Have you seen
          the lusts of the flesh, and the pomps and the pleasures thereof all
          fade away before your eyes? It must be so, or the Spirit of God has
          not visited your soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          But mark, wherever the Spirit of God comes, he destroys the goodliness
          and flower of the flesh; that is to say, our righteousness withers as
          our sinfulness. Before the Spirit comes we think ourselves as good as
          the best. We say, |All these commandments have I kept from my youth
          up,| and we superciliously ask, |What lack I yet?| Have we not been
          moral? Nay, have we not even been religious? We confess that we may
          have committed faults, but we think them very venial, and we venture,
          in our wicked pride, to imagine that, after all, we are not so vile as
          the word of God would lead us to think. Ah, my dear hearer, when the
          Spirit of God blows on the comeliness of thy flesh, its beauty will
          fade as a leaf, and thou wilt have quite another idea of thyself thou
          wilt then find no language too severe in which to describe thy past
          character. Searching deep into thy motives, and investigating that
          which moved thee to thine actions, thou wilt see so much of evil, that
          thou wilt cry with the publican, |God be merciful to me, a sinner!|
        </p>
        <p>
          Where the Holy Ghost has withered up in us our self-righteousness, he
          has not half completed his work; there is much more to be destroyed
          yet, and among the rest, away must go our boasted power of resolution.
          Most people conceive that they can turn to God whenever they resolve
          to do so. |I am a man of such strength of mind,| says one, |that if I
          made up my mind to be religious, I should be without difficulty.|
          |Ah,| saith another volatile spirit, |I believe that one of these days
          I can correct the errors of the past, and commence a new life.| Ah,
          dear hearers, the resolutions of the flesh are goodly flowers, but
          they must all fade. When visited by the Spirit of God, we find that
          even when the will is present with us, how to perform that which we
          would we find not; yea, and we discover that our will is averse to all
          that is good, and that naturally we will not come unto Christ that we
          may have life. What poor frail things resolutions are when seen in the
          light of God's Spirit!
        </p>
        <p>
          Still the man will say, |I believe I have, after all, within myself an
          enlightened conscience and an intelligence that will guide me aright.
          The light of nature I will use, and I do not doubt that if I wander
          somewhat I shall find my way back again.| Ah, man! thy wisdom, which
          is the very flower of thy nature, what is it but folly, though thou
          knowest it not? Unconverted and unrenewed, thou art in God's sight no
          wiser than the wild ass's colt. I wish thou wert in thine own esteem
          humbled as a little child at Jesus' feet, and made to cry, |Teach thou
          me.|
        </p>
        <p>
          When the withering wind of the Spirit moves over the carnal mind, it
          reveals the death of the flesh in all respects, especially in the
          matter of power towards that which is good. We then learn that word of
          our Lord: |Without me ye can do nothing.| When I was seeking the Lord,
          I not only believed that I could not pray without divine help, but I
          felt in my very soul that I could not. Then I could not even feel
          aright, or mourn as I would, or groan as I would. I longed to long
          more after Christ; but, alas! I could not even feel that I needed him
          as I ought to feel it. This heart was then as hard as adamant, as dead
          as those that rot in their graves. Oh, what would I at times have
          given for a tear! I wanted to repent, but could not; longed to
          believe, but could not; I felt bound, hampered, and paralysed. This is
          a humbling revelation of God's Holy Spirit, but a needful one; for the
          faith of the flesh is not the faith of God's elect. The faith which
          justifies the soul is the gift of God and not of ourselves. That
          repentance which is the work of the flesh will need to be repented of.
          The flower of the flesh must wither; only the seed of the Spirit will
          produce fruit unto perfection. The heirs of heaven are born not of
          blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of man, but of God. If the
          work in us be not the Spirit's working, but our own, it will droop and
          die when most we require its protection; and its end will be as the
          grass which to-day is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. You see, then, the universality of this withering work within us,
          but I beg you also to notice the completeness of it. The grass, what
          does it do? Droop? nay, wither. The dower of the field: what of that?
          Does it hang its head a little? No, according to Isaiah it fades; and
          according to Peter it falleth away. There is no reviving it with
          showers, it has come to its end. Even thus are the awakened led to see
          that in their flesh there dwelleth no good thing. What dying and
          withering work some of God's servants have had in their souls! Look at
          John Bunyan, as he describes himself in his |Grace Abounding!| For how
          many months and even years was the Spirit engaged in writing death
          upon all that was the old Bunyan, in order that he might become by
          grace a new man fitted to track the pilgrims along their heavenly way.
          We have not all endured the ordeal so long, but in every child of God
          there must be a death to sin, to the law, and to self, which must be
          fully accomplished ere he is perfected in Christ and taken to heaven.
          Corruption cannot inherit incorruption; it is through the Spirit that
          we mortify the deeds of the body, and therefore live. But cannot the
          fleshly mind be improved? By no means; for |the carnal mind is enmity
          against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed
          can be.| Cannot you improve the old nature? No; |ye must be born
          again.| Can it not be taught heavenly things? No. |The natural man
          receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are
          foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are
          spiritually discerned.| There is nothing to be done with the old
          nature but to let it be laid in the grave; it must be dead, and
          buried, and when it is so, then the incorruptible seed that liveth and
          abideth for ever will develop gloriously, the fruit of the new birth
          will come to maturity, and grace shall be exalted in glory. The old
          nature never does improve, it is as earthly, and sensual, and devilish
          in the saint of eighty years of age as it was when first he came to
          Christ; it is unimproved and unimprovable; towards God it is enmity
          itself: every imagination of the thoughts of the heart is evil, and
          that continually. The old nature called |the flesh lusteth against the
          Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the
          one to the other,| neither can there be peace between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Let us further notice that all this withering work in the soul is
          very painful. As you read these verses do they not strike you as
          having a very funereal tone? |All flesh is grass, and all the
          goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field: the grass withereth,
          the flower fadeth.| This is mournful work, but it must be done. I
          think those who experience much of it when they first come to Christ
          have great reason to be thankful. Their course in life will, in all
          probability, be much brighter and happier, for I have noticed that
          persons who are converted very easily, and come to Christ with but
          comparatively little knowledge of their own depravity, have to learn
          it afterwards, and they remain for a long time babes in Christ, and
          are perplexed with masters that would not have troubled them if they
          had experienced a deeper work at first. No, sir; if grace has begun to
          build in your soul and left any of the old walls of self-trust
          standing, they will have to come down sooner or later. You may
          congratulate yourself upon their remaining, but it is a false
          congratulation, your glorying is not good. I am sure of this, that
          Christ will never put a new piece upon an old garment, or new wine in
          old bottles: he knows the rent would be worse in the long run, and the
          bottles would burst. All that is of nature's spinning must be
          unravelled. The natural building must come down, lath and plaster,
          roof and foundation, and we must have a house not made with hands. It
          was a great mercy for our city of London that the great fire cleared
          away all the old buildings which were the lair of the plague, a far
          healthier city was then built; and it is a great mercy for a man when
          God sweeps right away all his own righteousness and strength, when he
          makes him feel that he is nothing and can be nothing, and drives him
          to confess that Christ must be all in all, and that his only strength
          lies in the eternal might of the ever-blessed Spirit. Sometimes in a
          house of business an old system has been going on for years, and it
          has caused much confusion, and allowed much dishonesty. You come in as
          a new manager, and you adopt an entirely new plan. Now, try if you
          can, and graft your method on to the old system. How it will worry
          you! Year after year you say to yourself, |I cannot work it: if I had
          swept the whole away and started afresh, clear from the beginning, it
          would not have given me one-tenth of the trouble.| God does not intend
          to graft the system of grace upon corrupt nature, nor to make the new
          Adam grow out of the old Adam, but he intends to teach us this: |Ye
          are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.| Salvation is not
          of the flesh but of the Lord alone; that which is born of the flesh is
          only flesh at the best; and only that which is born of the Spirit is
          spirit. It must be the Spirit's work altogether, or it is not what God
          will accept.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, brethren, that although this is painful it is inevitable. I
          have already entrenched upon this, and shown you how necessary it is
          that all of the old should be taken away; but let me further remark
          that it is inevitable that the old should go, because it is in itself
          corruptible. Why does the grass wither? Because it is a withering
          thing. |Its root is ever in its we, and it must die.| How could it
          spring out of the earth, and be immortal? It is no amaranth: it blooms
          not in Paradise: it grows in a soil on which the curse has fallen.
          Every supposed good thing that grows out of your own self, is like
          yourself, mortal, and it must die. The seeds of corruption are in all
          the fruits of manhood's tree; let them be as fair to look upon as
          Eden's clusters, they must decay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, it would never do, my brother, that there should be
          something of the flesh in our salvation and something of the Spirit;
          for if it were so there would be a division of the honor. Hitherto the
          praises of God; beyond this my own praises. If I were to win heaven
          partly through what I had done, and partly through what Christ had
          done, and if the energy which sanctified me was in a measure my own,
          and in a measure divine, they that divide the work shall divide the
          reward, and the songs of heaven while they would be partly to Jehovah
          must also be partly to the creature. But it shall not be. Down, proud
          flesh! Down! I say. Though thou cleanse and purge thyself as thou
          mayst, thou art to the core corrupt though thou labor unto weariness,
          thou buildest wood that will be burned, and stubble that will be
          turned to ashes. Give up thine own self-confidence, and let the work
          be, and the merit be where the honor shall be, namely, with God alone.
          It is inevitable, then, that there should be all this withering.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. This last word by way of comfort to any that are passing through
          the process we are describing, and I hope some of you are. It gives me
          great joy when I hear that you unconverted ones are very miserable,
          for the miseries which the Holy Spirit works are always the prelude to
          happiness. It is the Spirit's work to wither. I rejoice in our
          translation, |Because the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it.| It is
          true the passage may be translated, |The wind of the Lord bloweth upon
          it.| One word, as you know, is used in the Hebrew both for |wind| and
          |Spirit,| and the same is true of the Greek; but let us retain the old
          translation here, for I conceive it to be the real meaning of the
          text. The Spirit of God it is that withers the flesh. It is not the
          devil that killed my self-righteousness. I might be afraid if it were:
          nor was it myself that humbled myself by a voluntary and needless
          self-degradation, but it was the Spirit of God. Better to be broken in
          pieces by the Spirit of God, than to be made whole by the flesh! What
          doth the Lord say? |I kill.| But what next? |I make alive.| He never
          makes any alive but those he kills. Blessed be the Holy Ghost when he
          kills me, when he drives the sword through the very bowels of my own
          merits and myself-confidence, for then he will make me alive. |I
          wound, and I heal.| He never heals those whom he has not wounded. Then
          blessed be the hand that wounds; let it go on wounding; let it cut and
          tear; let it lay bare to me myself at my very worst, that I may be
          driven to self-despair, and may fall back upon the free mercy of God,
          and receive it as a poor, guilty, lost, helpless, undone sinner, who
          casts himself into the arms of sovereign grace, knowing that God must
          give all, and Christ must be all, and the Spirit must work all, and
          man must be as clay in the potter's hands, that the Lord may do with
          him as seemeth trim good. Rejoice, dear brother, how ever low you are
          brought, for if the Spirit humbles you he means no evil, but he
          intends infinite good to your soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, let us close with a few sentences concerning THE
          IMPLANTATION.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Peter, although the flesh withers, and the flower thereof
          falls away, yet in the children of God there is an unwithering
          something of another kind. |Being born again, not of corruptible seed,
          but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for
          ever.| |The word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word
          which by the gospel is preached unto you.| Now, the gospel is of use
          to us because it is not of human origin. If it were of the flesh, all
          it could do for us would not land us beyond the flesh; but the gospel
          of Jesus Christ is super-human, divine, and spiritual. In its
          conception it was of God; its great gift, even the Savior, is a divine
          gift; and all its teachings are full of deity. If you, my hearer,
          believe a gospel which you have thought out for yourself, or a
          philosophical gospel which comes from the brain of man, it is of the
          flesh, and will wither, and you will die, and be lost through trusting
          in it. The only word that can bless you and be a seed in your soul
          must be the living and incorruptible word of the eternal Spirit. Now
          this is the incorruptible word, that |God was made flesh and dwelt
          among us;| that |God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto
          himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.| This is the
          incorruptible word, that |Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ
          is born of God.| |He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he
          that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed
          in the name of the only begotten Son of God.| |God hath given to us
          eternal life, and this life is in his Son.| Now, brethren, this is the
          seed; but before it can grow in your soul, it must be planted there by
          the Spirit. Do you receive it this morning? Then the Holy Spirit
          implants it in your soul. Do you leap up to it, and say, |I believe
          it! I grasp it! On the incarnate God I fix my hope; the
          substitutionary sacrifice, the complete atonement of Christ is all my
          confidence; I am reconciled to God by the blood of Jesus.| Then you
          possess the living seed within your soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what is the result of it? Why, then there comes, according to the
          text, a new life into us, as the result of the indwelling of the
          living word, and our being born again by it. A new life it is; it is
          not the old nature putting out its better parts; not the old Adam
          refining and purifying itself, and rising to something better. No;
          have we not said aforetime that the flesh withers and the flower
          thereof fades? It is an entirely new life. Ye are as much new
          creatures at your regeneration, as if you had never existed, and had
          been for the first time created. |Old things are passed away; behold,
          all things are become new.| The child of God is beyond and above other
          men. Other men do not possess the life which he has received. They are
          but duplex -- body and soul have they. He is of triple nature -- he is
          spirit, soul, and body. A fresh principle, a spark of the divine life
          has dropped into his soul; he is no longer a natural or carnal man,
          but he has become a spiritual man, understanding spiritual things and
          possessing a life far superior to anything that belongs to the rest of
          mankind. O that God, who has withered in the souls of any of you that
          which is of the flesh, may speedily grant you the new birth through
          the Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now observe, to close, wherever this new life comes through the word,
          it is incorruptible, it lives and abides for ever. To get the good
          seed out of a true believer's heart and to destroy the new nature in
          him, is a thing attempted by earth and hell, but never yet achieved.
          Pluck the sun out of the firmament, and you shall not even then be
          able to pluck grace out of a regenerate heart. It |liveth and abideth
          for ever,| saith the text; it neither can corrupt of itself nor be
          corrupted. |It sinneth not, because it is born of God.| |I give unto
          them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man
          pluck them out of my hand.| |The water that I shall give him shall be
          in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.| You have a
          natural life -- that will die, it is of the flesh. You have a
          spiritual life -- of that it is written: |Whosoever liveth and
          believeth in me shall never die.| You have now within you the noblest
          and truest immortality: you must live as God liveth, in peace and joy,
          and happiness. But oh, remember, dear hearer, if you have not this you
          |shall not see life.| What then -- shall you be annihilated? Ah! no,
          but |the wrath of the Lord is upon you.| You shall exist, though you
          shall not live. Of life you shall know nothing, for that is the gift
          of God in Christ Jesus; but of an everlasting death, full of torment
          and anguish, you shall be the wretched heritor -- |the wrath of God
          abideth on him.| You shall be cast into |the lake of fire, which is
          the second death.| You shall be one of those whose |worm dieth not,
          and whose fire is not quenched.| May God, the ever-blessed Spirit,
          visit you! If he be now striving with you, O quench not his divine
          flame! Trifle not with any holy thought you have. If this morning you
          must confess that you are not born again, be humbled by it. Go and
          seek mercy of the Lord, entreat him to deal graciously with you and
          save you. Many who have had nothing but moonlight have prized it, and
          ere long they have had sunlight. Above all, remember what the
          quickening seed is, and reverence it when you hear it preached, |for
          this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.| Respect
          it, and receive it. Remember that the quickening seed is all wrapped
          up in this sentence: |Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt
          be saved.| |He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved; but he
          that believeth not shall be damned.|
        </p>
        <p>The Lord bless you, for Jesus' sake. Amen.</p>
