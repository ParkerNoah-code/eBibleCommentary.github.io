 </p>
</b></font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">TITLE. To the Chief Musician on Neginoth. </p>
<p align="justify">The Precentor is here instructed to perform this song to 
    the music of stringed instruments. The master of the harpers was called for 
    his most skillful minstrelsy, and truly the song is worthy of the sweetest 
    sounds that strings can yield. A Psalm or Song of Asaph. The style and 
    matter indicate the same hand as that which wrote the preceding; and it is 
    an admirable arrangement which placed the two in juxtaposition. Faith in the 
    75th Psalm sung of victories to come, and here it sings of triumphs 
    achieved. The present Psalm is a most jubilant war song, a paean to the King 
    of kings, the hymn of a theocratic nation to its divine ruler. We have no 
    need to mark divisions in a song where the unity is so well preserved.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. In Judah is God known.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">If unknown in all the world beside, he has so revealed 
    himself to <i>his people </i>by his deeds of grace, that he is no unknown 
    God to them. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">His name is great in Israel. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">To be <i>known</i>, in the Lord's case, is to be <i>
    honored</i>: those who know his name admire the greatness of it. Although 
    Judah and Israel were unhappily divided politically—yet the godly of both 
    nations were agreed concerning Jehovah their God; and truly whatever schisms 
    may mar the visible church, the saints always "appear as one" in magnifying 
    the Lord their God. Dark is the outer world—but within the favored circle 
    Jehovah is revealed, and is the adoration of all who behold him. <i>The 
    world knows him not, and therefore blasphemes him</i>—but his church is full 
    of ardor to proclaim his fame unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. In Salem also is his tabernacle.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">In the peaceful city he dwells, and the peace is 
    perpetuated, because there his sacred tent is pitched. The church of God is 
    the place where the Lord abides and he is to her the Lord and giver of 
    peace. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And his dwelling place in Zion.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Upon the chosen hill was the palace of Israel's Lord. It 
    is the glory of the church that the Redeemer inhabits her by his Holy 
    Spirit. Vain are the assaults of the enemy, for they attack not us alone—but 
    the Lord himself. Immanuel, God with us, finds a home among his people, who 
    then shall work us ill?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. There he broke the arrows of the bow. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Without leaving his tranquil abode, he sent forth his 
    word and snapped the arrows of his enemies before they could shoot them. The 
    idea is sublime, and marks the ease, completeness, and rapidity of the 
    divine action. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The shield, and the sword, and the battle.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Every weapon, offensive and defensive, the Lord dashed in 
    pieces; death bearing bolts and life preserving armor were alike of no avail 
    when the Breaker sent forth his word of power. In the spiritual conflicts of 
    this and every age, the like will be seen; no weapon that is formed against 
    the church shall prosper, and every tongue that rises against her in 
    judgment, she shall condemn. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Selah.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">It is fit that we should dwell on so soul stirring a 
    theme, and give the Lord our grateful adoration—hence a pause is inserted.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. You are more glorious and excellent than the 
    mountains of prey. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Far more is Jehovah to be extolled than all the invading 
    powers which sought to oppress his people, though they were for power and 
    greatness comparable to mountains. Assyria had pillaged the nations until it 
    had become rich with mountains of spoil, this was talked of among men as 
    glory—but the psalmist despised such renown, and declares that the Lord was 
    far more illustrious.<i> What are the honors of war but brags of murder? 
    What the fame of conquerors but the reek of manslaughter? </i>But the Lord 
    is glorious in holiness, and his terrible deeds are done in justice for the 
    defense of the weak and the deliverance of the enslaved. Mere power may be 
    glorious—but it is not excellent: when we behold the mighty acts of the 
    Lord, we see a perfect blending of the two qualities.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. The stouthearted are spoiled.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">They came to spoil, and lo! they are spoiled themselves. 
    Their stout hearts are cold in death, the angel of the pestilence has dried 
    up their life blood, their very heart is taken from them. They have slept 
    their sleep. Their last sleep—the sleep of death. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And none of the men of might have found their hands.</p></b>

<p align="justify">Their arms are palsied, they cannot lift a finger, for 
    the rigor of death has stiffened them. What a scene was that when 
    Sennacherib's host was utterly destroyed in one night. The hands which were 
    furious to pull down Jerusalem, could not even be raised from the sod, the 
    most valiant warriors were as weak as the palsied cripples at the temple 
    gate, yes, their eyes they could not open, a deep sleep sealed their vision 
    in everlasting darkness. O God, how awesome are you! Thus shall you fight 
    for us, and in the hour of peril overthrow the enemies of your gospel. 
    Therefore in you will we trust and not be afraid.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. At your rebuke.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">A word accomplished all, there was no need of a single 
    blow. O God of Jacob. God of your wrestling people, who again like their 
    father supplant their enemy; God of the covenant and the promise, you have 
    in this gracious character fought for your elect nation. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.</p></b>

<p align="justify">They will neither neigh nor rattle again; still are the 
    trampings of the horses and the crash of the cars; the calvary no more 
    creates its din. The Israelites always had a special fear of horses and 
    scythed chariots; and, therefore, the sudden stillness of the entire force 
    of the enemy in this department is made the theme of special rejoicing. The 
    horses were stretched on the ground, and the chariots stood still, as if the 
    whole camp had fallen asleep. Thus can the Lord send a judicial sleep over 
    the enemies of the church, a premonition of the second death, and this he 
    can do when they are in the zenith of power; and, as they imagine, in the 
    very act of blotting out the remembrance of his people. The world's <i>
    Rabshakahs </i>can write terrible letters—but the Lord answers not with pen 
    and ink—but with rebukes, which bear death in every syllable.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. You, even you, are to be feared. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Not Sennacherib, nor Nisroch his God—but Jehovah alone, 
    who with a silent rebuke had withered all the monarch's host.</p>
<p align="justify">"Fear him, you saints, and then you shall<br/>
    Have nothing else to fear."</p>
<p align="justify">The fear of man is a snare—but the fear of God is a great 
    virtue, and has great power for good over the human mind<i>. God is to be 
    feared profoundly, continually, and alone. </i>Let all worship be to him 
    only. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And who may stand in your sight when once you are angry?
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Who indeed? The angels fell when their rebellion provoked 
    his justice; Adam lost his place in Paradise in the same manner; Pharaoh and 
    other proud monarchs passed away at his frown; neither is there in earth or 
    Hell any who can abide the terror of his wrath. <i>How blessed are they who 
    are sheltered in the atonement of Jesus, and hence have no cause to fear the 
    righteous anger of the Judge of all the earth.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. You caused judgment to be heard from Heaven.</p></b>

<p align="justify">So complete an overthrow was evidently a judgment from 
    Heaven; those who saw it not—yet heard the report of it, and said, "This is 
    the finger of God." Man will not hear God's voice if he can help it—but God 
    takes care to cause it to be heard. The echoes of that judgment executed on 
    the haughty Assyrian are heard still, and will ring on down all the ages, to 
    the praise of divine justice. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The earth feared and was still. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">All nations trembled at the tidings, and sat in humbled 
    awe. Repose followed the former turmoils of war, when the oppressor's power 
    was broken, and God was reverenced for having given quiet to the peoples. 
    How readily can Jehovah command an audience! It may be that in the latter 
    days he will, by some such miracles of power in the realms of grace, 
    constrain all earth's inhabitants to attend to the gospel, and submit to the 
    reign of his all glorious Son. So be it, good Lord.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. When God arose to judgment.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Men were hushed when he ascended the judgment seat and 
    actively carried out the decrees of justice. When God is still the people 
    are in tumult; when he arises they are still as a stone. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">To save all the meek of the earth.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">The Ruler of men has a special eye towards the poor and 
    despised; he makes it his first point to right all their wrongs. "Blessed 
    are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth." They have little enough of 
    it now—but their avenger is strong and he will surely save them. He who 
    saves his people is the same God who overthrows their enemies;<i> he is as 
    omnipotent to save as to destroy</i>. Glory be unto his name. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Selah. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Here pause, and let devout contemplation adore the God of 
    Jacob.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. Surely the wrath of man shall praise you. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It shall not only be overcome but rendered subservient to 
    your glory. Man with his breath of threatening is but blowing the trumpet of 
    the Lord's eternal fame. Furious winds often drive vessels the more swiftly 
    into port. <i>The devil blows the fire and melts the iron, and then the Lord 
    fashions it for his own purposes. Let men and devils rage as they may, they 
    cannot do otherwise than subserve the divine purposes. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The remainder of wrath shall you restrain.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Malice is tethered and cannot break its bounds. The fire 
    which cannot be utilized shall be damped. Some read it "you shall gird," as 
    if the Lord girded on the wrath of man as a sword to be used for his own 
    designs, and <i>certainly men of the world are often a sword in the hand of 
    God, to scourge others</i>. The verse clearly teaches that <i>even the most 
    rampant evil is under the control of the Lord, and will in the end be 
    overruled for his praise.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. Vow, and pay unto the Lord your God. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Well may we do so in memory of such mercies and 
    judgments. To vow or not is a matter of choice—but to discharge our vows is 
    our bounden duty. He who would defraud God, his own God, is a wretch indeed. 
    He keeps his promises, let not his people fail in theirs. He is their 
    faithful God and deserves to have a faithful people. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Let all that be round about him bring presents unto him 
    that ought to be feared.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Let surrounding nations submit to the only living God, 
    let his own people with alacrity present their offerings, and let his 
    priests and Levites be leaders in the sacred sacrifice. He who deserves to 
    be praised as our God does, should not have mere verbal homage—but 
    substantial tribute. <i>Dread Sovereign, behold I give myself to you.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. He shall cut off the spirit of princes.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Their courage, skill, and life are in his hands, and he 
    can remove them as a gardener cuts off a slip from a plant. None are great 
    in his hand. Caesars and Napoleons fall under his power as the boughs of the 
    tree beneath the woodman's axe. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">He is terrible to the kings of the earth.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">While they are terrible to others, he is terrible to 
    them. If they oppose themselves to his people, he will make short work of 
    them; they shall perish before the terror of his arm, "for the Lord is a man 
    of war, the Lord is his name." Rejoice before him all you who adore the God 
    of Jacob.</p>
