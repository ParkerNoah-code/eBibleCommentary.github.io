        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.23)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Evening, May 13, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>
          "The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But,
          thanks be unto God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus
          Christ." -- 1 Corinthians 15:56-57.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the Bible is one of the most poetical of books, though its
          language is unutterably sublime, yet we must remark how constantly it
          is true to nature. There is no straining of a fact, no glossing over a
          truth. However dark may be the subject, while it lights it up with
          brilliance, yet it does not deny the gloom connected with it. If you
          will read this chapter of Paul's epistle, so justly celebrated as a
          master-piece of language, you will find him speaking of that which is
          to come after death with such exultation and glory that you feel, "If
          this be to die, then it were well to depart at once." Who has not
          rejoiced, and whose heart has not been lifted up or filled with a holy
          fire, while he has read such sentences as these: "In a moment, in the
          twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the trumpet shall sound,
          and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
          For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must
          put on immortality. So, when this corruptible shall have put on
          incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then
          shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is
          swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where
          is thy victory?" Yet, with all that majestic language, with all that
          bold flight of eloquence, he does not deny that death is a gloomy
          thing. Even his very figures imply it. He does not laugh at it; he
          does not say, "Oh, it is nothing to die;" he describes death as a
          monster; he speaks of it as having a sting; he tells us wherein the
          strength of that sting lies; and even in the exclamation of triumph,
          he imputes that victory not to unaided flesh, but he says, "Thanks be
          to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          When I select such a text as this, I feel that I cannot preach from
          it. The thought o'ermasters me; my words do stagger; there are no
          utterances that are great enough to convey the mighty meaning of this
          wondrous text. If I had the eloquence of all men united in one, if I
          could speak as never man spake (with the exception of that one godlike
          man of Nazareth), I could not compass so vast a subject as this. I
          will not therefore pretend to do so, but offer you such thoughts as my
          mind is capable of producing.
        </p>
        <p>
          To-night we shall speak of three things: first, the sting of death;
          secondly, the strength of sin; and thirdly, the victory of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, THE STING OF DEATH. The apostle pictures death as a terrible
          dragon, or monster, which, coming upon all men, must be fought with by
          each one for himself. He gives us no hopes whatever that any of us can
          avoid it. He tells us of no bridge across the river Death; he does not
          give us the faintest hope that it is possible to emerge from this
          state of existence into another without dying; he describes the
          monster as being exactly in our path, and with it we must fight, each
          man personally, separately, and alone; each man must die; we all must
          cross the black stream; each one of us must go through the iron gate.
          There is no passage from this world into another without death. Having
          told us, then, that there is no hope of our escape, he braces up our
          nerves for the combat; but he gives us no hope that we shall be able
          to slay the monster; he does not tell us that we can strike our sword
          into his heart, and so overturn and overwhelm death; but, pointing to
          the dragon, he seems to say, "Thou canst not slay it, man; there is no
          hope that thou shouldst ever put thy foot upon its neck and crush its
          head; but one thing can be done -- it has a sting which thou mayest
          extract; thou canst not crush death under foot, but thou mayest pull
          out the sting which is deadly; and then thou need not fear the
          monster, for monster it shall be no longer, but rather it shall be a
          swift-winged angel to waft thee aloft to heaven. Where, then, is the
          sting of this dragon? Where must I strike? What is the sting? The
          apostle tells us, "that the sting of death is sin." Once let me cut
          off that, and then, though death may be dreary and solemn, I shall not
          dread it; but, holding up the monster's sting, I shall exclaim, "O
          death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?" Let us now
          dwell upon the fact, that "the sting of death is sin."
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, sin puts a sting into death, from the fact that sin brought
          death into the world. Men could be more content to die if they did not
          know it was a punishment. I suppose if we had never sinned, there
          would have been some means for us to go from this world to another. It
          cannot be supposed that so huge a population would have existed, that
          all the myriads who have lived from Adam down till now could ever have
          inhabited so small a globe as this; there would not have been space
          enough for them. But there might have been provided some means for
          taking us off when the proper time should come, and bearing us safely
          to heaven. God might have furnished horses and chariots of fire for
          each of his Elijahs; or, as it was said of Enoch, so it might have
          been declared of each of us, "He is not, for God hath taken him." Thus
          to die, if we may call it death to depart from this body and to be
          with God, would have been no disgrace; in fact, it would have been the
          highest honor; fitting the loftiest aspiration of the soul, to live
          quickly its little time in this world, then to mount and be with its
          God; and in the prayers of the most pious and devout man, one of his
          sublimest petitions would be, "O God, hasten the time of my departure,
          when I shall be with thee." When such sinless beings thought of their
          departure, they would not tremble, for the gate would be one of ivory
          and pearl -- not as now, of iron -- the stream would be as nectar, far
          different from the present "bitterness of death." But alas! how
          different! Death is now the punishment of sin. "In the day thou eatest
          there of thou shalt surely die." "In Adam all die." By his sin every
          one of us become subject to the penalty of death, and thus, being a
          punishment, death has its sting. To the best man, the holiest
          Christian, the most sanctified intellect, the soul that has the
          nearest and dearest intercourse with God, death must appear to have a
          sting, because sin was its mother. O fatal offspring of sin, I only
          dread thee because of they parentage! If thou didst come to me as an
          honor, I could wade through Jordan even now, and, when its chilling
          billows were around me, I would smile amidst its surges; and in the
          swellings of Jordan my song should swell too, and the liquid music of
          my voice should join with the liquid swellings of the floods,
          "Hallelujah! It is blessed to cross to the land of the glorified."
          This is one reason why the sting of sin is death.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But I must take it in another sense. "The sting of death is sin:"
          -- that is to say, that which shall make death most terrible to man
          will be sin, if it is not forgiven. If that be not the exact meaning
          of the apostle, still it is a great truth, and I may find it here. If
          sin lay heavy on me and were not forgiven -- if my transgressions were
          unpardoned -- if such were the fact (though I rejoice to know it is
          not so) it would be the very sting of death to me. Let us consider a
          man dying, and looking back on his past life: he will find in death a
          sting, and that sting will be his past sin. Imagine a conqueror's
          deathbed. He has been a man of blood from his youth up. Bred in the
          camp, his lips were early set to the bugle, and his hand, even in
          infancy, struck the drum. He had a martial spirit; he delighted in the
          fame and applause of men; he loved the dust of battle and the garment
          rolled in blood. He has lived a life of what men call glory. He has
          stormed cities, conquered countries, ravaged continents, overrun the
          world. See his banners hanging in the hall, and the marks of glory on
          his escutcheon. He is one of earth's proudest warriors. But now he
          comes to die, and when he lies down to expire, what shall invest his
          death with horror? It shall be his sin. Methinks I see the monarch
          dying; he lies in state; around him are his nobles and his
          councillors; but there is somewhat else there. Hard by his side there
          stands a spirit from Hades; it is a soul of a departed woman. She
          looks on him and says, "Monster! my husband was slain in battle
          through thy ambition: I was made a widow, and my helpless orphans and
          myself were starved." And she passes by. Her husband comes, and
          opening wide his bloody wounds, he cries, "Once I called thee monarch;
          but, by thy vile covetousness thou didst provoke an unjust war. See
          here these wounds -- I gained them in the siege. For thy sake I
          mounted first the scaling ladder; this foot stood upon the top of the
          wall, and I waved my sword in triumph, but in hell I lifted up my eyes
          in torment. Base wretch, thine ambition hurried me thither!" Turning
          his horrid eyes upon him, he passes by. Then up comes another, and
          another, and another yet; waking from their tombs, they stalk around
          his bed and haunt him; the dreary procession still marches on, looking
          at the dying tyrant. He shuts his eyes, but he feels the cold and bony
          hand upon his forehead; he quivers, for the siting of death is in his
          heart. "O Death!" says he; "to leave this large estate, this mighty
          realm, this pomp and power -- this were somewhat; but to meet those
          men, those women, and those orphan children, face to face; to hear
          them saying, Art thou become like one of us?' while kings whom I have
          dethroned, and monarchs whom I have cast down shall rattle their
          chains in my ears, and say, Thou wast our destroyer, but how art thou
          fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How art thou
          brought down as in a moment from thy glory and thy pride!'" There, you
          see, the sting of death would be the man's sin. It would not sting him
          that he had to die, but that he had sinned, that he had been a bloody
          man, that his hands were red with wholesale murder -- this would
          plague him indeed, for "the sting of death is sin."
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, suppose another character -- a minister. He has stood before the
          world, proclaiming something which he called the gospel. He has been a
          noted preacher; the multitude have been hanging on his lips; they have
          listened to his words; before his eloquence a nation stood amazed, and
          thousands trembled at his voice. But his preaching is over; the time
          when he can mount the pulpit is gone; another standing-place awaits
          him, another congregation, and he must hear another and a better
          preacher than himself. There he lies. He has been unfaithful to his
          charge. He preached philosophy to charm his people, instead of
          preaching truth and aiming at their hearts. And, as he pants upon his
          bed, that worst and most accursed of men -- for surely none can be
          worse than he -- there comes up one, a soul from the pit, and looking
          him in the face, says, "I came to thee once, trembling on account of
          sin; "I asked thee the road to heaven, and thou didst say, Do such and
          such good works,' and I did them, and am damned. Thou didst tell me an
          untruth; thou didst not declare plainly the word of God." He vanishes
          only to be followed by another; he has been an irreligious character,
          and as he sees the minister upon his deathbed, he says, "Ah! and art
          thou here? Once I strolled into thy house of prayer, but thou hadst
          such a sermon that I could not understand. I listened; I wanted to
          hear something from thy lips, some truth that might burn my soul and
          make me repent; but I knew not what thou saidst; and here I am." The
          ghost stamps his foot, and the man quivers like an aspen leaf, because
          he knows it is all true. Then the whole congregation arise before him
          as he lies upon his bed; he looks upon the motley group; he beholds
          the snowy heads of the old, and glittering eyes of the young; and
          lying there upon his pillow, he pictures all the sins of his past
          life, and he hears it said, "Go thou! unfaithful to thy charge; thou
          didst no divest thyself of thy love of pomp and dignity; thou didst
          not speak
        </p>
        <p>'As though thou ne'er might'st speak again,</p>
        <p>A dying man to dying men.'"</p>
        <p>
          Oh! it may be something for that minister to leave his charge,
          somewhat for him to die; but worst of all, the sting of death will be
          his sin: to hear his parish come howling after him to hell; to see his
          congregation following behind him in one mingled herd, he having led
          them astray, having been a false prophet instead of a true one,
          speaking peace, peace, where there was no peace, deluding them with
          lies, charming them with music, when he ought rather to have told them
          in rough and rugged accents the Word of God. Verily, it is true, it is
          true, the sting of death to such a man shall be his great, his
          enormous, his heinous sin of having deluded others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, then having painted two full-length pictures, I might give each
          one of you miniatures of yourselves. I might picture thee, O drunkard,
          when thy cups are drained, and when thy liquor shall no longer be
          sweet to thy taste, when worse than gall shall be the dainties that
          thou drinkest, when, within an hour, the worms shall make a carnival
          upon thy flesh; I might picture thee as thou lookest back upon they
          misspent life. And thou, O swearer, methinks I see thee there, with
          thine oaths echoed back by memory to thine own dismay. And thou, man
          of lust and wickedness, thou who hast debauched and seduced others, I
          see thee there; and the sting of death to thee, how horrible, how
          dreadful! It shall not be that thou art groaning with pain, it shall
          not be that thou art racked with agony, it shall not be that thy heart
          and flesh faileth, but the sting, the sting, shall be thy sin. How
          many in this place can spell the word "remorse?" I pray you may never
          know its awful meaning. Remorse, remorse! You know its derivation; it
          signifies to bite. Ah! now we dance with our sins -- it is a merry
          life with us -- we take their hands, and, sporting in the noontide
          sun, we dance, we dance, and live in joy. But then those sins shall
          bite us. The young lions we have stroked and played with shall bite;
          the young adder, the serpent, whose azure hues have well delighted us,
          shall bite, shall sting, when remorse shall occupy our souls. I might,
          but I will not, tell you a few stories of the awful power of remorse;
          it is the first pang of hell; it is the ante-chamber of the pit. To
          have remorse is to feel the sparks that blaze upwards from the fire of
          the bottomless Gehenna; to feel remorse is to have eternal torment
          commenced within the soul. The sting of death shall be unforgiven,
          unrepented sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But if sin in the retrospect be the sting of death, what must sin
          in the prospect be? My friends, we do not often enough look at what
          sin is to be. We see what it is; first the seed, then the blade, then
          the ear, and then the full corn in the ear. It is the wish, the
          imagination, the desire, the sight, the taste, the deed; but what is
          sin in its next development? We have observed sin as it grows; we have
          seen it, at first, a very little thing, but expanding itself until it
          has swelled into a mountain. We have seen it like "a little cloud, the
          size of a man's hand," but we have beheld it gather until it covered
          the skies with blackness, and sent down drops of bitter rain. But what
          is sin to be in the next state? We have gone so far, but sin is a
          thing that cannot stop. We have seen whereunto it has grown, but
          whereunto will it grow? for it is not ripe when we die; it has to go
          on still; it is set going, but it has to unfold itself forever. The
          moment we die, the voice of justice cries, "Seal up the fountain of
          blood; stop the stream of forgiveness; he that is holy, let him be
          holy still; he that is filthy, let him be filthy still." And after
          that, the man goes on growing filthier and filthier still; his lust
          developes itself, his vice increases; all those evil passions blaze
          with tenfold more fury, and, amidst the companionship of others like
          himself, without the restraints of grace, without the preached word,
          the man becomes worse and worse; and who can tell whereunto his sin
          may grow? I have sometimes likened the hour of our death to that
          celebrated picture, which I think you have seen in the National
          Gallery, of Perseus holding up the head of Medusa. That head turned
          all persons into stone who looked upon it. There is a warrior there
          with a dart in his hand; he stands stiffened, turned into stone, with
          the javelin even in his fist. There is another, with a poniard beneath
          his robe, about to stab; he is now the statue of an assassin,
          motionless and cold. Another is creeping along stealthily, like a man
          in ambuscade, and there he stands a consolidated rock; he has looked
          only upon that head, and he is frozen into stone. Well, such is death.
          What I am when death is held before me, that I must be forever. When
          my spirit goes, if God finds me hymning his praise, I shall hymn it in
          heaven; doth he find me breathing out oaths, I shall follow up those
          oaths in hell. Where death leaves me, judgment finds me. As I die, so
          shall I live eternally.
        </p>
        <p>"There are no acts of pardon passed</p>
        <p>In the cold grave to which we haste."</p>
        <p>
          It is forever, forever, forever! Ah! there are a set of heretics in
          these days who talk of short punishment, and preach about God's
          transporting souls for a term of years, and then letting them die.
          Where did such men learn their doctrine, I wonder? I read in God's
          word that the angel shall plant one foot upon the earth, and the other
          upon the sea, and shall swear by him that liveth and was dead, that
          time shall be no longer. But, if a soul could die in a thousand years,
          it would die in time; if a million of years could elapse, and then the
          soul could be extinguished, there would be such a thing as time; for,
          talk to me of years, and there is time. But, sirs, when that angel has
          spoken the word, "Time shall be no longer," things will then be
          eternal; the spirit shall proceed in its ceaseless revolution of weal
          or woe, never to be stayed, for there is no time to stop it; the fact
          of its stopping would imply time; but everything shall be eternal, for
          time shall cease to be. It well becomes you, then, to consider where
          ye are and what ye are. Oh! stand and tremble on the narrow neck of
          land twixt the two unbounded seas, for God in heaven alone can tell
          how soon thou mayest be launched upon the eternal future. May God
          grant that, when that last hour may come, we may be prepared for it!
          Like the thief, unheard, unseen, it steals through night's dark shade.
          Perhaps, as here I stand, and rudely speak of these dark, hidden
          things, soon may the hand be stretched, and dumb the mouth that lisps
          the faltering strain. Oh! thou that dwellest in heaven, thou power
          supreme, thou everlasting King, let not that hour intrude upon me in
          an illspent season; but may it find me rapt in meditation high,
          hymning my great Creator. So, in the last moment of my life, I will
          hasten beyond the azure, to bathe the wings of this my spirit in their
          native element, and then to dwell with thee for ever --
        </p>
        <p>"Far from a world of grief and sin,</p>
        <p>With God eternally shut in."</p>
        <p>II. "THE STRENGTH OF SIN is the law."</p>
        <p>
          I have attempted to show how to fight this monster -- it is by
          extracting and destroying its sting. I prepare myself for the battle.
          It is true I have sinned, and therefore I have put a sting into death,
          but I will endeavor to take it away. I attempt it, but the monster
          laughs me in the face, and cries, "The strength of sin is the law.
          Before thou canst destroy sin thou must in some way satisfy the law.
          Sin cannot be removed by thy tears or by thy deeds, for the law is its
          strength; and until thou hast satisfied the vengeance of the law,
          until thou hast paid the uttermost farthing of its demands, my sting
          cannot be taken away, for the very strength of sin is the law." Now, I
          must try and explain this doctrine that the strength of sin is the
          law. Most men think that sin has no strength at all. "Oh," say many,
          "we may have sinned very much, but we will repent, and we will be
          better for the rest of our lives; no doubt God is merciful, and he
          will forgive us." And we hear many divines often speak of sin as if it
          were a very venial thing. Inquire of them what is a man to do? There
          is no deep repentance required, no real inward workings of divine
          grace, no casting himself upon the blood of Christ. They never tell us
          about a complete atonement having been made. They have, indeed, some
          shadowy idea of an atonement, that Christ died just as a matter of
          form to satisfy justice; but as to any literal taking away of our
          sins, and suffering the actual penalty for us, they do not consider
          that God's law requires any such thing. I suppose they do not, for I
          never hear them assert the positive satisfaction and substitution of
          our Lord Jesus Christ. But without that, how can we take away the
          strength of sin?
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The strength of sin is in the law, first, in this respect, that the
          law being spiritual, it is quite impossible for us to live without
          sin. If the law were merely carnal, and referred to the flesh; if it
          simply related to open and overt actions, I question, even then,
          whether we could live without sin; but when I turn over the ten
          commandments and read, "Thou shalt not covet," I know it refers even
          to the wish of my heart. It is said, "Thou shalt not commit adultery;"
          but it is said, also that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after
          her hath already committed that sin. So that it is not merely the act,
          it is the thought; it is not the deed simply, it is the very
          imagination, that is a sin. Oh now, sinner, how canst thou get rid of
          sin? Thy very thoughts, the inward workings of thy mind, these are
          crimes -- this is guilt and desperate wickedness. Is there not, now,
          strength in sin? Hath not the law put a potency in it? Has it not
          nerved sin with such a power that all thy strength cannot hope to wipe
          away the black enormity of thy transgression?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Then, again, the law puts strength into sin in this respect -- that
          it will not abate one tittle of its stern demands. It says to every
          man who breaks it, "I will not forgive you." You hear persons talk
          about God's mercy. Now, if they do not believe in the gospel, they
          must be under the law; but where in the law do we read of mercy? If
          you will read the commandments through, there is a curse after them,
          but there is no provision made for pardon. The law itself speaks not
          of that; it thunders out without the slightest mitigation, "The soul
          that sinneth it shall die." If any of you desire to be saved by works,
          remember one sin will spoil your righteousness; one dust of this
          earth's dross will spoil the beauty of that perfect righteousness
          which God requires at your hands. If ye would be saved by works, men
          and brethren, ye must be as holy as the angels, ye must be as pure and
          as immaculate as Jesus; for the law requires perfection, and nothing
          short of it; and God, with unflinching vengeance, will smite every man
          low who cannot bring him a perfect obedience. If I cannot, when I come
          before his throne, plead a perfect righteousness as being mine, God
          will say, "you have not fulfilled the demands of my law; depart,
          accursed one! You have sinned, and you must die." "Ah," says one, "can
          we ever have a perfect righteousness, then? Yes, I will tell you of
          that in the third point; thanks be unto Christ, who giveth us the
          victory through his blood and through his righteousness, who adorns us
          as a bride in her jewels as a husband arrays his wife with ornaments.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Yet again; the law gives strength to sin from the fact that, for
          every transgression it will exact a punishment. The law never remits a
          farthing of debt: it says, "Sin -- punishment." They are linked
          together with adamantine chains; they are tied, and cannot be severed.
          The law speaks not of sin and mercy; mercy comes in the gospel. The
          law says, "Sin -- die; transgress -- be chastised; sin -- hell." Thus
          are they linked together. Once let me sin, and I may go to the foot of
          stern Justice, and as, with blind eyes, she holds the scales, I may
          say, "O Justice, remember, I was holy once; remember that on such and
          such an occasion I did keep the law." "Yes," saith Justice, "all I owe
          thee thou shalt have; I will not punish thee for what thou hast not
          done; but remember you this crime, O sinner?" and she puts in the
          heavy weight. The sinner trembles, and he cries, "But canst thou not
          forget that? Wilt thou not cast it away?" "Nay," saith Justice, and
          she puts in another weight. "Sinner, dost thou recollect this crime?"
          "Oh!" says the sinner, "wilt thou not for mercy's sake-?" "I will not
          have mercy," says Justice; "Mercy has its own palace, but I have
          naught to do with forgiveness here; mercy belongs to Christ. If you
          will be saved by Justice, you shall have your full of it. If you come
          to me for salvation, I will not have mercy brought in to help me; she
          is not my vicegerent; I stand here alone without her." And again, as
          she holds the scales, she puts in another iniquity, another crime,
          another enormous transgression; and each time the man begs and prays
          that he may have that passed by. Says Justice, "Nay, I must exact the
          penalty; I have sworn I will, and I will. Canst thou find a substitute
          for thyself? If thou canst, there is the only room I have for mercy. I
          will exact it of that substitute, but even at his hands I will have
          the utmost jot and tittle; I will abate nothing; I am God's Justice,
          stern and unflinching, I will not alter, I will not mitigate the
          penalty." She still holds the scales. The plea is in vain. "Never will
          I change!" she cries; "bring me the blood, bring me the price to its
          utmost; count it down, or else, sinner, thou shalt die.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my friends, I ask you, if ye consider the spirituality of the
          law, the perfection it requires, and its unflinching severity, are you
          prepared to take away the sting of death in your own persons? Can you
          hope to overcome sin yourselves? Can you trust that, by some righteous
          works, you may yet cancel your guilt? If you think so, go, O foolish
          one, go! O madman, go! work out thine own salvation with fear and
          trembling, without the God that worketh in thee; go, twist thy rope of
          sand; go, build a pyramid of air; go, prepare a house with bubbles,
          and think it is to last forever; but know it will be a dream with an
          awful awakening, for as a dream when one awaketh will he despise alike
          your image and your righteousness. "The strength of sin is the law."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But now, in the last place, we have before us THE VICTORY OF
          FAITH. The Christian is the only champion who can smite the dragon of
          death, and even he cannot do it of himself; but when he has done it,
          he shall cry, "Thanks be to God who giveth us the victory through our
          Lord Jesus Christ." One moment, and I will show you how the Christian
          can look upon death with complacency, through the merits of Jesus
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, Christ has taken away the strength of sin in this respect, that
          he has removed the law. We are not under bondage, but under grace. Law
          is not our directing principle, grace is. Do not misunderstand me. The
          principle that I must do a thing -- that is to say, the principle of
          law, "do, or be punished; do, or be rewarded," is not the motive of
          the Christian's life; his principle is grace: "God has done so much
          for me, what ought I to do for him?" We are not under the law in that
          sense, but under grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then Christ has removed the law in this sense, that he has completely
          satisfied it. The law demands a perfect righteousness; Christ says,
          "Law, thou hast it; find fault with me; I am the sinner's substitute;
          have I not kept thy commandments? Wherein have I violated thy
          statutes?" "Come here, my beloved," he says, and then he cries to
          Justice, "Find a fault in this man; I have put my robe upon him; I
          have washed him in my blood; I have cleansed him from his sin. All the
          past is gone; as for the future, I have secured it by sanctification;
          as for the penalty, I have borne it myself; at one tremendous draught
          of love I have drunk that man's destruction dry; I have borne what he
          should have suffered; I have endured the agonies he ought to have
          endured. Justice, have I not satisfied thee? Did I not say upon the
          tree, and didst thou not coincide with it, It is finished; it is
          finished?' Have I not made so complete an atonement that there is now
          no need for that man to die and expiate his guilt? Do I not complete
          the perfect righteousness of this poor, once condemned, but now
          justified spirit?" "Yes" saith Justice, "I am well satisfied, and even
          more content, if possible, than if the sinner had brought a spotless
          righteousness of his own." And now, what saith the Christian after
          this? Boldly he comes to the realms of death, and entering the gates
          there, he cries, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's
          elect?" And when he had said it, the dragon drops his sting. He
          descends into the grave; he passes by the place where fiends lie down
          in fetters of iron; he sees their chains, and looks into the dungeon
          where they dwell, and as he passes by the prison door, he shouts, "Who
          shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?" They growl and bite
          their iron bonds, and hiss in secret, but they cannot lay aught to his
          charge. Now see him mount aloft. He approaches God's heaven, he come
          against the gates, and Faith still triumphantly shouts, "Who shall lay
          anything to the charge of God's elect?" And a voice comes from within:
          "Not Christ, for he hath died; not God, for he hath justified."
          Received by Jesus, Faith enters heaven, and again she cries, "Who even
          here amongst the spotless and ransomed, shall lay anything to the
          charge of God's elect?" Now the law is satisfied, sin is gone; and now
          surely we need not fear the sting of the dragon, but we may say, as
          Paul did, when he rose into the majesty of poetry -- such beautiful
          poetry that Pope himself borrowed his words, only transposing the
          sentences, "O grave, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy
          sting?"
        </p>
        <p>
          If it were necessary to-night, I might speak to you concerning the
          resurrection, and I might tell you how much that takes away the sting
          of death, but I will confine myself to the simple fact, that the sting
          of death is sin, that the strength of sin is the law, and that Christ
          gives us the victory by taking the sting away, and removing the
          strength of sin by his perfect obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, sirs, how many are there here who have any hope that for them
          Christ Jesus died? Am I coming too close home, when most solemnly I
          put the question to each one of you, as I stand in God's presence this
          night, to free my head of your blood; as I stand and appeal with all
          the earnestness this heart is capable of? Are you prepared to die? I
          sin pardoned? Is the law satisfied? Can you view the flowing
        </p>
        <p>"Of Christ's soul-redeeming blood,</p>
        <p>With divine assurance knowing,</p>
        <p>That he hath made your peace with God?"</p>
        <p>
          O! can ye now put one hand upon your heart, and the other upon the
          Bible, and say, "God's word and I agree; the witness of the Spirit
          here and the witness there are one. I have renounced my sins, I have
          given up my evil practices; I have abhorred my own righteousness; I
          trust in naught but Jesus' doings; simply do I depend on him.
        </p>
        <p>'Nothing in my hand I bring,</p>
        <p>Simply to thy cross I cling.'"</p>
        <p>
          If so, should you die where you are -- sudden death were sudden glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, my hearers, shall I be faithful with you? or shall I belie my
          soul? Which shall it be? Are there not many here who, each time the
          bell tolls the departure of a soul, might well ask the question, "Am I
          prepared?" and they must say, "No." I shall not turn prophet to-night;
          but were it right for me to say so, I fear not one-half of you are
          prepared to die. Is that true? Yea, let the speaker ask himself the
          question, "Am I prepared to meet my Maker face to face?" Oh, sit in
          your seat and catechise your souls with that solemn question. Let each
          one ask himself, "Am I prepared, should I be called, to die?" Methinks
          I hear one say with confidence, "I know that my Redeemer liveth." "Let
          him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall." I hear another
          say with trembling accents --
        </p>
        <p>"Ah! guilty, weak, and helpless worm,</p>
        <p>On Christ's kind arms I fall;</p>
        <p>He is my strength and righteousness,</p>
        <p>My Jesus and my all."</p>
        <p>
          Yes, sweet words! I would rather have written that one verse than
          Milton's "Paradise Lost." It is such a matchless picture of the true
          condition of the believing soul. But I hear another say, "I shall not
          answer such a question as that. I am not going to be dull to-day. It
          may be gloomy weather outside to-day, but I do not want to be made
          melancholy." Young man, young man, go thy way. Let thine heart cheer
          thee in the days of thy youth; but for all this the Lord shall bring
          thee to judgment. What wilt thou do, careless spirit, when thy friends
          have forsaken thee, when thou art alone with God? Thou dost not like
          to be alone, young man, now, dost thou? A falling leaf will startle
          thee. To be alone an hour will bring on an insufferable feeling of
          melancholy. But thou wilt be alone -- and a dreary alone it will be --
          with God an enemy! How wilt thou do in the swellings of Jordan? What
          wilt thou do when he taketh thee by the hand at eventide, and asketh
          thee for an account; when he says, "What didst thou do in the
          beginning of thy days? how didst thou spend thy life?" When he asks
          thee, "Where are the years of thy manhood?" When he questions thee
          about thy wasted Sabbaths, and inquires how thy latter years were
          spent, what wilt thou say then? Speechless, without an answer, thou
          wilt stand. Oh, I beseech you, as ye love yourselves, take care! Even
          now, begin to weigh the solemn matters of eternal life. Oh! say not,
          "Why so earnest? why in such haste?" Sirs, if I saw you lying in your
          bed, and your house was on fire, the fire might be at the bottom of
          the house, and you might slumber safely for the next five minutes; but
          with all my might I would pull you from your bed, or I would shout,
          "Awake! awake! the flame is under thee." So with some of you who are
          sleeping over hell's mouth, slumbering over the pit of perdition, may
          I not awake you? may I not depart a little from clerical rules, and
          speak to you as one speaketh to his fellow whom he loves? Ah! if I
          loved you not, I need not be here. It is because I wish to win your
          souls, and, if it be possible, to win for my Master some honor, that I
          would thus pour out my heart before you. As the Lord liveth, sinner,
          thou standest on a single plank over the mouth of hell, and that plank
          is rotten. Thou hangest over the pit by a solitary rope, and the
          strands of that rope are breaking. Thou art like that man of old, whom
          Dionysius placed at the head of the table; before him was a dainty
          feast, but the man ate not, for directly over his head was a sword
          suspended by a hair. So art thou, sinner. Let thy cup be full, let thy
          pleasures be high, let thy soul be elevated, seest thou that sword?
          The next time thou sittest in the theatre, look up and see that sword:
          when next in thy business thou scornest the rules of God's gospel,
          look at that sword. Though thou seest it not, it is there. Even now,
          ye may hear God saying to Gabriel, "Gabriel, that man is sitting in
          his seat in the hall; he is hearing, but is as though he heard not;
          unsheathe thy blade; let the glittering sword cut through that hair;
          let the weapon fall upon him and divide his soul and body." Stop, thou
          Gabriel, stop! Save the man a little while. Give him yet an hour, that
          he may repent. Oh, let him not die. True, he has been here these ten
          or dozen nights, and he has listened without a tear; but stop, and
          peradventure he may repent yet. Jesus backs up my entreaty, and he
          cries, "Spare him yet another year, till I dig about him and dung him,
          and though he now cumbers the ground, he may yet bring forth fruit,
          that he may not be hewn down and cast into the fire." I thank thee, O
          god; thou wilt not cut him down to-night; but to-morrow may be his
          last day. Ye may never see the sun rise, though you have seen it set.
          Take heed. Hear the word of God's gospel, and depart with God's
          blessing. "Whosoever believeth on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
          shall be saved." "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved."
          "He is able to save to the uttermost, all that come unto him."
          "Whosoever cometh unto him, he will in no wise cast out." Let every
          one that heareth say, "Come; whosoever is athirst, let him come and
          take of the water of life, freely."<br />
