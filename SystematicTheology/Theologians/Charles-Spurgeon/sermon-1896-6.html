          7. And they have said, God shall not see, the God of Jacob shall not
          know.8. Understand, ye stupid among the people: and ye fools, when
          will ye be wise? 9. He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he
          that formed the eye, shall he not see? 10. He that chastiseth the
          nations, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge.

          7. And they have said, God shall not see When the Psalmist speaks of
          the wicked as taunting God with blindness and ignorance, we are not to
          conceive of them as just exactly entertaining this imagination of him
          in their hearts, but they despise his judgments as much as if he took
          no cognisance of human affairs. Were the truth graven upon men's
          hearts that they cannot elude the eye of God, this would serve as a
          check and restraint upon their conduct. When they proceed to such
          audacity in wickedness as to lay the hand of violence upon their
          fellow-creatures, to rob, and to destroy, it shows that they have
          fallen into a state of brutish security in which they virtually
          consider themselves as concealed from the view of the Almighty. This
          security sufficiently proves at least, that they act as if they never
          expected to be called to an account for their conduct. Though they may
          not then be guilty of the gross blasphemy of asserting in so many
          words that God is ignorant of what goes forward in the world, a mere
          nothing in the universe -- the Psalmist very properly charges them
          with denying God's providential government, and, indeed, avowedly
          stripping him of the power and function of judge and governor, since,
          if they really were persuaded as they ought of his superintending
          providence, they would honor him by feeling a reverential fear -- as I
          have elsewhere observed at greater length. He intends to express the
          lowest and most abandoned stage of depravity, in which the sinner
          casts off the fear of God, and rushes into every excess. Such
          infatuated conduct would have been inexcusable even in heathens, who
          had never heard of a divine revelation; but it was monstrous in men
          who had been brought up from infancy in the knowledge of the word, to
          show such mockery and contempt of God.

          8 Understand, ye stupid among the people As it was execrable impiety
          to deny God to be Judge of the earth, the Psalmist severely reprimands
          their folly in thinking to elude his government, and even succeed by
          artifices in escaping his view. The expression, stupid among the
          people, is stronger than had he simply condemned them as foolish. It
          rendered their folly more inexcusable, that they belonged to the
          posterity of Abraham, of whom Moses said,
        </p>
        <p>
          "What people is there so great, who have their gods so near unto them,
          as the Lord thy God hath this day come down unto thee? For this is
          your understanding and wisdom before all nations, to have God for your
          legislator." (Deuteronomy 4:7)
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps, however, he may be considered as addressing the rulers and
          those who were of higher rank in the community, and styling them
          degraded among the people, that is, no better than the common herd of
          the vulgar. Proud men, who are apt to be blinded by a sense of their
          importance, require to be brought down, and made to see that in God's
          estimation they are no better than others. He puts them on a level
          with the common people, to humble their self-complacency; or we may
          suppose that he hints with an ironical and sarcastic allusion to their
          boasted greatness, that they were distinguished above others chiefly
          for pre-eminent folly -- adding, at the same time, as an additional
          aggravation, that they were obstinate in their adherence to it; for as
          much is implied in the question, When will ye be wise? We might
          consider it an unnecessary assertion of Divine Providence to put the
          question to the wicked, Shall not he who made the ear hear? because
          there are none so abandoned as openly to deny God's cognisance of
          events; but, as I have observed above, the flagrant audacity and
          self-security which most men display in contradicting his will, is a
          sufficient proof that they have supplanted God from their
          imaginations, and substituted a mere dead idol in his place, since,
          did they really believe him to be cognisant of their actions, they
          would at least show as much regard to him as to their
          fellow-creatures, in whose presence they feel some measure of
          restraint, and are prevented from sinning by fear and respect. To
          arouse them from this stupidity, the Psalmist draws an argument from
          the very order of nature, inferring that if men both see and hear, by
          virtue of faculties which they have received from God the Creator, it
          is impossible that God himself, who formed the eye and the ear, should
          not possess the most perfect observation.

          10. He that chastiseth the nations, shall not he correct? He would
          have them argue from the greater to the less, that if God did not
          spare even whole nations, but visits their iniquity with punishment,
          they could not imagine that he would suffer a mere handful of
          individuals to escape with impunity. The comparison intended, however,
          may possibly be between the Gentiles and the Jews. If God punished the
          heathen nations, who had not heard his word, with much severity, the
          Jews might expect that they, who had been familiarised to instruction
          in his house, would receive still sharper correction, and that he
          would vindicate his justice most in that nation over which he had
          chosen to preside. Still the former sense of the passage appears to me
          preferable, That it is folly in any number of individuals to flatter
          themselves with impunity, when they see God inflicting public
          punishment upon collective people. Some think there is an exclusive
          allusion to the signal and memorable instances of Divine judgment
          recorded in Scripture, as in the destruction of Sodom with fire from
          heaven, (Genesis 19.) and of the whole human family by the flood,
          (Genesis 7.) But the simpler meaning is best, That it were the height
          of madness in individuals to think that they could escape when nations
          perish. In adding that God teacheth men knowledge, the Psalmist
          glances at the overweening confidence of such as despise God, and
          pride themselves in their acuteness and shrewdness, as we find Isaiah
          denouncing a woe against those crafty enemies of God who dig deep,
          that they may hide themselves from his sight, (Isaiah 29:15.) It is a
          disease prevalent enough in the world still. We know the refuges under
          covert of which both courtiers and lawyers take occasion to indulge in
          shameless mockery of God. It is as if the Psalmist had said -- You
          think to elude God through the confidence which you have in your acute
          understandings, and would pretend to dispute the knowledge of the
          Almighty, when, in truth, all the knowledge which is in the world is
          but as a drop from his own inexhaustible fullness.<br />
