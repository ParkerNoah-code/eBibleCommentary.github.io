          1. Those, moreover, who say that the world was formed by angels, or by
          any other maker of it, contrary to the will of Him who is the Supreme
          Father, err first of all in this very point, that they maintain that
          angels formed such and so mighty a creation, contrary to the will of
          the Most High God. This would imply that angels were more powerful
          than God; or if not so, that He was either careless, or inferior, or
          paid no regard to those things which took place among His own
          possessions, whether they turned out ill or well, so that He might
          drive away and prevent the one, while He praised and rejoiced over the
          other. But if one would not ascribe such conduct even to a man of any
          ability, how much less to God
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Next let them tell us whether these things have been formed within
          the limits which are contained by Him, and in His proper territory, or
          in regions belonging to others, and lying beyond Him? But if they say
          [that these things were done] beyond Him, then all the absurdities
          already mentioned will face them, and the Supreme God will be enclosed
          by that which is beyond Him, in which also it will be necessary that
          He should find His end. If, on the other hand, [these things were
          done] within His own proper territory, it will be very idle to say
          that the world was thus formed within His proper territory against His
          will by angels who are themselves under His power, or by any other
          being, as if either He Himself did not behold all things which take
          place among His own possessions, or was not aware of the things to be
          done by angels.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If, however, [the things referred to were done] not against His
          will, but with His concurrence and knowledge, as some [of these men]
          think, the angels, or the Former of the world [whoever that may have
          been], will no longer be the causes of that formation, but the will of
          God. For if He is the Former of the world, He too made the angels, or
          at least was the cause of their creation; and He will be regarded as
          having made the world who prepared the causes of its formation.
          Although they maintain that the angels were made by a long succession
          downwards, or that the Former of the world [sprang] from the Supreme
          Father, as Basilides asserts; nevertheless that which is the cause of
          those things which have been made will still be traced to Him who was
          the Author of such a succession. [The case stands] just as regards
          success in war, which is ascribed to the king who prepared those
          things which are the cause of victory; and, in like manner, the
          creation of any state, or of any work, is referred to him who prepared
          materials for the accomplishment of those results which were
          afterwards brought about. Wherefore, we do not say that it was the axe
          which cut the wood, or the saw which divided it; but one would very
          properly say that the man cut and divided it who formed the axe and
          the saw for this purpose, and [who also formed] at a much earlier date
          all the tools by which the axe and the saw themselves were formed.
          With justice, therefore, according to an analogous process of
          reasoning, the Father of all will be declared the Former of this
          world, and not the angels, nor any other [so-called] former of the
          world, other than He who was its Author, and had formerly been the
          cause of the preparation for a creation of this kind.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This manner of speech may perhaps be plausible or persuasive to
          those who know not God, and who liken Him to needy human beings, and
          to those who cannot immediately and without assistance form anything,
          but require many instrumentalities to produce what they intend. But it
          will not be regarded as at all probable by those who know that God
          stands in need of nothing, and that He created and made all things by
          His Word, while He neither required angels to assist Him in the
          production of those things which are made, nor of any power greatly
          inferior to Himself, and ignorant of the Father, nor of any defect or
          ignorance, in order that he who should know Him might become man. But
          He Himself in Himself, after a fashion which we can neither describe
          nor conceive, predestinating all things, formed them as He pleased,
          bestowing harmony on all things, and assigning them their own place,
          and the beginning of their creation. In this way He conferred on
          spiritual things a spiritual and invisible nature, on super-celestial
          things a celestial, on angels an angelical, on animals an animal, on
          beings that swim a nature suited to the water, and on those that live
          on the land one fitted for the land -- on all, in short, a nature
          suitable to the character of the life assigned them -- while He formed
          all things that were made by His Word that never wearies.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. For this is a peculiarity of the pre-eminence of God, not to stand
          in need of other instruments for the creation of those things which
          are summoned into existence. His own Word is both suitable and
          sufficient for the formation of all things, even as John, the disciple
          of the Lord, declares regarding Him: "All things were made by Him, and
          without Him was nothing made." Now, among the "all things" our world
          must be embraced. It too, therefore, was made by His Word, as
          Scripture tells us in the book of Genesis that He made all things
          connected with our world by His Word. David also expresses the same
          truth [when he says] "For He spake, and they were made; He commanded,
          and they were created." Whom, therefore, shall we believe as to the
          creation of the world -- these heretics who have been mentioned that
          prate so foolishly and inconsistently on the subject, or the disciples
          of the Lord, and Moses, who was both a faithful servant of God and a
          prophet? He at first narrated the formation of the world in these
          words: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth," and
          all other things in succession; but neither gods nor angels [had any
          share in the work].
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, that this God is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Paul the
          apostle also has declared, [saying,] "There is one God, the Father,
          who is above all, and through all things, and in us all." I have
          indeed proved already that there is only one God; but I shall further
          demonstrate this from the apostles themselves, and from the discourses
          of the Lord. For what sort of conduct would it be, were we to forsake
          the utterances of the prophets, of the Lord, and of the apostles, that
          we might give heed to these persons, who speak not a word of sense?
