        <p>A Psalm of Praise</p>
        <p>
          1. Let all the earth make a joyful noise to Jehovah.2. Serve Jehovah
          with gladness: come into his presence with joyfulness.3. Know ye that
          Jehovah himself is God: he made us, and not we ourselves: we are his
          people, and the sheep of his pasture.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          1 Make a joyful noise The Psalmist refers only to that part of the
          service of God which consists in recounting his benefits and giving
          thanks. And since he invites the whole of the inhabitants of the earth
          indiscriminately to praise Jehovah, he seems, in the spirit of
          prophecy, to refer to the period when the Church would be gathered out
          of different nations. Hence he commands (verse 2) that God should be
          served with gladness, intimating that his kindness towards his own
          people is so great as to furnish them with abundant ground for
          rejoicing. This is better expressed in the third verse, in which he
          first reprehends the presumption of those men who had wickedly
          revolted from the true God, both in fashioning for themselves gods
          many, and in devising various forms of worshipping them. And as a
          multitude of gods destroys and suppresses the true knowledge of one
          God only, and tarnishes his glory, the prophet, with great propriety,
          calls upon all men to bethink themselves, and to cease from robbing
          God of the honor due to his name; and, at the same time, inveighs
          against their folly in that, not content with the one God, they were
          become vain in their imaginations. For, however much they are
          constrained to confess with the mouth that there is a God, the maker
          of heaven and earth, yet they are ever and anon gradually despoiling
          him of his glory; and in this manner, the Godhead is, to the utmost
          extent of their power, reduced to a nonentity. As it is then a most
          difficult thing to retain men in the practice of the pure worship of
          God, the prophet, not without reason, recalls the world from its
          accustomed vanity, and commands them to recognize God as God. For we
          must attend to this short definition of the knowledge of him, namely,
          that his glory be preserved unimpaired, and that no deity be opposed
          to him that might obscure the glory of his name. True, indeed, in the
          Papacy, God still retains his name, but as his glory is not
          comprehended in the mere letters of his name, it is certain that there
          he is not recognized as God. Know, therefore, that the true worship of
          God cannot be preserved in all its integrity until the base
          profanation of his glory, which is the inseparable attendant of
          superstition, be completely reformed.

          The prophet next makes mention of the great benefits received from
          God, and, in an especial manner, desires the faithful to meditate upon
          them. To say God made us is a very generally acknowledged truth; but
          not to advert to the ingratitude so usual among men, that scarcely one
          among a hundred seriously acknowledges that he holds his existence
          from God, although, when hardly put to it, they do not deny that they
          were created out of nothing; yet every man makes a god of himself, and
          virtually worships himself, when he ascribes to his own power what God
          declares belongs to him alone. Moreover, it must be remembered that
          the prophet is not here speaking of creation in general, (as I have
          formerly said,) but of that spiritual regeneration by which he creates
          anew his image in his elect. Believers are the persons whom the
          prophet here declares to be God's workmanship, not that they were made
          men in their mother's womb, but in that sense in which Paul, in
          Ephesians 2:10, calls them, To poiema, the workmanship of God, because
          they are created unto good works which God hath before ordained that
          they should walk in them; and in reality this agrees best with the
          subsequent context. For when he says, We are his people, and the sheep
          of his pasture, he evidently refers to that distinguishing grace which
          led God to set apart his children for his heritage, in order that he
          may, as it were, nourish them under his wings, which is a much greater
          privilege than that of merely being born men. Should any person be
          disposed to boast that he has of himself become a new man, who is
          there that would not hold in abhorrence such a base attempt to rob God
          of that which belongs to him? Nor must we attribute this spiritual
          birth to our earthly parents, as if by their own power they begat us;
          for what could a corrupt seed produce? Still the majority of men do
          not hesitate to claim for themselves all the praise of the spiritual
          life. Else what mean the preachers of free-will, unless it be to tell
          us that by our own endeavors we have, from being sons of Adam, become
          the sons of God? In opposition to this, the prophet in calling us the
          people of God, informs us that it is of his own good will that we are
          spiritually regenerated. And by denominating us the sheep of his
          pasture, he gives us to know that through the same grace which has
          once been imparted to us, we continue safe and unimpaired until the
          end. It might be otherwise rendered, he made us his people, etc. But
          as the meaning is not altered, I have retained that which was the more
          generally received reading.<br />
