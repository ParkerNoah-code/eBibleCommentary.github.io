          And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house. And
          Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had
          many wives. And his concubine that was in Sechem, she also bare him a
          son, and he called his name Abimelech. And Gideon the son of Joash
          died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his
          father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of
          Israel turned again, and went a whoring after the Baalim, and made
          Baal-berith their god. And the children of Israel remembered not the
          LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their
          enemies on every side: neither shewed they kindness to the house of
          Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had
          shewed unto Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's
          brethren, and spake with them, and with all the family of the house of
          his mother's father, saying, Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the
          men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, that all the sons of
          Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, rule over you, or
          that one rule over you? remember also that I am your bone and your
          flesh. And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the
          men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow
          Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother. And they gave him
          threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith,
          wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light fellows, which followed him.
          And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren
          the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one
          stone: but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid
          himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          And all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all the
          house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the
          pillar that was in Shechem. And when they told it to Jotham, he went
          and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and
          cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that
          God may hearken unto you. The trees went forth on a time to anoint a
          king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.
          But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness,
          wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to wave to and fro
          over the trees? And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and
          reign over us. But the fig tree said unto them, Should I leave my
          sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave to and fro over the
          trees? And the trees said unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.
          And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth
          God and man, and go to wave to and fro over the trees? Then said all
          the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us. And the
          bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you,
          then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come
          out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon. Now therefore,
          if ye have dealt truly and uprightly, in that ye have made Abimelech
          king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have
          done unto him according to the deserving of his hands; -- for my
          father fought for you, and adventured his life, and delivered you out
          of the hand of Midian: and ye are risen up against my father's house
          this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon
          one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king
          over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother; -- if ye then
          have dealt truly and uprightly with Jerubbaal and with his house this
          day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:
          but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of
          Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of
          Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech. And Jotham
          ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of
          Abimelech his brother.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Abimelech was prince over Israel three years. And God sent an evil
          spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of
          Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech: that the violence done to
          the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their
          blood might be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them, and
          upon the men of Shechem, which strengthened his hands to slay his
          brethren. And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him on the tops
          of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by
          them: and it was told Abimelech.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to
          Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their trust in him. And they went
          out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trode the
          grapes, and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and
          did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech. And Gaal the son of Ebed
          said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him?
          is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve ye the
          men of Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him? And
          would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove
          Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come
          out. And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the
          son of Ebed, his anger was kindled. And he sent messengers unto
          Abimelech craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his
          brethren are come to Shechem; and, behold, they constrain the city to
          take part against thee. Now therefore, up by night, thou and the
          people that is with thee, and lie in wait in the field: and it shall
          be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise
          early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people that
          is with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou
          shalt find occasion.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by
          night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies. And Gaal
          the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the
          city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from
          the ambushment. And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul,
          Behold, there come people down from the tops of the mountains. And
          Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they
          were men. And Gaal spake again and said, See, there come people down
          by the middle of the land, and one company cometh by the way of the
          oak of Meonenim. Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth,
          that thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not
          this the people that thou hast despised? go out now, I pray, and fight
          with them. And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought
          with Abimelech. And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and
          there fell many wounded, even unto the entering of the gate. And
          Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul drave out Gaal and his brethren,
          that they should not dwell in Shechem. And it came to pass on the
          morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told
          Abimelech. And he took the people, and divided them into three
          companies, and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and, behold, the
          people came forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and
          smote them. And Abimelech, and the companies that were with him,
          rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and
          the two companies rushed upon all that were in the field, and smote
          them. And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took
          the city, and slew the people that was therein: and he beat down the
          city, and sowed it with salt.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard thereof, they
          entered into the hold of the house of Elberith. And it was told
          Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered
          together. And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the
          people that were with him; and Abimelech took an ax in his hand, and
          cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his
          shoulder: and he said unto the people that were with him, What ye have
          seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done. And all the people
          likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put
          them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the
          men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took
          it. But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all
          the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut themselves in,
          and gat them up to the roof of the tower. And Abimelech came unto the
          tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower
          to burn it with fire. And a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon
          Abimelech's head, and brake his skull. Then he called hastily unto the
          young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and
          kill me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man
          thrust him through, and he died. And when the men of Israel saw that
          Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place. Thus God
          requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in
          slaying his seventy brethren: and all the wickedness of the men of
          Shechem did God requite upon their heads: and upon them came the curse
          of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
