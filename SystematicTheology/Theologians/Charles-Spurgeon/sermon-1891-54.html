          1. That they improperly and illogically apply both the parables and
          the actions of the Lord to their falsely-devised system, I prove as
          follows: They endeavour, for instance, to demonstrate that passion
          which, they say, happened in the case of the twelfth Æon, from this
          fact, that the passion of the Saviour was brought about by the twelfth
          apostle, and happened in the twelfth month. For they hold that He
          preached [only] for one year after His baptism. They maintain also
          that the same thing was clearly set forth in the case of her who
          suffered from the issue of blood. For the woman suffered during twelve
          years, and through touching the hem of the Saviour's garment she was
          made whole by that power which went forth from the Saviour, and which,
          they affirm, had a previous existence. For that Power who suffered was
          stretching herself outwards and flowing into immensity, so that she
          was in danger of being dissolved into the general substance [of the
          Æons]; but then, touching the primary Tetrad, which is typified by the
          hem of the garment, she was arrested, and ceased from her passion.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Then, again, as to their assertion that the passion of the twelfth
          Æon was proved through the conduct of Judas, how is it possible that
          Judas can be compared [with this Æon] as being an emblem of her -- he
          who was expelled from the number of the twelve, and never restored to
          his place? For that Æon, whose type they declare Judas to be, after
          being separated from her Enthymesis, was restored or recalled [to her
          former position]; but Judas was deprived [of his office], and cast
          out, while Matthias was ordained in his place, according to what is
          written, "And his bishopric let another take." They ought therefore to
          maintain that the twelfth Æon was cast out of the Pleroma, and that
          another was produced, or sent forth to fill her place; if, that is to
          say, she is pointed at in Judas. Moreover, they tell us that it was
          the Æon herself who suffered, but Judas was the betrayer, [and not the
          sufferer.] Even they themselves acknowledge that it was the suffering
          Christ, and not Judas, who came to [the endurance of] passion. How,
          then, could Judas, the betrayer of Him who had to suffer for our
          salvation, be the type and image of that Æon who suffered?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But, in truth, the passion of Christ was neither similar to the
          passion of the Æon, nor did it take place in similar circumstances.
          For the Æon underwent a passion of dissolution and destruction, so
          that she who suffered was in danger also of being destroyed. But the
          Lord, our Christ, underwent a valid, and not a merely accidental
          passion; not only was He Himself not in danger of being destroyed, but
          He also established fallen man by His own strength, and recalled him
          to incorruption. The Æon, again, underwent passion while she was
          seeking after the Father, and was not able to find Him; but the Lord
          suffered that He might bring those who have wandered from the Father,
          back to knowledge and to His fellowship. The search into the greatness
          of the Father became to her a passion leading to destruction; but the
          Lord, having suffered, and bestowing the knowledge of the Father,
          conferred on us salvation. Her passion, as they declare, gave origin
          to a female offspring, weak, infirm, unformed, and ineffective; but
          His passion gave rise to strength and power. For the Lord, through
          means of suffering, "ascending into the lofty place, led captivity
          captive, gave gifts to men," and conferred on those that believe in
          Him the power "to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and on all the
          power of the enemy," that is, of the leader of apostasy. Our Lord also
          by His passion destroyed death, and dispersed error, and put an end to
          corruption, and destroyed ignorance, while He manifested life and
          revealed truth, and bestowed the gift of incorruption. But their Æon,
          when she had suffered, established ignorance, and brought forth a
          substance without shape, out of which all material works have been
          produced -- death, corruption, error, and such like.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Judas, then, the twelfth in order of the disciples, was not a type
          of the suffering Æon, nor, again, was the passion of the Lord; for
          these two things have been shown to be in every respect mutually
          dissimilar and inharmonious. This is the case not only as respects the
          points which I have already mentioned, but with regard to the very
          number. For that Judas the traitor is the twelfth in order, is agreed
          upon by all, there being twelve apostles mentioned by name in the
          Gospel. But this Æon is not the twelfth, but the thirtieth; for,
          according to the views under consideration, there were not twelve Æons
          only produced by the will of the Father, nor was she sent forth the
          twelfth in order: they reckon her, [on the contrary,] as having been
          produced in the thirtieth place. How, then, can Judas, the twelfth in
          order, be the type and image of that Æon who occupies the thirtieth
          place?
        </p>
        <p>
          5. But if they say that Judas in perishing was the image of her
          Enthymesis, neither in this way will the image bear any analogy to
          that truth which [by hypothesis] corresponds to it. For the Enthymesis
          having been separated from the Æon, and itself afterwards receiving a
          shape from Christ, then being made a partaker of intelligence by the
          Saviour, and having formed all things which are outside of the
          Pleroma, after the image of those which are within the Pleroma, is
          said at last to have been received by them into the Pleroma, and,
          according to [the principle of] conjunction, to have been united to
          that Saviour who was formed out of all. But Judas having been once for
          all cast away, never returns into the number of the disciples;
          otherwise a different person would not have been chosen to fill his
          place. Besides, the Lord also declared regarding him, "Woe to the man
          by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed;" and, "It were better for
          him if he had never been born;" and he was called the "son of
          perdition" by Him. If, however, they say that Judas was a type of the
          Enthymesis, not as separated from the Æon, but of the passion entwined
          with her, neither in this way can the number twelve be regarded as a
          [fitting] type of the number three. For in the one case Judas was cast
          away, and Matthias was ordained instead of him; but in the other case
          the Æon is said to have been in danger of dissolution and destruction,
          and [there are also] her Enthymesis and passion: for they markedly
          distinguish Enthymesis from the passion; and they represent the Æon as
          being restored, and Enthymesis as acquiring form, but the passion,
          when separated from these, as becoming matter. Since, therefore, there
          are thus these three, the Æon, her Enthymesis, and her passion, Judas
          and Matthias, being only two, cannot be the types of them.
