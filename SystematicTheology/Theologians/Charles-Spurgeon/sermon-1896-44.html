          By this psalm every godly man is taught to give thanks to God for the
          mercies bestowed upon himself in particular, and then for the grace
          which God has vouchsafed to all his chosen ones in common, by making a
          covenant of salvation with them in his law, that he might make them
          partakers of his adoption. But the Psalmist chiefly magnifies the
          mercy by which God sustains and bears with his people; and that not on
          account of any merit or worth of theirs, for they only deserve to be
          visited with severe punishment, but because he compassionates their
          frailty. The psalm is at length concluded with a general ascription of
          praise to God.<br />
