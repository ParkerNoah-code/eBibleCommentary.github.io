        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.312)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Thursday Evening, May 3rd, 1860, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Surrey Chapel, Blackfriar's Road,</p>
        <p>ON BEHALF OF THE RELIGIOUS TRACT SOCIETY.</p>
        <p>
          |O Lord, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant and the son of thine
          handmaid thou hast loosed my bonds.| -- Psalm 116:16.
        </p>
        <p>
          THESE SENTENCES SUGGEST a contrast. David's religion was one of
          perfect liberty; -- |Thou hast loosed my bonds.| It was one of
          complete service; -- |Truly l am thy servant. I am thy servant and the
          son of thine handmaid.| Did I say the text suggested a contrast?
          Indeed the two things need never be contrasted, for they are found to
          be but part of one divine experience in the Jives of all God's people.
          The religion of Jesus is the religion of liberty. The true believer
          can say, when his soul is in a healthy state, |Thou hast loosed my
          bonds. The penal fetters with which my soul was once bound are all
          dashed to shivers; I am free!| |There is therefore now no condemnation
          to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh, but
          after the Spirit.| The burdensome bonds of ceremonials are all cast to
          the winds. Henceforth the beggarly elements are trodden under foot;
          shadows have yielded to substance, and the type and the symbol cease
          to oppress; the true light now shineth, and the torches are quenched.
          |Thou hast loosed my bonds,| -- that is to say, thou hast not only
          saved me from the penal consequences of my sin and from the heavy
          burden of the old Mosaic ceremonial law, but thou hast moreover
          delivered me from the spirit of bondage which once led me to serve
          thee with the fear of an unwilling slave. Thou hast taken the yoke
          from my neck, and the goad from behind my back. Thou hast made me thy
          freed man. No more do I crouch at thy feet or go to thy footstool
          cowering like a slave, but l came to thee with privilege of access, up
          to thy very throne. By the Spirit of adoption I cry, my Father. Thou
          dost own the kindred. For by the self-same Spirit I am sealed to the
          day of redemption. Thus, O Lord, |thou hast loosed my bonds.| Nor if
          religion has had its full sway in us, is this all. Thou hast loosed me
          from the bonds of worldly maxims; thou hast delivered me from the fear
          of man; thou hast rescued me from the stooping and fawning which made
          me once the slave of every tyrant who laid claim to my allegiance, and
          thou hast made me now the servant of but one Master, whose service is
          perfect liberty. Whereas before I spoke with bated breath, lest I
          should offend, and even my condolence had continually to yield to the
          whims and prejudices of another man, behold now |thou hast loosed my
          bonds.| As an eagle with my eye on the sun, with wings outstretched
          true to the line upward which I soar, bound no longer to the rooks of
          prejudice or the mounds of worldly maxim -- free, entirely free to
          serve my God without let or hindrance. -- |Thou hast loosed my bonds.|
          Vast and wide is the liberty of the believer. The Antinomian, when he
          essays to describe gospel liberty, only errs by forgetting that such
          liberty is consistent with the fullest service. But we enjoy all the
          liberty that even an Antinomian theology could offer. A liberty to be
          holy is a grander liberty than a license to be sinful. A liberty to be
          conscientious; a liberty to know forgiven sin; a liberty to trample
          upon conquered lusts, this is an infinitely wider liberty than that
          which would permit me to be the comfortable slave of sin, and yet
          indulge the delusive hope that I may one day enter the kingdom of
          heaven. The largest expressions that can ever be used by the boldest
          minister of free grace, cannot here be exaggerations. Luther may
          exhaust his thunders, and Calvin may spend his logic, Zuingle may
          utter his periods with fiery zeal, but after all the grand things that
          have been spoken about the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free,
          we are freer than those men knew. Free as the very air we breathe is
          the Christian, if he live up to his privileges. If he be in bondage at
          all, it is because he hath not as yet yielded his spirit fully to the
          redeeming and emancipating influence of the gospel of the Lord Jesus
          Christ. In the fullest and widest sense therefore, the believer may
          cry, |Thou hast loosed my bonds.| Nor is this liberty merely
          consistent with the profoundest and most reverent service, but the
          service is, indeed, a main characteristic of the exalted freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant and the son of thine
          handmaid.| This does not convict with the sentence that follows it, --
          |Thou hast loosed my bonds.| This fact of my being God's servant is to
          me a proof and evidence, my, and a delightful fruit and effect of my
          having kind my bonds loosed by the great Emancipator, the Lord Jesus
          Christ. Service then, as well as liberty I Service is ordained to be a
          constant characteristic of the true religion of the Lord Jesus Christ.
          |We are not our own, we are bought with a price.| There is not n hair
          upon our head, there is not a passion in our spirit, there is not a
          single power or faculty in our mind which is our own. We are all
          bought -- all purchased, -- we are all, every single particle of us,
          the purchased property of the Lord Jesus Christ -- perfectly free, and
          yet perfectly the property of Jesus -- supremely blest with the widest
          liberty, and yet in the fullest sense the property of another -- the
          shackled servants of the Lord Jesus Christ. This service, my brethren,
          it appears from the text, should be true, -- |O Lord, truly I am thy
          servant | I fear there is very much service of God that only lies in
          terms and words. Men sit and sing hymns, in which they cry --
        </p>
        <p>|And if I might make some reserve,</p>
        <p>And duty did not call;</p>
        <p>I love my God with zeal so great,</p>
        <p>I'd freely give him all.|</p>
        <p>
          But within an hour their nets belie their song. There is much of
          service in our own thought which never comes to service in net. I do
          not doubt but that we often compliment ourselves upon schemes we have
          devised, which fall dead to the ground, like blasted figs, never
          having been carried into effect. We go to our chambers and bend our
          knees, and Satan whispers some word of self-satisfaction to us,
          because we have some project on our soul, some device in our heart,
          though that project has never come to service, has only been an unborn
          intention, has never come into the life of an act. I would that each
          one of us knew more fully the meaning of this word, |truly.| |O Lord,
          truly I am thy servant;| so truly that mine enemies cannot dispute it;
          so truly that if they dare dispute it, my next action shall contradict
          them; so truly that never in any act of my life shall I give them
          reason to suppose the contrary; so truly thy servant, that my thoughts
          yield thee obedience as well as my hands my head as well as my heart;
          my heart as well as my feet. |Truly I am thy servant!| Not so in name
          and by profession, but so by actual deeds of holy endurance, and of
          noble daring for thee. |O Lord, truly I am thy servant.| This service,
          it appears to me also from the text, is continual. |I am thy servant,|
          is the utterance at this moment. |I am thy servant,| is the utterance
          of the next. |I am thy servant,| is my utterance to-day. |I am thy
          servant,| will be my utterance when I come to die. Never should the
          Christian think that any other language will ever be in his lips
          anything less than traitorous. |I am thy servant,| is to be the
          exclamation of the man the moment his spirit knows its sins forgiven.
          |I am thy servant| is to be his constant monitor when he stands
          exposed to temptation; it is to be his continual spur when idleness in
          a Laodicean spirit would make him lukewarm. |I am thy servant| is it
          to be his joy in the time of the hardest of labor. |I am thy servant|
          is to be his song in the time of the sternest suffering. Continually
          and ever we are the servants of God. We may change our masters upon
          earth, but our Master who is in heaven is our Master for ever We may
          cease to serve our country. but we could not cease to serve our God.
          We may cease to be linked with any denomination, but we could not
          cease to be the servants of Christ. Even should it be possible for us
          to be so forgetful of our obligations as to dream for a moment of not
          being the servants of the Church, we could not harbor the thought that
          we should cease to be the servants of Christ. |I am thy servant.| Let
          the next moment repeat it; let the next hour echo it, let the next
          year continue to resound it; let my whole life prolong it; and let
          eternity be a continuation of the solemn swell. |Truly, I am thy
          servant; I am thy servant and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast
          loosed my bonds.|
        </p>
        <p>
          May I take the liberty now after offering you these few remarks by way
          of introduction, as a sort of running commentary upon my text -- may I
          take the liberty of concentrating your thoughts upon one particular,
          during the rest of my sermon. There is one important point which I
          wish to bring before this prevent audience, namely, the duty and the
          excellence of personal service for their Lord and Master. I think I
          shall be warranted in confining my text, although it contains far
          more, to the repetition of that pronoun |I,| |Truly I am thy servant;
          I am thy servant and the son of thine handmaid: thou has loosed my
          bonds.| The personality of the text seems to be conspicuous to allow
          me now to restrain myself to that one topic -- the duty of the
          personal service of Christ. I do feel at this peculiar season, when
          God as visited some parts of our land with rich revival, and when we
          have reason to hope that revival will extend through this great city,
          I do feel just mew that no topic can be more adapted to the times than
          the topic of personal service -- personal consecration of every
          Christian to his Lord's will.
        </p>
        <p>
          This evening, then, I shall first speak upon the nature of personal
          service; secondly, its reasonableness; thirdly, its excellence; and in
          the last place, come to that which is no doubt upon your own minds,
          the special assistance which the Religious Tract Society yields to
          personal effort in the Redeemer's kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, THE NATURE OF PERSONAL SERVICE. Let me explain it by a
          contrast. The service of God among us has grown more and more a
          service by proxy. I would not be censorious. Judge ye what I say, and
          if there be but any measure of truth in it, let the truth come home to
          your soul. Do we not observe even in the outward worship of God, at
          times a great attempt towards worship by proxy? Do we not often hear
          singing -- certainly never in this place -- but do we not often hear
          singing the praises of God confined to some five or six or more
          trained men and women who are to praise God for us? Do we not
          sometimes have the dreary thought, when we are in our churches and
          chapels, that even the prayer is said and prayed by the minister for
          us? There is not always that hearty union in the one great prayer of
          the day which there should be whenever we are gathered together. The
          thought suggests itself continually to the thinking mind, |Is not much
          of the devotion confined to the minister, and to those few who pass
          through the service?|, in fact, we have actually degraded ourselves by
          applying the term |performance| to divine worship. |Performance!| A
          phrase begotten in the theater, which certainly should have spent its
          existence there, has actually been brought into the house of God, and
          the services are now-a-day |performed,| and the worship of God is gone
          through, and the thing is called the |doing duty| of the minister, and
          not the taking delight and the enjoying of a pleasure by the people.
          Do we not observe, too, that in an our churches there is too much
          now-a-day of serving God in acts of benevolence, and acts of public
          instruction through the minister! Your minister is supported; you
          expect him to discharge your duty for you; he is to he the means of
          converting sinners; he is to be the means of comforting the feeble
          minded; in fact, all the mass of duties that belong to the Church are
          considered to belong to the one man who is specially set apart to
          devote himself to the service of the ministry. Oh that this were
          rectified! Would to God that our people could all feel that no support
          of ministers can ever rid them of their own personal responsibility! I
          think I speak in the name of all my brethren in the ministry -- we
          repudiate the idea of taking your responsibility upon ourselves. We
          find that our own work is more than we can perform without our
          Master's strength. To come at last with clean hands before our Maker's
          bar, and to be able to say, |We are free from the blood of all men,|
          will be as much as with the most arduous labors, and the most
          unremitting anxieties, we can expect to attain unto. We cannot take
          your work -- we do not pretend to do so. If you have dreamed of it,
          forget the delusion, and be rid of it once for all. I will do no man's
          duty but my own; I will not attempt to stand sponsor to your
          remissness, and take upon myself the sin of your sloth and lethargy;
          nor will any minister of Christ for a moment think that his most
          arduous efforts, and most self-denying exertions, can for a moment
          acquit you of being guilty of the blood of souls, unless you, each of
          you, do personally the utmost that you can. A sorry contrast to this
          principle, I fear, is presented in many, many a Christian Church. You
          have put one man into the rank, and he is to do all, while you are to
          sit still to be fed, to be edified, to be built up, as if you had
          nothing to do but to be stones and bricks that are to be built up, and
          not living men and women, who are to spend and be spent in the
          Redeemer's cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having thus sought to exhibit by contrast, let me now illustrate the
          nature of this personal service by an actual picture. Look at the
          early days of Christendom -- the Church's pride and glory -- when the
          purest air and the most refreshing dew were upon her mouth -- then was
          the day of personal service. The moment a man was converted to God in
          those days, he became a preacher; perhaps, within a week, a martyr.
          Every man then was a witness, -- not here and there a bishop, or now
          and then a confessor -- but every Christian whether he moved in
          Caesar's household, or whether he moved, like Lydia, in the pursuits
          of humble commerce -- every believer had a part in the service, and
          sought to magnify the name of his Master. Within but a few centuries
          after the death of Christ, the cross had been uplifted in every land;
          the name of Jesus had been pronounced in every known dialect;
          missionaries had passed through the deserts had penetrated into the
          remote recesses of uncivilized countries; the whole earth was at
          least, nominally evangelized.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what has befallen us now, my brethren? The results of the labors
          of the Church through a space of years -- what are they? They dribble
          into utter insignificance, when compared with the triumphs of the
          Apostolic times, and my own conviction is, that next to what I fear is
          the great cause -- the absence of the Spirit's influence -- next to
          that, and perhaps first of all, is the absence of personal agency in
          the service of the Lord Jesus Christ, whereby the Spirit is manifested
          in the diversities of his operations. What conqueror or mighty warrior
          could expect to will a campaign if his troops should vote that one in
          a hundred should be supported by their rations -- that one in a
          hundred should go to battle? No, ye legions! you must every one of you
          draw swords. Every heart must be stout, and every arm must be strong;
          the line must not be composed of here and there a warrior and an
          interval between, but every man must march forward, with the spirit of
          a lion and the strength of God, to do battle against the common enemy
          of souls. We shall never see great things in the world tin we have all
          roused ourselves to our personal responsibilities. God will not give
          the honor of saving the world to his ministers. He meant it for his
          Church; and until his Church is prepared to grasp it, God will
          withhold the grown which he has prepared for her brow, and for hers
          alone, and which none but she can over will. I think you may readily
          understand then what I mean by personal service. I mean this: if there
          be poor, it is not for you to subscribe to a society that shall send
          out paid agents for their relief but as far as lieth in you to visit
          them in their homes, and with your own hands supply them the bounty of
          a Christian heart. It is not for you to say the City Mission supplies
          admirably the lack of a sufficient number of ministers; the whole lack
          is supplied, I may be idle. It is for you to instruct them. You are to
          be as a burning and a shining light in the midst of this dark
          generation. Personal service is for you; it is for you to say, |Though
          I am content with my minister's labors, I cannot be content with my
          own. I must have more, and more, and more to do. I desire to spend all
          that I have in Jesus Christ's cause, and not to keep back a single
          power which I possess, but to be continually the living servant of the
          living God.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Having thus explained the nature of personal service, let me pass
          on to observe THE REASONABLENESS OF THIS PERSONAL SERVICE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heir of heaven, blood-bought and blood-washed, Jesus did not save thee
          by another. He did not sit in heaven himself at ease and then array
          Gabriel in his power and might and send him down to suffer, bleed, and
          die for you; but |He, his own self,| -- mark the strong expression of
          Scripture -- |His own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree.
          |He might send out apostles and seventy disciples to preach, but he
          never relaxed his service when he employed others. He might kindle
          other lights, but he did not quench his own. He was himself your
          servant. He washed the disciples' feet, not through the medium of
          another disciple, but with his own hands. They fed the hungry, but he
          himself multiplied the fishes and brake the bread. He sent the gospel
          into the world, but not by missionaries, but by himself; he became his
          own preacher, his own expounder and then left the truth to be taken up
          by others, when he himself had ascended into glory. By the streaming
          veins, then, of the Lord Jesus Christ; by the blessed body which for
          your sake endured the curse -- the curse of toil, aggravated till it
          became not the sweat of the face, but the sweat of the heart in very
          drops of blood -- by these I hold the reasonableness of your personal
          service to him; and |I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies
          of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
          acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But, again, have you not a personal religion? You are not content with
          promises that are held in a sort of |joint stock| by the entire
          community; you long to have in your own heart the personal cry of
          adoption; nothing but vital personal union to the ton of God can ever
          satisfy you. You are not content with the general election; you feel
          that you must have a personal election and a personal calling. You
          long to read your title clear to mansions in the skies. The charter of
          free grace, bright as it is, doth not satisfy you unless you can see
          your name amongst its inheritors. All the broad acres of the promises
          cannot charm you, you can walk over them and can them your own. You
          live, if you be a true Christian, you live upon the personal
          realization of your interest in that covenant of grace. What more
          reasonable than that you should give personal service? Were I
          preaching to those who were dolts, this might be seen and felt too;
          but I speak to those who are wise men, because they have been taught
          of God, and I say -- what can be a more logical conclusion than that
          personal benefits enjoyed, and personal blessings received, should be
          reciprocated by personal cervices rendered?
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, let me remark to you that this personal service is
          reasonable, from the fact that personal service is the only kind of
          service at all available. I scarcely know whether you can serve God
          except by individual consecration. All that your minister can do is
          already due from him to God. You could not say before the eternal
          throne, |Great God, I am thy servant, but I serve thee by another.|
          Might he not reply, |That other was my servant too?| Here is a man who
          has spent his whole life, and whom you have felt to do so; does he
          come before God and cry, |Great God, I have done all, and I have a
          surplus left to supplement the dilatory character of my fellows?| No;
          when we have done all, we are unprofitable servant; we have done no
          more than it was our duty to have done. How, then, can you by any
          means hope that you can serve God through us, when eve ourselves feel
          we cannot reach the mark to which we would have aspired in our own
          personal service to Jesus? Oh I brothers and sisters, if you will but
          think of it, all your idea of showing your gratitude to God by making
          another man to carry your burden on his back, is founded on idleness,
          and cannot be maintained in righteousness. More might I say, but I
          choose instead thereof to appeal to you thus: -- Does not the
          reasonableness of personal service strike you at once? If it does not,
          there was a time when it did. E thou be a child of God, there was a
          season when argument was quite unnecessary to thee. Dost thou remember
          the time when thy sins lay heavily upon thy breast, and thou didst cry
          both night end day, |God be merciful to me a sinner?| Hast thou
          forgotten that glad hour when at the foot of Mercy's cross all the
          strings were loosed that bound that burden to thy back, and thou west
          free? Hast thou forgotten, then, those feelings of devout gratitude
          which made thee fall to the ground and cry, |My Master, take me; make
          something of me; do what thou wilt with me, only let me serve thee?|
          Most thou remember that hot haste in which thou didst rush into the
          world to tell to another the secret which God had whispered in thine
          ear? Dost thou remember now that first month of thy consecration to
          God, when thou couldest not do enough, when thou didst long to be rid
          even of necessary worldly employment's, that thou mightest devote
          thyself to God? Methinks I hear those sighs of thine now, -- |O that I
          were a doorkeeper in the house of my God I O that I could serve my
          Master with all my might, and with all my strength!| Ah, brethren I
          and if thou needest argument now, what doth it betoken but that thou
          best lost thy first love, and that thou hast fallen from the height of
          thy consecration? It seems to be believed by some men, who pretend to
          deep experience, that the love of Christians necessarily cools after
          conversion. I am sure it ought not to do so; and if it does, it were a
          feet which were disgraceful to us. To my mind, it is palpable that if
          we loved our Master much when we first knew him, we ought to love him
          with a tenfold degree of fervent attachment after we have known him
          more. Certain I am, if we have seen Christ, the very Christ, and have
          verily seen him, we shall be more deeply in love with him every day;
          whereas at first we thought him lovely, we shall come to know him so;
          and whereas once we thought anything we could do would be too little,
          we shall come to think that everything we could do would not be
          enough. I question that man's love altogether, who has to say of it,
          that it grew cold after a little season. What! Is the work of God's
          Spirit but a sort of spasmodic twitching. Is this all the Spirit does,
          to lay the lash upon the back of the ass and make it go its jaded
          journey for an instant with a little more quickened pace? Surely not
          God doth not thus work. It were an inferior work to any which is
          exhibited in nature if this were all he did. And shall grace be second
          to the deeds of nature? Does God send the planets on in their orbits,
          and do they continue to roll, and after he hath made a creature serve
          him, will he stop? Does he light the sun and does he blaze for ever,
          and will he kindle our zeal, and shall it soon be quenched? Is God's
          grace as the smoke from the chimney, as the morning cloud, and as the
          early dew that passeth away? God forbid that we should harbour the
          idea! No, brethren; and personal service, personal continued service
          too, is but the reasonable effect of that grace which God gave us at
          the first, and which he continues to give us every hour, and will give
          us till we mount to eternal glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now let me advance to my third point -- PERSONAL SERVICE --
          ITS EXCELLENCE,
        </p>
        <p>
          This excellence is so manifold, that had I some three hours to preach
          in, I might continue to go through the list and not exhaust it. Among
          the first of its charms, personal service is the main argument of the
          Christian religion against the sceptic. The sceptic says the religion
          of Christ is maintained by men who make a gain of godliness. |Your
          living is dependent upon your advocating the canes,| says the infidel.
          Even to our missionaries this is often said, and though an unworthy
          suspicion and utterly untrue of men who sacrifice much even when they
          gain most, uttered to men who in any other service might soon grow
          rich -- in their Masters service seldom, if ever -- yet nevertheless,
          the taunt being never so unworthy, it has great power over unthinking
          minds. Let the Church, however, but beam to work unanimously; lot
          every private man have his mission, let every man and woman beam to
          build nearest to their own house, and from that day scepticism begins
          to lose, at least; one of its argument; and with it, it loses one of
          its most formidable elements -- one of its deadliest weapons with
          which it has attacked the Church. |See there, see there,| says the
          infidel, |there is an honest man, though he be an honest fool he does
          at least believe what he says, for he does it not by word, but
          personally, he doer it not by another, but by himself; not because he
          is paid for it, but because he loves it.| Oh, sirs! it were greatly to
          the confusion of infidelity, if not to in utter destruction, if the
          whole Church could once see in its proper light, and carry out in its
          full measure, the grand doctrine of personal service. But further, I
          am persuaded that while it would be a grand argument against sceptics,
          it would be one of the greatest means of deciding that glass of
          waverers, who, although they are not skeptical, are negligent of the
          things of the kingdom. There is no way to make another man earnest
          like being earnest one's-self. If I see others who neglect the great
          salvation, and is I neglect it too, I patronize, and aid, and abet
          them in their neglect; but if that man sees me earnest about his
          salvation, he begins at once to put to himself the question, |Why is
          this? Here am I asleep and going down into hell, and this man who is
          no relation of mine, and who has no personal interest in me, is
          grieved, pained, and vexed because I am going wrong, and he cannot
          rest and be quiet because he fears I am in danger of the wrath to
          come.| Oh! my brethren, there would be more souls, I do believe, moved
          to earnestness by earnestness, than by aught else. The closest logic,
          the most mighty rhetoric never convinced a soul so well as that
          mightiest of logic and of rhetoric -- the earnestness of a true
          Christian. Let men who are now slothful see us in earnest, and they
          will begin to follow in our wake, God will bless our example to them,
          and through us they will be saved. But further, the excellency of
          personal service, it strikes me, is not confined to the good we do,
          but should be argued from the good we get. We have in our Churches,
          men and women who are always looking for an opportunity for
          quarreling. If there be a member who has made the slightest slip, they
          report it to the public, they tell it in Gath, and publish it in the
          streets of Askelon. There is nothing that is right. If you do a thing
          to-day, it is wrong; if you were to alter it to-morrow, it would be
          just as wrong. They are never consistent in anything but in their
          inconsistent grumbling. The mightiest cure for the Church is to set
          them to work. Armies are troublesome things, even emperors find they
          must allow these hungry things to blunt their appetite with war. The
          Church itself can never be much blessed while it hath division in its
          own ranks. Its very activity will cause disorder; the very earnestness
          in the Christian will cause confusion, unless you lead forth that
          earnestness to its proper field of development. I have always found
          that where there is a quarrelsome Church, it is sure to be an idle
          Church, and where men are always |at it,| they have very little time
          to find fault with one another. When we fuse iron, the two pieces will
          soon weld, bring two cold pieces together, and the stoutest arm and
          the heaviest hammer can never weld them. Let our Churches be united
          and they will be earnest; let them be cold, and they will be dashed to
          a thousand shivers. |And moreover, we have a large class of poor
          creatures, who, while not discontent with others, are discontent with
          themselves. They don't fight with other people, but they seem to be
          incessantly quarreling with a personal jealousy of their ownselves.
          They are not what they like to be, and they are not what they wish to
          be, and they don't feel as they should feel, and they don't think as
          they would like to think. They are always plunging their finger into
          their own eyes a, because they cannot see so well as they would wish,
          always ripping up the wounds they have, because those wounds smart,
          making themselves miserable in order that they may be happy, and at
          last, crying themselves into an inconsolable state of misery, they
          acquire a habit of mourning, until that mourning seems to be the only
          bliss they know. To use a homely illustration, and one which will be
          remembered, if another might not, the swiftest way for these cold
          souls to warm themselves is by setting them at once to work. When we
          were boys, we have sometimes gathered round our father's fire in the
          winter time, and almost sat upon it, yet we could not get wane; we
          rubbed our fingers, but they stir kept blue, at length our father
          wisely turned us out of doors and bade us work, and after some healthy
          pastime we soon came in with limbs no longer benumbed; the blood was
          circulated, and what tire could not do, exercise soon accomplished.
          Ministers of Christ, if your people cry to you, |Comfort us! comfort
          us! -- comfort them, and make the fire a good one; at the same time
          remember that all the fire you can ever kindle, will not warm them so
          long as they are idle. If they are idle they cannot be warm. God will
          not have his people eat the fat and drink the sweet, unless they are
          prepared to carry their burden and give a portion to others as well as
          seek meat for themselves. The benefit of personal service then is not
          confined to others, but will come to be enjoyed even by those who
          engage in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example or two here may tend to enforce the lesson I am anxious to
          inculcate. If you wish to prove the truth of this, you can begin to
          make a tolerable experiment in the course of the next half-hour. Do
          you want to feel grateful? Do not go home and get the hymn-book down.
          Just go down this street here, and take the first turning to the left
          or the right, whichever you please. Go up the first pair of stairs you
          come to; you see a little room; perhaps the husband has come home by
          now -- come home weary, and there is a swarm of children, all dirty,
          and so to live and sleep in; perhaps, that one room. Well, if you will
          only take a view of that with your own eyes, and then go home to your
          own house, you will begin to feel grateful. Or rise up to-morrow
          morning, and go to another house, and see a poor creature stretched on
          the bed of languishing, dependent on the parish allowance, and worse
          than that, dying with| our hope knowing nothing of God. or of the-way
          of salvation, and if that does not make you grateful when you think of
          your own interest in the precious blood of Jesus. I know nothing that
          will. Again, you want to be zealous and earnest. Next Sabbath morning
          walk down the New Cut, and if the open depravity does not make you
          earnest, your blood is fish's blood, and you have not the warmth of
          man's blood in you. Just see how the street is thronged all day with
          those who buy and sell, and get gain, while you are meeting in the
          house of God for prayer and praise. If that should not satisfy you,
          and you want to feel peculiarly zealous take your walk abroad and not
          only look on but begin to act. Take your stand amidst the crowd near
          the Victoria Theatre, and try to preach, and if you do not feel
          desirous when you hear their clamours and see their anxious eyes, as
          if they longed to hear you with eyes as wed as ears -- if that does
          not make you zealous, I know of nothing that will make you so. Take a
          handful of tracts in your hand, and a handful of coppers in your
          pocket -- two good things together, and give some of each to the poor
          people, and they will recollect you; and after you have gone to those
          -- the poorest and the most depraved -- if you do not go home with a
          feeling of gratitude mingled with one of earnest zeal for the
          salvation of souls, I do not know what remedy I can prescribe. I wish
          some of you fine ladies and gentlemen had the walking down some of out
          courts and alleys -- nay; I would wish you to have a special treat
          that you might always remember. I would like you to sleep one night at
          a lodging-house, I should dike you to eat one meal with the poor man;
          I should like you to sit in the midst of one drunken brawl, I should
          wish you to see one poor wife, her face all bleeding, where a brutal
          and degrading husband ha. been striking her; I should like you to
          spend one Sabbath in the midst of sin and debauchery; I should like
          you to see one scene of vice, and then hurry you away once and for
          all. Methinks, if I took you there not only to see, but to act and
          cooperate in some holy deed of service; book you there that you might
          thrust your hand into the kennel, and bring up some lost jewel; that
          you might thrust your finger into the very fire, that you might pluck
          some bread from the burning, I think that usefulness would not be all
          on the part of others, but to a great degree react upon your own
          heart. You would go home and say, |I could not have behaved it; I
          could not have imagined that the necessities of this city were so
          great; that the need of praying and preaching, and generous
          liberality, could have been one-tenth so huge.| I am sure if you be
          Christians, from that time forward, you would be more indefatigable in
          your industry, and more unlimited in your gifts than before. I must
          not tarry longer, time reproves me, though if it be that any of you
          shall carry thou out in practice, the time employed in persuading you
          will be well spent.
        </p>

          IV. I want now for a minute or two, to come to that Society, for which
          I stand here to plead to-night, and observe ITS PECULIAR ADAPTATION TO
          PERSONAL SERVICE.
        </p>
        <p>
          We love the Missionary Society, both for home and abroad, though it
          does in measure help us to serve God by proxy. I love the Bible
          Society, because that enables me to serve God personally. For the same
          reason, I moat ever love the Religious Tract Society, because that
          enables me, nay, compels me, if I would do anything, to do it myself.
          I think I need only just mention one or two particulars. The peculiar
          form of usefulness which the Religious Tract Society lays hold upon,
          is admirably adapted to those persons who have but little power and
          little ability, but nevertheless, wish to do something for Christ.
          They have not the tongue of the eloquent, but they may have the hand
          of the diligent. They cannot stand and preach, but they can stand and
          distribute here and there these silent preachers. They do not feel
          that they could subscribe their guinea, but they may buy their
          thousand tracts, and these they can distribute broadcast. How many a
          little one in Zion has spent his life in doing this good, when he
          could not perhaps have found any other good within his reach. This
          however, is but the beginning -- the smallest part of the matter. And
          when men begin with little efforts for Christ, such as the giving away
          of a tract, they become stronger to do something else afterwards. I
          speak personally to-night -- and excuse the allusion -- I remember the
          first service which my youthful heart rendered to Christ, was the
          doing up of tracts in envelopes, that might send them, with the hope
          that by choosing pertinent tracts, applicable to person. I knew, and
          then sealing them up, that God would bless them. And I well remember
          telling them and distributing them in a town in England where tracts
          had never been distributed before, and going from house to house, and
          telling in humble language, the things of the kingdom of God. I might
          have done nothing, if I had not been encouraged by finding myself able
          to do something. I sought to do something more and then from that
          something more, and now have I got beyond. And so I do not doubt that
          many of the servants of God have been led on to do something higher
          and nobler, because the first step was for good.
        </p>
        <p>
          I look upon the giving away of a religious tract as only the first
          step for action not to be compared with many another deed done for
          Christ; but were it not for the first step we might never reach to the
          second but that first attained, we are encouraged to take another, and
          so at the last, God helping us, we may be made extensively useful
          Besides, there is this to be said for the Society, that it does not
          make a man perform an act which looks like service but which is not.
          There is a real service of Christ in the distribution of the gospel in
          its printed form, a service the result of which heaven alone shall
          disclose, and the judgment-day alone discover. How many thousands have
          been carried to heaven instrumentally upon the wings of these tracts,
          none can tell. I might say, if it were right to quote such a
          Scripture, |The leaves were for the healing of the nations,| -- verily
          they are so. Scattered where the whole tree could scarcely be carried,
          the very leaves have had a medicinal and a healing virtue in them and
          the real word of truth, the simple statement of a Savior crucified and
          of a sinner who shall be saved by simply trusting in the Savior, has
          been greatly blessed, and many thousand souls have been led into the
          kingdom of heaven by this simple means.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now what shall I say to bind up what has been already said into a
          compact form! Let each one of us, if we have done nothing for Christ,
          begin to do something now. The distribution of tracts is the first
          thing. Let us do that and attempt something else by-and-bye. Are we,
          on the other hand, diligently engaged already in some higher service
          for Christ, let us not despise those steps which helped us up, but let
          us now assist others with these steps that they too may rise from the
          grade of service which is theirs to a higher and a greater one. Let us
          in fact encourage this society at all times with our contributions and
          with our prayers. I would remind you that during this year the Tract
          Society has sent abroad some forty-two millions of tracts -- some four
          and a half millions more than last year. These have been sent
          throughout the whole earth. Extensive as man, I may say has been the
          action of this society -- not confined to any sect or denomination, or
          any class or clime. It has labored for all, and an Christians have
          labored with it, and God has given it a large measure of success.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I may leave it in your hands to-night; but permit me this one
          word ere I bid you farewell. Many of you I shall never see again, and
          I remember that my own sermon tells me that I have personal service to
          perform for Christ. It is not enough for me to urge you to do it, I
          must do it too. My hearers, imagine not that any service you can do
          for Christ will save your souls if you are unrenewed. If your faith is
          not fixed in Jesus, your best works will be but splendid sins. All the
          performance of duties will not affect your salvation. Cease from your
          own righteousness, cease from all deeds of working out life, and
          |believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.| Trust
          Jesus, and you are saved, trust self, and you are lost. Just as you
          are, cast yourselves on Christ. I remember Dr. Hawker concluding an
          admirable discourse with these brief words: -- The words were
          addressed to Rebecca of old: |Wilt thou go with this man?| Let me
          conclude with the like words: -- Souls, will ye go with Christ? Will
          ye go to Christ?| |I would go with him,| saith one, |but would he have
          me.| Did he ever reject one that came to him? |I would go with
          Christ,| saith another, |but I am naked.| He will clothe thee. |I
          would go to him,| says a third, |but I am filthy.| He can cleanse you;
          nay, his own blood shall wash you, and his own veins will supply the
          purifying stream. |I would go with him, saith another, | but I am
          diseased and leprous, and cannot walk with him.| Ah! but he is a great
          physician, and he can heal thee. Come as thou art to Christ. Many say,
          |But I cannot come.| I remember a raying in the North of Ireland, in
          the revival, which just hits the mark. The young converts will say to
          one another, when one says, |I cannot come.| |Brother, come if you
          can, and if you can't come, come as you can.| Will you not come, when
          by coming to Christ you may save your soul? We do not know what faith
          is when we say to ourselves, |It is a something so mysterious I cannot
          reach it.| Faith is trusting Christ. It is the end of mystery and the
          beginning of simplicity; the giving up of all those idle feelings and
          believings that aught else can save the soul, and the reception of
          that one master thought, that Christ Jesus is exalted on high to be a
          Prince and a Savior, to give repentance and remission of sins. Never
          soul perished trusting Jesus, never heart was blasted with perdition
          that had confidently rested itself upon the cross. There is thy hope,
          poor shipwrecked mariner, yonder constellation of the cross with those
          five stars, the wounds of Jesus Look there and live. One glance and
          thou art saved. Those soul-quickening words, |Believe and live,|
          comprehend the whole gospel of God. May the Divine Spirit lead you now
          out of self unto Christ. O Lord! command thy blessing for Jesus' sake.
          Amen.<br />
