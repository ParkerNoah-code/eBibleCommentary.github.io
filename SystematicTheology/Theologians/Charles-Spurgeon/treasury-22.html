<p align="center">PSALM 22 <br/>
 </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">TITLE. "To the chief Musician. To the tune, "The Hind of 
    the morning". A Psalm of David."</p>
<p align="justify">This ode of singular excellence was committed to the most 
    excellent of the temple songsters; the chief among ten thousand is worthy to 
    be extolled by the chief Musician; no meaner singer must have charge of such 
    a strain; we must see to it that we call up our best abilities when Jesus is 
    the theme of praise. </p>
<p align="justify">Our Lord Jesus is so often compared to a hind, and his 
    cruel huntings are so pathetically described in this most affecting psalm, 
    that we cannot but believe that the title indicates the Lord Jesus under a 
    well-known poetical metaphor; at any rate, Jesus is the Hind of the morning 
    concerning whom David here sings.</p>
<p align="justify">SUBJECT. This is beyond all others THE PSALM OF THE 
    CROSS. It may have been actually repeated word by word by our Lord when 
    hanging on the cruel tree; it would be too bold to say that it was so, but 
    even a casual reader may see that it might have been. </p>
<p align="justify">It begins with, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken 
    me?" and ends, according to some, in the original with "It is finished." For 
    plaintive expressions uprising from unutterable depths of woe we may say of 
    this psalm, "there is none like it." </p>
<p align="justify">It is the photograph of our Lord's saddest hours, the 
    record of his dying words, the lachrymatory of his last tears, the memorial 
    of his expiring joys. </p>
<p align="justify">David and his afflictions may be here in a very modified 
    sense, but, as the star is concealed by the light of the sun, <i>he who sees 
    Jesus will probably neither see nor care to see David</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">Before us we have a description both of the darkness and 
    of the glory of the cross, the <i>sufferings </i>of Christ and the <i>glory
    </i>which shall follow.<i> Oh for grace to draw near and see this great 
    sight! </i>We should read reverently, putting off our shoes from off our 
    feet, as Moses did at the burning bush, for if there be holy ground anywhere 
    in Scripture it is in this psalm.</p>
<p align="justify">DIVISION. </p>
<p align="justify">From the commencement to the twenty-first verse is a most 
    pitiful cry for help.</p>
<p align="justify">From verse 21 to 31 is a most precious foretaste of 
    deliverance. </p>
<p align="justify">The first division may be subdivided at the tenth verse, 
    from verse 1 to 10 being an appeal based upon covenant relationship; and 
    from verse 10 to 21 being an equally earnest plea derived from the imminence 
    of his peril.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</p></b> 
    This was the startling cry of Golgotha: <i>Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani. </i>
    The Jews mocked, but the angels adored when Jesus cried this exceeding 
    bitter cry. Nailed to the tree we behold our great Redeemer in extremities, 
    and what do we see? Having <i>ears </i>to hear let us hear, and having <i>
    eyes </i>to see let us see! Let us gaze with holy wonder, and mark the 
    flashes of light amid the awful darkness of that midday-midnight. 
<p align="justify">First, our Lord's <i>faith </i>beams forth and deserves 
    our reverent imitation; he keeps his hold upon his God with both hands and 
    cries twice, "My God, my God!" The spirit of adoption was strong within the 
    suffering Son of Man, and he felt no doubt about his interest in his God. Oh 
    that we could imitate this cleaving to an afflicting God! </p>
<p align="justify">Nor does the sufferer distrust the power of God to 
    sustain him, for the title used, "El"—signifies strength, and is the name of 
    the Mighty God. He knows the Lord to be the all-sufficient support and 
    support of his spirit, and therefore appeals to him in the agony of grief, 
    but not in the misery of doubt. He would gladly know why he has left, he 
    raises that question and repeats it, but neither the power nor the 
    faithfulness of God does he mistrust. </p>
<p align="justify">What an inquiry is this before us! "Why have you forsaken 
    me?" We must lay the emphasis on every word of this saddest of all 
    utterances. </p>
<p align="justify">"Why?" what is the great cause of such a strange fact as 
    for God to leave his own Son at such a time and in such a plight? There was 
    no cause in him, why then was he deserted? </p>
<p align="justify">"Have" it is done, and the Savior is feeling its dread 
    effect as he asks the question; it is surely true, but how mysterious! It 
    was no threatening of forsaking which made the great Surety cry aloud, he 
    endured that forsaking in very deed. </p>
<p align="justify">"You" I can understand why traitorous Judas and timid 
    Peter should be gone, but you, my God, my faithful friend, how can <i>you
    </i>leave me? This is worst of all, yes, worse than all put together. Hell 
    itself has for its fiercest flame the separation of the soul from God. </p>
<p align="justify">"Forsaken" if you had chastened I might bear it, for your 
    face would shine; but to forsake me utterly, ah! why is this? </p>
<p align="justify">"Me" your innocent, obedient, suffering Son, why leave 
    you me to perish? <i>A sight of self seen by penitence, and of Jesus on the 
    cross seen by faith, will best expound this question. </i>Jesus is forsaken 
    because our sins had separated between us and our God.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"Why are you so far from helping me, and from the words 
    of my roaring?"</p></b> The Man of Sorrows had prayed until his speech failed 
    him, and he could only utter moanings and groanings as men do in severe 
    sicknesses, like the roarings of a wounded animal. To what extremity of 
    grief was our Master driven? What strong crying and tears were those which 
    made him too hoarse for speech! What must have been his anguish to find his 
    own beloved and trusted Father standing afar off, and neither granting help 
    nor apparently hearing prayer! This was good cause to make him "roar." Yet 
    there was reason for all this which those who rest in Jesus as their 
    Substitute well know.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. "O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not 
    hear."</p></b> For our prayers to appear to be unheard is no new trial, Jesus 
    felt it before us, and it is observable that he still held fast his 
    believing hold on God, and cried still, "My God." On the other hand his 
    faith did not render him less importunate, for amid the hurry and horror of 
    that dismal day he ceased not his cry, even as in Gethsemane he had agonized 
    all through the gloomy night. Our Lord continued to pray even though no 
    comfortable answer came, and in this he set us an example of obedience to 
    his own words, "men ought always to pray, and not to faint." No daylight is 
    too glaring, and no midnight too dark to pray in; and no delay or apparent 
    denial, however grievous, should tempt us to forbear from importunate 
    pleading.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. "But you are holy, O you who inhabits the 
    praises of Israel."</p></b> However ill things may look, there is no ill in you, 
    O God! We are very apt to think and speak hardly of God when we are under 
    his afflicting hand, but not so the obedient Son. He knows too well his 
    Father's goodness to let outward circumstances libel his character. There in 
    no unrighteousness with the God of Jacob, he deserves no censure; let him do 
    what he will, he is to be praised, and to reign enthroned amid the songs of 
    his chosen people. 
<p align="justify">If prayer be unanswered it is not because God is 
    unfaithful, but for some other good and weighty reason. If we cannot 
    perceive any ground for the delay, we must leave the riddle unsolved, but we 
    must not fly in God's face in order to invent an answer. While the holiness 
    of God is in the highest degree acknowledged and adored, the afflicted 
    speaker in this verse seems to marvel how the holy God could forsake him, 
    and be silent to his cries. The argument is, you are holy. Oh! why is it 
    that you do disregard your holy One in his hour of sharpest anguish? We may 
    not question the holiness of God, but we may argue from it, and use it as a 
    plea in our petitions.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. "Our fathers trusted in you: they trusted, and 
    you delivered them."</p></b> This is the rule of life with all the chosen 
    family. Three times over is it mentioned, they trusted, and trusted, and 
    trusted, and never left off trusting, for it was their very life; and they 
    fared well too, for you did deliver them. Out of all their straits, 
    difficulties, and miseries, faith brought them by calling their God to the 
    rescue; but in the case of our Lord it appeared as if faith would bring no 
    assistance from Heaven, he alone of all the trusting ones was to remain 
    without deliverance. 
<p align="justify">The experience of other saints may be a great consolation 
    to us when in deep waters if faith can be sure that their deliverance will 
    be ours; but when we feel ourselves sinking, it is poor comfort to know that 
    others are swimming. </p>
<p align="justify">Our Lord here pleads the past dealings of God with his 
    people as a reason why he should not be left alone; here again he is an 
    example to us in the skillful use of the weapon of all-prayer. The use of 
    the plural pronoun "our" shows how one with his people Jesus was even on the 
    cross. We say, "Our Father which are in Heaven," and he calls those "our 
    fathers" through whom we came into the world, although he was without father 
    as to the flesh.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. "They cried unto you, and were delivered; they 
    trusted in you, and were not confounded."</p></b> As if he had said, "How is it 
    that I am now left without support in my overwhelming griefs, while all 
    others have been helped? We may remind the Lord of his former 
    loving-kindnesses to his people, and beseech him to be still the same. This 
    is true wrestling; let us learn the art. 
<p align="justify">Observe, that ancient saints cried and trusted, and that 
    in trouble we must do the same; and the invariable result was that they were 
    not ashamed of their hope, for deliverance came in due time; this same happy 
    portion shall be ours. The prayer of faith can do the deed when nothing else 
    can. Let us wonder when we see Jesus using the same pleas as ourselves, and 
    immersed in griefs far deeper than our own.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. "But I am a worm, and no man."</p></b> This verse is 
    a miracle in language. How could the Lord of glory be brought to such 
    abasement as to be not only lower than the angels, but even lower than men.
    <i>What a contrast between "I AM" and "I am a worm"! </i>Yet such a double 
    nature was found in the person of our Lord Jesus when bleeding upon the 
    tree. <i>He felt himself to be comparable to a helpless, powerless, 
    down-trodden worm, passive while crushed, and despised by those who trod 
    upon him</i>. He selects the weakest of creatures, and becomes, when trodden 
    upon, writhing, quivering flesh, utterly devoid of any might except strength 
    to suffer. This was a true likeness of himself when his body and soul had 
    become a mass of misery—the very essence of agony—in the dying pangs of 
    crucifixion. 
<p align="justify">Man by nature is but a worm; but our Lord puts himself 
    even beneath man, on account of the scorn that was heaped upon him and the 
    weakness which he felt, and therefore he adds, <b>"and no man." </b>The 
    privileges and blessings which belonged to the fathers he could not obtain 
    while deserted by God, and common acts of humanity were not allowed him, for 
    he was rejected of men. He was outlawed from the society of earth, and shut 
    out from the smile of Heaven. </p>
<p align="justify">How utterly did the Savior empty himself of all glory, 
    and become of no reputation for our sakes! </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"A reproach of men"</p></b>—their common butt and jest; a 
    byword and a proverb unto them—the sport of the rabble, and the scorn of the 
    rulers. Oh the caustic power of reproach, to those who endure it with 
    patience—yet smart under it most painfully! 
<b>
<p align="justify">"And despised of the people.</p></b>" The voice of the people 
    was against him. The very people who would once have crowned him then 
    despised him; and those who were benefitted by his cures, sneered at him in 
    his woes. Sin is worthy of all reproach and contempt, and for this reason 
    Jesus, the Sin-bearer, was given up to be thus unworthily and shamefully 
    entreated.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. "All they that see me laugh me to scorn."</p></b> 
    Read the evangelistic narrative of the ridicule endured by the Crucified 
    One, and then consider, in the light of this expression, how it grieved him. 
    The iron entered into his soul. 
<p align="justify">Mockery has for its distinctive description "cruel 
    mockings;" those endured by our Lord were of the most cruel kind. The 
    scornful ridicule of our Lord was universal—all sorts of men were unanimous 
    in the derisive laughter, and vied with each other in insulting him. Priests 
    and people, Jews and Gentiles, soldiers and civilians—all united in the 
    general scoff, and that at the time when he was prostrate in weakness and 
    ready to die.<i> Which shall we wonder at the most—the cruelty of man or the 
    love of the bleeding Savior? How can we ever complain of ridicule after 
    this?</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"They shoot out the lip, they shake the head."</p></b> These 
    were gestures of contempt. Pouting, grinning, shaking of the head, thrusting 
    out of the tongue, and other modes of derision were endured by our patient 
    Lord. Men made faces at him before whom angels veil their faces and adore. 
    The basest signs of disgrace which disdain could devise were maliciously 
    cast at him. They punned upon his prayers, they made matter for laughter of 
    his sufferings, and set him utterly at nothing. Herbert sings of our Lord as 
    saying,
<p align="justify">"Shame tears my soul, my body many a wound;<br/>
    Sharp nails pierce this, but sharper that confound;<br/>
    Reproaches which are free, while I am bound.<br/>
    Was ever grief like mine?"</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. "Saying, He trusted on the Lord that he would 
    deliver him; let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him."</p></b> Here the 
    taunt is cruelly aimed at the sufferer's faith in God, which is the 
    tenderest point in a godly man's soul, the very apple of his eye. They must 
    have learned the diabolical art from Satan himself, for they made rare 
    proficiency in it. 
<p align="justify">According to Matthew 27:39-44, there were five forms of 
    taunt hurled at the Lord Jesus. This special piece of mockery is probably 
    mentioned in this psalm because it is the most bitter of the whole. It has a 
    biting, sarcastic irony in it, which gives it a peculiar venom. It must have 
    stung the Man of Sorrows to the quick. </p>
<p align="justify">When we are tormented in the same manner, let us remember 
    him who endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, and we shall 
    be comforted. </p>
<p align="justify">On reading these verses one is ready, with Trapp, to ask<i>, 
    Is this a prophecy or a history? </i>for the description is so accurate. We 
    must not lose sight of the truth which was unwittingly uttered by the Jewish 
    scoffers. They themselves are witnesses that Jesus of Nazareth trusted in 
    God—why then was he permitted to perish? Jehovah had aforetime delivered 
    those who rolled their burdens upon him—why was this man deserted? Oh that 
    they had understood the answer! </p>
<p align="justify">Note further, that their ironic jest, "seeing he 
    delighted in him," was true. The Lord did delight in his dear Son, and when 
    he was found in fashion as a man, and became obedient unto death, he still 
    was well pleased with him. <i>Strange mixture! Jehovah delights in him—and 
    yet bruises him! Jehovah is well pleased with him—and yet slays him.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. "But you are he who took me out of the womb."</p></b> 
    Kindly providence attends with tenderness at every human birth; but the Son 
    of Man, who was marvelously begotten of the Holy Spirit, was in an especial 
    manner watched over by the Lord when brought forth by Mary. The destitute 
    state of Joseph and Mary, far away from friends and home, led them to see 
    the cherishing hand of God in the safe delivery of the mother, and the happy 
    birth of the child. That Child now fighting the great battle of his life, 
    uses the mercy of his nativity as an argument with God. <i>Faith finds 
    weapons everywhere. </i>He who wills to believe shall never lack reasons for 
    believing. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"You made me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts."
    </p></b>Was our Lord so early a believer? Was he one of those babes and 
    sucklings out of whose mouths strength is ordained? So it would seem; and if 
    so, what a plea for help! <i>Early piety gives peculiar comfort in our after 
    trials</i>, for surely he who loved us when we were children is too faithful 
    to cast us off in our riper years. Some give the text the sense of "gave me 
    cause to trust, by keeping me safely," and assuredly <i>there was a special 
    providence which preserved our Lord's infant days from the fury of Herod, 
    the dangers of traveling, and the ills of poverty</i>.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. "I was cast upon you from the womb."</p></b> Into 
    the Almighty arms he was first received, as into those of a loving parent. 
    This is a sweet thought. <i>God begins his care over us from the earliest 
    hour. </i>We are dandled upon the knee of mercy, and cherished in the lap of 
    goodness; our cradle is canopied by divine love, and our first totterings 
    are guided by his care. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"You are my God from my mother's belly." </p></b>The psalm 
    begins with "My God, my God," and here, not only is the claim repeated, but 
    its early date is urged. Oh noble perseverance of faith, thus to continue 
    pleading with holy ingenuity of argument!<i> Our birth was our weakest and 
    most perilous period of existence; if we were then secured by Omnipotent 
    tenderness, surely we have no cause to suspect that divine goodness will 
    fail us now</i>. He who was our God when we left our mother, will be with us 
    until we return to mother earth, and will keep us from perishing in the 
    belly of Hell.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verses 11-21. </p></b>The crucified Son of David continues to 
    pour out his complaint and prayer. We need much grace that while reading we 
    may have fellowship with his sufferings. May the blessed Spirit conduct us 
    into a most clear and affecting sight of our Redeemer's woes.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. "Be not far from me."</p></b> This is the petition 
    for which he has been using such varied and powerful pleas. His great woe 
    was that God had forsaken him; his great prayer is that he would be near 
    him. A lively sense of the divine presence is a mighty stay to the heart in 
    times of distress. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"For trouble is near; for there is none to help." </p></b>
    There are two "fors," as though faith gave a double knock at mercy's gate; 
    that is a powerful prayer which is full of holy reasons and thoughtful 
    arguments. <i>The nearness of trouble is a weighty motive for divine help; 
    this moves our heavenly Father's heart, and brings down his helping hand.
    </i>It is his glory to be our very present help in trouble. 
<p align="justify">Our Substitute had trouble in his inmost heart, for he 
    said, "the waters have come in, even unto my soul!" Well might he cry, "be 
    not far from me." </p>
<p align="justify">The absence of all other helpers is another telling plea. 
    In our Lord's case none either could or would help him, it was needful that 
    he should tread the winepress alone; yet was it a sore aggravation to find 
    that all his disciples had forsaken him, and lover and friend were put far 
    from him. There is an awfulness about absolute friendlessness which is 
    crushing to the human mind, for man was not made to be alone, and is like a 
    dismembered limb when he has to endure heart-loneliness.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. "Many bulls have compassed me—strong bulls of 
    Bashan have beset me round."</p></b> The mighty ones in the crowd are here 
    marked by the tearful eye of their victim. The priests, elders, scribes, 
    Pharisees, rulers, and captains bellowed round the cross like wild bulls, 
    fed in the fat and solitary pastures of Bashan, full of strength and fury; 
    they stamped and foamed around the innocent One, and longed to gore him to 
    death with their cruelties.
<p align="justify">Conceive of the Lord Jesus as a helpless, unarmed, naked 
    man, cast into the midst of a herd of infuriated wild bulls. They were 
    brutal as bulls, many, and strong, and the Rejected One was all alone, and 
    bound naked to the tree. His position throws great force into the earnest 
    entreaty, "Be not far from me."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. "They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a 
    ravening and a roaring lion."</p></b> Like hungry cannibals they opened their 
    blasphemous mouths as if they were about to swallow the man whom they 
    abhorred. They could not vomit forth their anger fast enough through the 
    ordinary aperture of their mouths, and therefore set the doors of their lips 
    wide open like those who <i>gape</i>.<i> Like roaring lions they howled out 
    their fury, and longed to tear the Savior in pieces, as wild beasts raven 
    over their prey. 
</i>
<p align="justify">Our Lord's faith must have passed through a most severe 
    conflict while he found himself abandoned to the cruelties of the wicked, 
    but he came off victorious by prayer; the very dangers to which he was 
    exposed, being used to add prevalence to his entreaties.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14. </p></b>Turning from his enemies, our Lord 
    describes his own personal condition in language which should bring the 
    tears into every loving eye.<b> 
<p align="justify">"I am poured out like water." </p></b>He was utterly spent, 
    like water poured upon the earth; his heart failed him, and had no more 
    firmness in it than running water, and his whole being was made a sacrifice, 
    like a libation poured out before the Lord. He had long been a fountain of 
    tears; in Gethsemane his heart welled over in sweat, and on the cross he 
    gushed forth with blood. He poured out his strength and spirit, so that he 
    was reduced to the most feeble and exhausted state.<b> 
<p align="justify">"All my bones are out of joint," </p></b>as if distended upon 
    a rack. Is it not most probable that the fastenings of the hands and feet, 
    and the jar occasioned by fixing the cross in the earth, may have dislocated 
    the bones of the Crucified One? If this is not intended, we must refer the 
    expression to that extreme weakness which would occasion relaxation of the 
    muscles and a general sense of parting asunder throughout the whole system.<b>

<p align="justify">"My heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of me."
    </p></b>Excessive debility and intense pain made his inmost life to feel like 
    wax melted in the heat. The Greek liturgy uses the expression, "your unknown 
    sufferings," and well it may. <i>The fire of Almighty wrath would have 
    consumed our souls forever in Hell—it was no light work to bear as a 
    substitute the heat of an anger so justly terrible. 
</i>
<p align="justify">Dr. Gill wisely observes, "if the heart of Christ, the 
    Lion of the tribe of Judah, melted at it, what heart can endure, or hands be 
    strong, when God deals with <i>them </i>in his wrath?"</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 15. "My strength is dried up like a potsherd."</p></b> 
    Most complete debility is here portrayed; Jesus likens himself to a broken 
    piece of earthenware, or an earthen pot, baked in the fire until the last 
    particle of moisture is driven out of the clay. No doubt a high degree of 
    feverish burning afflicted the body of our Lord. <i>All his strength was 
    dried up in the tremendous flames of avenging justice, even as the paschal 
    lamb was roasted in the fire. 
</i><b>
<p align="justify">"My tongue cleaves to my jaws!"</p></b> Thirst and fever 
    fastened his tongue to his jaws. Dryness and a horrible clamminess tormented 
    his mouth, so that he could scarcely speak.
<b>
<p align="justify">"You have brought me into the dust of death!"</p></b> So 
    tormented in every single part as to feel dissolved into separate atoms, and 
    each atom full of misery; the full price of our redemption was paid, and no 
    part of the Surety's body or soul escaped its share of agony. 
<p align="justify">The words may set forth Jesus as having wrestled with 
    Death until he rolled into the dust with his antagonist. Behold the 
    humiliation of the Son of God! <i>The Lord of Glory stoops to the dust of 
    death.</i> Amid the moldering relics of mortality, Jesus condescends to 
    lodge!</p>
<p align="justify">Bishop Mant's version of the two preceding verses is 
    forcible and accurate:</p>
<p align="justify">"Poured forth like water is my frame;<br/>
    My bones asunder start;<br/>
    As wax that feels the searching flame,<br/>
    Within me melts my heart.</p>
<p align="justify">My withered sinews shrink unstrung<br/>
    Like potsherd dried and dead;<br/>
    Cleaves to my jaws my burning tongue<br/>
    The dust of death my bed."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 16.</p></b> We are to understand every item of this sad 
    description as being urged by the Lord Jesus as a plea for divine help; and 
    this will give us a high idea of his perseverance in prayer. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"For dogs have compassed me."</p></b> Here he marks the more 
    ignoble crowd, who, while less strong than their brutal leaders, were not 
    less ferocious, for there they were howling and barking like unclean and 
    hungry dogs! Hunters frequently surround their game with a circle, and 
    gradually encompass them with an ever-narrowing ring of dogs and men. 
<p align="justify">Such a picture is before us. In the center stands, not a 
    panting stag, but a bleeding, fainting man, and around him are the enraged 
    and unpitying wretches who have hounded him to his doom. </p>
<p align="justify">Here we have the "hind of the morning" of whom the psalm 
    so plaintively sings, hunted by bloodhounds, all thirsting to devour him! 
    The assembly of the wicked have inclosed me. Thus the Jewish people were 
    unchurched, and that which called itself an assembly of the righteous is 
    justly for its sins marked upon the forehead as an assembly of the wicked. 
    This is not the only occasion when professed churches of God have become 
    synagogues of Satan, and have persecuted the Holy and the Just One. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"They pierced my hands and my feet."</p></b> This can by no 
    means refer to David, or to any one but Jesus of Nazareth, the once 
    crucified but now exalted Son of God. Pause, dear reader, and view the 
    wounds of your Redeemer.
<p align="justify">Verse 17. So emaciated was Jesus by his fastings and 
    sufferings that he says, <b>"I may count all my bones."</b> He could count 
    and recount them. The posture of the body on the cross, Bishop Horne thinks, 
    would so distend the flesh and skin as to make the bones visible, so that 
    they might be numbered. The zeal of his Father's house had eaten him up; 
    like a good soldier he had endured hardness. Oh that we cared less for the 
    body's enjoyment and ease—and more for our Father's business! It were better 
    to count the bones of an emaciated body than to bring leanness into our 
    souls.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"They look and stare upon me."</p></b> Unholy eyes gazed 
    insultingly upon the Saviors's nakedness, and shocked the sacred delicacy of 
    his holy soul. The sight of the agonizing body ought to have ensured 
    sympathy from the throng, but it only increased their savage mirth, as they 
    gloated their cruel eyes upon his miseries. Let us blush for human nature, 
    and mourn in sympathy with our Redeemer's shame. <i>The first Adam made us 
    all naked—and therefore the second Adam became naked that he might clothe 
    our naked souls.
</i>
<p align="justify">Verse 18. "They part my garments among them, and cast 
    lots for my vesture." The garments of the executed were the perks of the 
    executioners in most cases, but it was not often that they cast lots at the 
    division of the spoil. This incident shows how clearly David in vision saw 
    the day of Christ, and how surely the Man of Nazareth is he of whom the 
    prophets spoke: "these things, therefore, the soldiers did." </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">He who gave his blood to cleanse us, gave his garments to 
    clothe us.</p></i> As Ness says, "this precious Lamb of God gave up his golden 
    fleece for us." How every incident of Jesus' griefs is here stored up in the 
    treasury of inspiration, and embalmed in the amber of sacred song. We must 
    learn hence to be very mindful of all that concerns our Beloved, and to 
    think much more of everything which has a connection with him. 
<p align="justify">It may be noted that the habit of <i>gambling </i>is of 
    all others the most hardening, for men could practice it even at the 
    cross-foot while besprinkled with the blood of the Crucified. No Christian 
    will endure the <i>rattle of the dice </i>when he thinks of this.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 19. "But be you not far from me, O Lord."</p></b> 
    Invincible faith returns to the charge, and uses the same means, namely, 
    importunate prayer. He repeats the petition so piteously offered before. He 
    wants nothing but his God, even in his lowest state. He does not ask for the 
    most comfortable or nearest presence of God, he will be content if he is not 
    far from him. Humble requests speed at the throne.
<b>
<p align="justify">"O my strength, hasten to help me."</p></b> Hard cases need 
    timely aid: when necessity justifies it we may be urgent with God as to 
    time, and cry, "make haste;" but we must not do this out of willfulness. 
    Mark how in the last degree of personal weakness he calls the Lord "my 
    strength;" after this fashion the believer can sing, "when I am weak, then 
    am I strong."
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 20. "Deliver my soul from the sword." </p></b>By the 
    sword is probably meant entire destruction, which as a man he dreaded. Or 
    perhaps he sought deliverance from the enemies around him, who were like a 
    sharp and deadly sword to him. The Lord had said, "Awake, O sword," and now 
    from the terror of that sword the Shepherd would gladly be delivered as soon 
    as justice should see fit. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"My darling from the power of the dog."</p></b> Meaning his 
    soul, his life, which is most dear to every man. The original is, "my only 
    one," and therefore is our soul dear, because it is our only soul. 
<i>
<p align="justify">Would that all men made their souls their darlings, but 
    many treat them as if they were not worth so much as the mire of the 
    streets. </p>
</i>
<p align="justify">The dog may mean Satan, that infernal Cerberus, that 
    cursed and cursing cur; or else the whole company of Christ's foes, who 
    though many in number were as unanimous as if there were but one, and with 
    one consent sought to rend him in pieces.</p>
<p align="justify">If Jesus cried for help against the dog of Hell, much 
    more may we. Cave canem, beware of the dog, for his power is great, and only 
    God can deliver us from him. <i>When he fawns upon us, we must not put 
    ourselves in his power; and when he howls at us, we may remember that God 
    holds him with a chain</i>.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 21. "Save me from the lion's mouth—for you have 
    saved me from the horns of the wild oxen."</p></b> Having experienced 
    deliverance in the past from great enemies, who were strong as the wild 
    oxen, the Redeemer utters his last cry for rescue from death, which is 
    fierce and mighty as the lion. This prayer was heard, and the gloom of the 
    cross departed. Thus faith, though sorely beaten, and even cast beneath the 
    feet of her enemy, ultimately wins the victory. It was so in our Head, it 
    shall be so in all the members. We have overcome the wild oxen, we shall 
    conquer the lion, and from both lion and wild oxen we shall take the crown.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verses 22-31.</p></b> The transition is very marked; from a 
    horrible tempest all is changed into calm. The darkness of Calvary at length 
    passed away from the face of nature, and from the soul of the Redeemer, and 
    beholding the light of his triumph and its future results the Savior smiled. 
    We have followed him through the <i>gloom</i>, let us attend him in the 
    returning <i>light</i>. It will be well still to regard the words as a part 
    of our Lord's soliloquy upon the cross, uttered in his mind during the last 
    few moments before his death.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 22. "I will declare your name unto my brethren."</p></b> 
    The delights of Jesus are always with his church, and hence his thoughts, 
    after much distraction, return at the first moment of relief to their usual 
    channel; he forms fresh designs for the benefit of his beloved ones. 
<p align="justify">He is not ashamed to call them brethren, "Saying, I will 
    declare your name unto my brethren. <b>"In the midst of the congregation 
    will I praise you." </b>Among his first resurrection words were these, "Go 
    to my brethren." In the verse before us, Jesus anticipates happiness in 
    having communication with his people; he purposes to be their teacher and 
    minister, and fixes his mind upon the subject of his discourse. The <i>name</i>, 
    that is, <i>the character and conduct of God </i>are by Jesus Christ's 
    gospel proclaimed to all the holy brotherhood; they behold the fullness of 
    the Godhead dwelling bodily in him, and rejoice greatly to see all the 
    infinite perfections manifested in one who is bone of their bone and flesh 
    of their flesh. </p>
<p align="justify">What a precious subject is the name of our God! It is the 
    only one worthy of the only Begotten, whose meat and drink it was to do the 
    Father's will. We may learn from this resolution of our Lord, that one of 
    the most excellent methods of showing our thankfulness for deliverances, is 
    to tell to our brethren what the Lord has done for us. We mention our 
    sorrows readily enough; why are we so slow in declaring our deliverances?
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"In the midst of the congregation will I praise you."</p></b> 
    Not in a little household gathering merely does our Lord resolve to proclaim 
    his Father's love, but in the great assemblies of his saints, and in the 
    general assembly and church of the first-born. This the Lord Jesus is always 
    doing by his representatives, who are the heralds of salvation, and labor to 
    praise God. 
<p align="justify">In the great universal church Jesus is the One 
    authoritative teacher, and all others, so far as they are worthy to be 
    called teachers, are nothing but echoes of his voice.</p>
<p align="justify">Jesus, in this second sentence, reveals his object in 
    declaring the divine name, it is that God may be praised. The church 
    continually magnifies Jehovah for manifesting himself in the person of 
    Jesus, and Jesus himself leads the song, and is both choirmaster and 
    preacher in his church. Delightful are the seasons when Jesus communes with 
    our hearts concerning divine truth; joyful praise is the sure result.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 23. "You who fear the Lord, praise him."</p></b> The 
    reader must imagine the Savior as addressing the congregation of the saints. 
    He exhorts the faithful to unite with him in thanksgiving. The description 
    of "fearing the Lord" is very frequent and very instructive; it is the 
    beginning of wisdom, and is an essential sign of grace. "I am a Hebrew and I 
    fear God" was Jonah's confession of faith. <i>Humble awe of God is so 
    necessary a preparation for praising him, that none are fit to sing to his 
    honor but such as reverence his word. </i>This fear is consistent with the 
    highest joy, and is not to be confounded with legal bondage, which is a fear 
    which perfect love casts out. Where Jesus leads the tune, none but holy lips 
    may dare to sing. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"All the seed of Jacob glorify him."</p></b> The genius of 
    the gospel is praise. Jew and Gentile saved by sovereign grace should be 
    eager in the blessed work of magnifying the God of our salvation. All saints 
    should unite in the song; no tongue may be silent, no heart may be cold. 
    Christ calls us to glorify God, and can we refuse?
<b>
<p align="justify">"And fear him, all you the seed of Israel."</p></b> The 
    spiritual Israel all do this, and we hope the day will come when Israel 
    after the flesh will be brought to the same mind. 
<p align="justify">The more we praise God the more reverently shall we fear 
    him—and the deeper our reverence the sweeter our songs. So much does Jesus 
    value praise that we have it here under his dying hand and seal, that all 
    the saints must glorify the Lord.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 24. "For he has not despised nor abhorred the 
    affliction of the afflicted."</p></b> Here is good matter and motive for praise. 
    The experience of our covenant Head and Representative should encourage all 
    of us to bless the God of grace. <i>Never was man so afflicted as our Savior 
    in body and soul from friends and foes, by Heaven and Hell, in life and 
    death. </i>He was the foremost in the ranks of the afflicted, but all those 
    afflictions were sent in love, and not because his Father despised and 
    abhorred him. 'Tis true that justice demanded that Christ should bear the 
    burden which as a substitute he undertook to carry, but Jehovah always loved 
    him, and in love laid that load upon him with a view to his ultimate glory 
    and to the accomplishment of the dearest wish of his heart. Under all his 
    woes our Lord was honorable in the Father's sight, <i>the matchless jewel of 
    Jehovah's heart.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">"Neither has he hid his face from him." </p></b>That is to 
    say, the hiding was but temporary, and was soon removed—it was not final and 
    eternal. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"But when he cried unto him, he heard." </p></b>Jesus was 
    heard in that he feared. He cried profoundly in his extremity, and was 
    speedily answered; he therefore bids his people join him in singing "glory 
    to God in the highest!"
<p align="justify">Every child of God should seek refreshment for his faith 
    in this testimony of the Man of Sorrows. What Jesus here witnesses is as 
    true today as when it was first written. It shall never be said that any 
    man's affliction or poverty prevented his being an accepted suppliant at 
    Jehovah's throne of grace. The basest applicant is welcome at mercy's door:</p>
<p align="justify">"None that approach his throne shall find<br/>
 A God unfaithful or unkind."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 25. "My praise shall be of you in the great 
    congregation."</p></b> The one subject of our Master's song is the Lord alone. 
    The Lord and the Lord only is the theme which the believer handles when he 
    gives himself to imitate Jesus in praise. 
<p align="justify">The word in the original is "from you,"—true praise is of 
    celestial origin. The rarest harmonies of music are nothing unless they are 
    sincerely consecrated to God by hearts sanctified by the Spirit. </p>
<p align="justify">The choirmaster says, "Let us sing to the praise and 
    glory of God." But <i>the choir often sing to the praise and glory of 
    themselves</i>. Oh when shall our service of song be a pure offering? 
    Observe in this verse how Jesus loves the public praises of the saints, and 
    thinks with pleasure of the great congregation. It would be wicked on our 
    part to despise the twos and threes; but, on the other hand, let not the 
    little companies snarl at the greater assemblies as though they were 
    necessarily less pure and less approved, for Jesus loves the praise of the 
    great congregation. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"I will pay my vows before those who fear him."</p></b> Jesus 
    dedicates himself anew to the carrying out of the divine purpose in 
    fulfillment of his vows made in anguish. Did our Lord when he ascended to 
    the skies proclaim amid the redeemed in glory the goodness of Jehovah? And 
    was that the vow here meant? Undoubtedly the publication of the gospel is 
    the constant fulfillment of covenant engagements made by our Surety in the 
    councils of eternity. Messiah vowed to build up a spiritual temple for the 
    Lord, and he will surely keep his word.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 26. "The meek shall eat and be satisfied."</p></b> Mark 
    how the dying Lover of our souls solaces himself with the result of his 
    death.<i> The spiritually poor find a feast in Jesus, they feed upon him to 
    the satisfaction of their hearts</i>. They were famished until he gave 
    himself for them, but now they are filled with royal dainties. The thought 
    of the joy of his people gave comfort to our expiring Lord. Note the 
    characters who partake of the benefit of his passion: "the meek," the humble 
    and lowly. Lord, make us so. Note also the certainty that gospel provisions 
    shall not be wasted, "they shall eat;" and the sure result of such eating, 
    "and be satisfied." 
<b>
<p align="justify">"Those who seek the Lord shall praise him." </p></b>For a 
    while they may keep a fast, but their thanksgiving days must and shall come.
    
<b>
<p align="justify">"May your heart shall live forever."</p></b> Your spirits 
    shall not fail through trial, you shall not die of grief, immortal joys 
    shall be your portion. Thus Jesus speaks even from the cross to the troubled 
    seeker.<i> If his dying words are so assuring, what consolation may we not 
    find in the truth that he ever lives to make intercession for us! </i>Those 
    who eat at Jesus' table receive the fulfillment of the promise, "Whoever 
    eats of this bread shall live forever!"
<p align="justify">Verse 27. In reading this verse one is struck with the 
    Messiah's missionary spirit. It is evidently his grand consolation that 
    Jehovah will be known throughout all places of his dominion.<b> </b></p>
<p align="justify">"All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto 
    the Lord." Out from the inner circle of the present church the blessing 
    is to spread in growing power until the remotest parts of the earth shall be 
    ashamed of their idols, mindful of the true God, penitent for their 
    offences, and unanimously earnest for reconciliation with Jehovah. Then 
    shall false worship cease,<b> "and all the kindreds of the nations shall 
    worship before you," </b>O you only living and true God. This hope which was 
    the reward of Jesus is a stimulus to those who fight his battles.</p>
<p align="justify">It is well to mark the order of conversion as here set 
    forth.</p>
<p align="justify">They shall "remember"—this is reflection, like the 
    prodigal who came unto himself.</p>
<p align="justify">"And turn unto Jehovah"—this is repentance, like Manasseh 
    who left his idols.</p>
<p align="justify">And "worship"—this is holy service, as Paul adored the 
    Christ whom once he abhorred.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 28. "For the kingdom is the Lord's."</p></b> As an 
    obedient Son the dying Redeemer rejoiced to know that his Father's interests 
    would prosper through his pains. "The Lord reigns" was his song as it is 
    ours. He who by his own power reigns supreme in the domains of creation and 
    providence, has set up a kingdom of grace, and by the conquering power of 
    the cross that kingdom will grow until all people shall own its sway and 
    proclaim that <b>"he is the governor among the nations." </b>Amid the 
    tumults and disasters of the present, the Lord reigns. In the halcyon days 
    of peace the rich fruit of his dominion will be apparent to every eye. Great 
    Shepherd, let your glorious kingdom come.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 29. "All they that be fat upon earth." </p></b>The rich 
    and great are not shut out. Grace now finds the most of its jewels among the 
    poor, but in the latter days the mighty of the earth "shall eat," shall 
    taste of redeeming grace and dying love, and shall "worship" with all their 
    hearts the God who deals so bountifully with us in Christ Jesus. 
<p align="justify">Those who are spiritually fat with inward prosperity 
    shall be filled with the marrow of communion, and shall worship the Lord 
    with peculiar fervor. In the covenant of grace Jesus has provided good cheer 
    for our high estate, and he has taken equal care to console us in our 
    humiliation, for the next sentence is<b>, "all they that go down to the dust 
    shall bow before him." </b>There is relief and comfort in bowing before God 
    when our case is at its worst; even amid the dust of death prayer kindles 
    the lamp of hope.</p>
<p align="justify">While all who come to God by Jesus Christ are thus 
    blessed, whether they be rich or poor—none of those who despise him may hope 
    for a blessing. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"None can keep alive his own soul."</p></b> This is the stern 
    counterpart of the gospel message of "look and live." There is no salvation 
    out of Christ. We must have life as Christ's gift, or we shall die 
    eternally. This is very solid evangelical doctrine, and should be proclaimed 
    in every corner of the earth, that like a great hammer it may break in 
    pieces all self-confidence.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 30. "A seed shall serve him."</p></b> Posterity shall 
    perpetuate the worship of the Most High. The kingdom of truth on earth shall 
    never fail. As one generation is called to its rest, another will arise in 
    its stead. We need have no fear for the true apostolic succession—that is 
    safe enough.
<b>
<p align="justify">"It shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation." </p></b>
    He will reckon the ages by the succession of the saints, and set his 
    accounts according to the families of the faithful. Generations of sinners 
    come not into the genealogy of the skies. God's family register is not for 
    strangers, but for the children only.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 31. "They shall come."</p></b> <i>Sovereign grace shall 
    bring out from among men the blood bought ones. </i>Nothing shall thwart the 
    divine purpose. The chosen shall come to life, to faith, to pardon, to 
    Heaven. In this the dying Savior finds a sacred satisfaction. Toiling 
    servant of God, be glad at the thought that the eternal purpose of God shall 
    suffer no hindrance. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"And shall declare his righteousness unto a people that 
    shall be born."</p></b> None of the people who shall be brought to God by the 
    irresistible attractions of the cross shall be dumb, they shall be able to 
    tell forth the righteousness of the Lord, so that future generations shall 
    know the truth. Fathers shall teach their sons, who shall hand it down to 
    their children; the theme of the story always being <b>"that he has done 
    this," </b>or, that "It is finished." Salvation's glorious work is done, 
    there is peace on earth, and glory in the highest. "It is finished!" These 
    were the expiring words of the Lord Jesus, as they are the last words of 
    this Psalm. May we by living faith be enabled to see our salvation finished 
    by the death of Jesus!
