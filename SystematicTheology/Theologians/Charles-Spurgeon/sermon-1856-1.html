          THE more you read the Bible, and the more you meditate upon it, the
          more you will be astonished with it. He who is but a casual reader of
          the Bible, does not know the height, the depth, the length and breadth
          of the mighty meanings contained in its pages. There are certain times
          when I discover a new vein of thought, and I put my hand to my head
          and say in astonishment, "Oh, it is wonderful I never saw this before
          in the Scriptures." You will find the Scriptures enlarge as you enter
          them; the more you study them the less you will appear to know of
          them, for they widen out as we approach them. Especially will you find
          this the case with the typical parts of God's Word. Most of the
          historical books were intended to be types either of dispensations, or
          experiences, or offices of Jesus Christ. Study the Bible with this as
          a key, and you will not blame Herbert when he calls it "not only the
          book of God, but the God of books." One of the most interesting points
          of the Scriptures is their constant tendency to display Christ; and
          perhaps one of the most beautiful figures under which Jesus Christ is
          ever exhibited in sacred writ, is the Passover Paschal Lamb. It is
          Christ of whom we are about to speak to-night.

          Israel was in Egypt, in extreme bondage; the severity of their slavery
          had continually increased till it was so oppressive that their
          incessant groans went up to heaven. God who avenges his own elect,
          though they cry day and night unto him, at last, determined that he
          would direct a fearful blow against Egypt's king and Egypt's nation,
          and deliver his own people. We can picture the anxieties and the
          anticipations of Israel, but we can scarcely sympathize with them,
          unless we as Christians have had the same deliverance from spiritual
          Egypt. Let us, brethren, go back to the day in our experience, when we
          abode in the land of Egypt, working in the brick-kilns of sin, toiling
          to make ourselves better, and finding it to be of no avail; let us
          recall that memorable night, the beginning of months, the commencement
          of a new life in our spirit, and the beginning of an altogether new
          era in our soul. The Word of God struck the blow at our sin; he gave
          us Jesus Christ our sacrifice; and in that night we went out of Egypt.
          Though we have passed through the wilderness since then, and have
          fought the Amalekites, have trodden on the fiery serpent, have been
          scorched by the heat and frozen by the snows, yet we have never since
          that time gone back to Egypt; although our hearts may sometimes have
          desired the leeks, the onions, and the flesh-pots of Egypt, yet we
          have never been brought into slavery since then. Come, let us keep the
          Passover this night, and think of the night when the Lord delivered us
          out of Egypt. Let us behold our Saviour Jesus as the Paschal Lamb on
          which we feed; yea, let us not only look at him as such, but let us
          sit down to-night at his table, let us eat of his flesh and drink of
          his blood; for his flesh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink
          indeed. In holy solemnity let our hearts approach that ancient supper;
          let us go back to Egypt's darkness, and by holy contemplation behold,
          instead of the destroying angel, the angel of the covenant, at the
          head of the feast, -- "the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of
          the world."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall not have time to-night to enter into the whole history and
          mystery of the Passover; you will not understand me to be to- night
          preaching concerning the whole of it; but a few prominent points
          therein as a part of them. It would require a dozen sermons to do so;
          in fact a book as large as Caryl upon Job -- if we could find a divine
          equally prolix and equally sensible. But we shall first of all look at
          the Lord Jesus Christ, and show how he corresponds with the Paschal
          Lamb, and endeavour to bring you to the two points -- of having his
          blood sprinkled on you, and having fed on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, JESUS CHRIST IS TYPIFIED HERE UNDER THE PASCHAL LAMB;
          and should there be one of the seed of Abraham here who has never seen
          Christ to be the Messiah, I beg his special attention to that which I
          am to advance, when I speak of the Lord Jesus as none other than the
          Lamb of God slain for the deliverance of his chosen people. Follow me
          with your Bibles, and open first at the 12th chapter of Exodus.
        </p>
        <p>
          We commence, first of all, with the victim -- the lamb. How fine a
          picture of Christ. No other creature could so well have typified him
          who was holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners. Being
          also the emblem of sacrifice, it most sweetly pourtrayed our Lord and
          Saviour Jesus Christ. Search natural history through, and though you
          will find other emblems which set forth different characteristics of
          his nature, and admirably display him to our souls, yet there is none
          which seems so appropriate to the person of our beloved Lord as that
          of the Lamb. A child would at once perceive the likeness between a
          lamb and Jesus Christ, so gentle and innocent, so mild and harmless,
          neither hurting others, nor seeming to have the power to resent an
          injury.
        </p>
        <p>"A humble man before his foes, a weary man and full of woes."</p>
        <p>
          What tortures the sheepish race have received from us! how are they,
          though innocent, continually slaughtered for our food! Their skin is
          dragged from their backs, their wool is shorn to give us a garment.
          And so the Lord Jesus Christ, our glorious Master, doth give us his
          garments that we may be clothed with them; he is rent in sunder for
          us; his very blood is poured out for our sins; harmless and holy, a
          glorious sacrifice for the sins of all his children. Thus the Paschal
          Lamb might well convey to the pious Hebrew the person of a suffering,
          silent, patient, harmless Messiah.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look further down. It was a lamb without blemish. A blemished lamb, if
          it had the smallest speck of disease, the least wound, would not have
          been allowed for a Passover. The priest would not have suffered it to
          be slaughtered, nor would God have accepted the sacrifice at his
          hands. It must be a lamb without blemish. And was not Jesus Christ
          even such from his birth? Unblemished, born of the pure virgin Mary,
          begotten of the Holy Ghost, without a taint of sin; his soul was pure,
          and spotless as the driven snow, white, clear, perfect; and his life
          was the same. In him was no sin. He took our infirmities and bore our
          sorrows on the cross. He was in all points tempted as we are, but
          there was that sweet exception, "yet without sin." A lamb without
          blemish. Ye who have known the Lord, who have tasted of his grace, who
          have held fellowship with him, doth not your heart acknowledge that he
          is a lamb without blemish? Can ye find any fault with your Saviour?
          Have you aught to lay to his charge? Hath his truthfulness departed?
          Have his words been broken? Have his promises failed? Has he forgotten
          his engagements? And, in any respect, can you find in him any blemish?
          Ah, no! he is the unblemished lamb, the pure, the spotless, the
          immaculate, "the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world;"
          and in him there is no sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Go on further down the chapter. "Your lamb shall be without blemish, a
          male of the first year." I need not stop to consider the reason why
          the male was chosen; we only note that it was to be a male of the
          first year. Then it was in its prime then its strength was
          unexhausted, then its power was just ripened into maturity and
          perfection, God would not have an untimely fruit. God would not have
          that offered which had not come to maturity. And so our Lord Jesus
          Christ had just come to the ripeness of manhood when he was offered.
          At 34 years of age was he sacrificed for our sins; he was then hale
          and strong, although his body may have been emaciated by suffering,
          and his face more marred than that of any other man, yet was he then
          in the perfection of manhood. Methinks I see him then. His goodly
          beard flowing down upon his breast; I see him with his eyes full of
          genius, his form erect, his mien majestic, his energy entire, his
          whole frame in full development, -- a real man, a magnificent man --
          fairer than the sons of men; a Lamb not only without blemish, but with
          all his powers fully brought out. Such was Jesus Christ -- a Lamb of
          the first year -- not a boy, not a lad, not a young man, but a full
          man, that he might give his soul unto us. He did not give himself to
          die for us when he was a youth, for he would not then have given all
          he was to be; he did not give himself to die for us when he was in old
          age, for then would he have given himself when he was in decay; but
          just in his maturity, in his very prime, then Jesus Christ our
          Passover was sacrificed for us. And, moreover, at the time of his
          death, Christ was full of life, for we are informed by one of the
          evangelists that "he cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghost."
          This is a sign that Jesus did not die through weakness, nor through
          decay of nature. His soul was strong within him; he was still the Lamb
          of the first year. Still was he mighty; he could, if he pleased, even
          on the cross, have unlocked his hands from their iron bolts; and
          descending from the tree of infamy, have driven his astonished foes
          before him, like deer scattered by a lion, yet did he meekly yield
          obedience unto death. My soul; canst thou not see thy Jesus here, the
          unblemished Lamb of the first year, strong and mighty? And, O my
          heart! does not the though rise up -- if Jesus consecrated himself to
          thee when he was thus in all his strength and vigour, should not I in
          youth dedicate myself to him? And if I am in manhood, how am I doubly
          bound to give my strength to him? And if I am in old age, still should
          I seek while the little remains, to consecrate that little to him. If
          he gave his all to me, which was much, should I not give my little all
          to him? Should I not feel bound to consecrate myself entirely to his
          service, to lay body, soul, and spirit, time, talents, all upon his
          altar. And though I am not an unblemished lamb, yet I am happy that as
          the leavened cake was accepted with the sacrifice, though never burned
          with it -- I, though a leavened cake, may be offered on the altar with
          my Lord and Saviour, the Lord's burnt offering, and so, though impure,
          and full of leaven, I may be accepted in the beloved, an offering of a
          sweet savour, acceptable unto the Lord my God. Here is Jesus, beloved,
          a Lamb without blemish, a Lamb of the first year!
        </p>
        <p>
          The subject now expands and the interest deepens. Let me have your
          very serious consideration to the next point, which has much gratified
          me in its discovery and which will instruct you in the relation. In
          the 6th verse of the 12th chapter of Exodus we are told that this lamb
          which should be offered at the Passover was to be selected four days
          before its sacrifice, and to be kept apart: -- "In the tenth day of
          this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the
          house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: and if the household be
          too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house
          take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to
          his eating shall make your count for the lamb." The 6th verse says,
          "And ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month." For
          four days this lamb, chosen to be offered, was taken away from the
          rest of the flock and kept alone by itself, for two reasons: partly
          that by its constant bleatings they might be put in remembrance of the
          solemn feast which was to be celebrated; and moreover, that during the
          four days they might be quite assured that it had no blemish, for
          during that time it was subject to constant inspection, in order that
          they might be certain that it had no hurt or injury that would render
          it unacceptable to the Lord. And now, brethren, a remarkable fact
          flashes before you -- just as this lamb was separated four days, the
          ancient allegories used to say that Christ was separated four years.
          Four years after he left his father's house he went into the
          wilderness, and was tempted of the devil. Four years after his baptism
          he was sacrificed for us. But there is another, better than that: --
          About four days before his crucifixion, Jesus Christ rode in triumph
          through the streets of Jerusalem. He was thus openly set apart as
          being distinct from mankind. He, on the ass, rode up to the temple,
          that all might see him to be Judah's Lamb, chosen of God, and ordained
          from the foundation of the world. And what is more remarkable still,
          during those four days, you will see, if you turn to the Evangelists,
          at your leisure, that as much is recorded of what he did and said as
          through all the other part of his life. During those four days, he
          upbraided the fig tree, and straightway it withered; it was then that
          he drove the buyers and sellers from the temple; it was then that he
          rebuked the priests and elders, by telling them the similitude of the
          two sons, one of whom said he would go, and did not, and the other who
          said he would not go, and went; it was then that he narrated the
          parable of the husbandsmen, who slew those who were sent to them;
          afterwards he gave the parable of the marriage of the king's son. Then
          comes his parable concerning the man who went unto the feast, not
          having on a wedding garment; and then also, the parable concerning the
          ten virgins, five of whom were very wise, and five of whom were
          foolish; then comes the chapter of very striking denunciations against
          the Pharisees: -- "Woe unto you O ye blind Pharisees! cleanse first
          that which is within the cup and platter;" and then also comes that
          long chapter of prophecy concerning what should happen at the siege of
          Jerusalem, and an account of the dissolution of the world: "Learn a
          parable of the fig-tree: when his branch is yet tender and putteth
          forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh.: But I will not trouble you
          by telling you here that at the same time he gave them that splendid
          description of the day of judgment, when the sheep shall be divided
          from the goats. In fact, the most splendid utterances of Jesus were
          recorded as having taken place within these four days. Just as the
          lamb separated from its fellows, did bleat more than ever during the
          four days, so did Jesus during those four days speak more; and if you
          want to find a choice saying of Jesus, turn to the account of the last
          four days' ministry to find it. There you will find that chapter, "Let
          not your hearts be troubled;" there also, his great prayer, "Father, I
          will;" and so on. The greatest things he did, he did in the last four
          days when he was set apart.
        </p>
        <p>
          And there is one more thing to which I beg your particular attention,
          and that is, that during those four days I told you that the lamb was
          subject to the closest scrutiny, so, also, during those four days, it
          is singular to relate, that Jesus Christ was examined by all classes
          of persons. It was during those four days that the lawyer asked him
          which was the greatest commandment? and he said, "Thou shalt love the
          Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, and with all
          thy might; and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." It was then
          that the Herodians came and questioned him about the tribute money; it
          was then that the Pharisees tempted him; it was then, also, the
          Sadducees tried him upon the subject of the resurrection. He was tried
          by all classes and grades -- Herodians, Pharisees, Sadducees, lawyers,
          and the common people. It was during these four days that he was
          examined: but how did he come forth? An immaculate Lamb! The officers
          said, "never man spake like this man." His foes found none who could
          even bear false witness against him, such as agreed together; and
          Pilate declared, "I find no fault in him." He would not have been fit
          for the Paschal Lamb had a single blemish have been discovered, but "I
          find no fault in him," was the utterance of the great chief
          magistrate, who thereby declared that the Lamb might be eaten at God's
          Passover, the symbol and the means of the deliverance of God's people.
          O beloved! you have only to study the Scriptures to find out wondrous
          things in them; you have only to search deeply, and you stand amazed
          at their richness. You will find God's Word to be a very precious
          word; the more you live by it and study it, the more will it be
          endeared to your minds.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the next thing we must mark is the place where this lamb was to be
          killed, which peculiarly sets forth that it must be Jesus Christ. The
          first Passover was held in Egypt, the second Passover was held in the
          wilderness; but we do not read that there were more than these two
          Passovers celebrated until the Israelites came to Canaan. And then, if
          you turn to a passage in Deuteronomy, the 16th chapter, you will find
          that God no longer allowed them to slay the Lamb in their own houses
          but appointed a place for its celebration. In the wilderness, they
          brought their offerings to the tabernacle where the lamb was
          slaughtered; but at its first appointment in Egypt, of course they had
          no special place to which they took the lamb to be sacrificed.
          Afterwards, we read in the 16th of Deuteronomy, and the 5th verse,
          "Thou mayest not sacrifice the Passover within any of thy gates, which
          the Lord thy God giveth thee; but at the place which the Lord thy God
          shall chose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the
          Passover at even at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou
          camest forth out of Egypt." It was in Jerusalem that men ought to
          worship, for salvation was of the Jews; there was God's palace, there
          his altar smoked, and there only might the Paschal Lamb be killed. So
          was our blessed Lord led to Jerusalem. The infuriated throng dragged
          him along the city. In Jerusalem our Lamb was sacrificed for us; it
          was at the precise spot where God had ordained that it should be. Oh!
          if that mob who gathered round him at Nazareth had been able to push
          him headlong down the hill, then Christ could not have died at
          Jerusalem; but as he said, "a prophet cannot perish out of Jerusalem,"
          so was it true that the King of all prophets could not do otherwise,
          -- the prophecies concerning him would not have been fulfilled. "Thou
          shalt kill the lamb in the place the Lord thy God shall appoint." He
          was sacrificed in the very place. Thus, again you have an incidental
          proof that Jesus Christ was the Paschal Lamb for his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next point is the manner of his death. I think the manner in which
          the lamb was to be offered so peculiarly sets forth the crucifixion of
          Christ, that no other kind of death could by any means have answered
          all the particulars set down here. First, the lamb was to be
          slaughtered, and its blood caught in a basin. Usually blood was caught
          in a golden basin. Then, as soon as it was taken, the priest standing
          by the altar on which the fat was burning, threw the blood on the fire
          or cast it at the foot of the altar. You may guess what a scene it
          was. Ten thousand lambs sacrificed, and the blood poured out in a
          purple river. Next, the lamb was to be roasted; but it was not to have
          a bone of its body broken. Now I do say, there is nothing but
          crucifixion which can answer all these three things. Crucifixion has
          in it the shedding of blood -- the hands and feet were pierced. It has
          in it the idea of roasting, for roasting signifies a long torment, and
          as the lamb was for a long time before the fire, so Christ, in
          crucifixion, was for a long time exposed to a broiling sun, and all
          the other pains which crucifixion engenders. Moreover not a bone was
          broken; which could not have been the case with any other punishment.
          Suppose it had been possible to put Christ to death in any other way.
          Sometimes the Romans put criminals to death by decapitation; but by a
          such death the next is broken. Many martyrs were put to death by
          having a sword pierced through them; but, while that would have been a
          bloody death, and not a bone broken necessarily, the torment would not
          have been long enough to have been pictured by the roasting. So that,
          take whatever punishment you will -- take hanging, which sometimes the
          Romans practised in the form of strangling, that mode of punishment
          does not involve shedding of blood, and consequently the requirements
          would not have been answered. And I do think, any intelligent Jew,
          reading through this account of the Passover, and then looking at the
          crucifixion, must be struck by the fact that the penalty and death of
          the cross by which Christ suffered, must have taken in all these three
          things. There was blood-shedding; the long continued suffering -- the
          roasting of torture; and then added to that, singularly enough, by
          God's providence not a bone was broken, but the body was taken down
          from the cross intact. Some may say that burning might have answered
          the matter; but there would not have been a shedding of blood in that
          case, and the bones would have been virtually broken in the fire.
          Besides the body would not have been preserved entire. Crucifixion was
          the only death which could answer all of these three requirements. And
          my faith receives great strength from the fact, that I see my Saviour
          not only as a fulfilment of the type, but the only one. My heart
          rejoices to look on him whom I have pierced, and see his blood, as the
          lamb's blood, sprinkled on my lintel and my door-post, and see his
          bones unbroken, and to believe that not a bone of his spiritual body
          shall be broken hereafter; and rejoice, also, to see him roasted in
          the fire, because thereby I see that he satisfied God for that
          roasting which I ought to have suffered in the torment of hell for
          ever and ever.

          Christian! I would that I had words to depict in better language; but,
          as it is, I give thee the undigested thoughts, which thou mayest take
          home and live upon during the week; for thou wilt find this Paschal
          Lamb to be an hourly feast, as well as supper, and thou mayest feed
          upon it continually, till thou comest to the mount of God, where thou
          shalt see him as he is, and worship him in the Lamb in the midst
          thereof.

        <p>
          II. HOW WE DERIVE BENEFIT FROM THE BLOOD OF CHRIST. Christ our
          Passover is slain for us. The Jew could not say that; he could say, a
          lamb, but "the Lamb," even "Christ our Passover," was not yet become a
          victim. And here are some of my hearers within these walls to-night
          who cannot say "Christ our Passover is slain for us." But glory be to
          God! some of us can. There are not a few here who have laid their
          hands upon the glorious Scapegoat; and now they can put their hands
          upon the Lamb also, and they can say, "Yes; it is true, he is not only
          slain, but Christ our Passover is slain for us." We derive benefit
          from the death of Christ in two modes: first, by having his blood
          sprinkled on us for our redemption; secondly, by our eating his flesh
          for food, regeneration and sanctification. The first aspect in which a
          sinner views Jesus is that of a lamb slain, whose blood is sprinkled
          on the door-post and on the lintel. Note the fact, that the blood was
          never sprinkled on the threshold. It was sprinkled on the lintel, the
          top of the door, on the side-post, but never on the threshold, for woe
          unto him who trampleth under foot the blood of the Son of God! Even
          the priest of Dagon trod not on the threshold of his god, much less
          will the Christian trample under foot the blood of the Paschal Lamb.
          But his blood must be on our right hand to be our constant guard, and
          on our left to be our continual support. We want to have Jesus Christ
          sprinkled on us. As I told you before, it is not alone the blood of
          Christ poured out on Calvary that saves a sinner; it is the blood of
          Christ sprinkled on the heart. Let us turn to the land of Zoan. Do you
          not think you behold the scene to-night! It is evening. The Egyptians
          are going homeward -- little thinking of what is coming. But just as
          soon as the sun is set, a lamb is brought into every house. The
          Egyptian strangers passing by, say, "These Hebrews are about to keep a
          feast to night," and they retire to their houses utterly careless
          about it. The father of the Hebrew house takes his lamb, and examining
          it once more with anxious curiosity, looks it over from head to foot,
          to see if it has a blemish. He findeth none. "My son," he says to one
          of them, "bring hither the bason." It is held. He stabs the lamb, and
          the blood flows into the bason. Do you not think you see the sire, as
          he commands his matronly wife to roast the lamb before the fire! "Take
          heed," he says, "that not a bone be broken." Do you see her intense
          anxiety, as she puts it down to roast, lest a bone should be broken?
          Now, says the father, "bring a bunch of hyssop." A child brings it.
          The father dips it into the blood. "Come here, my children, wife and
          all, and see what I am about to do." He takes the hyssop in his hands,
          dips it in the blood, and sprinkles it across the lintel and the
          door-post. His children say, "What mean you by this ordinance?" He
          answers, "This night the Lord God will pass through to smite the
          Egyptians, and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel and on the two
          side posts, the Lord will pass over the door, and will not suffer the
          destroyer to come into your houses to smite you." The thing is done;
          the lamb is cooked; the guests are set down to it; the father of the
          family has supplicated a blessing; they are sitting down to feast upon
          it. And mark how the old man carefully divides joint from joint, lest
          a bone should be broken; and he is particular that the smallest child
          of the family should have some of it to eat, for so the Lord hath
          commanded. Do you not think you see him as he tells them "it is a
          solemn night -- make haste -- in another hour we shall all go out of
          Egypt." He looks at his hands, they are rough with labour, and
          clapping them, he cries, "I am not to be a slave any longer." His
          eldest son, perhaps, has been smarting under the lash, and he says,
          "Son, you have had the task-master's lash upon you this afternoon; but
          it is the last time you shall feel it." He looks at them all, with
          tears in his eyes -- "This is the night the Lord God will deliver
          you." Do you see them with their hats on their heads, with their loins
          girt, and their staves in their hands? It is the dead of the night.
          Suddenly they hear a shriek! The father says, "Keep within doors, my
          children; you will know what it is in a moment." Now another shriek --
          another shriek -- shriek succeeds shriek: they hear perpetual wailing
          and lamentation. "Remain within," says he, "the angel of death is
          flying abroad." A solemn silence is in the room, and they can almost
          hear the wings of the angel flap in the air as he passes their
          blood-marked door. "Be calm," says the sire, "that blood will save
          you." The shrieking increases. "Eat quickly, my children," he says
          again, and in a moment the Egyptians coming, say, "Get thee hence! Get
          thee hence! We are not for the jewels that you have borrowed. You have
          brought death into our houses." "Oh!" says a mother, "Go! for God's
          sake! go. My eldest son lies dead!" "Go!" says a father, "Go! and
          peace go with you. It were an ill day when your people came into
          Egypt, and our king began to slay your first-born, for God is
          punishing us for our cruelty." Ah! see them leaving the land; the
          shrieks are still heard; the people are busy about their dead. As they
          go out, a son of Pharoah is taken away unembalmed, to be buried in one
          of the pyramids. Presently they see one of their task-master's sons
          taken away. A happy night for them -- when they escape! And do you
          see, my hearers, a glorious parallel? They had to sprinkle the blood,
          and also to eat the lamb. Ah! my soul, hast thou e'er had the blood
          sprinkled on thee? Canst thou say that Jesus Christ is thine? It is
          not enough to say "he loved the world, and gave his Son," you must
          say, "He loved me,, and gave himself for me." There is another hour
          coming, dear friends, when we shall all stand before God's bar; and
          then God will say, "Angel of death, thou once didst smite Egypt's
          first born; thou knowest thy prey. Unsheath thy sword." I behold the
          great gathering, you and I are standing amongst them. It is a solemn
          moment. All men stand in suspense. There is neither hum nor murmur.
          The very stars cease to shine lest the light should disturb the air by
          its motion. All is still. God says, "Has thou sealed those that are
          mine?" "I have," says Gabriel; "they are sealed by blood every one of
          them." Then saith he next, "Sweep with thy sword of slaughter! Sweep
          the Earth! and send the unclothed, the unpurchased, the unwashed ones
          to the pit." Oh! how shall we feel beloved, when for a moment we see
          that angel flap his wings? He is just about to fly, "But," will the
          doubt cross our minds "perhaps he will come to me?" Oh! no; we shall
          stand and look the angel full in his face.
        </p>
        <p>"Bold shall I stand in that great day!</p>
        <p>For who aught to my charge shall lay?</p>
        <p>While through thy blood absolved</p>
        <p>I am From sin's tremendous curse and shame."</p>
        <p>
          If we have the blood on us, we shall see the angel coming, we shall
          smile at him; we shall dare to come even to God's face and say,
        </p>
        <p>"Great God! I'm clean! Through Jesus' blood, I'm clean!"</p>
        <p>
          But if, my hearer, thine unwashen spirit shall stand unshriven before
          its maker, if thy guilty soul shall appear with all its black spots
          upon it, unsprinkled with the purple tide, how wilt thou speak when
          thou seest flash from the scabbard the angel's sword swift for death,
          and winged for destruction, and when it shall cleave thee asunder?
          Methinks I see thee standing now. The angel is sweeping away a
          thousand there. There is one of thy pot companions. There one with
          whom thou didst dance and swear. There another, who after attending
          the same chapel like thee, was a despiser of religion. Now death comes
          nearer to thee. Just as when the reaper sweeps the field and the next
          ear trembles because its turn shall come next, I see a brother and a
          sister swept into the pit. Have I no blood upon me? Then, O rocks! it
          were kind of you to hide me. Ye have no benevolence in your arms.
          Mountains! let me find in your caverns some little shelter. But it is
          all in vain, for vengeance shall cleave the mountains and split the
          rocks open to find me out. Have I no blood? Have I no hope? Ah! no! he
          smites me. Eternal damnation is my horrible portion. The depth of the
          darkness of Egypt for thee, and the horrible torments of the pit from
          which none can escape! Ah! my dear hearers, could I preach as I could
          wish, could I speak to you without my lips and with my heart, then
          would I bid you seek that sprinkled blood, and urge you by the love of
          your own soul, by everything that is sacred and eternal, to labour to
          get this blood of Jesus sprinkled on your souls. It is the blood
          sprinkled that saves a sinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when the Christian gets the blood sprinkled, that is not all he
          wants. He wants something to feed upon. And, O sweet thought! Jesus
          Christ is not only a Saviour for sinners, but he is food for them
          after they are saved. The Paschal Lamb by faith we eat. We live on it.
          You may tell, my hearers, whether you have the blood sprinkled on the
          door by this: do you eat the Lamb? Suppose for a moment that one of
          the old Jews had said in his heart, "I do not see the use of this
          feasting. It is quite right to sprinkle the blood on the lintel or
          else the door will not be known; but what good is all this inside? We
          will have the lamb prepared, and we will not break his bones; but we
          will not eat of it." And suppose he went and stored the lamb away.
          What would have been the consequence? Why, the angel of death would
          have smitten him as well as the rest, even if the blood had been upon
          him. And if, moreover, that old Jew had said, "there, we will have a
          little piece of it; but we will have something else to eat, we will
          have some unleavened bread; we will not turn the leaven out of our
          houses, but we will have some leavened bread." If they had not
          consumed the lamb, but had reserved some of it, then the sword of the
          angel would have found the heart out as well as that of any other man.
          Oh! dear hearer, you may think you have the blood sprinkled, you may
          think you are just; but if you do not live on Christ as well as by
          Christ, you will never be saved by the Paschal Lamb. "Ah!" say some,
          "we know nothing of this." Of course you don't. When Jesus Christ
          said, "except ye eat my flesh, and drink my blood, ye have no life in
          you," there were some that said, "This is a hard saying, who can heart
          it?" and many from that time went back -- and walked no more with him.
          They could not understand him; but, Christian, dost thou not
          understand it? Is not Jesus Christ thy daily food? And even with the
          bitter herbs, is he not sweet food? Some of you, my friends, who are
          true Christians, live too much on your changing frames and feelings,
          on your experiences and evidences. Now, that is all wrong. That is
          just as if a worshipper had gone to the tabernacle and began eating
          one of the coats that were worn by the priest. When a man lives on
          Christ's righteousness, it is the same as eating Christ's dress. When
          a man lives on his frames and feelings, that is as much as if the
          child of God should live on some tokens that he received in the
          sanctuary that never were meant for food, but only to comfort him a
          little. What the Christian lives on is not Christ's righteousness, but
          Christ; he does not live on Christ's pardon, but on Christ; and on
          Christ he lives daily, on nearness to Christ. Oh! I do love Christ-
          preaching. It is not the doctrine of justification that does my heart
          good, it is Christ, the justifier; it is not pardon that so much makes
          the Christian's heart rejoice, it is Christ the pardoner; it is not
          election that I love half so much as my being chosen in Christ ere
          worlds began; ay! it is not final perseverance that I love so much as
          the thought that in Christ my life is hid, and that since he gives
          unto his sheep eternal life, they shall never perish, neither shall
          any man pluck them out of his hand. Take care, Christian, to eat the
          Paschal Lamb and nothing else. I tell thee man, if thou eatest that
          alone, it will be like bread to thee -- thy soul's best food. If thou
          livest on aught else but the Saviour, thou art like one who seeks to
          live on some weed that grows in the desert, instead of eating the
          manna that comes down from heaven. Jesus is the manna. In Jesus as
          well as by Jesus we live. Now, dear friends, in coming to this table,
          we will keep the Paschal Supper. Once more, by faith, we will eat the
          Lamb, by holy trust we will come to a crucified Saviour, and feed on
          his blood, and righteousness, and atonement.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, in concluding, let me ask you, are you hoping to be saved my
          friends? One says, "Well, I don't hardly know; I hope to saved, but I
          do not know how." Do you know, you imagine I tell you a fiction, when
          I tell you that people are hoping to be saved by works, but it is not
          so, it is a reality. In travelling through the country I meet with all
          sorts of characters, but most frequently with self-righteous persons.
          How often do I meet with a man who thinks himself quite godly because
          he attends the church once on a Sunday, and who thinks himself quite
          righteous because he belongs to the Establishment; as a churchman said
          to me the other day, "I am a rigid churchman." "I am glad of that," I
          said to him, "because then you are a Calvinist, if you hold the
          Articles.'" He replied "I don't know about the Articles,' I go more by
          the Rubric.'" And so I thought he was more of a formalist than a
          Christian. There are many persons like that in the world. Another
          says, "I believe I shall be saved. I don't owe anybody anything; I
          have never been a bankrupt; I pay everybody twenty shillings in the
          pound; I never get drunk; and if I wrong anybody at any time, I try to
          make up for it by giving a pound a year to such-and-such a society; I
          am as religious as most people; and I believe I shall be saved." That
          will not do. It is as if some old Jew had said, "We don't want the
          blood on the lintel, we have got a mahogany lintel; we don't want the
          blood on the door-post, we have a mahogany door-post." Ah! whatever it
          was, the angel would have smitten it if it had not had the blood upon
          it. You may be as righteous as you like: if you have not the blood
          sprinkled, all the goodness of your door-posts and lintels will be of
          no avail whatever. "Yes," says another, "I am not trusting exactly
          there. I believe it is my duty to be as good as I can; but then I
          think Jesus Christ's mercy will make up the rest. I try to be as
          righteous as circumstances allow; and I believe that whatever
          deficiencies there may be, Christ will make them up." That is as if a
          Jew had said, "Child, bring me the blood," and then, when that was
          brought, he had said, "bring me a ewer of water;" and then he had
          taken it and mixed it together, and sprinkled the door-post with it.
          Why, the angel would have smitten him as well as anyone else, for it
          is blood, blood, blood, blood! that saves. It is not blood mixed with
          the water of our poor works; it is blood, blood, blood, blood! and
          nothing else. And the only way of salvation is by blood. For, without
          the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin. have precious
          blood sprinkled upon you, my hearers; trust in precious blood; let
          your hope be in a salvation sealed with an atonement of precious
          blood, and you are saved. But having no blood, or having blood mixed
          with anything else, thou art damned as thou art alive -- for the angel
          shall slay thee, however good and righteous thou mayest be. Go home,
          then, and think of this: "Christ our Passover is sacrificed for
          us."<br />
