<p align="justify">Title. A Song of Degrees. This is the seventh step, and 
    we may therefore expect to meet with some special perfection of joy in it; 
    nor shall we look in vain. We see here not only that Zion <i>abides</i>, but 
    that her <i>joy returns after sorrow</i>. Abiding is not enough, 
    fruitfulness is added. The pilgrims went from blessing to blessing in their 
    Psalmody as they proceeded on their holy way. Happy people to whom every 
    ascent was a song, every halt a hymn. Here the truster becomes a sower: 
    faith works by love, obtains a present bliss, and secures a harvest of 
    delight.</p>
<p align="justify">There is nothing in this Psalm by which we can decide its 
    date, further than this—that it is a song after a great deliverance from 
    oppression. "Turning captivity" by no means requires an actual removal into 
    banishment to fill out the idea; rescue from any dire affliction or crushing 
    tyranny would be fitly described as "captivity turned." Indeed, the passage 
    is not applicable to captives in Babylon, for it is Zion itself which is in 
    captivity, and not a part of her citizens: the holy city was in sorrow and 
    distress; though it could not be removed, the prosperity could be 
    diminished. Some dark cloud lowered over the beloved capital, and its 
    citizens prayed "Turn again our captivity, O Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">This Psalm is in its right place and most fitting it 
    follows its predecessor, for as in Psalm 125:1-5 we read that the rod of the 
    wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous, we here see it removed 
    from them to their great joy. The word "turn" would seem to be the key-note 
    of the song; it is a Psalm of conversion—conversion from captivity; and it 
    may well be used to set forth the rapture of a pardoned soul when the anger 
    of the Lord is turned away from it. We will call it, "Leading captivity 
    captive."</p>
<p align="justify">The Psalm divides itself into<br/>
    a narrative (Psalm 126:1, 19 126:2), <br/>
    a song (Psalm 126:3), <br/>
    a prayer (Psalm 126:4),<br/>
    and a promise (Psalm 126:5-6). </p>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    EXPOSITION.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 126:1<br/>
    "When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that 
    dream"</p></b> Being in trouble the gracious pilgrims remember: for their 
    comfort times of national woe which were succeeded by remarkable 
    deliverances. Then sorrow was gone like a dream, and the joy which followed 
    was so great that it seemed too good to be true, and they feared that it 
    must be the vision of an idle brain. So sudden and so overwhelming was their 
    joy that they felt like men out of themselves, ecstatic, or in a trance. The 
    captivity had been great, and great was the deliverance; for the great God 
    himself had wrought it: it seemed too good to be actually true: each man 
    said to himself,
<p align="justify">"Is this a dream? O if it be a dream,<br/>
 Let me sleep on, and do not wake me yet."</p>
<p align="justify">It was not the freedom of an individual which the Lord in 
    mercy had wrought, but of all Zion, of the whole nation; and this was reason 
    enough for overflowing gladness. We need not instance the histories which 
    illustrate this verse in connection with literal Israel; but it is well to 
    remember how often it has been true to ourselves. </p>
<p align="justify">Let us look to the prison-houses from which we have been 
    set free. Ah, me, what captives we have been! At our first conversion what a 
    turning again of captivity we experienced. Never shall that hour be 
    forgotten. Joy! Joy! Joy! Since then, from multiplied troubles, from 
    depression of spirit, from miserable backsliding, from grievous doubt, we 
    have been emancipated, and we are not able to describe the bliss which 
    followed each emancipation.</p>
<p align="justify">"When God revealed his gracious name<br/>
    And changed our mournful state,<br/>
    Our rapture seemed a pleasing dream.<br/>
    The grace appeared so great!"</p>
<p align="justify">This verse will have a higher fulfillment in the day of 
    the final overthrow of the powers of darkness when the Lord shall come forth 
    for the salvation and glorification of his redeemed. Then in a fuller sense 
    than even at Pentecost our old men shall see visions, and our young men 
    shall dream dreams. Yes, all things shall be so wonderful, so far beyond all 
    expectation, that those who behold them shall ask themselves whether it be 
    not all a dream. </p>
<p align="justify">The past is ever a sure prognostic of the future; the 
    thing which has been is the thing that shall be, we shall again and again 
    find ourselves amazed at the wonderful goodness of the Lord. Let our hearts 
    gratefully remember the former lovingkindnesses of the Lord, we were sadly 
    low, sorely distressed, and completely past hope, but when Jehovah appeared
    <i>he did not merely lift us out of despondency, he raised us into wondering 
    happiness. </i>The Lord who alone turns our captivity does nothing by 
    halves; those whom he saves from Hell he brings to Heaven. He turns exile 
    into ecstasy, and banishment into bliss.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 126:2<br/>
    "Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing." </p></b>
    So full were they of joy that they could not contain themselves. They must 
    express their joy and yet they could not find expression for it. 
    Irrepressible mirth could do no other than laugh, for speech was far too 
    dull a thing for it. The mercy was so unexpected, so amazing, so singular 
    that they could not do less than laugh; and they laughed much, so that their 
    mouths were full of it, and that because their hearts were full too. When at 
    last the tongue could move articulately, it could not be content simply to 
    talk, but it must needs sing; and sing heartily too, for it was full of 
    singing. Doubtless the former pain added to the zest of the pleasure, the 
    captivity threw a brighter color into the emancipation. The people 
    remembered this joy-flood for years after, and here is the record of it 
    turned into a song. 
<p align="justify">Note the <i>when </i>and the <i>then</i>. God's when is 
    our then. At the moment when he turns our captivity, the heart turns from 
    its sorrow; when he fills us with grace we are filled with gratitude. We 
    were made to be as those who dream, but we both laughed and sang in our 
    sleep. We are wide awake now, and though we can scarcely realize the 
    blessing, yet we rejoice in it exceedingly.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"Then said they among the heathen, The Lord has done 
    great things for them."</p></b> The heathen heard the songs of Israel, and the 
    better sort among them soon guessed the cause of their joy. Jehovah was 
    known to be their God, and to him the other nations ascribed the 
    emancipation of his people, reckoning it to be no small thing which the Lord 
    had thus done; for those who carried away the nations had never in any other 
    instance restored a people to their ancient dwelling-place. These foreigners 
    were no dreamers; though they were only lookers-on, and not partakers in the 
    surprising mercy, they plainly saw what had been done, and rightly ascribed 
    it to the great Giver of all good.
<p align="justify">It is a blessed thing when saints set sinners talking 
    about the loving-kindness of the Lord, and it is equally blessed when the 
    saints who are hidden away in the world hear of what the Lord has done for 
    his church, and themselves resolve to come out from their captivity and 
    unite with the Lord's people. </p>
<p align="justify">Ah, dear reader, Jehovah has indeed done marvelous things 
    for his chosen people, and these "great things" shall be themes for eternal 
    praise among all intelligent creatures.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 126:3<br/>
    "The Lord has done great things for us; whereof we are glad."</p></b> They did 
    not deny the statement which reflected so much glory upon Jehovah: with 
    exultation they admitted and repeated the statement of Jehovah's notable 
    dealings with them. To themselves they appropriated the joyful assertion; 
    they said "The Lord has done great things for us," and they declared their 
    gladness at the fact. 
<p align="justify">It is a poor modesty which is ashamed to own its joy in 
    the Lord. Call it rather a robbery of God. There is so little of happiness 
    abroad that if we possess a full share of it we ought not to hide our light 
    under a bushel, but let it shine on all that are in the house. Let us avow 
    our joy, and the reason of it, stating the "whereof" as well as the fact.
    </p>
<p align="justify">None are so happy as those who are newly turned and 
    returned from captivity; none can more promptly and satisfactorily give a 
    reason for the gladness that is in them. The Lord himself has blessed us, 
    blessed us greatly, blessed us individually, blessed us assuredly; and 
    because of this we sing unto his name. </p>
<p align="justify">I heard one say the other day in prayer "whereof we <i>
    desire </i>to be glad." Strange dilution and defilement of Scriptural 
    language! Surely if God has done great things for us we <i>are </i>glad, and 
    cannot be otherwise. No doubt such language is meant to be lowly, but in 
    truth it is loathsome.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 126:4<br/>
    "Turn again our captivity, O Lord." </p></b>Remembering the former joy of a past 
    rescue they cry to Jehovah for a repetition of it. When we pray for the 
    turning Of our captivity, it is wise to recall former instances thereof: <i>
    nothing strengthens faith more effectually than the memory of a previous 
    experience</i>. 
<p align="justify">"The Lord has done" harmonizes well with the prayer, 
    "Turn again." The text shows us how wise it is to resort anew to the Lord 
    who in former times has been so good to us. Where else should we go but to 
    him who has done such great things for us? Who can turn again our captivity 
    but he who turned it before?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"As the streams in the south." </p></b>Even as the Lord sends 
    floods adown the dry beds of southern torrents after long droughts, so can 
    he fill our wasted and wearied spirits with floods of holy delight. This the 
    Lord can do for any of us, and he can do it at once, for nothing is too hard 
    for the Lord. It is well for us thus to pray, and to bring our suit before 
    him who is able to bless us exceeding abundantly. Do not let us forget the 
    past, but in the presence of our present difficulty let us resort unto the 
    Lord, and beseech him to do that for us which we cannot possibly do for 
    ourselves—that which no other power can perform on our behalf. 
<p align="justify">Israel did return from the captivity in Babylon, and it 
    was even as though a flood of people hastened to Zion. Suddenly and 
    plenteously the people filled again the temple courts. In streams they shall 
    also in the latter days return to their own land, and replenish it yet 
    again. Like mighty torrents shall the nations flow unto the Lord in the day 
    of his grace. May the Lord hasten it in his own time.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 126:5<br/>
    "They that sow in tears shall reap in joy."</p></b> Hence, present distress must 
    not be viewed as if it would last forever: it is not the end, by any means, 
    but only a means to the end. <i>Sorrow is our sowing, rejoicing shall be our 
    reaping</i>. If there were no sowing in tears, there would be no reaping in 
    joy. If we were never captives we could never lead our captivity captive. 
    Our mouth had never been filled with holy laughter if it had not been first 
    filled with the bitterness of grief. We must sow—we may have to sow in the 
    wet weather of sorrow; but we shall reap, and reap in the bright summer 
    season of joy. Let us keep to the work of this present sowing time, and find 
    strength in the promise which is here so positively given us. Here is one of 
    the Lord's <i>shalls </i>and wills; it is freely given both to workers, 
    waiters, and weepers, and they may rest assured that it will not fail: "in 
    due season they shall reap."
<p align="justify">This sentence may well pass current in the church as an 
    inspired proverb. It is not every sowing which is thus insured against all 
    danger, and guaranteed a harvest; but the promise specially belongs to 
    sowing in tears. When a man's heart is so stirred that he weeps over the 
    sins of others, he is elect to usefulness. <i>Winners of souls are first 
    weepers for souls. </i>As there is no birth without travail, so is there no 
    spiritual harvest without painful tillage. When our own hearts are broken 
    with grief at man's transgression we shall break other men's hearts: tears 
    of earnestness beget tears of repentance: "deep calls unto deep."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 126:6<br/>
    "He."</p></b> The general assurance is applied to each one in particular. That 
    which is spoken in Psalm 126:5 in the plural—"they," is here repeated in the 
    singular—"he." 
<b>
<p align="justify">"He who goes forth and weeps, bearing precious seed, 
    shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him."</p></b> 
    He leaves his couch to go forth into the frosty air and tread the heavy 
    soil; and as he goes he weeps because of past failures, or because the 
    ground is so sterile, or the weather so unseasonable, or his corn so scarce, 
    and his enemies so plentiful and so eager to rob him of his reward.
<p align="justify">He drops a seed and a tear, a seed and a tear, and so 
    goes on his way. In his basket he has seed which is precious to him, for he 
    has little of it, and it is his hope for the next year. Each grain leaves 
    his hand with anxious prayer that it may not be lost: he thinks little of 
    himself, but much of his seed, and he eagerly asks, "Will it prosper? shall 
    I receive a reward for my labor?" Yes, good gardener, doubtless you will 
    gather sheaves from your sowing.</p>
<p align="justify">Because the Lord has written <i>doubtless</i>, take heed 
    that you do not doubt. No reason for doubt can remain after the Lord has 
    spoken. You will return to this field—not to sow, but to reap; not to weep, 
    but to rejoice: and after awhile you will go home again with nimbler step 
    than today, though with a heavier load, for you shall have sheaves to bear 
    with you. Your handful shall be so greatly multiplied that many sheaves 
    shall spring from it; and you shall have the pleasure of reaping them and 
    bringing them home to the place from which you went out weeping.</p>
<p align="justify">This is a figurative description of that which was 
    literally described in verses 1-3. It is the turning of the worker's 
    captivity, when, instead of seed buried beneath black earth, he sees the 
    waving crops inviting him to a golden harvest.</p>
<p align="justify">It is somewhat singular to find this promise of 
    fruitfulness in close contact with return from captivity; and yet it is so 
    in our own experience, for when our own soul is revived the souls of others 
    are blessed by our labors. If any of us, having been once lonesome and 
    lingering captives, have now returned home, and have become longing and 
    laboring sowers—may the Lord, who has already delivered us, soon transform 
    us into glad-hearted reapers, and to him shall be praise forever and ever. 
    Amen. </p>
