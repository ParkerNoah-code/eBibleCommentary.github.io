          A Note by the Translator. -- The following list of the Syrian names of
          months, in use in the empire and during the era of the Seleucidæ,
          several of which have been mentioned in these Documents, is taken from
          Caswinii Calendarium Syriacum, edited in Arabic and Latin by Volck,
          1859. The later Hebrew names also are here added for comparison. It
          must, however, be noticed that |the years employed in the Syrian
          Calendar, were, at least after the incarnation, Julian years, composed
          of Roman months.| (SeeL'Art de vérifier les dates: Paris, 1818, tom.
          i. p.45.) The correspondence with the Hebrew months, therefore, is not
          so close as the names would indicate, since these commenced with the
          new moons, and an intercalary month, Veadar, following their twelfth
          month Adar, was added.
