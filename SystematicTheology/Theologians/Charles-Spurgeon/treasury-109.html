 </p>
</b></font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">This historic psalm was evidently composed by King David, 
    for the first fifteen verses of it were used as a hymn at the carrying up of 
    the ark from the house of Obed Edom, and we read in 1 Chronicles 16:7, "Then 
    on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the Lord, into the 
    hand of Asaph and his brethren." </p>
<p align="justify">Such a song was suitable for the occasion, for it 
    describes the movements of the Lord's people and his guardian care over them 
    in every place, and all this on account of the covenant of which the ark, 
    then removing, was a symbol. </p>
<p align="justify">Our last psalm sang the opening chapters of Genesis—and 
    this takes up its closing chapters and conducts us into Exodus and Numbers.</p>
<p align="justify">The first verses are full of joyful praise, and call upon 
    the people to extol Jehovah, 1-7; </p>
<p align="justify">then the earliest days of the infant nation, are 
    described, 8-15; </p>
<p align="justify">the going into Egypt, 16-23,</p>
<p align="justify">the coming forth from it with the Lord's outstretched 
    arm, 24-38, </p>
<p align="justify">the journeying through the wilderness and the entrance 
    into Canaan.</p>
<p align="justify">We are now among the <i>long </i>Psalms, as at other 
    times we have been among the short ones. These varying lengths of the sacred 
    poems should teach us not to lay down any law either of brevity or prolixity 
    in either prayer or praise. Short petitions and single verses of hymns are 
    often the best for public occasions—but there are seasons when a whole night 
    of wrestling or an entire day of psalm singing will be none too long. The 
    Spirit is ever free in his operations, and is not to be confined within the 
    rules of conventional propriety. The wind blows as it wills—and at one time 
    rushes in short and rapid sweep, while at another it continues to refresh 
    the earth hour after hour with its reviving breath.</p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. O give thanks unto the Lord. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Jehovah is the author of all our benefits, therefore let 
    him have all our gratitude. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Call upon his name.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Or call him by his name; proclaim his titles and fill the 
    world with his renown. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Make known his deeds among the people.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Or among the nations. Let the heathen hear of our God, 
    that they may forsake their idols and learn to worship him. The removal of 
    the ark was a fit occasion for proclaiming aloud the glories of the Great 
    King, and for publishing to all mankind the greatness of his doings, for it 
    had a history in connection with the nations which it was well for them to 
    remember with reverence. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The rest of the psalm is a sermon, of which these first 
    verses constitute the text.</p>
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. Sing unto him. </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">Bring your best thoughts and express them in the best 
    language to the sweetest sounds. Take care that your singing is "unto him, 
    "and not merely for the sake of the music or to delight the ears of others.
    </p></i>Singing is so delightful an exercise that it is a pity so much or it 
    should be wasted upon trifles, or worse than trifles. O you who can emulate 
    the nightingale, and almost rival the angels, we do most earnestly pray that 
    your hearts may be renewed so that your floods of melody may be poured out 
    at your Maker's and Redeemer's feet. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Talk of all his wondrous works. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Men love to speak of marvels, and others are generally 
    glad to hear of surprising things; surely the believer in the living God has 
    before him the most amazing series of wonders ever heard of or imagined, his 
    themes are inexhaustible and they are such as should hold men spellbound. We 
    ought to have more of this talk—no one would be blamed as a Mr. Talkative if 
    this were his constant theme. Talk, all of you—you all know something by 
    experience of the marvelous loving kindness of the Lord. In this way, by all 
    dwelling on this blessed subject, "all" his wondrous works will be 
    published. </p>
<p align="justify">One cannot do it, nor ten thousand times ten thousand—but 
    if all speak to the Lord's honor, they will at least come nearer to 
    accomplishing the deed. </p>
<p align="justify">We ought to have a wide range when conversing upon the 
    Lord's doings, and should not shut our eyes to any part of them. Talk of his 
    wondrous works in <i>creation </i>and in <i>grace</i>, in <i>judgment </i>
    and in <i>mercy</i>, in providential interpositions and in spiritual 
    comforting. Leave out none, or it will be to your damage. Obedience to this 
    verse will give every sanctified tongue some work to do. The trained 
    musicians can sing, and the commoner voices can talk, and in both ways the 
    Lord will receive a measure of the thanks due to him, and his deeds will be 
    made known among the people.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. Glory in his holy name.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Make it a matter of joy that you have such a God. His 
    character and attributes are such as will never make you blush to call him 
    your God. Idolaters may well be ashamed of the actions attributed to their 
    imagined deities, their names are foul with lust and red with blood—but 
    Jehovah is wholly glorious; every deed of his will bear the strictest 
    scrutiny. His <i>name </i>is holy, his <i>character </i>is holy, his <i>law
    </i>is holy, his <i>government </i>is holy, his <i>influence </i>is holy. In 
    all this we may make our boast, nor can any deny our right to do so.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">If they have not yet found him so fully as they 
    desire—yet even to be allowed and enabled to seek after such a God is cause 
    for gladness. To worship the Lord and seek his kingdom and righteousness is 
    the sure way to happiness, mad indeed there is no other. True seekers throw 
    their hearts into the engagement, hence their hearts receive joy; according 
    to the text they have a permit to rejoice and they have the promise that 
    they shall do so. How happy all these sentences are! Where can men's ears be 
    when they talk of the gloom of psalm singing? What worldly songs are fuller 
    of real mirth? One hears the sound of the timbrel and the harp in every 
    verse. Even seekers find bliss in the name of the Lord Jesus—but as for the 
    finders, we may say with the poet,</p>
<p align="justify">"And those who find you find a bliss,<br/>
    Nor tongue nor pen can show: <br/>
    The love of Jesus what it is,<br/>
    None but his loved ones know."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. Seek the Lord and his strength.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Put yourselves under his protection. Regard him not as a 
    puny God—but look unto his omnipotence, and seek to know the power of his 
    grace. We all need strength; let us look to the strong One for it. We need 
    infinite power to bear us safely to our eternal resting place, let us look 
    to the Almighty Jehovah for it. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Seek his face evermore.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Seek, seek, seek, we have the word three times, and 
    though the words differ in the Hebrew, the sense is the same. It must be a 
    blessed thing to seek, or we would not be thus stirred up to do so. </p>
<p align="justify">To seek his face is to desire his presence, his smile, 
    his favor consciously enjoyed. First we seek <i>him</i>, then his <i>
    strength </i>and then his <i>face</i>; from the personal reverence, we pass 
    on to the imparted power, and then to the conscious favor. This seeking must 
    never cease—the more we know, the more we must seek to know. Finding him, we 
    must "our minds inflame to seek him more and more." He seeks spiritual 
    worshipers, and spiritual worshipers seek him; they are therefore sure to 
    meet face to face before long.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. Remember his marvelous works that he has done.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Memory is never better employed than upon such topics. 
    Alas, we are far more ready to recollect foolish and evil things, than to 
    retain in our minds the glorious deeds of Jehovah. If we would keep these in 
    remembrance our <i>faith </i>would be stronger, our <i>gratitude </i>warmer, 
    our <i>devotion </i>more fervent, and our <i>love </i>more intense. Shame 
    upon us that we should let slip what it would seem impossible to forget. We 
    ought to need no exhortation to remember such wonders, especially as he has 
    wrought them all on the behalf of his people. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">These also should be had in memory. The judgments of his
    <i>mouth </i>are as memorable as the marvels of his <i>hand</i>. God had but 
    to speak and the enemies of his people were sorely afflicted; his threats 
    were not mere words—but smote his adversaries terribly. As the Word of God 
    is the salvation of his saints, so is it the destruction of the ungodly. Out 
    of his mouth goes a two edged sword with which he will slay the wicked.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. O seed of Abraham his servant, you children of 
    Jacob his chosen. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Should all the world forget, you are bound to remember. 
    Your father <i>Abraham </i>saw his wonders and judgments upon Sodom, and 
    upon the kings who came from far. <i>Jacob </i>also saw the Lord's marvelous 
    works in visiting the nations with famine—yet providing for his chosen a 
    choice inheritance in a goodly land. Therefore let the children praise their 
    father's God. </p>
<p align="justify">The Israelites were the Lord's elect nation, and they 
    were bound to imitate their progenitor, who was the Lord's faithful servant 
    and walked before him in holy faith: the seed of Abraham should not be 
    unbelieving, nor should the children of so true a servant become rebels. </p>
<p align="justify">As we read this pointed appeal to the chosen seed we 
    should recognize the special claims which the Lord has upon ourselves, since 
    we too have been favored above all others. Election is not a couch for 
    ease—but an argument for sevenfold diligence. <i>If God has set his choice 
    upon us, let us aim to be choice men.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. He is the Lord our God.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Blessed be his name. Jehovah condescends to be our God. 
    This sentence contains a greater wealth of meaning than all the eloquence of 
    orators can compass, and there is more joy in it than in all the sonnets of 
    them that make merry. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">His judgments are in all the earth.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Or in all the land, for the whole of the country was 
    instructed by his law, ruled by his statutes, and protected by his 
    authority. What a joy it is that our God is never absent from us, he is 
    never non-resident, never an absentee ruler, his judgments are in all the 
    places in which we dwell. If the second clause of this verse refers to the 
    whole world, it is very beautiful to see the speciality of Israel's election 
    united with the universality of Jehovah's reign. </p>
<p align="justify">Not alone to the one nation did the Lord reveal 
    himself—but his glory flashed around the globe. It is astonishing that the 
    Jewish people should have become so exclusive, and have so utterly lost the 
    missionary spirit, for their sacred literature is full of the broad and 
    generous sympathies which are so consistent with the worship of "the God of 
    the whole earth." </p>
<p align="justify">Nor is it less painful to observe that among a certain 
    class of believers in God's election of grace there lingers a hard exclusive 
    spirit, fatal to compassion and zeal. It would be well for these also to 
    remember that their Redeemer is "the Savior of all men, especially of those 
    who believe."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. He has remembered his covenant forever.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Here is the basis of all his dealings with his people: he 
    had entered into covenant with them in their father Abraham, and to this 
    covenant he remained faithful. The exhortation to remember (verse 5) 
    receives great force from the fact that God has remembered. If the Lord has 
    his promise in memory surely we ought not to forget the wonderful manner in 
    which he keeps it. To us it should be matter for deepest joy that never in 
    any instance has the Lord been unmindful of his covenant engagements, nor 
    will he be so world without end. O that we were as mindful of them as he is.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The word which he commanded to a thousand generations.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This is only an amplification of the former statement, 
    and serves to set before us <i>the immutable fidelity of the Lord during the 
    changing generations of men. </i>His judgments are threatened upon the third 
    and fourth generations of them that hate him—but his love runs on forever, 
    even to "a thousand generations." </p>
<p align="justify">His promise is here said to be commanded, or vested with 
    all the authority of a law. It is a proclamation from a sovereign, the 
    command of an Emperor whose laws shall stand fast in every jot and tittle 
    though Heaven and earth shall pass away. Therefore let us give thanks unto 
    the Lord and talk of all his wondrous works, so wonderful for their 
    faithfulness and truth.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. Which covenant he made with ABRAHAM. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">When the victims were divided and the burning lamp passed 
    between the pieces (Genesis 15) then the Lord made, or ratified, the 
    covenant with the patriarch. This was a solemn deed, performed not without 
    blood, and the cutting in pieces of the sacrifice; it points us to the 
    greater covenant which in Christ Jesus is signed, sealed, and ratified, that 
    it may stand fast forever and ever. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And his oath unto ISAAC. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Isaac did not in vision see the solemn making of the 
    covenant—but the Lord renewed unto him his oath (Genesis 26:2-5). This was 
    enough for him, and must have established his faith in the Most High. We 
    have the privilege of seeing in our Lord Jesus both the sacrificial seal, 
    and the eternal oath of God, by which every promise of the covenant is made 
    yes and amen to all the chosen seed.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. And confirmed the same unto JACOB for a law.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Jacob in his wondrous dream (Genesis 28:10-15) received a 
    pledge that the Lord's mode of procedure with him would be in accordance 
    with covenant relations; for said Jehovah, "I will not leave you until I 
    have done that which I have spoken to you of." Thus, if we may so speak with 
    all reverence, the covenant became a law unto the Lord himself by which he 
    bound himself to act. O matchless condescension, that the most free and 
    sovereign Lord should put himself under covenant bonds to His chosen, and 
    make a law for himself, though he is above all law. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And to ISRAEL for an everlasting covenant. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">When he changed Jacob's name he did not change his 
    covenant—but it is written, "he blessed him there" (Genesis 32:29), and it 
    was with the old blessing, according to the unchangeable word of abiding 
    grace.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. Saying, Unto you will I give the land of 
    Canaan, the portion of your inheritance. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This repetition of the great covenant promise is recorded 
    in Genesis 35:9-12 in connection with the change of Jacob's name, and very 
    soon after that slaughter of the Shechemites, which had put the patriarch 
    into such great alarm and caused him to use language almost identical with 
    that of the next verse. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. When they were but a few men in number yes, 
    very few, and strangers in it. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have troubled me to 
    make me to a stench among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites 
    and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves 
    together against me, and slay me, and I shall be destroyed, and my house."
    </p>
<p align="justify">Thus the fears of the man of God declared themselves, and 
    they were reasonable if we look only at the circumstances in which he was 
    placed—but they are soon seen to be groundless when we remember that the 
    covenant promise, which guaranteed the possession of the land, necessarily 
    implied the preservation of the race to whom the promise was made. <i>We 
    often fear where no fear is. </i></p>

<p align="justify">The blessings promised to the seed of Abraham were not 
    dependent upon the number of his descendants, or their position in this 
    world. The covenant was made with one man, and consequently the number could 
    never be less, and that one man was not the owner of a foot of soil in all 
    the land, save only a cave in which to bury his dead, and therefore his seed 
    could not have less inheritance than he. </p>
<p align="justify">The smallness of a church, and the poverty of its 
    members, are no barriers to the divine blessing—if it be sought earnestly by 
    pleading the promise. Were not the apostles few, and the disciples feeble, 
    when the good work began? Neither because we are strangers and foreigners 
    here below, as our fathers were, are we in any the more danger.<i> We are 
    like sheep in the midst of wolves—but the wolves cannot hurt us, for our 
    shepherd is near.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. When they went from one nation, to another, 
    from one Kingdom to another people. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Migrating as the patriarchs did from the region of one 
    tribe to the country of another they were singularly preserved. The little 
    wandering family might have been cut off root and branch had not a special 
    mandate been issued from the throne for their protection. It was not the 
    gentleness of their neighbors which screened them; <i>they were hedged about 
    by the mysterious guardianship of Heaven</i>. Whether in Egypt, or in 
    Philistia, or in Canaan, the heirs of the promises, dwelling in their tents, 
    were always secure.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14. He allowed no man to do them wrong.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Men cannot wrong us unless he allows them to do so; the 
    greatest of them must wait his permission before they can place a finger 
    upon us. The wicked would devour us if they could—but they cannot even cheat 
    us of a farthing without divine permission. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Pharaoh and Abimelech must both be made to respect the 
    singular strangers who had come to sojourn in their land; the greatest kings 
    are very second rate persons with God in comparison with his chosen 
    servants.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 15. Saying, touch not my anointed, and do my 
    prophets no harm.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Abraham and his seed were in the midst of the world a 
    generation of <i>priests </i>anointed to present sacrifice unto the most 
    High God; since to them the oracles were committed, they were also the <i>
    prophets </i>of mankind. They were <i>kings </i>too—a royal priesthood; 
    hence they had received a threefold anointing. Their holy office surrounded 
    them with a sacredness which rendered it sacrilege to molest them. The Lord 
    was pleased to impress the wild tribes of Canaan with a respectful awe of 
    the pious strangers who had come to abide with them, so that they came not 
    near them to do them ill. </p>
<p align="justify">The words here mentioned may not have been actually 
    spoken—but the impression of awe which fell upon the nations is thus 
    poetically described. God will not have those harmed, who have been set 
    apart unto himself. He calls them his own, saying, "My anointed" he declares 
    that he has "anointed" them to be prophets, priests, and kings unto himself, 
    and yet again he claims them as his prophets, "Do my prophets no harm." </p>
<p align="justify">All through the many years in which the three great 
    fathers dwelt in Canaan no man was able to injure them; they were not able 
    to defend themselves by force of arms; but the eternal God was their refuge.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Even so at this present time the remnant according to the 
    election of grace cannot be destroyed, nay, nor so much as touched, without 
    the divine consent. Against the church of Christ the gates of Hell cannot 
    prevail. </p>
<p align="justify">In all this we see reasons for giving thanks unto the 
    Lord, and proclaiming his name according to the exhortation of the first 
    verse of the Psalm.</p>
<p align="justify">Here ends the portion which was sung at the moving of the 
    ark. Its fitness to be used for such a purpose is very manifest, for the ark 
    was the symbol both of the covenant and of that mystic dwelling of God with 
    Israel which was at once her glory and her defense. None could touch the 
    Lord's peculiar ones, for the Lord was among them, flaming forth in majesty 
    between the cherubim. </p>
<p align="justify">The presence of God having remained with his chosen ones 
    while they sojourned in Canaan, it did not desert them when they were called 
    to go down into Egypt. They did not go there of their own choice—but under 
    divine direction, and hence the Lord prepared their way and prospered them 
    until he saw fit to conduct them again to the land of promise.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 16. Moreover he called for a <i>famine </i>upon the 
    land. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He had only to call for it as a man calls for his 
    servant, and it came at once. How grateful ought we to be that he does not 
    often call in that terrible servant of his, so meager and gaunt, and grim, 
    so pitiless to the women and the children, so bitter to the strong men, who 
    utterly fail before it. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">He broke the whole staff of bread. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Man's feeble life cannot stand without its staff—if bread 
    fails him, he fails. As a cripple with a broken staff falls to the ground, 
    so does man when there is no bread to sustain him. To God it is as easy to 
    make a famine as to break a staff. He could make that famine universal, too, 
    so that all countries should be in like case: then would the race of man 
    fall indeed, and its staff would be broken forever. </p>
<p align="justify">There is this sweet comfort in the matter, that <i>the 
    Lord has wise ends to serve even by famine</i>. He meant his people to go 
    down into Egypt, and the scarcity of food was his method of leading them 
    there, for "they heard that there was grain in Egypt."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 17. He sent a man before them, even Joseph.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He was the advance guard and pioneer for the whole clan.<i> 
    His brethren sold him—but God sent him. </i>Where the hand of the wicked is 
    visible, God's hand may be invisibly at work, overruling their malice. No 
    one was more of a man, or more fit to lead the van than Joseph: an 
    interpreter of dreams was wanted, and his brethren had said of him, "Behold, 
    this dreamer comes." </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Who was sold for a servant.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Or rather for a slave. Joseph's journey into Egypt was 
    not so costly as Jonah's voyage when he paid his own fare. His free passage 
    was provided by the Midianites, who also secured his introduction to a great 
    officer of state by handing him over as a slave. His way to a position in 
    which he could feed his family lay through the pit, the slaver's caravan, 
    the slave market and the prison—and who shall deny but what it was the <i>
    right </i>way, the <i>surest </i>way, the <i>wisest </i>way, and perhaps the
    <i>shortest </i>way. Yet assuredly it seemed not so. </p>
<p align="justify">Were we to send a man on such an errand we would furnish 
    him with money—Joseph goes as a pauper; we would clothe him with 
    authority—Joseph goes as a slave; we would leave him at full liberty—Joseph 
    is a bondman.</p>
<p align="justify">Yet <i>money </i>would have been of little use when grain 
    was so dear, <i>authority </i>would have been irritating rather than 
    influential with Pharaoh, and <i>freedom </i>might not have thrown Joseph 
    into connection with Pharaoh's captain and his other servants—and so the 
    knowledge of his skill in interpretation might not have reached the 
    monarch's ear. God way is <i>the </i>way. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Our Lord's path to his mediatorial throne ran by the 
    cross of Calvary.</p>
<p align="justify">Our road to glory runs by the rivers of grief.</p>
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 18. Whose feet they hurt with fetters. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">From this we learn a little more of Joseph's sufferings 
    than we find in the book of Genesis: inspiration had not ceased, and David 
    was as accurate a historian as Moses, for the same Spirit guided his pen.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">He was laid in iron.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Or "into iron came his soul." The prayer book version, 
    "the iron entered into his soul," is ungrammatical—but probably expresses 
    much the same truth. His fetters hurt his mind as well as his body, and well 
    did Jacob say, "The archers shot at him, and sorely grieved him." </p>
<p align="justify">Under the cruelly false accusation, which he could not 
    disprove, his mind was, as it were, belted and bolted around with iron, and 
    had not the Lord been with him he might have sunk under his sufferings.</p>
<p align="justify">In all this, and a thousand things besides, he was an 
    admirable <i>type </i>of him who in the highest sense is "the Shepherd, the 
    stone of Israel." </p>
<p align="justify">The iron fetters were preparing him to wear chains of 
    gold, and making his feet ready to stand on high places.<i> It is even so 
    with all the Lord's afflicted ones, they too shall one day step from their 
    prisons to their thrones.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 19. Until the time that his word came. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">God has his times, and his children must wait until his 
    "until" is fulfilled. Joseph was tried as in a furnace, until the Lord's 
    assaying work was fully accomplished. The word of the chief butler was 
    nothing, he had to wait until God's word came, and meanwhile the word of the 
    Lord tried him. He believed the promise—but his faith was sorely exercised.
    </p>
<p align="justify">A delayed blessing tests men, and proves their metal, 
    whether their faith is of that precious kind which can endure the fire. Of 
    many a choice promise we may say with Daniel "the thing was true—but the 
    time appointed was long." If the vision tarries, it is good to wait for it 
    with patience. There is a <i>trying </i>word and a <i>delivering </i>word, 
    and we must bear the one until the other comes to us. </p>
<p align="justify">How meekly Joseph endured his afflictions, and with what 
    fortitude he looked forward to the clearing of his slandered character, we 
    may readily imagine. It will be better still if under similar trials we are 
    able to imitate him, and come forth from the furnace as thoroughly purified 
    as he was, and as well prepared to bear the yet <i>harder ordeal of honor 
    and power.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 20. The king sent and loosed him. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He was thrust into the prison by an officer—but he was 
    released by the monarch himself. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Even the ruler of the people, and let him go free. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The tide had turned, so that Egypt's haughty potentate 
    gave him a call from the prison to the palace. He had interpreted the dreams 
    of captives, himself a captive. He must now interpret for a ruler and become 
    a ruler himself. When God means to enlarge his prisoners, kings become his 
    turnkeys.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 21. He made him lord of his house. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Reserving no power—but saying "only in the throne will I 
    be greater than you." The servitor of slaves becomes lord over nobles. How 
    soon the Lord lifts his chosen from the dunghill to set them among princes.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And ruler of all his substance. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He empowered him to manage the storing of the seven 
    plenteous harvests, and to dispense the provisions in the coming days of 
    scarcity. All the treasures of Egypt were under his lock and key, yes, the 
    granaries of the world were sealed or opened at his bidding. Thus was he in 
    the best conceivable position for preserving alive the house of Israel with 
    whom the covenant was made. </p>
<p align="justify">As our Lord was himself secured in Egypt from Herod's 
    enmity, so, ages before, the redeemed race found an equally available 
    shelter, in the hour of need. </p>
<p align="justify">God has always a refuge for his saints, and if the whole 
    earth could not afford them sanctuary, the Lord himself would be their 
    dwelling place, and take them up to lie in his own bosom. We are always sure 
    to be fed, if all the world should starve.</p>
<p align="justify">It is delightful to think of <i>our greater Joseph </i>
    ruling the nations for the good of his own household, and it becomes us to 
    abide in quiet confidence in every political disaster, since Jesus is on the 
    throne of providence, King of kings and Lord of lords, and will be so until 
    this dispensation ends.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 22. To bind his princes at his pleasure. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He who was bound, obtains authority to bind. He is no 
    longer kept in prison—but keeps all the prisons, and casts into them the 
    greatest nobles when justice demands it. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And teach his senators wisdom. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The heads of the various peoples, the elders of the 
    nations, learned from him the science of government, the art of providing 
    for the people. Joseph was a great instructor in political economy, and we 
    doubt not that he mingled with it the purest morals, the most upright 
    jurisprudence, and something of that divine wisdom without which the most 
    able senators remain in darkness. </p>
<p align="justify">The king's authority made him absolute both in the 
    executive and in the legislative courts, and the Lord instructed him to use 
    his power with discretion. What responsibilities and honors loaded the man 
    who had been rejected by his brothers, and sold for twenty pieces of silver! 
    What glories crown the head of that greater one who was "separated from his 
    brethren."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 23. Israel also came into Egypt. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The aged patriarch came, and with him that increasing 
    company which bore his name. He was hard to bring there. Perhaps nothing 
    short of the hope of seeing Joseph could have drawn him to take so long a 
    journey from the tombs of his forefathers; but <i>the divine will was 
    accomplished and the church of God was removed into an enemy's country, 
    where for a while it was nourished</i>. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Shem the blessed came to lodge awhile with Ham the 
    accursed:<i> the dove was in the vulture's nest</i>. God so willed it for a 
    time, and therefore it was safe and right: still it was only a sojourn, not 
    a settlement. </p>
<p align="justify">The fairest Goshen in Egypt was not the covenant 
    blessing, neither did the Lord mean his people to think it so; even so to us 
    "earth is our lodge" but only our lodge, for Heaven is our home.<i> When we 
    are best housed we ought still to remember that here we have no continuing 
    city. </i>It were ill news for us if we were doomed to reside in Egypt 
    forever, for all its riches are not worthy to be compared with the reproach 
    of Christ. Thus the song rehearsed the removals of the Lord's people, and 
    was a most fit accompaniment to the bearing up of the ark, as the priest 
    carried it into the city of David, where the Lord had appointed it a resting 
    place.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 24. And he increased his people greatly. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">In Goshen they seem to have increased rapidly from the 
    first, and this excited the fears of the Egyptians, so that they tried to 
    retard their increase by oppression—but the Lord continued to bless them.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And made them stronger than their enemies. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Both in physical strength and in numbers they threatened 
    to become the more powerful race. Nor was this growth of the nation impeded 
    by tyrannical measures—but the very reverse took place, thus giving an early 
    instance of what has since become a proverb in the church, "the more they 
    oppressed them, the more they multiplied." <i>It is idle to contend either 
    with God or his people.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 25. He turned their hearts to hate his people.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It was his goodness to Israel which called forth the ill 
    will of the Egyptian court, and so far the Lord caused it, and moreover he 
    made use of this feeling to lead on to the discomfort of his people, and so 
    to their readiness to leave the land to which they had evidently become 
    greatly attached. Thus far but no further did the Lord turn the hearts of 
    the Egyptians. </p>
<p align="justify">God cannot in any sense be the author of sin so far as to 
    be morally responsible for its existence—but it often happens through the 
    evil which is inherent in human nature, that the acts of the Lord arouse the 
    ill feelings of ungodly men. Is the sun to be blamed because while it 
    softens wax it hardens clay? Is the orb of day to be accused of creating the 
    foul exhalations which are drawn by its warmth from the pestilential marsh? 
    The sun causes the reek of the dunghill only in a certain sense; had it been 
    a bed of flowers his beams would have called forth fragrance. </p>
<p align="justify">The evil is in men, and the honor of turning it to good 
    and useful purposes is with the Lord. Hatred is often allied with cunning, 
    and so in the case of the Egyptians.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">They began to deal subtly with his servants.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They treated them in a fraudulent manner, they reduced 
    them to bondage by their exactions, they secretly concerted the destruction 
    of their male children, and at length openly ordained that cruel measure, 
    and all with the view of checking their increase, lest in time of war they 
    should side with invaders in order to obtain their liberty. Surely the 
    depths of Satanic policy were here reached—but vain was the cunning of man 
    against the chosen seed.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 26. He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he 
    had chosen.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">When the oppression was at the worst, Moses came. For the 
    second time we have here the expression, "he sent"; he who sent Joseph sent 
    also Moses and his eloquent brother. The Lord had the men in readiness and 
    all he had to do was to commission them and thrust them forward. They were 
    two, for mutual comfort and strength, even as the apostles and the seventy 
    in our Lord's day were sent forth two and two. The men differed, and so the 
    one became the supplement of the other, and together they were able to 
    accomplish far more than if they had been exactly alike. The main point was 
    that they were both sent, and hence both clothed with divine might.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 27. They showed his signs among them, and wonders 
    in the land of Ham. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The miracles which were wrought by Moses were the Lord's, 
    not his own. Hence they are here called HIS signs, as being the marks of 
    Jehovah's presence hence they are here called "his" and power. The plagues 
    were "words of his signs", that is to say, they were speaking marvels, which 
    testified more plainly than words to the omnipotence of Jehovah, to his 
    determination to be obeyed, to his anger at the obstinacy of Pharaoh. </p>
<p align="justify">Never were discourses more plain, pointed, personal, or 
    powerful—and yet it took ten of them to accomplish the end designed. In the 
    preaching of the gospel there are words, and signs, and wonders and these 
    leave men without excuse for their impenitence. To have the kingdom of God 
    come near unto them, and yet to remain rebellious is the unhappy sin of 
    obstinate spirits. Those are <i>wonders of sin </i>who see wonders of grace, 
    and yet are unaffected by them. As bad as he was, Pharaoh had not this 
    guilt, for the prodigies which lie beheld were marvels of judgment and not 
    of mercy.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 28. He sent darkness, and made it dark.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It was no natural or common darkness to be accounted for 
    by the blinding dust of the whirlwind, it was beyond all precedent and out 
    of the range of ordinary events. It was a horrible palpable obscurity which 
    men felt clinging about them as though it were a robe of death. It was a 
    thick darkness, a total darkness, a darkness which lasted three days, a 
    darkness in which no one dared to stir. What a condition to be in! </p>
<p align="justify">This plague is first mentioned, thought it is not first 
    in order, because it fitly describes all the period of the plagues. The land 
    was in the darkness of sorrow, and in the darkness of sin all the time. If 
    we shudder as we think of that long and terrible gloom, let us reflect upon 
    the gross darkness which still covers heathen lands as the result of sin, 
    for it is one of the chief plagues which iniquity creates for itself. May 
    the day soon come when the people which sit in darkness shall see a great 
    light. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And they rebelled not against his word. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Moses and Aaron did as they were bidden, and during the 
    darkness the Egyptians were so cowed that even when it cleared away they 
    were anxious for Israel to be gone, and had it not been for the pride of 
    Pharaoh they would have rejoiced to speed them on their journey there and 
    then. <i>God can force men to obey, and even make the stoutest hearts eager 
    to pay respect to his will</i>, for fear his plagues should be multiplied.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Possibly, however, the sentence before us neither refers 
    to Moses nor the Egyptians—but to the plagues which came at the Lord's 
    bidding. <i>The darkness, the hail, the frogs, the murrain, were all so many 
    obedient servants of the great Lord of all.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 29. He turned their waters into blood, and slew 
    their fish. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">So that the plague was not a mere coloring of the water 
    with red earth, as some suppose—but the river was offensive and fatal to the 
    fish. The beloved Nile and other streams were all equally tainted and 
    ensanguined. </p>
<p align="justify">Their commonest mercy became their greatest curse. Water 
    is one of the greatest blessings, and the more plentiful it is the 
    better—but blood is a hideous sight to look upon, and to see rivers and 
    pools of it is frightful indeed. </p>
<p align="justify">Fish in Egypt furnished a large part of the food supply, 
    and it was no small affliction to see them floating dead and white upon a 
    stream of crimson. The hand of the Lord thus smote them where all classes of 
    the people would become aware of it and suffer from it.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 30. Their land brought forth frogs in abundance.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">If fish could not live frogs might, yes, they multiplied 
    both on land and in the water until they swarmed beyond all count.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">In the chambers of their kings. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They penetrated the choicest rooms of the palace, and 
    were found upon the couches of state. The Lord called for them and they 
    marched forth. Obnoxious and even loathsome their multitudes became—but 
    there was no resisting them; they seemed to spring out of the ground, the 
    very land brought them forth. Their universal presence must have inspired 
    horror and disgust which would cause sickness and make life a burden; their 
    swarming even in the king's own chambers was a rebuke to his face, which his 
    pride must have felt. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Kings are no more than other men with God</p></i>, nay less 
    than others when they are first in rebellion; if the frogs had abounded 
    elsewhere—but had been kept out of his select apartments, the monarch would 
    have cared little, for he was a heartless being—but God took care that there 
    should be a special horde of the invaders for the palace; they were more 
    than ordinarily abundant in the chambers of their kings.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 31. He spoke. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">See the power of the divine word. He had only to say it 
    and it was done!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And there came divers sorts of flies. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Insects of various annoying kinds came up in infinite 
    hordes, a mixture of biting, stinging, buzzing gnats, mosquitoes, files, 
    beetles, and other vermin such as make men's flesh their prey, the place of 
    deposit for their eggs, and the seat of peculiar torments. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And lice in all their coasts.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">These unutterably loathsome forms of life were as the 
    dust of the ground, and covered their persons, their garments, and all they 
    ate. <i>Nothing is too small to master man, when God commands it to assail 
    him</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">The sons of Ham had despised the Israelites and now they 
    were made to loathe themselves. The meanest beggars were more approachable 
    than the proud Egyptians; they were reduced to the meanest condition of 
    filthiness, and the most painful state of irritation. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">What armies the Lord can send forth when once his right 
    arm is bared for war!</p></i> And what scorn he pours on proud nations when he 
    fights them, not with angels—but with lice! 
<p align="justify">Pharaoh had little left to be proud of when his own 
    person was invaded by filthy parasites. It was a slap in the face which 
    ought to have humbled his heart; but, alas, man, when he is altogether 
    polluted, still maintains his self conceit, and when he is the most 
    disgusting object in the universe, he still vaunts himself. <i>Surely pride 
    is moral madness.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 32. He gave them hail for rain. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They seldom had rain—but now the showers assumed the form 
    of heavy, destructive hail storms, and being accompanied with a hurricane 
    and thunderstorm, they were overwhelming, terrible, and destructive. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And flaming fire in their land. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The lightning was peculiarly vivid, and seemed to run 
    along upon the ground, or fall in fiery flakes. Thus all the fruit of the 
    trees and the harvests of the fields were either broken to pieces or burned 
    on the spot, and universal fear bowed the hearts of men to the dust. No 
    phenomena are more appalling to the most of mankind than those which attend 
    a thunderstorm; <i>even the most audacious blasphemers quail when the dread 
    artillery of Heaven opens fire upon the earth</i>.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 33. He smote their vines also and their fig trees.</p></b>

<p align="justify">So that all hope of gathering their best fruits was gone, 
    and the trees were injured for future bearing. All the crops were destroyed, 
    and these are mentioned as being the more prominent forms of their produce, 
    used by them both at festivals and in common meals. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And broke the trees of their coasts. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">From end to end of Egypt the trees were battered and 
    broken by the terrible hailstorm. God is in earnest when he deals with proud 
    spirits—he will either end them, or mend them.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 34. He spoke, and the locusts came, and 
    caterpillars, and that without number. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">One word from the Captain, and the armies leap forward! 
    The expression is very striking, and sets forth the immediate result of the 
    divine word. The caterpillar is called the licker, because it seems to lick 
    up every green thing as in a moment. Perhaps the caterpillar here meant is 
    still the <i>locust </i>in another form. That locusts swarm in countless 
    armies is a fact of ordinary observation, and the case would be worse on 
    this occasion. We have ourselves ridden for miles through armies of locusts, 
    and we have seen with our own eyes how completely they devour every green 
    thing. The description is not strained when we read, </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 35. And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and 
    devoured the fruit of their ground.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Nothing escapes these ravenous creatures, they even climb 
    the trees to reach any remnant of foliage which may survive. Commissioned as 
    these were by God, we may be sure they would do their work thoroughly, and 
    leave behind them nothing but a desolate wilderness.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 36. Are smote also all the firstborn in their land, 
    the chief of all their strength. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Now came the master blow. The Lord <i>spoke </i>
    before—but now he <i>smites</i>; before he only smote vines—but now he 
    strikes men themselves. The glory of the household dies in a single night, 
    the prime and pick of the nation are cut off, the flower of the troops, the 
    heirs of the rich, and the hopes of the poor all die at midnight. </p>
<p align="justify">Now the target was struck in the center, there was no 
    confronting this plague. Pharaoh feels it as much as the woman slave at the 
    mill. He had smitten Israel, the Lord's firstborn, and the Lord repaid him 
    to his face. What a cry went up throughout the land of Egypt when every 
    house wailed its firstborn at the dead of night! O Jehovah, you did triumph 
    in that hour, and with an outstretched arm did you deliver your people.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 37. He brought them forth also with silver and 
    gold. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This they asked of the Egyptians, perhaps even demanded, 
    and well they might, for they had been robbed and spoiled for many a day, 
    and it was not fit that they should go forth empty handed. Glad were the 
    Egyptians to hand over their jewels to propitiate a people who had such an 
    awesome friend above; they needed no undue pressure, they feared them too 
    much to deny them their requests. </p>
<p align="justify">The Israelites were compelled to leave their houses and 
    lands behind them, and it was but justice that they should be able to turn 
    these into portable property. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And there was not one feeble person among their tribes.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">A great marvel indeed. Their number was very great and 
    yet there was not one carried, or limping in the rear. Poverty and 
    oppression had not enfeebled them. JEHOVAH ROPHI had healed them; they 
    carried none of the diseases of Egypt with them, and felt none of the 
    exhaustion which sore bondage produces. </p>
<p align="justify">When God calls his people to a long journey he fits them 
    for <i>it. In the pilgrimage of life, our strength shall be equal to our day</i>.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">See the contrast between Egypt and Israel—in Egypt one 
    dead in every house, and among the Israelites not one so much as limping!</p>
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 38. Egypt was glad when they departed.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Which would not have been the case had the gold and 
    silver been <i>borrowed </i>by the Israelites, for men do not like to see 
    borrowers carry their goods into a far country. The awe of God was on Egypt, 
    and they feared his people and were glad to pay them to be gone. What a 
    change from the time when the sons of Jacob were the drudges of the land, 
    the offscouring of all things, the brick-makers whose toil was only requited 
    by the lash or the stick. Now they were reverenced as prophets and priests.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">For the fear of them fell upon them.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The people proceeded even to a superstitious terror them. 
    Thus with cheers and good wishes their former taskmasters sent them on their 
    way. Pharaoh was foiled and the chosen people were once more on the move, 
    journeying to the place which the Lord had given to them by a covenant of 
    salt. "O give thanks unto Jehovah; call upon his name, make known his deeds 
    among the people!"</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 39. He spread a cloud for a covering.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Never people were so favored. What would not travelers in 
    the desert now give for such a canopy? The sun could not scorch them with 
    its burning ray; their whole camp was screened like a king in his pavilion. 
    Nothing seemed to be too good for God to give his chosen nation, their 
    comfort was studied in every way. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And fire to give light in the night. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">While cities were swathed in darkness, their town of 
    tents enjoyed a light which modern are with all its appliances cannot equal.<i> 
    God himself was their sun and shield, their glory and their defense. </i></p>

<p align="justify">Could they be unbelieving while so graciously shaded, or 
    rebellious while they walked at midnight in such a light? <i>Alas, the tale 
    of their sin is as extraordinary as this story of His love</i>. But this 
    Psalm selects the happier theme and dwells only upon covenant love and 
    faithfulness. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">O give thanks unto the Lord for he is good. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">We, too, have found the Lord all this to us, for he has 
    been our sun and shield, and has preserved us alike from the perils of joys 
    and the evils of grief. </p>
<p align="justify">"He has been my joy in woe,<br/>
    Cheered my heart when it was low; <br/>
    And with warnings softly sad<br/>
    Calmed my heart when it was glad."</p>
<p align="justify">So has the promise been fulfilled to us, "the sun shall 
    not hurt you by day, nor the moon by night."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 40. The people asked. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">But how badly, how wickedly! And yet his grace forgave 
    the sin of their murmuring and heard its meaning. Or perhaps we may consider 
    that while the multitude murmured there were a few, who were really gracious 
    people, who prayed, and therefore the blessing came. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And he brought them quail, and satisfied them with the 
    bread of Heaven. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He gave them what they asked amiss, as well as what was 
    good for them—mingling judgment with goodness, for their discipline. The 
    quail were more a curse than a blessing in the end, because of their greed 
    and lust—but in themselves they were a peculiar indulgence, and favor: it 
    was their own fault, that the dainty food brought death with it. </p>
<p align="justify">As for the manna it was unmingled good to them, and 
    really satisfied them, which the quail never did. It was bread from 
    Heaven—and the bread of Heaven, sent by Heaven. It was a pity that they were 
    not led to look up to Heaven whence it came, and fear and love the God who 
    out of Heaven rained it upon them. Thus they were housed beneath the Lord's 
    canopy and fed with food from his own table; never were people so lodged and 
    boarded. O house of Israel, Praise the Lord.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 41. He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out.

<p align="justify">With Moses' rod and his own word he cleft the rock in the 
    desert, and forth leaped abundant floods for their drinking where they had 
    feared to die of thirst.<i> From most unlikely sources the all-sufficient 
    God can supply his people's needs; hard rocks become springing fountains at 
    the Lord's command. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">They ran in the dry places like a river.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">So that those at a distance from the rock could stoop 
    down and refresh themselves, and the stream flowed on, so that in future 
    journeyings they were supplied. The desert sand would naturally swallow up 
    the streams, and yet it did not so, the refreshing river ran "in the dry 
    places." </p>
<p align="justify">We know that the<i> rock set forth our Lord Jesus Christ, 
    from whom there flows a fountain of living waters which shall never be 
    exhausted until the last pilgrim has crossed the Jordan and entered Canaan.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 42. For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham 
    his servant.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Here is the secret reason for all this grace. The 
    covenant, and he for whose sake it was made are ever on the heart of the 
    Most High. He remembered his people, because he remembered his covenant. He 
    could not violate that gracious compact, for it was sacred to him.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">His holy promise.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">A holy God must keep his promise holy. In our case the 
    Lord's eye is upon his beloved Son, and his engagements with him on our 
    behalf. This is the source and well-head of those innumerable favors which 
    enrich us in all our wanderings through this life's wilderness.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 43. And he brought forth his people with joy, and 
    his chosen with gladness.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Up from the wilderness he led them, rejoicing over them 
    himself and making them rejoice too. They were his people, his chosen—and 
    hence in them he rejoiced, and upon them he showered his favors, that they 
    might rejoice in him as their God, and their portion.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 44. And gave them the lands of the heathen. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He drove out the Canaanites, and allotted the lands to 
    the tribes. They were called on to fight—but the Lord wrought so wonderfully 
    that the conquest was not effected by their bow or spear—the Lord <i>gave
    </i>them the land. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And they inherited the labor of the people.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They dwelt in houses which they had not built, and 
    gathered fruit from vines and olives which they had not planted. They were 
    not settled in a desert which needed to be reclaimed—but in a land fertile 
    to a proverb, and cultivated carefully by its inhabitants. Like Adam, they 
    were placed in a garden. This entrance into the goodly land was fitly 
    celebrated when the ark was being moved to Zion.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 45. That they might observe his statutes, and keep 
    his laws. </p></b>This was the practical design of it all. <i>The chosen nation 
    was to be the conservator of truth, the exemplar of morality, the pattern of 
    devotion</i>. Everything was so ordered as to place them in advantageous 
    circumstances for fulfilling this trust. Theirs was a high calling and a 
    glorious election. It involved great responsibilities—but it was in itself a 
    distinguished blessing, and one for which the nation was bound to give 
    thanks. Most justly then did the music close with the jubilant but solemn 
    shout of HALLELUJAH. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Praise the Lord.</p>

<p align="justify">If this history did not make Israel praise God, what 
    would?</p>
