<p align="center">PSALM 15 <br/>
 </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">SUBJECT, etc. This Psalm of David bears no dedicatory 
    title at all indicative of the occasion upon which it was written; but it is 
    exceedingly probable that, together with the twenty-fourth Psalm, to which 
    it bears a striking resemblance, <i>its composition was in some way 
    connected with the removal of the ark to the holy hill of Zion</i>. Who 
    should attend upon the ark was a matter of no small consequence, for because 
    unauthorized people had intruded into the office, David was unable on the 
    first occasion to complete his purpose of bringing the ark to Zion. On the 
    second attempt he is more careful, not only to allot the work of carrying 
    the ark to the divinely appointed Levites (1 Chronicles 15:2), but also to 
    leave it in charge of the man whose house the Lord had blessed, even Obed-edom, 
    who, with his many sons, ministered in the house of the Lord. (1 Chronicles 
    26:8, 12.) </p>
<p align="justify">Spiritually we have here a description of the man who is 
    a child at home in the Church of God on earth, and who will dwell in the 
    house of the Lord forever above. He is primarily Jesus, the perfect man, and 
    in him all who through grace are conformed to his image.</p>
<p align="justify">DIVISION. The first verse asks the question; <br/>
    the rest of the verses answer it. <br/>
    We will call the Psalm THE QUESTION AND ANSWER.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. LORD, who may abide in Your tabernacle? Who may 
    dwell in Your holy hill? </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">THE QUESTION. <b>Jehovah</b>. You high and holy One, who 
    shall be permitted to have fellowship with you? The heavens are not pure in 
    your sight, and you charge your angels with folly, who then of mortal mold 
    shall dwell with you, you dread consuming fire? A sense of the glory of the 
    Lord and of the holiness which befits his house, his service, and his 
    attendants, excites the humble mind to ask the solemn question before us. 
    Where angels bow with veiled faces—how shall man be able to worship at all?
    </p>
<p align="justify">The <i>unthinking many </i>imagine it to be a very easy 
    matter to approach the Most High, and when professedly engaged in his 
    worship they have no questionings of heart as to their fitness for it; but 
    truly humbled souls often shrink under a sense of utter unworthiness, and 
    would not dare to approach the throne of the God of holiness if it were not 
    for him, our Lord, our Advocate, who can abide in the heavenly temple, 
    because his righteousness endures forever. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"Who shall abide in your tabernacle?"</p></b> Who shall be 
    admitted to be one of the household of God, to sojourn under his roof and 
    enjoy communion with himself? 
<b>
<p align="justify">"Who shall dwell in your holy hill?"</p></b> Who shall be a 
    citizen of Zion, and an inhabitant of the heavenly Jerusalem? The question 
    is raised, because it is a question. All men have not this privilege, nay, 
    even among professors there are aliens from the commonwealth, who have no 
    secret fellowship with God. On the grounds of law no mere man can dwell with 
    God, for there is not one upon earth who answers to the just requirements 
    mentioned in the succeeding verses. The questions in the text are asked of 
    the Lord, as if none but the Infinite Mind could answer them so as to 
    satisfy the unquiet conscience. 
<p align="justify">We must know from the Lord of the tabernacle what are the 
    qualifications for his service, and when we have been taught of him, we 
    shall clearly see that <i>only our spotless Lord Jesus, and those who are 
    conformed unto his image, can ever stand with acceptance before the Majesty 
    on high</i>.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Impertinent curiosity</p></i> frequently desires to know who 
    and how many shall be saved. If those who thus ask the question, "Who shall 
    dwell in your holy hill?" would make it a soul-searching inquiry in 
    reference to themselves they would act much more wisely. 
<p align="justify">Members of the visible church, which is God's tabernacle 
    of worship, and hill of eminence, should diligently see to it, that they 
    have the preparation of heart which fits them to be inhabitants of the house 
    of God. <i>Without the wedding-dress of righteousness in Christ Jesus, we 
    have no right to sit at the banquet of communion</i>. Without uprightness of 
    walk we are not fit for the imperfect church on earth, and certainly we must 
    not hope to enter the perfect church above.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. He who walks uprightly, and works righteousness, 
    and speaks the truth in his heart. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">THE ANSWER. The Lord in answer to the question informs us 
    by his Holy Spirit of the character of the man who alone can dwell in his 
    holy hill. <i>In perfection this holiness is found only in the Man of 
    Sorrows, but in a measure it is wrought in all his people by the Holy 
    Spirit. </i>Faith and the graces of the Spirit are not mentioned, because 
    this is a description of outward character, and <i>where fruits are found 
    the root may not be seen, but it is surely there.</i> Observe the accepted 
    man's walk, work, and word:</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"He who WALKS uprightly,"</p></b> he keeps himself erect as 
    those do who traverse high ropes; if they lean on one side over they must 
    go, or as those who carry precious but fragile ware in baskets on their 
    heads, who lose all if they lose their perpendicular. 
<p align="justify">True believers do not cringe as flatterers, wriggle as 
    serpents, bend double as earth-grubbers, or crook on one side as those who 
    have sinister aims; they have the strong backbone of the vital principle of 
    grace within, and <i>being themselves upright, they are able to walk 
    uprightly</i>. Walking is of far more importance than talking. He only is 
    right, who is upright in walk, and downright in honesty. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"And WORKS righteousness." </p></b>His faith shows itself by 
    good works, and therefore is no dead faith. God's house is a hive for 
    workers, not a nest for drones. Those who rejoice that everything is done 
    for them by another, even the Lord Jesus, and therefore hate legality, are 
    the best doers in the world upon gospel principles. If we are not positively 
    serving the Lord, and doing his holy will to the best of our power, we may 
    seriously debate our interest in divine things, for <i>trees which bear no 
    fruit must be hewn down and cast into the fire. 
</i><b>
<p align="justify">"And SPEAKS the truth in his heart." </p></b>The fool in the 
    last psalm spoke falsely in his heart; observe both here and elsewhere in 
    the two psalms, the striking contrast. Saints not only desire to love and 
    speak truth with their <i>lips</i>, but they seek to be true <i>within</i>. 
    They will not lie even in the closet of their hearts, for God is there to 
    listen. They scorn double meanings, evasions, equivocations, white lies, 
    flatteries, and deceptions. 
<p align="justify">Though truths, like roses, have thorns about them—godly 
    men wear them in their bosoms. Our heart must be the sanctuary and refuge of 
    truth, should it be banished from all the world beside, and hunted from 
    among men; at all risk we must entertain the angel of truth, for truth is 
    God's daughter. </p>
<p align="justify">We must be careful that the heart is really fixed and 
    settled in principle, for tenderness of conscience toward truthfulness, like 
    the bloom on a peach—needs gentle handling, and once lost it were hard to 
    regain it. <i>Jesus was the mirror of sincerity and holiness.</i> Oh, to be 
    more and more fashioned after his similitude!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. </p></b>After the positive comes the negative.<b> 
    "He who does not backbite with his tongue." </b>There is a sinful way of 
    backbiting with the <i>heart </i>when we think too harshly of a neighbor; 
    but it is the <i>tongue </i>which does the mischief. <i>Some men bite more 
    with their tongues, than with their teeth. </i>The tongue is not steel, but 
    it cuts, and it's wounds are very hard to heal. Its worst wounds are not to 
    our face, but to our back when our head is turned. Under the law, a <i>night 
    hawk was </i>an unclean bird, and its human image is abominable everywhere. 
    All slanderers are the devil's bellows to blow up contention.
<b>
<p align="justify">"Nor does evil to his neighbor."</p></b> <i>He who bridles 
    his tongue will not give a licence to his hand. </i>Loving our neighbor as 
    ourselves will make us jealous of his good name, careful not to injure his 
    estate, or by ill example to corrupt his character. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"Nor spread rumors about their neighbors." </p></b>He is a 
    fool if not a knave who picks up stolen goods and harbors them. In slander 
    as well as robbery, the <i>receiver </i>is as bad as the thief. If there 
    were not gratified hearers of slanders, there would be an end of the trade 
    of spreading them. Trapp says, that <i>"the tale-bearer carries the devil in 
    his tongue, and the tale-hearer carries the devil in his ear!" 
</i>
<p align="justify">The original may be translated, "endures;" implying that 
    it is a sin to endure or tolerate tale-bearers. </p>
<p align="justify">"Show that man out!" we would say of a drunkard—yet it is 
    very questionable if his unmanly behavior will do us so much mischief as the
    <i>tale-bearers </i>insinuating story. </p>
<p align="justify">"Call for a policeman!" we say if we see a thief at his 
    business; ought we to feel no indignation when we hear a <i>gossip </i>at 
    her work? </p>
<p align="justify">"Mad dog! Mad dog!!" is a terrible hue and cry, but there 
    are few curs whose bite is so dangerous as a <i>busybody's </i>tongue. </p>
<p align="justify">"Fire! fire!!" is an alarming note, but the <i>
    tale-bearer's </i>tongue is set on fire by Hell, and those who indulge it 
    had better mend their manners, or they may find that there is fire in Hell 
    for unbridled tongues. </p>
<p align="justify">Our Lord spoke evil of no man, but breathed a prayer for 
    his foes; we must be like him, or we shall never be with him.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. "In whose eyes a vile person is despised; but he 
    honors those who fear the Lord." </p></b>We must be as honest in paying respect, 
    as in paying our bills. Honor to whom honor is due. To all godly men we owe 
    a debt of honor, and we have no right to hand over what is their due to vile 
    people who happen to be in high places. 
<p align="justify">When base men are in office, it is our duty to respect 
    the <i>office</i>; but we cannot so violate our consciences as to do 
    otherwise than despise the men. On the other hand, when true saints are in 
    poverty and distress, we must sympathize with their afflictions and honor 
    the men none the less. <i>We may honor the roughest cabinet for the sake of 
    the jewels, but we must not prize false gems because of their setting. </i>A 
    sinner in a gold chain and silken robes, is no more to be compared with a 
    saint in rags; than the light in a silver candlestick can be compared with 
    the sun behind a cloud. The proverb says, that <i>"ugly women, finely 
    dressed, are the uglier for it," </i>and so base men in high estate are the 
    more base because of it. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"He who swears to his own hurt, and changes not." </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Scriptural saints under the New Testament rule "swear not 
    at all," but their word is as good as an oath. Those men of God who think it 
    right to swear, are careful and prayerful lest they should even seem to 
    overshoot the mark. When engagements have been entered into which turn out 
    to be unprofitable, "the saints are men of honor still." </p>
<p align="justify">Our blessed Surety swore to his own hurt, but how 
    gloriously he stood to his suretyship! what a comfort to us that he changes 
    not, and what an example to us to be scrupulously and precisely exact in 
    fulfilling our covenants with others! The most far-seeing trader may enter 
    into engagements which turn out to be serious losses—but whatever else he 
    loses, if he keeps his honor, his losses will be bearable; if that be lost, 
    then all is lost.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. "He who puts not out his money to usury."</p></b> 
    Usury was and is hateful both to God and man. That a lender should share 
    with the borrower in gains made by his money is most fitting and proper; but 
    that the man of property should eat up the poor wretch who unfortunately 
    obtained a loan from him is abominable. Those who grind poor tradesmen, 
    needy widows, and such like, by charging them interest at intolerable rates, 
    will find that their gold, and their silver are cankered. The man who shall 
    ascend into the hill of the Lord, must shake off this sin as Paul shook the 
    viper into the fire. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"Nor takes a bribe against the innocent."</p></b> Bribery is 
    a sin both in the giver and the receiver. It was frequently practiced in 
    Eastern courts of justice; that form of it is now under our excellent judges 
    almost an unheard-of thing. Yet the sin survives in various forms, which the 
    reader needs not that we should mention; and under every shape it is 
    loathsome to the true man of God. He remembers that Jesus instead of taking 
    reward against the innocent, died for the guilty.
<b>
<p align="justify">"He who does these things shall never be moved."</p></b> No 
    storm shall tear him from his foundations, drag him from his anchorage, or 
    uproot him from his place. Like the Lord Jesus, whose dominion is 
    everlasting, the true Christian shall never lose his crown. He shall not 
    only be on Zion, but like Zion, be fixed and firm. He shall dwell in the 
    tabernacle of the Most High, and neither death nor judgment shall remove him 
    from his place of privilege and blessedness.
