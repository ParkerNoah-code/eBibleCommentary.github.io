        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.241)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, March 6th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>

          "Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called." -- Romans
          8:30
        </p>
        <p>
          THE GREAT BOOK OF GOD'S DECREES is fast closed against the curiosity
          of man. Vain man would be wise; he would break the seven seals
          thereof, and read the mysteries of eternity. But this cannot be; the
          time has not yet come when the book shall be opened, and even then the
          seals shall not be broken by mortal hand, but it shall be said, "The
          lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed to open the book and break
          the seven seals thereof."
        </p>
        <p>Eternal Father, who shall look</p>
        <p>Into thy secret will?</p>
        <p>None but the Lamb shall take the book,</p>
        <p>And open every seal.</p>
        <p>
          None but he shall ever unroll that sacred record and read it to the
          assembled world. How then am I to know whether I am predestinated by
          God unto eternal life or not? It is a question in which my eternal
          interests are involved; am I among that unhappy number who shall be
          left to live in sin and reap the due reward of their iniquity; or do I
          belong to that goodly company, who albeit that they have sinned shall
          nevertheless be washed in the blood of Christ, and shall in white
          robes walk the golden streets of paradise? Until this question be
          answered my heart cannot rest, for I am intensely anxious about it. My
          eternal destiny infinitely more concerns me than all the affairs of
          time. Tell me, oh, tell me, if ye know, seers and prophets, is my name
          recorded in that book of life? Am I one of those who are ordained unto
          eternal life, or am I to be left to follow my own lusts and passions,
          and to destroy my own soul? Oh! man, there is an answer to thy
          inquiry; the book cannot be opened, but God himself hath published
          many a page thereof. He hath not published the page whereon the actual
          names of the redeemed are written; but that page of the sacred decree
          whereon their character is recorded is published in his Word, and
          shall be proclaimed to thee this day. The sacred record of God's hand
          is this day published everywhere under heaven, and he that hath an ear
          let him hear what the Spirit saith unto him. O my hearer, by thy name
          I know thee not, and by thy name God's Word doth not declare thee, but
          by thy character thou mayest read thy name; and if thou hast been a
          partaker of the calling which is mentioned in the text, then mayest
          thou conclude beyond a doubt that thou art among the predestinated --
          "For whom he did predestinate, them he also called." And if thou be
          called, it follows as a natural inference thou art predestinated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, in considering this solemn subject, let me remark that there are
          two kinds of callings mentioned in the Word of God. The first is the
          general call, which is in the gospel sincerely given to everyone that
          heareth the word. The duty of the minister is to call souls to Christ,
          he is to make no distinction whatever -- "Go ye into all the world,
          and preach the gospel to every creature." The trumpet of the gospel
          sounds aloud to every man in our congregations -- "Ho, everyone that
          thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye,
          buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without
          price." "Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man"
          (Prov.8:4). This call is sincere on God's part; but man by nature is
          so opposed to God, that this call is never effectual, for man
          disregards it, turns his back upon it, and goes his way, caring for
          none of these things. But mark, although this call be rejected, man is
          without excuse in the rejection; the universal call has in it such
          authority, that the man who will not obey it shall be without excuse
          in the day of judgment. When thou art commanded to believe and repent,
          when thou art exhorted to flee from the wrath to come, the sin lies on
          thy own head if thou dost despise the exhortation, and reject the
          commandment. And this solemn text drops an awful warning: "How shall
          ye escape, if ye neglect so great salvation." But I repeat it, this
          universal call is rejected by man; it is a call, but it is not a
          attended with divine force and energy of the Holy Spirit in such a
          degree as to make it an unconquerable call, consequently men perish,
          even though they have the universal call of the gospel ringing in
          their ears. The bell of God's house rings every day, sinners hear it,
          but they put their fingers in their ears, and go their way, one to his
          farm, and another to his merchandise, and though they are bidden and
          are called to the wedding (Luke 14:16,17,18), yet they will not come,
          and by not coming they incur God's wrath, and he declareth of such, --
          "None of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper" (Luke
          14:24). The call of our text is of a different kind; it is not a
          universal call, it is a special, particular, personal, discriminating,
          efficacious, unconquerable, call. This call is sent to the
          predestinated, and to them only; they by grace hear the call, obey it,
          and receive it. These are they who can now say, "Draw us, and we will
          run after thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          In preaching of this call this morning, I shall divide my sermon into
          three brief parts. -- First, I shall give illustrations of the call;
          second, we shall come to examine whether we have been called; and then
          third, what delightful consequences flow therefrom. Illustration,
          examination, consolation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, for ILLUSTRATION. In illustrating the effectual call
          of grace, which is given to the predestinated ones, I must first use
          the picture of Lazarus. See you that stone rolled at the mouth of the
          sepulchre? Much need is there for the stone that it should be well
          secured, for within the sepulchre there is a putrid corpse. The sister
          of that corrupt body stands at the side of the tomb, and she says,
          "Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he hath been dead four days."
          This is the voice of reason and of nature. Martha is correct; but by
          Martha's side there stands a man who, despite all his lowliness, is
          very God of very God. "Roll ye away the stone," saith he, and it is
          done; and now, listen to him; he cries, "Lazarus, come forth!" that
          cry is directed to a mass of putridity, to a body that has been dead
          four days, and in which the worms have already held carnival; but,
          strange to say, from that tomb there comes a living man; that mass of
          corruption has been quickened into life, and out he comes, wrapped
          about with graveclothes, and having a napkin about his head. "Loose
          him and let him go," saith the Redeemer; and then he walks in all the
          liberty of life. The effectual call of grace is precisely similar; the
          sinner is dead in sin; he is not only in sin but dead in sin, without
          any power whatever to give to himself the life of grace. Nay, he is
          not only dead, but he is corrupt; his lusts, like the worms, have
          crept into him, a foul stench riseth up into the nostrils of justice,
          God abhorreth him, and justice crieth, "Bury the dead out of my sight,
          cast it into the fire, let it be consumed." Sovereign Mercy comes, and
          there lies this unconscious, lifeless mass of sin; Sovereign Grace
          cries, either by the minister, or else directly without any agency, by
          the Spirit of God, "come forth!" and that man lives. Does he
          contribute anything to his new life? Not he; his life is given solely
          by God. He was dead, absolutely dead, rotten in his sin; the life is
          given when the call comes, and, in obedience to the call, the sinner
          comes forth from the grave of his lust, begins to live a new life,
          even the life eternal, which Christ gives to his sheep.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well," cries one, "but what are the words which Christ uses when he
          calls a sinner from death?" Why the Lord may use any words. It was not
          long ago there came unto this hall, a man who was without God and
          without Christ, and the simple reading of the hymn --
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus lover of my soul,"</p>
        <p>
          was the means of his quickening. He said within himself, "Does Jesus
          love me? then I must love him," and he was quickened in that selfsame
          hour. The words which Jesus uses are various in different cases. I
          trust that even while I am speaking this morning, Christ may speak
          with me, and some word that may fall from my lips, unpremeditated and
          almost without design, shall be sent of God as a message of life unto
          some dead and corrupt heart here, and some man who has lived in sin
          hitherto, shall now live to righteousness, and live to Christ. That is
          the first illustration I will give you of what is meant by effectual
          calling. It finds the sinner dead, it gives him life, and he obeys the
          call of life and lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us consider a second phase of it. You will remember while the
          sinner is dead in sin, he is alive enough so far as any opposition to
          God may be concerned. He is powerless to obey, but he is mighty enough
          to resist the call of divine grace. I may illustrate it in the case of
          Saul of Tarsus: this proud Pharisee abhors the Lord Jesus Christ; he
          has seized upon every follower of Jesus who comes within his grasp; he
          has haled men and women to prison; with the avidity of a miser who
          hunts after gold, he has hunted after the precious life of Christ's
          disciple, and having exhausted his prey in Jerusalem, he seeks letters
          and goes off to Damascus upon the same bloody errand. Speak to him on
          the road, send out the apostle Peter to him, let Peter say, "Saul, why
          dost thou oppose Christ? The time shall come when thou shalt yet be
          his disciple." Paul would turn round and laugh him to scorn -- "Get
          thee gone thou fisherman, get thee gone -- I a disciple of that
          imposter Jesus of Nazareth! Look here, this is my confession of faith;
          here will I hale thy brothers and thy sisters to prison, and beat them
          in the synagogue and compel them to blaspheme and even hunt them to
          death, for my breath is threatening, and my heart is as fire against
          Christ." Such a scene did not occur, but had there been any
          remonstrance given by men you may easily conceive that such would have
          been Saul's answer. But Christ determined that he would call the man.
          Oh, what an enterprise! Stop HIM? Why he is going fast onward in his
          mad career. But lo, a light shines round about him and he falls to the
          ground, and he hears a voice crying, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
          me; it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks." Saul's eyes are
          filled with tears, and then again with scales of darkness, and he
          cries, "Who art thou?" and a voice calls, "I am Jesus, whom thou
          persecutest." It is not many minutes before he begins to feel his sin
          in having persecuted Jesus, nor many hours ere he receives the
          assurance of his pardon, and not many days ere he who persecuted
          Christ stands up to preach with vehemence and eloquence unparalleled,
          the very cause which he once trod beneath his feet. See what effectual
          calling can do. If God should choose this morning to call the
          hardest-hearted wretch within hearing of the gospel, he must obey. Let
          God call -- a man may resist, but he cannot resist effectually. Down
          thou shalt come, sinner, if God cries down; there is no standing when
          he would have thee fall. And mark, every man that is saved, is always
          saved by an overcoming call which he cannot withstand; he may resist
          it for a time, but he cannot resist so as to overcome it, he must give
          way, he must yield when God speaks. If he says, "Let there be light,"
          the impenetrable darkness gives way to light; if he says, "Let there
          be grace," unutterable sin gives way, and the hardest-hearted sinner
          melts before the fire of effectual calling.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have thus illustrated the call in two ways, by the state of the
          sinner in his sin, and by the omnipotence which overwhelms the
          resistance which he offers. And now another case. The effectual call
          may be illustrated in its sovereignty by the case of Zaccheus. Christ
          is entering into Jericho to preach. There is a publican living in it,
          who is a hard, griping, grasping, miserly extortioner. Jesus Christ is
          coming in to call some one, for it is written he must abide in some
          man's house. Would you believe it, that the man whom Christ intends to
          call is the worst man in Jericho -- the extortioner? He is a little
          short fellow, and he cannot see Christ, though he has a great
          curiosity to look at him; so he runs before the crowd and climbs up a
          sycamore tree, and thinking himself quite safe amid the thick foliage,
          he waits with eager expectation to see this wonderful man who had
          turned the world upside down. Little did he think that he was to turn
          him also. The Saviour walks along preaching and talking with the
          people until he comes under the sycamore tree, then lifting up his
          eyes, he cries -- "Zaccheus, make haste and come down, for today I
          must abide in thy house." The shot took effect, the bird fell, down
          came Zaccheus, invited the Saviour to his house, and proved that he
          was really called not by the voice merely but by grace itself, for he
          said, "Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give unto the poor, and if
          I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I restore unto
          him fourfold;" and Jesus said, "This day is salvation come unto thy
          house." Now why call Zaccheus? There were many better men in the city
          than he. Why call him? Simply because the call of God comes to
          unworthy sinners. There is nothing in man that can deserve this call;
          nothing in the best of men that can invite it; but God quickeneth whom
          he will, and when he sends that call, though it come to the vilest of
          the vile, down they come speedily and swiftly; they come down from the
          tree of their sin, and fall prostrate in penitence at the feet of
          Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now to illustrate this call in its effects, we remind you that
          Abraham is another remarkable instance of effectual calling. "Now the
          Lord had said unto Abraham, get thee out of thy country, and from thy
          kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show
          thee," and "by faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into place
          which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went
          out, not knowing whither he went." Ah! poor Abraham, as the world
          would have had it, what a trial his call cost him! He was happy enough
          in the bosom of his father's household, but idolatry crept into it,
          and when God called Abraham, he called him alone and blessed him out
          of Ur of the Chaldees, and said to him, "Go forth, Abraham!" and he
          went forth, not knowing whither he went. Now, when effectual calling
          comes into a house and singles out a man, that man will be compelled
          to go forth without the camp, bearing Christ's reproach. He must come
          out from his very dearest friends, from all his old acquaintances,
          from those friends with whom he used to drink, and swear, and take
          pleasure; he must go straight away from them all, to follow the Lamb
          whithersoever he goeth. What a trial to Abraham's faith, when he had
          to leave all that was so dear to him, and go he knew not whither! And
          yet God had a goodly land for him, and intended greatly to bless him.
          Man! if thou art called, if thou art called truly, there will be a
          going out, and a going out alone. Perhaps some of God's professed
          people will leave you; you will have to go without a solitary friend,
          -- maybe you will even be deserted by Sarah herself, and you may be a
          stranger in a strange land, a solitary wanderer, as all your fathers
          were. Ah! but if it be an effectual call, and if salvation shall be
          the result thereof, what matters it though thou dost go to heaven
          alone? Better to be a solitary pilgrim to bliss, than one of the
          thousands who throng the road to hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will have one more illustration. When effectual calling comes to a
          man, at first he may not know that it is effectual calling. You
          remember the case of Samuel; the Lord called Samuel, and he arose and
          went to Eli, and he said, "Here am I, for thou calledst me." Eli said,
          "I called not, lie down again. And he went and lay down." The second
          time the Lord called him, and said, "Samuel, Samuel," and he arose
          again, and went to Eli, and said, "Here am I, for thou didst call me,"
          and then it was that Eli, not Samuel, first of all perceived that the
          Lord had called the child. And when Samuel knew it was the Lord, he
          said, "Speak; for thy servant heareth." When the work of grace begins
          in the heart, the man is not always clear that it is God's work; he is
          impressed under the minister, and perhaps he is rather more occupied
          with the impression than with the agent of the impression; he says, "I
          know not how it is, but I have been called; Eli, the minister, has
          called me." And perhaps he goes to Eli to ask what he wants with him.
          "Surely," said he, "the minister knew me, and spoke something
          personally to me, because he knew my case." And he goes to Eli, and it
          is not till afterwards, perhaps, that he finds that Eli had nothing to
          do with the impression, but that the Lord had called him. I know this
          -- I believe God was at work with my heart for years before I knew
          anything about him. I knew there was a work; I knew I prayed, and
          cried, and groaned for mercy, but I did not know that was the Lord's
          work; I half thought it was my own. I did not know till afterwards,
          when I was led to know Christ as all my salvation, and all my desire,
          that the Lord had called the child, for this could not have been the
          result of nature, it must have been the effect of grace. I think I may
          say to those who are the beginners in the divine life, so long as your
          call is real, rest assured it is divine. If it is a call that will
          suit the remarks which I am about to give you in the second part of
          the discourse, even though you may have thought that God's hand is not
          in it, rest assured that it is, for nature could never produce
          effectual calling. If the call be effectual, and you are brought out
          and brought in -- brought out of sin and brought to Christ, brought
          out of death into life, and out of slavery into liberty, then, though
          thou canst not see God's hand in it, yet it is there.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I have thus illustrated effectual calling. And now as a matter of
          EXAMINATION let each man judge himself by certain characteristics of
          heavenly calling which I am about to mention. If in your Bible you
          turn to 2 Timothy 1:9, you will read these words -- "Who hath saved
          us, and called us with an holy calling." Now here is the first
          touchstone by which we may try our calling -- many are called but few
          are chosen, because there are many kinds of call, but the true call,
          and that only, answers to the description of the text. It is "an holy
          calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose
          and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began."
          This calling forbids all trust in our own doings and conducts us to
          Christ alone for salvation, but it afterwards purges us from dead
          works to serve the living and true God. If you are living in sin, you
          are not called; if you can still continue as you were before your
          pretended conversion, then it is no conversion at all; that man who is
          called in his drunkenness, will forsake his drunkenness; men may be
          called in the midst of sin, but they will not continue in it any
          longer. Saul was anointed to be king when he was seeking his father's
          asses; and many a man has been called when he has been seeking his own
          lust, but he will leave the asses, and leave the lust, when once he is
          called. Now, by this shall ye know whether ye be called of God or not.
          If ye continue in sin, if ye walk according to the course of this
          world, according to the spirit that worketh in the children of
          disobedience, then are ye still dead in your trespasses and your sins;
          but as he that hath called you is holy, so must ye be holy. Can ye
          say, "Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I desire to
          keep all thy commandments, and to walk blamelessly in thy sight. I
          know that my obedience cannot save me, but I long to obey. There is
          nothing that pains me so much as sin; I desire to be quit and rid of
          it; Lord help me to be holy"? Is that the panting of thy heart? Is
          that the tenor of thy life towards God, and towards his law? Then,
          beloved, I have reason to hope that thou hast been called of God, for
          it is a holy calling wherewith God doth call his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another text. In Philippians 3:13 and 14 you find these words.
          "Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto
          those which are before, I press towards the mark for the prize of the
          high calling of God in Christ Jesus." Is then your calling a high
          calling, has it lifted up your heart, and set it upon heavenly things?
          Has it lifted up your hopes, to hope no longer for things that are on
          earth, but for things that are above? Has it lifted up your tastes, so
          that they are no longer grovelling, but you choose the things that are
          of God? Has it lifted up the constant tenor of your life, so that you
          spend your life with God in prayer, in praise, and in thanksgiving,
          and can no longer be satisfied with the low and mean pursuits which
          you followed in the days of your ignorance? Recollect, if you are
          truly called it is a high calling, a calling from on high, and a
          calling that lifts up your heart, and raises it to the high things of
          God, eternity, heaven, and holiness. In Hebrews 3:1, you find this
          sentence. "Holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling." Here is
          another test. Heavenly calling means a call from heaven. Have you been
          called, not of man but of God? Can you now detect in your calling, the
          hand of God, and the voice of God? If man alone call thee, thou art
          uncalled. Is thy calling of God? and is it a call to heaven as well as
          from heaven? Can you heartily say that you can never rest satisfied
          till you
        </p>
        <p>-- "behold his face</p>
        <p>And never, never sin,</p>
        <p>But from the rivers of his grace,</p>
        <p>Drink endless pleasures in."</p>
        <p>
          Man, unless thou art a stranger here, and heaven is thy home, thou
          hast not been called with a heavenly calling, for those who have been
          so called, declare that they look for a city which hath foundations,
          whose builder and maker is God, and they themselves are strangers and
          pilgrims upon the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is another test. Let me remind you, that there is a passage in
          scripture which may tend very much to your edification, and help you
          in your examination. Those who are called, are men who before the
          calling, groaned in sin. What says Christ? -- "I came not to call the
          righteous, but sinners to repentance." Now, if I cannot say the first
          things because of diffidence, though they be true, yet can I say this,
          that I feel myself to be a sinner, that I loathe my sinnership, that I
          detest my iniquity, that I feel I deserve the wrath of God on account
          of my transgressions? If so, then I have a hope that I may be among
          the called host whom God has predestinated. He has called not the
          righteous but sinners to repentance. Self-righteous man, I can tell
          thee in the tick of a clock, whether thou hast any evidence of
          election. I tell thee -- No; Christ never called the righteous; and if
          he has not called thee, and if he never does call thee, thou art not
          elect, and thou and thy self-righteousness must be subject to the
          wrath of God, and cast away eternally. Only the sinner, the awakened
          sinner, can be at all assured that he has been called; and even he, as
          he gets older in grace, must look for those higher marks of the high
          heavenly and holy calling in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a further test, -- keeping close to scripture this morning, for
          when we are dealing with our own state before God there is nothing
          like giving the very words of scripture, -- we are told in the first
          epistle of Peter, the second chapter, and the ninth verse, that God
          hath called us out of darkness into marvelous light. Is that your
          call? Were you once darkness in regard to Christ; and has marvelous
          light manifested to you a marvelous Redeemer, marvelously strong to
          save? Say soul, canst thou honestly declare that thy past life was
          darkness and that thy present state is light in the Lord? "For ye were
          sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord; walk as children
          of the light." That man is not called who cannot look back upon
          darkness, ignorance, and sin, and who cannot now say, that he knows
          more than he did know, and enjoys at times the light of knowledge, and
          the comfortable light of God's countenance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet again. Another test of calling is to be found in Galatians, the
          fifth chapter, and the fifteenth verse. "Brethren, ye have been called
          into liberty." Let me ask myself again this question, Have the fetters
          of my sin been broken off, and am I God's free man? Have the manacles
          of justice been snapped, and am I delivered -- set free by him who is
          the great ransomer of spirits? The slave is not called. It is the free
          man that has been brought out of Egypt, who proves that he has been
          called of God and is precious to the heart of the Most High.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet once more, another precious means of test in the first of
          Corinthians, the first chapter, and the ninth verse. "He is faithful
          by whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ
          our Lord." Do I have fellowship with Christ? do I converse with him,
          commune with him? Do I suffer with him, suffer for him? Do I
          sympathize with him in his objects and aims? Do I love what he loves;
          do I hate what he hates? Can I bear his reproach; can I carry his
          cross; do I tread in his steps; do I serve his cause, and is it my
          grandest hope that I shall see his kingdom come, that I shall sit upon
          his throne, and reign with him? If so, then am I called with the
          effectual calling, which is the work of God's grace, and is the sure
          sign of my predestination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me say now, before I turn from this point, that it is possible for
          a man to know whether God has called him or not, and he may know it
          too beyond a doubt. He may know it as surely as if he read it with his
          own eyes; nay, he may know it more surely than that, for if I read a
          thing with my eyes, even my eyes may deceive me, the testimony of
          sense may be false, but the testimony of the Spirit must be true. We
          have the witness of the Spirit within, bearing witness with our
          spirits that we are born of God. There is such a thing on earth as an
          infallible assurance of our election. Let a man once get that, and it
          will anoint his head with fresh oil, it will clothe him with the white
          garment of praise, and put the song of the angel into his mouth.
          Happy, happy man! who is fully assured of his interest in the covenant
          of grace, in the blood of atonement, and in the glories of heaven!
          Such men there are here this very day. Let them "rejoice in the Lord
          alway, and again I say rejoice."
        </p>
        <p>
          What would some of you give if you could arrive at this assurance?
          Mark, if you anxiously desire to know, you may know. If your heart
          pants to read its title clear it shall do so ere long. No man ever
          desired Christ in his heart with a living and longing desire, who did
          not find him sooner or later. If thou hast a desire, God has given it
          thee. If thou pantest, and criest, and groanest after Christ, even
          this is his gift; bless him for it. Thank him for little grace, and
          ask him for great grace. He has given thee hope, ask for faith; and
          when he gives thee faith, ask for assurance; and when thou gettest
          assurance, ask for full assurance; and when thou hast obtained full
          assurance, ask for enjoyment; and when thou hast enjoyment, ask for
          glory itself; and he shall surely give it thee in his own appointed
          season.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I now come to finish up with CONSOLATION. Is there anything here
          that can console me? Oh, yes, rivers of consolation flow from my
          calling. For, first, if I am called then I am predestinated, there is
          no doubt about it. The great scheme of salvation is like those chains
          which we sometimes see at horse-ferries. There is a chain on this side
          of the river fixed into a staple, and the same chain is fixed into a
          staple at the other side, but the greater part of the chain is for the
          most part under water, and you cannot see it: you only see it as the
          boat moves on, and as the chain is drawn out of the water by the force
          that propels the boat. If today I am enabled to say I am called, then
          my boat is like the ferry-boat in the middle of the stream. I can see
          that part of the chain, which is named "calling," but blessed be God,
          that is joined to the side that is called "election," and I may be
          also quite clear that it is joined on to the other side, the glorious
          end of "glorification." If I be called I must have been elected, and I
          need not doubt that. God never tantalized a man by calling him by
          grace effectually, unless he had written that man's name in the Lamb's
          book of life. Oh, what a glorious doctrine is that of election, when a
          man can see himself to be elect. One of the reasons why many men kick
          against it is this, they are afraid it hurts them. I never knew a man
          yet, who had a reason to believe that he himself was chosen of God,
          who hated the doctrine of election. Men hate election just as thieves
          hate Chubb's patent locks; because they cannot get at the treasure
          themselves, they therefore hate the guard which protects it. Now
          election shuts up the precious treasury of God's covenant blessings
          for his children -- for penitents, for seeking sinners. These men will
          not repent, will not believe; they will not go God's way, and then
          they grumble and growl, and fret, and fume, because God has locked the
          treasure up against them. Let a man once believe that all the treasure
          within is his, and then the stouter the bolt, and the surer the lock,
          the better for him. Oh, how sweet it is to believe our names were on
          Jehovah's heart, and graven on Jesus' hands before the universe had a
          being! May not this electrify a man of joy, and make him dance for
          very mirth?
        </p>
        <p>Chosen of God ere time began.</p>
        <p>
          Come on, slanderers! rail on as pleases you. Come on thou world in
          arms! Cataracts of trouble descend if you will, and you, ye floods of
          affliction, roll if so it be ordained, for God has written my name in
          the book of life. Firm as this rock I stand, though nature reels and
          all things pass away. What consolation then to be called: for if I am
          called, then I am predestinated. Come let us at the sovereignty which
          has called us, and let us remember the words of the apostle, "For ye
          see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the
          flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: But God hath
          chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God
          hath chosen the weak things of the world, to confound the things which
          are mighty; And base things of the world, and things which are
          despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to
          nought things that are: that no flesh should glory in his presence.
          But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom,
          and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that, according
          as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          A second consolation is drawn from the grand truth, that if a man be
          called he will certainly be saved at last. To prove that, however, I
          will refer you to the express words of scripture: Romans 11:29 -- "The
          gifts and calling of God are without repentance." He never repents of
          what he gives, nor of what he calls. And indeed this is proved by the
          very chapter out of which we have taken our text. "Whom he did
          predestinate, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also
          justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified," everyone of
          them. Now, believer, thou mayest be very poor, and very sick, and very
          much unknown and despised, but sit thee down and review thy calling
          this morning, and the consequences that flow from it. As sure as thou
          art God's called child today, thy poverty shall soon be at an end, and
          thou shalt be rich to all the intents of bliss. Wait awhile; that
          weary head shall soon be girt with a crown. Stay awhile; that horny
          hand of labor shall soon grasp the palm branch. Wipe away that tear;
          God shall soon wipe away thy tears for ever. Take away that sigh --
          why sigh when the everlasting song is almost on thy lip? The portals
          of heaven stand wide open for thee. A few winged hours must fly; a few
          more billows must roll o'er thee, and thou wilt be safely landed on
          the golden shore. Do not say, "I shall be lost; I shall be cast away."
          Impossible.
        </p>
        <p>Whom once he loves he never leaves,</p>
        <p>But loves them to the end.</p>
        <p>
          If he hath called thee, nothing can divide thee from his love. The
          wolf of famine cannot gnaw the bond; the fire of persecution cannot
          burn the link, the hammer of hell cannot break the chain; old time
          cannot devour it with rust, nor eternity dissolve it, with all its
          ages. Oh! believe that thou art secure; that voice which called thee,
          shall call thee yet again from earth to heaven, from death's dark
          gloom to immortality's unuttered splendours; Rest assured, the heart
          that called thee, beats with infinite love towards thee, a love
          undying, that many waters cannot quench, and that floods cannot drown.
          Sit thee down; rest in peace; lift up thine eye of hope, and sing thy
          song with fond anticipation. Thou shall soon be with the glorified,
          where thy portion is; thou art only waiting here to be made meet, for
          the inheritance, and that done, the wings of angels shall waft thee
          far away, to the mount of peace, and joy, and blessedness, where
        </p>
        <p>Far from a world of grief and sin,</p>
        <p>With God eternally shut in,</p>
        <p>
          thou shall rest for ever and ever. Examine yourselves then whether you
          have been called. -- And may the love of Jesus be with you. Amen.
