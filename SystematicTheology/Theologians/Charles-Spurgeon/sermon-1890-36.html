        <p>Of extraneous judgments.</p>
        <p>
          Moreover, by a general ordinance, and without prejudice to the
          authority of the apostles in all things, we prohibit extraneous
          judgments, because it is not fit that he should be judged by
          strangers, who ought to have those of his own province and those
          elected by himself as his judges, unless an appeal has been made.
          Wherefore, if any one of the bishops is accused on precise charges, he
          ought to be heard by all the bishops who are in the province; for it
          is not right that an accused person should be heard elsewhere than in
          his own circuit. Again, if any one is of opinion that he has a judge
          adverse to him, he should claim the right of appeal; and an appellant
          ought to be injured by no kind of oppression or detention; but an
          appellant ought to have the liberty of righting his case, when
          wronged, by the remedy of appeal. There ought also to be liberty of
          appeal in criminal cases. And the right of appealing ought to be
          denied to no one whom judgment has destined for punishment.<br />
