          On the question of an accused bishop appealing to the seat of the
          apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is determined, moreover, that, in the case of an accused bishop
          appealing to the seat of the apostles, that should be held to be a
          settlement which is the decision of the pontiff of that same seat. On
          all occasions, however, in cases concerning priests, let this form be
          maintained, that no one be bound by a decision pronounced by another
          than his own proper judge. It is the duty also of all the faithful to
          be ready to help the oppressed and the miserable in their distress, in
          order that by the manifestation of another manner of recompense
          (vindictæ) they may be able to keep the recompense (vengeance) of God
          from themselves. For he offers (libat) things prosperous to the Lord
          who keeps off things adverse from the afflicted. Whence it is written,
          |A brother aiding a brother shall be exalted.| For the Church of God
          ought to be without spot or wrinkle, and therefore it ought not to be
          trodden and defiled by certain persons; for it is written, |My dove,
          my undefiled, is but one.| Hence, again, the Lord says to Moses,
          |There is a place with me (penes me), and thou shalt stand upon a
          rock.| What place is there that belongs not to the Lord, seeing that
          all things consist in Him by whom they were created? There is a place,
          however, with God -- to wit, the unity of the holy Church -- in which
          there is a standing upon a rock, while the perfection of the
          confession (confessionis soliditas) is held in lowliness. We admonish
          thee, our brother, and all our brethren who are rulers in the Church
          of Christ, which He hath purchased with His blood, to keep back, by
          whatever checks ye possess, all men from that abyss into which some
          brethren are slipping, in reviling the Lord's pastors, and persecuting
          them both by word and deed; and we counsel you not to suffer them to
          be wounded with the hook of passion: for it is written, |For the wrath
          of man worketh not the righteousness of God.| Hence it is said again,
          |Let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak, and slow to
          wrath.| Now I doubt not that with God's help you observe all these
          things; but as an occasion for counsel has arisen, I also secretly
          attach my word to your good desires and deeds, so that what you are
          doing of yourselves and independently of admonition you may do
          presently not by yourselves alone, now that the counsellor himself is
          added to you. Wherefore, brethren, it becomes you and all the faithful
          to love each other, and not to calumniate or accuse one another: for
          it is written, |Love thy neighbour, and be faithful unto him. But if
          thou bewrayest his secrets, thou shalt follow no more after him. For
          as a man who destroyeth his friend, so is he that loseth the love of
          his neighbour. And as one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so
          art thou who hast let thy neighbour go, and shalt not get him again.
          Follow after him no more, for he is far off. For he is as a roe
          escaped out of the snare, since his soul is wounded. Further thou wilt
          not be able to bind him up, and after reviling there may be
          reconcilement; but to bewray the secrets of a friend is the despair of
          an unhappy mind. He that winketh with the eye worketh evil, and every
          one will cast him off. When thou art present, he will speak sweetly,
          and will admire thy words. But at last he will writhe his mouth, and
          slander thy sayings. I have hated many things, but nothing like him;
          and the Lord will hate him. Whoso casteth a stone on high, it will
          fall upon his own head; and a deceitful stroke shall make wounds in
          the deceiver. Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein; and he that
          placeth a stone in his neighbour's way shall stumble thereon; and he
          that setteth a trap for another shall perish in it. He that worketh
          mischief, it shall fall upon him; and he shall not know whence it
          cometh on him. Mockery and reproach are from the proud; and vengeance,
          as a lion, shall lie in wait for them. They that rejoice at the fall
          of the righteous shall be taken in the snare; and anguish shall
          consume them before they die. Wrath and fury are both abominations,
          and the sinful man shall have them both.| |He that desireth to be
          avenged shall find vengeance from the Lord, and He will surely keep
          his sins in remembrance. Forgive thy neighbour the hurt that he hath
          done thee; so shall thy sins also be forgiven thee when thou prayest.
          One man beareth hatred against another, and doth he seek pardon from
          the Lord? He showeth no mercy to a man which is like himself, and doth
          he ask forgiveness of his own sins from the Most High? He, though he
          is but flesh, nourishes hatred; and does he implore mercy from God?
          Who will entreat for pardon of his sins? Remember thy end, and let
          enmity cease. For corruption and death impend on His commandments.
          Remember the fear of God, and bear no malice to thy neighbour.
          Remember the covenant of the Highest, and wink at the ignorance of thy
          neighbour. Abstain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sins. For
          a furious man will kindle strife, and a sinful man will disquiet
          friends, and will make debate among them that be at peace. For
          according to the trees of the wood, so will the fire burn; and
          according as a man's strength is, so will his wrath be; and according
          to his riches, his anger will rise. An hasty contention will kindle a
          fire; and an hasty fighting will shed blood; and a tale-bearing
          (testificans) tongue will cause death. If thou blow the spark, it
          shall burn like a fire; and if thou spit upon it, it shall be
          quenched; and both these come out of thy mouth. The whisperer and
          double-tongued is cursed; for he has destroyed many that were at
          peace. A backbiting (tertia) tongue hath disquieted many, and driven
          them from nation to nation. Strong cities of the rich hath it pulled
          down, and overthrown the houses of great men. It has destroyed the
          strength of peoples, and has scattered strong nations. A backbiting
          tongue hath cast out virtuous women (viratas, spirited), and deprived
          them of their labours. Whoso hearkeneth unto it shall never find rest,
          and shall never have a friend on whom he may repose. The stroke of the
          whip maketh marks; but the stroke of the tongue will break the bones.
          Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but not so many as have
          fallen by the tongue. Well is he that is defended from the evil
          tongue, and hath not passed through the venom thereof; who hath not
          drawn the yoke thereof, nor hath been bound in her bands. For the yoke
          thereof is a yoke of iron, and the bands thereof are bands of brass.
          The death thereof is an evil death, and the grave were better than it.
          Its endurance shall not abide, but it shall possess the ways of the
          unrighteous. In its flame it shall not burn the righteous. Such as
          forsake the Lord shall fall into it; and it shall burn in them, and
          not be quenched; and it shall be sent upon them as a lion, and devour
          them as a leopard. Hedge thine ears (sæpi aures) about with thorns,
          and refuse to listen to the evil tongue, and make a door for thy mouth
          and bars for thine ears. Smelt (confla) thy gold and thy silver, and
          make a balance for thy words, and a right bridle for thy mouth. And
          beware lest thou slide perchance in thy tongue, and fall in the sight
          of thine enemies that be in wait for thee, and thy fall be
          irremediable unto death.| Let all beware of these things, and |keep
          thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.| |Finally,
          dearly beloved, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might.
          Put on the armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the
          wiles of the devil; for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
          against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness
          of this world, against spiritual wickedness in heavenly places
          (coelestibus). Wherefore take unto you the armour of God, that ye may
          be able to withstand in the evil day, and to stand perfect in all
          (omnibus perfecti). Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with
          truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness, and your feet
          shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace; in all (in omnibus)
          taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
          the fiery darts of the wicked one. And take the helmet of salvation,
          and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.| It is our
          wish, brother, that those things which we have written to you should
          be made known generally to all, in order that things which touch the
          others should be made known to all. May Almighty God protect you,
          brother, and all our brethren everywhere situate, even to the end, --
          even He who has thought good to redeem the whole world, our Lord Jesus
          Christ, who is blessed for ever. Amen. -- Given on the 16th day of
          October, in the consulship of the most illustrious Africanus and
          Decius.
