        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.41-42)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, September 2, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren
          beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to
          salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the
          truth: Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the
          glory of our Lord Jesus Christ." -- 2 Thessalonians 2:13-14.
        </p>
        <p>
          IF there were no other text in the sacred Word except this one, I
          think we should all be bound to receive and acknowledge the
          truthfulness of the great and glorious doctrine of God's ancient
          choice of his family. But there seems to be an inveterate prejudice in
          the human mind against this doctrine; and although most other
          doctrines will be received by professing Christians, some with
          caution, others with pleasure, yet this one seems to be most
          frequently disregarded and discarded. In many of our pulpits it would
          be reckoned a high sin and treason to preach a sermon upon election,
          because they could not make it what they call a "practical" discourse.
          I believe they have erred from the truth therein. Whatever God has
          revealed, he has revealed for a purpose. There is nothing in Scripture
          which may not, under the influence of God's Spirit, be turned into a
          practical discourse: for "all Scripture is given by inspiration of
          God, and is profitable" for some purpose of spiritual usefulness. It
          is true, it may not be turned into a free-will discourse -- that we
          know right well -- but it can be turned into a practical free-grace
          discourse: and free-grace practice is the best practice, when the true
          doctrines of God's immutable love are brought to bear upon the hearts
          of saints and sinners. Now, I trust this morning some of you who are
          startled at the very sound of this word, will say, "I will give it a
          fair hearing; I will lay aside my prejudices; I will just hear what
          this man has to say." Do not shut your ears and say at once, "It is
          high doctrine." Who has authorized you to call it high or low? Why
          should you oppose yourself to God's doctrine? Remember what became of
          the children who found fault with God's prophet, and exclaimed, "Go
          up, thou bald-head; go up, thou bald-head." Say nothing against God's
          doctrines, lest haply some evil beast should come out of the forest
          and devour you also. There are other woes beside the open judgment of
          heaven -- take heed that these fall not on your head. Lay aside your
          prejudices: listen calmly, listen dispassionately: hear what Scripture
          says; and when you receive the truth, if God should be pleased to
          reveal and manifest it to your souls, do not be ashamed to confess it.
          To confess you were wrong yesterday, is only to acknowledge that you
          are a little wiser to-day; and instead of being a reflection on
          yourself, it is an honour to your judgment, and shows that you are
          improving in the knowledge of the truth. Do not be ashamed to learn,
          and to cast aside your old doctrines and views, but to take up that
          which you may more plainly see to be in the Word of God. But if you do
          not see it to be here in the Bible, whatever I may say, or whatever
          authorities I may plead, I beseech you, as you love your souls, reject
          it; and if from this pulpit you ever hear things contrary to this
          Sacred Word, remember that the Bible must be the first, and God's
          minister must lie underneath it. We must not stand on the Bible to
          preach, but we must preach with the Bible above our heads. After all
          we have preached, we are well aware that the mountain of truth is
          higher than our eyes can discern; clouds and darkness are round about
          its summit, and we cannot discern its topmost pinnacle; yet we will
          try to preach it as well as we can. But since we are mortal, and
          liable to err, exercise your judgment; "Try the spirits whether they
          are of God"; and if on mature reflection on your bended knees, you are
          led to disregard election -- a thing which I consider to be utterly
          impossible -- then forsake it; do not hear it preached, but believe
          and confess whatever you see to be God's Word. I can say no more than
          that by way of exordium.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, first, I shall speak a little concerning the truthfulness of this
          doctrine: "God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation."
          Secondly, I shall try to prove that this election is absolute: "He
          hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation," not for
          sanctification, but "through sanctification of the Spirit and belief
          of the truth." Thirdly, this election is eternal, because the text
          says, "God hath from the beginning chosen you." Fourthly, it is
          personal: "He hath chosen you." Then we will look at the effects of
          the doctrine -- see what it does; and lastly, as God may enable us, we
          will try and look at its tendencies, and see whether it is indeed a
          terrible and licentious doctrine. We will take the flower, and like
          true bees, see whether there be any honey whatever in it; whether any
          good can come of it, or whether it is an unmixed, undiluted evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, I must try and prove that the doctrine is TRUE. And let me
          begin with an argumentum ad hominem; I will speak to you according to
          your different positions and stations. There are some of you who
          belong to the Church of England, and I am happy to see so many of you
          here. Though now and then I certainly say some very hard things about
          Church and State, yet I love the old Church, for she has in her
          communion many godly ministers and eminent saints. Now, I know you are
          great believers in what the Articles declare to be sound doctrine. I
          will give you a specimen of what they utter concerning election, so
          that if you believe them, you cannot avoid receiving election. I will
          read a portion of the 17th Article upon Predestination and Election:
          --
        </p>
        <p>
          "Predestination to life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby
          (before the foundations of the world were laid) he hast continually
          decreed by his counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and
          damnation those whom he hath chosen in Christ out of mankind, and to
          bring them by Christ to everlasting salvation, as vessels made to
          honour. Wherefore they which be endued with so excellent a benefit of
          God be called according to God's purpose by his Spirit working in due
          season: they through grace obey the calling: they be justified freely:
          they be made sons of God by adoption: they be made like the image of
          his only-begotten Son Jesus Christ: they walk religiously in good
          works, and at length, by God's mercy, they attain to everlasting
          felicity."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I think any churchman, if he be a sincere and honest believer in
          Mother Church, must be a thorough believer in election. True, if he
          turns to certain other portions of the Prayer Book, he will find
          things contrary to the doctrines of free-grace, and altogether apart
          from scriptural teaching; but if he looks at the Articles, he must see
          that God hath chosen his people unto eternal life. I am not so
          desperately enamoured, however, of that book as you may be; and I have
          only used this Article to show you that if you belong to the
          Establishment of England you should at least offer no objection to
          this doctrine of predestination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another human authority whereby I would confirm the doctrine of
          election, is, the old Waldensian creed. If you read the creed of the
          old Waldenses, emanating from them in the midst of the burning heat of
          persecution, you will see that these renowned professors and
          confessors of the Christian faith did most firmly receive and embrace
          this doctrine, as being a portion of the truth of God. I have copied
          from an old book one of the Articles of their faith: --
        </p>
        <p>
          "That God saves from corruption and damnation those whom he has chosen
          from the foundations of the world, not for any disposition, faith, or
          holiness that he foresaw in them, but of his mere mercy in Christ
          Jesus his Son, passing by all the rest according to the
          irreprehensible reason of his own free-will and justice."
        </p>
        <p>
          It is no novelty, then, that I am preaching; no new doctrine. I love
          to proclaim these strong old doctrines, which are called by nickname
          Calvinism, but which are surely and verily the revealed truth of God
          as it is in Christ Jesus. By this truth I make a pilgrimage into the
          past, and as I go, I see father after father, confessor after
          confessor, martyr after martyr, standing up to shake hands with me.
          Were I a Pelagian, or a believer in the doctrine of free-will, I
          should have to walk for centuries all alone. Here and there a heretic
          of no very honourable character might rise up and call me brother. But
          taking these things to be the standard of my faith, I see the land of
          the ancients peopled with my brethren -- I behold multitudes who
          confess the same as I do, and acknowledge that this is the religion of
          God's own church.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also give you an extract from the old Baptist Confession. We are
          Baptists in this congregation -- the greater part of us at any rate --
          and we like to see what our own forefathers wrote. Some two hundred
          years ago the Baptists assembled together, and published their
          articles of faith, to put an end to certain reports against their
          orthodoxy which had gone forth to the world. I turn to this old book
          -- which I have just 3rd Article: "By the decree of God, for the
          manifestation of his glory, some men and angels are predestinated, or
          foreordained to eternal life through Jesus Christ to the praise of his
          glorious grace; others being left to act in their sin to their just
          condemnation, to the praise of his glorious justice. These angels and
          men thus predestinated and foreordained, are particularly and
          unchangeably designed, and their number so certain and definite, that
          it cannot be either increased or diminished. Those of mankind that are
          predestinated to life, God, before the foundation of the world was
          laid, according to his eternal and immutable purpose, and the secret
          counsel and good pleasure of his will, hath chosen in Christ unto
          everlasting glory out of his mere free grace and love, without any
          other thing in the creature as a condition or cause moving him
          thereunto."
        </p>
        <p>
          As for these human authorities, I care not one rush for all three of
          them. I care not what they say, pro or con, as to this doctrine. I
          have only used them as a kind of confirmation to your faith, to show
          you that whilst I may be railed upon as a heretic and as a
          hyper-Calvinist, after all I am backed up by antiquity. All the past
          stands by me. I do not care for the present. Give me the past and I
          will hope for the future. Let the present rise up in my teeth, I will
          not care. What though a host of the churches of London may have
          forsaken the great cardinal doctrines of God, it matters not. If a
          handful of us stand alone in an unflinching maintenance of the
          sovereignty of our God, if we are beset by enemies, ay, and even by
          our own brethren, who ought to be our friends and helpers, it matters
          not, if we can but count upon the past; the noble army of martyrs, the
          glorious host of confessors, are our friends; the witnesses of truth
          stand by us. With these for us, we will not say that we stand alone,
          but we may exclaim, "Lo, God hath reserved unto himself seven thousand
          that have not bowed the knee unto Baal." But the best of all is, God
          is with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The great truth is always the Bible, and the Bible alone. My hearers,
          you do not believe in any other book than the Bible, do you? If I
          could prove this from all the books in Christendom; if I could fetch
          back the Alexandrian library, and prove it thence, you would not
          believe it any more; but you surely will believe what is in God's
          Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have selected a few texts to read to you. I love to give you a whole
          volley of texts when I am afraid you will distrust a truth, so that
          you may be too astonished to doubt, if you do not in reality believe.
          Just let me run through a catalogue of passages where the people of
          God are called elect. Of course if the people are called elect, there
          must be election. If Jesus Christ and his apostles were accustomed to
          style believers by the title of elect, we must certainly believe that
          they were so, otherwise the term does not mean anything. Jesus Christ
          says, "Except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should
          be saved; but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath
          shortened the days." "False Christs and false prophets shall rise, and
          shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the
          elect." "Then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his
          elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the
          uttermost part of heaven" (Mark 13:20,22,27). "Shall not God avenge
          his own elect, who cry day and night unto him, though he bear long
          with them?" (Luke 18:7). Together with many other passages which might
          be selected, wherein either the word "elect," or "chosen," or
          "foreordained," or "appointed" is mentioned; or the phrase "my sheep"
          or some similar designation, showing that Christ's people are
          distinguished from the rest of mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you have concordances, and I will not trouble you with texts.
          Throughout the epistles, the saints are constantly called "the elect."
          In the Colossians we find Paul saying, "Put on therefore, as the elect
          of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies." When he writes to Titus,
          he calls himself, "Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus
          Christ, according to the faith of God's elect." Peter says, "Elect
          according to the foreknowledge of God the Father." Then if you turn to
          John, you will find he is very fond of the word. He says, "The elder
          to the elect lady"; and he speaks of our "elect sister." And we know
          where it is written, "The church that is at Babylon, elected together
          with you." They were not ashamed of the word in those days; they were
          not afraid to talk about it. Now-a-days the word has been dressed up
          with diversities of meaning, and persons have mutilated and marred the
          doctrine, so that they have made it a very doctrine of devils, I do
          confess; and many who call themselves believers, have gone to rank
          Antinomianism. But notwithstanding this, why should I be ashamed of
          it, if men do wrest it? We love God's truth on the rack, as well as
          when it is walking upright. If there were a martyr whom we loved
          before he came on the rack, we should love him more still when he was
          stretched there. When God's truth is stretched on the rack, we do not
          call it falsehood. We love not to see it racked, but we love it even
          when racked, because we can discern what its proper proportions ought
          to have been if it had not been racked and tortured by the cruelty and
          inventions of men. If you will read many of the epistles of the
          ancient fathers, you will find them always writing to the people of
          God as the "elect." Indeed the common conversational term used among
          many of the churches by the primitive Christians to one another was
          that of the "elect." They would often use the term to one another,
          showing that it was generally believed that all God's people were
          manifestly "elect."
        </p>
        <p>
          But now for the verses that will positively prove the doctrine. Open
          your Bibles and turn to John 15:16, and there you will see that Jesus
          Christ has chosen his people, for he says, "Ye have not chosen me, but
          I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth
          fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask
          of the Father in my name, he may give it you." Then in the 19th verse,
          "If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye
          are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world,
          therefore the world hateth you." Then in the 17th chapter and the 8th
          and 9th verses, "For I have given unto them the words which thou
          gavest me; and they have received them and have known surely that I
          came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me. I
          pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast
          given me; for they are thine." Turn to Acts 13:48: "And when the
          Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the
          Lord; and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed." They may
          try to split that passage into hairs if they like; but it says,
          "ordained to eternal life" in the original as plainly as it possibly
          can; and we do not care about all the different commentaries
          thereupon. You scarcely need to be reminded of Romans 8, because I
          trust you are all well acquainted with that chapter and understand it
          by this time. In the 29th and following verses, it says, "For whom he
          did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of
          his Son, that he might be the first-born among many brethren.
          Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he
          called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also
          glorified. What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us,
          who can be against us? He that spared not his own Son, but delivered
          him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all
          things? Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?" It would
          also be unnecessary to repeat the whole of the 9th chapter of Romans.
          As long as that remains in the Bible, no man shall be able to prove
          Arminianism; so long as that is written there, not the most violent
          contortions of the passage will ever be able to exterminate the
          doctrine of election from the Scriptures. Let us read such verses as
          these -- "For the children being not yet born, neither having done any
          good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might
          stand, not of works, but of him that calleth; it was said unto her,
          The elder shall serve the younger." Then read the 22nd verse, "What if
          God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured
          with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction.
          And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of
          mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory." Then go on to Romans
          11:7 -- "What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh
          for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded." In
          the 5th verse of the same chapter, we read -- "Even so then at this
          present time also there is a remnant according to the election of
          grace." You, no doubt, all recollect the passage in I Corinthians
          1:26-29: "For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise
          men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: but
          God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise;
          and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the
          things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things
          which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to
          bring to nought things which are: that no flesh should glory in his
          presence." Again, remember the passage in I Thessalonians 5:9 -- "God
          hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord
          Jesus Christ." And then you have my text, which methinks would be
          quite enough. But, if you need any more, you can find them at your
          leisure, if we have not quite removed your suspicions as to the
          doctrine not being true.
        </p>
        <p>
          Methinks, my friends, that this overwhelming mass of Scripture
          testimony must stagger those who dare to laugh at this doctrine. What
          shall we say of those who have so often despised it, and denied its
          divinity; who have railed at its justice, and dared to defy God and
          call him an Almighty tyrant, when they have heard of his having
          elected so many to eternal life? Canst thou, O rejector! cast it out
          of the Bible? Canst thou take the penknife of Jehudi and cut it out of
          the Word of God? Wouldst thou be like the woman at the feet of
          Solomon, and have the child rent in halves, that thou mightest have
          thy half? Is it not here in Scripture? And is it not thy duty to bow
          before it, and meekly acknowledge what thou understandest not -- to
          receive it as the truth even though thou couldst not understand its
          meaning? I will not attempt to prove the justice of God in having thus
          elected some and left others. It is not for me to vindicate my Master.
          He will speak for himself, and he does so: -- "Nay, but, O man, who
          art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him
          that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power
          over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and
          another unto dishonour?" Who is he that shall say unto his father,
          "What hast thou begotten?" or unto his mother, "What hast thou brought
          forth?" "I am the Lord -- I form the light and create darkness I, the
          Lord, do all these things." Who art thou that repliest against God?
          Tremble and kiss his rod; bow down and submit to his sceptre; impugn
          not his justice, and arraign not his acts before thy bar, O man!
        </p>
        <p>
          But there are some who say, "It is hard for God to choose some and
          leave others." Now, I will ask you one question. Is there any of you
          here this morning who wishes to be holy, who wishes to be regenerate,
          to leave off sin and walk in holiness? "Yes, there is," says some one,
          "I do." Then God has elected you. But another says, "No; I don't want
          to be holy; I don't want to give up my lusts and my vices." Why should
          you grumble, then, that God has not elected you to it? For if you were
          elected you would not like it, according to your own confession. If
          God this morning had chosen you to holiness, you say you would not
          care for it. Do you not acknowledge that you prefer drunkenness to
          sobriety, dishonesty to honesty? You love this world's pleasures
          better than religion; then why should you grumble that God has not
          chosen you to religion? If you love religion, he has chosen you to it.
          If you desire it, he has chosen you to it. If you do not, what right
          have you to say that God ought to have given you what you do not wish
          for? Supposing I had in my hand something which you do not value, and
          I said I shall give it to such-and-such a person, you would have no
          right to grumble that I did not give to you. You could not be so
          foolish as to grumble that the other has got what you do not care
          about. According to your own confession, many of you do not want
          religion, do not want a new heart and a right spirit, do not want the
          forgiveness of sins, do not want sanctification; you do not want to be
          elected to these things: then why should you grumble? You count these
          things but as husks, and why should you complain of God who has given
          them to those whom he has chosen? If you believe them to be good and
          desire them, they are there for thee. God gives liberally to all those
          who desire; and first of all, he makes them desire, otherwise they
          never would. If you love these things, he has elected you to them, and
          you may have them; but if you do not, who are you that you should find
          fault with God, when it is your own desperate will that keeps you from
          loving these things -- your own simple self that makes you hate them?
          Suppose a man in the street should say, "What a shame it is I cannot
          have a seat in the chapel to hear what this man has to say." And
          suppose he says, "I hate the preacher; I can't bear his doctrine; but
          still it's a shame I have not a seat." Would you expect a man to say
          so? No: you would at once say, "That man does not care for it. Why
          should he trouble himself about other people having what they value
          and he despises?" You do not like holiness, you do not like
          righteousness; if God has elected me to these things, has he hurt you
          by it? "Ah! but," say some, "I thought it meant that God elected some
          to heaven and some to hell." That is a very different matter from the
          gospel doctrine. He has elected men to holiness and to righteousness
          and through that to heaven. You must not say that he has elected them
          simply to heaven, and others only to hell. He has elected you to
          holiness, if you love holiness. If any of you love to be saved by
          Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ elected you to be saved. If any of you
          desire to have salvation, you are elected to have it, if you desire it
          sincerely and earnestly. But, if you don't desire it, why on earth
          should you be so preposterously foolish as to grumble because God
          gives that which you do not like to other people?
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Thus I have tried to say something with regard to the truth of the
          doctrine of election. And now, briefly, let me say that election is
          ABSOLUTE: that is, it does not depend upon what we are. The text says,
          "God hath from the beginning chosen us unto salvation"; but our
          opponents say that God chooses people because they are good, that he
          chooses them on account of sundry works which they have done. Now, we
          ask in reply to this, what works are those on account of which God
          elects his people? Are they what we commonly call "works of law," --
          works of obedience which the creature can render? If so, we reply to
          you -- If men cannot be justified by the works of the law, it seems to
          us pretty clear that they cannot be elected by the works of the law:
          if they cannot be justified by their good deeds, they cannot be saved
          by them. Then the decree of election could not have been formed upon
          good works. "But," say others, "God elected them on the foresight of
          their faith." Now, God gives faith, therefore he could not have
          elected them on account of faith, which he foresaw. There shall be
          twenty beggars in the street, and I determine to give one of them a
          shilling; but will any one say that I determined to give that one a
          shilling, that I elected him to have the shilling, because I foresaw
          that he would have it? That would be talking nonsense. In like manner
          to say that God elected men because he foresaw they would have faith,
          which is salvation in the germ, would be too absurd for us to listen
          to for a moment. Faith is the gift of God. Every virtue comes from
          him. Therefore it cannot have caused him to elect men, because it is
          his gift. Election, we are sure, is absolute, and altogether apart
          from the virtues which the saints have afterwards. What though a saint
          should be as holy and devout as Paul; what though he should be as bold
          as Peter, or as loving as John, yet he would claim nothing from his
          Maker. I never knew a saint yet of any denomination, who thought that
          God saved him because he foresaw that he would have these virtues and
          merits. Now, my brethren, the best jewels that the saint ever wears,
          if they be jewels of his own fashioning, are not of the first water.
          There is something of earth mixed with them. The highest grace we ever
          possess has something of earthliness about it. We feel this when we
          are most refined, when we are most sanctified, and our language must
          always be --
        </p>
        <p>"I the chief of sinners am;</p>
        <p>Jesus died for me."</p>
        <p>
          Our only hope, our only plea, still hangs on grace as exhibited in the
          person of Jesus Christ. And I am sure we must utterly reject and
          disregard all thought that our graces, which are gifts of our Lord,
          which are his right-hand planting, could have ever caused his love.
          And we ever must sing --
        </p>
        <p>"What was there in us that could merit esteem</p>
        <p>Or give the Creator delight?</p>
        <p>'Twas even so Father we ever must sing,</p>
        <p>Because it seemed good in thy sight."</p>
        <p>
          "He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy": he saves because he
          will save. And if you ask me why he saves me, I can only say, because
          he would do it. Was there anything in me that should recommend me to
          God? No; I lay aside everything, I had nothing to recommend me. When
          God saved me I was the most abject, lost, and ruined of the race. I
          lay before him as an infant in my blood. Verily, I had no power to
          help myself. O how wretched did I feel and know myself to be! If you
          had something to recommend you to God, I never had. I will be content
          to be saved by grace, unalloyed, pure grace. I can boast of no merits.
          If you can do so, I cannot. I must sing --
        </p>
        <p>"Free grace alone from the first to the last,</p>
        <p>Hath won my affection and held my soul fast."</p>
        <p>
          III. Then, thirdly, this election is ETERNAL. "God hath from the
          beginning chosen you unto eternal life." Can any man tell me when the
          beginning was? Years ago we thought the beginning of this world was
          when Adam came upon it; but we have discovered that thousands of years
          before that God was preparing chaotic matter to make it a fit abode
          for man, putting races of creatures upon it, who might die and leave
          behind the marks of his handiwork and marvellous skill, before he
          tried his hand on man. But that was not the beginning, for revelation
          points us to a period long ere this world was fashioned, to the days
          when the morning stars were begotten; when, like drops of dew, from
          the fingers of the morning, stars and constellations fell trickling
          from the hand of God; when, by his own lips, he launched forth
          ponderous orbs; when with his own hand he sent comets, like
          thunderbolts, wandering through the sky, to find one day their proper
          sphere. We go back to years gone by, when worlds were made and systems
          fashioned, but we have not even approached the beginning yet. Until we
          go to the time when all the universe slept in the mind of God as yet
          unborn, until we enter the eternity where God the Creator lived alone,
          everything sleeping within him, all creation resting in his mighty
          gigantic thought, we have not guessed the beginning. We may go back,
          back, back, ages upon ages. We may go back, if we might use such
          strange words, whole eternities, and yet never arrive at the
          beginning. Our wing might be tired, our imagination would die away;
          could it outstrip the lightnings flashing in majesty, power, and
          rapidity, it would soon weary itself ere it could get to the
          beginning. But God from the beginning chose his people; when the
          unnavigated ether was yet unfanned by the wing of a single angel, when
          space was shoreless, or else unborn when universal silence reigned,
          and not a voice or whisper shocked the solemnity of silence; when
          there was no being and no motion, no time, and nought but God himself,
          alone in his eternity; when without the song of an angel, without the
          attendance of even the cherubim, long ere the living creatures were
          born, or the wheels of the chariot of Jehovah were fashioned, even
          then, "in the beginning was the Word," and in the beginning God's
          people were one with the Word, and "in the beginning he chose them
          into eternal life." Our election then is eternal. I will not stop to
          prove it, I only just run over these thoughts for the benefit of young
          beginners, that they may understand what we mean by eternal, absolute
          election.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And, next, the election is PERSONAL. Here again, our opponents
          have tried to overthrow election by telling us that it is an election
          of nations, and not of people. But here the Apostle says, "God hath
          from the beginning chosen you." It is the most miserable shift on
          earth to make out that God hath not chosen persons but nations,
          because the very same objection that lies against the choice of
          persons, lies against the choice of a nation. If it were not just to
          choose a person, it would be far more unjust to choose a nation, since
          nations are but the union of multitudes of persons, and to choose a
          nation seems to be a more gigantic crime -- if election be a crime --
          than to choose one person. Surely to choose ten thousand would be
          reckoned to be worse than choosing one; to distinguish a whole nation
          from the rest of mankind, does seem to be a greater extravaganza in
          the acts of divine sovereignty than the election of one poor mortal
          and leaving out another. But what are nations but men? What are whole
          peoples but combinations of different units? A nation is made up of
          that individual, and that, and that. And if you tell me that God chose
          the Jews, I say then, he chose that Jew, and that Jew, and that Jew.
          And if you say he chooses Britain, then I say he chooses that British
          man, and that British man, and that British man. So that is the same
          thing after all. Election then is personal: it must be so. Every one
          who reads this text, and others like it, will see that Scripture
          continually speaks of God's people one by one and speaks of them as
          having been the special subjects of election.
        </p>
        <p>"Sons we are through God's election,</p>
        <p>Who in Jesus Christ believe;</p>
        <p>By eternal destination</p>
        <p>Sovereign grace we here receive."</p>
        <p>We know it is personal election.</p>
        <p>
          V. The other thought is -- for my time flies too swiftly to enable me
          to dwell at length upon these points -- that election produces GOOD
          RESULTS. "He hath from the beginning chosen you unto sanctification of
          the spirit, and belief of the truth." How many men mistake the
          doctrine of election altogether! and how my soul burns and boils at
          the recollection of the terrible evils that have accrued from the
          spoiling and the wresting of that glorious portion of God's glorious
          truth! How many are there who have said to themselves, "I am elect,"
          and have sat down in sloth, and worse than that! They have said, "I am
          the elect of God," and with both hands they have done wickedness. They
          have swiftly run to every unclean thing, because they have said, "I am
          the chosen child of God, irrespective of my works, therefore I may
          live as I list, and do what I like." Oh, beloved! let me solemnly warn
          every one of you not to carry the truth too far; or, rather not to
          turn the truth into error, for we cannot carry it too far. We may
          overstep the truth; we can make that which was meant to be sweet for
          our comfort, a terrible mixture for our destruction. I tell you there
          have been thousands of men who have been ruined by misunderstanding
          election; who have said, "God has elected me to heaven, and to eternal
          life"; but they have forgotten that it is written, God has elected
          them "through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth."
          This is God's election -- election to sanctification and to faith. God
          chooses his people to be holy, and to be believers. How many of you
          here then are believers? How many of my congregation can put their
          hands upon their hearts and say, "I trust in God that I am
          sanctified"? Is there one of you who says, "I am elect"? -- I remind
          that you swore last week. One of you says, "I trust I am elect" -- but
          I jog your memory about some vicious act that you committed during the
          last six days. Another of you says, "I am elect" -- but I would look
          you in the face and say, "Elect! thou art a most cursed hypocrite! and
          that is all thou art." Others would say, "I am elect" -- but I would
          remind them that they neglect the mercy-seat and do not pray. Oh,
          beloved! never think you are elect unless you are holy. You may come
          to Christ as a sinner, but you may not come to Christ as an elect
          person until you can see your holiness. Do not misconstrue what I say
          -- do not say "I am elect," and yet think you can be living in sin.
          That is impossible. The elect of God are holy. They are not pure, they
          are not perfect, they are not spotless; but, taking their life as a
          whole, they are holy persons. They are marked, and distinct from
          others: and no man has a right to conclude himself elect except in his
          holiness. He may be elect, and yet lying in darkness, but he has no
          right to believe it; no one can see it, there is no evidence of it.
          The man may live one day, but he is dead at present. If you are
          walking in the fear of God, trying to please him, and to obey his
          commandments, doubt not that your name has been written in the Lamb's
          book of life from before the foundation of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, lest this should be too high for you, note the other mark of
          election, which is faith, "belief of the truth." Whoever believes
          God's truth, and believes on Jesus Christ, is elect. I frequently meet
          with poor souls, who are fretting and worrying themselves about this
          thought -- "How, if I should not be elect!" "Oh, sir," they say, "I
          know I put my trust in Jesus; I know I believe in his name and trust
          in his blood; but how if I should not be elect?" Poor dear creature!
          you do not know much about the gospel, or you would never talk so, for
          he that believes is elect. Those who are elect, are elect unto
          sanctification and unto faith; and if you have faith you are one of
          God's elect; you may know it and ought to know it, for it is an
          absolute certainty. If you, as a sinner, look to Jesus Christ this
          morning, and say --
        </p>
        <p>"Nothing in my hands I bring,</p>
        <p>Simply to thy cross I cling,"</p>
        <p>
          you are elect. I am not afraid of election frightening poor saints or
          sinners. There are many divines who tell the enquirer "election has
          nothing to do with you." That is very bad, because the poor soul is
          not to be silenced like that. If you could silence him so, it might be
          well, but he will think of it, he can't help it. Say to him then, if
          you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you are elect. If you will cast
          yourself on Jesus, you are elect. I tell you -- the chief of sinners
          -- this morning, I tell you in his name, if you will come to God
          without any works of your own, cast yourself on the blood and
          righteousness of Jesus Christ; if you will come now and trust in him,
          you are elect -- you were loved of God from before the foundation of
          the world, for you could not do that unless God had given you the
          power, and had chosen you to do it. Now you are safe and secure if you
          do but come and cast yourself on Jesus Christ, and wish to be saved
          and to be loved by him. But think not that any man will be saved
          without faith and without holiness. Do not conceive, my hearers, that
          some decree, passed in the dark ages of eternity, will save your
          souls, unless you believe in Christ. Do not sit down and fancy that
          you are to be saved without faith and holiness. That is a most
          abominable and accursed heresy, and has ruined thousands. Lay not
          election as a pillow for you to sleep on, or you may be ruined. God
          forbid that I should be sewing pillows under armholes that you may
          rest comfortably in your sins. Sinner! there is nothing in the Bible
          to palliate your sins. But if thou art condemned O man! if thou art
          lost O woman! thou wilt not find in this Bible one drop to cool thy
          tongue, or one doctrine to palliate thy guilt; your damnation will be
          entirely your own fault, and your sin will richly merit it, because ye
          believe not ye are condemned. "Ye believe not because ye are not of my
          sheep." "Ye wilt not come to me that ye might have life." Do not fancy
          that election excuses sin -- do not dream of it -- do not rock
          yourself in sweet complacency in the thought of your irresponsibility.
          You are responsible. We must give you both things. We must have divine
          sovereignty, and we must have man's responsibility. We must have
          election, but we must ply your hearts, we must send God's truth at
          you; we must speak to you, and remind you of this, that while it is
          written, "In me is thy help"; yet it is also written, "O Israel, thou
          hast destroyed thyself."

          VI. Now, lastly, what are the true and legitimate tendencies of right
          conceptions concerning the doctrine of election. First, I will tell
          you what the doctrine of election will make saints do under the
          blessing of God; and, secondly what it will do for sinners if God
          blesses it to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I think election, to a saint, is one of the most stripping
          doctrines in all the world -- to take away all trust in the flesh, or
          all reliance upon anything except Jesus Christ. How often do we wrap
          ourselves up in our own righteousness, and array ourselves with the
          false pearls and gems of our own works and doings. We begin to say
          "Now I shall be saved, because I have this and that evidence." Instead
          of that, it is naked faith that saves; that faith and that alone
          unites to the Lamb, irrespective of works, although it is productive
          of them. How often do we lean on some work, other than that of our own
          Beloved, and trust in some might, other than that which comes from on
          high. Now if we would have this might taken from us, we must consider
          election. Pause my soul, and consider this. God loved thee before thou
          hadst a being. He loved thee when thou wast dead in trespasses and
          sins, and sent his Son to die for thee. He purchased thee with his
          precious blood ere thou couldst lisp his name. Canst thou then be
          proud?
        </p>
        <p>
          I know nothing, nothing again, that is more humbling for us than this
          doctrine of election. I have sometimes fallen prostrate before it,
          when endeavouring to understand it. I have stretched my wings, and,
          eagle-like, I have soared towards the sun. Steady has been my eye, and
          true my wing, for a season; but, when I came near it, and the one
          thought possessed me, -- "God hath from the beginning chosen you unto
          salvation," I was lost in its lustre, I was staggered with the mighty
          thought; and from the dizzy elevation down came my soul, prostrate and
          broken, saying, "Lord, I am nothing, I am less than nothing. Why me?
          Why me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Friends, if you want to be humbled, study election, for it will make
          you humble under the influence of God's Spirit. He who is proud of his
          election is not elect; and he who is humbled under a sense of it may
          believe that he is. He has every reason to believe that he is, for it
          is one of the most blessed effects of election that it helps us to
          humble ourselves before God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again. Election in the Christian should make him very fearless
          and very bold. No man will be so bold as he who believes that he is
          elect of God. What cares he for man if he is chosen of his Maker? What
          will he care for the pitiful chirpings of some tiny sparrows when he
          knoweth that he is an eagle of a royal race? Will he care when the
          beggar pointeth at him, when the blood royal of heaven runs in his
          veins? Will he fear if all the world stand against him? If earth be
          all in arms abroad, he dwells in perfect peace, for he is in the
          secret place of the tabernacle of the Most High, in the great
          pavillion of the Almighty. "I am God's," says he, "I am distinct from
          other men. They are of an inferior race. Am not I noble? Am not I one
          of the aristocrats of heaven? Is not my name written in God's book?"
          Does he care for the world? Nay: like the lion that careth not for the
          barking of the dog, he smileth at all his enemies; and when they come
          too near him, he moveth himself and dasheth them to pieces. What
          careth he for them? He walks about them like a colossus; while little
          men walk under him and understand him not. His brow is made of iron,
          his heart is of flint -- what doth he care for man? Nay; if one
          universal hiss came up from the wide world, he would smile at it, for
          he would say, --
        </p>
        <p>"He that hath made his refuge God,</p>
        <p>Shall find a most secure abode."</p>
        <p>
          "I am one of his elect. I am chosen of God and precious; and though
          the world cast me out, I fear not." Ah! ye time-serving professors,
          some of you can bend like the willows. There are few oaken-Christians
          now-a-days, that can stand the storm; and I will tell you the reason.
          It is because you do not believe yourselves to be elect. The man who
          knows he is elect will be too proud to sin; he will not humble himself
          to commit the acts of common people. The believer in this truth will
          say, "I compromise my principles? I change my doctrines? I lay aside
          my views? I hide what I believe to be true? No! since I know I am one
          of God's elect, in the very teeth of all men I shall speak God's
          truth, whatever man may say." Nothing makes a man so truly bold as to
          feel that he is God's elect. He shall not quiver, he shall not shake,
          who knows that God has chosen him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, election will make us holy. Nothing under the gracious
          influence of the Holy Spirit can make a Christian more holy than the
          thought that he is chosen. "Shall I sin," he says, "after God hath
          chosen me? Shall I transgress after such love? Shall I go astray after
          so much lovingkindness and tender mercy? Nay, my God; since thou hast
          chosen me, I will love thee; I will live to thee --
        </p>
        <p>'Since thou, the everlasting God,</p>
        <p>My Father art become;'</p>
        <p>
          I will give myself to thee to be thine for ever, by election and by
          redemption, casting myself on thee, and solemnly consecrating myself
          to thy service."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, lastly, to the ungodly. What says election to you? First, ye
          ungodly ones, I will excuse you for a moment. There are many of you
          who do not like election, and I cannot blame you for it, for I have
          heard those preach election, who have sat down, and said, "I have not
          one word to say to the sinner." Now, I say you ought to dislike such
          preaching as that, and I do not blame you for it. But, I say, take
          courage, take hope, O thou sinner, that there is election. So far from
          dispiriting and discouraging thee, it is a very hopeful and joyous
          thing that there is an election. What if I told thee perhaps none can
          be saved, none are ordained to eternal life; wouldst thou not tremble
          and fold thy hands in hopelessness, and say, "Then how can I be saved,
          since none are elect?" But, I say, there is a multitude elect, beyond
          all counting -- a host that no mortal can number. Therefore, take
          heart, thou poor sinner! Cast away thy despondency -- mayest thou not
          be elect as well as any other? for there is a host innumerable chosen.
          There is joy and comfort for thee! Then, not only take heart, but go
          and try the Master. Remember, if you were not elect, you would lose
          nothing by it. What did the four Syrians say? "Let us fall unto the
          host of the Syrians, for if we stay here we must die, and if we go to
          them we can but die." O sinner! come to the throne of electing mercy,
          Thou mayest die where thou art. Go to God; and, even supposing he
          should spurn thee, suppose his uplifted hand should drive thee away --
          a thing impossible -- yet thou wilt not lose anything; thou wilt not
          be more damned for that. Besides, supposing thou be damned, thou
          wouldst have the satisfaction at least of being able to lift up thine
          eyes in hell and say, "God, I asked mercy of thee and thou wouldst not
          grant it; I sought it, but thou didst refuse it." That thou never
          shalt say, O sinner! If thou goest to him, and askest him, thou shalt
          receive; for he ne'er has spurned one yet! Is not that hope for you?
          What though there is an allotted number, yet it is true that all who
          seek belong to that number. Go thou and seek; and if thou shouldst be
          the first one to go to hell, tell the devils that thou didst perish
          thus -- tell the demons that thou art a castaway, after having come as
          a guilty sinner to Jesus. I tell thee it would disgrace the Eternal --
          with reverence to his name -- and he would not allow such a thing. He
          is jealous of his honour, and he could not allow a sinner to say that.
        </p>
        <p>
          But ah, poor soul! not only think thus, that thou canst not lose
          anything by coming; there is yet one more thought -- dost thou love
          the thought of election this morning? Art thou willing to admit its
          justice? Dost thou say, "I feel that I am lost; I deserve it; and that
          if my brother is saved I cannot murmur. If God destroy me, I deserve
          it, but if he saves the person sitting beside me, he has a right to do
          what he will with his own, and I have lost nothing by it." Can you say
          that honestly from your heart? If so, then the doctrine of election
          has had its right effect on your spirit, and you are not far from the
          kingdom of heaven. You are brought where you ought to be, where the
          Spirit wants you to be; and being so this morning, depart in peace;
          God has forgiven your sins. You would not feel that if you were not
          pardoned; you would not feel that if the Spirit of God were not
          working in you. Rejoice, then, in this. Let your hope rest on the
          cross of Christ. Think not on election but on Christ Jesus. Rest on
          Jesus -- Jesus first, midst, and without end.<br />
