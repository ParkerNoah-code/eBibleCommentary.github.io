            Here is noble work for him, for the cry of the last Psalm is about
            to be heard, and the challenge of the foes of Israel taken up by God
            himself. Here the virgin daughter of Zion despises her foe, and
            laughs him to scorn. The destruction of Sennacherib's army is a
            notable illustration of this sacred song. Here is another of the
            "destroy not" Psalms, and the title may be intended as a check upon
            the natural fierceness of the oppressed, or a taunt for the savage
            foe, who is here bitterly bidden to destroy not, because the nation
            is well aware that he cannot. Here, in holy faith, the sucking child
            plays at the hole of the asp, and the weaned child puts his hand on
            the cockatrice den. A Psalm or Song of Asaph. For reading or
            singing. A hymn to God and a song for his saints. Happy were the
            people who having found a Milton in David had an almost equal
            songster in Asaph: happiest of all, because these poets were not
            inspired by earth's Castalian fount, but drank of "the fount of
            every blessing.

            Then follows a warning voice from the church to her enemies, verses

            another time our prayers will remain unanswered. As the smiling

            me tell you, better be a fool void of reason, than a fool void of
            grace: this is the devil's fool. Proverbs 14:9. Is not he a fool who
            refuses a rich portion? God offers Christ and salvation—but the
            sinner refuses this portion: "Israel would have none of me." Psalm
            81:11. Is not he a fool who tends his mortal part, and neglects his
            angelical part? As if one should paint the wall of his house, and
            let the timber rot. Is not he a fool who will feed the devil with
            his soul? As that emperor who fed his lion with a pheasant. Is not

            In a rightly ordered society, godly men are counted great men,
            virtue confers true rank, and grace is more esteemed than gold.
            Being saved from unrighteous domination, the chief among the chosen
            people here promises to rectify the errors which had crept into the
            commonwealth, and after the example of the Lord himself, to abase
            the haughty and elevate the humble.

            This <i>memorable ode </i>may be sung in times of great depression,
            when prayer has performed her errand at the mercy-seat, and when
            faith is watching for speedy deliverance. It is a song of the second
            advent, concerning the nearness of the judge with the cup of wrath.
