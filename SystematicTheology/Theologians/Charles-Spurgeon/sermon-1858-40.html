        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.204)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, July 11, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens</p>
        <p>
          "For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost."
          -- Luke 19:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          HOW FOND OUR MASTER WAS of the sweet title, the "Son of Man!" If he
          had chosen, he might always have spoken of himself as the Son of God,
          the Everlasting Father, the Wonderful, the Counseller, the Prince of
          Peace. He hath a thousand gorgeous titles, resplendent as the throne
          of heaven, but he careth not to use them: to express his humility and
          let us see the lowliness of him whose yoke is easy and whose burden is
          light. He calls not himself the Son of God, but he speaks of himself
          evermore as the Son of Man who came down from heaven. Let us learn a
          lesson of humility from our Saviour; let us never court great titles,
          nor proud degrees. What are they, after all, but beggarly distinctions
          whereby one worm is known from another? He that hath the most of them
          is a worm still, and is in nature no greater than his fellows. If
          Jesus called himself the Son of Man, when he had far greater names,
          let us learn to humble ourselves unto men of low estate, knowing that
          he that humbleth himself shall in due time be exalted. Methinks,
          however, there is a sweeter thought than this in that name, Son of
          Man. It seems to me that Christ loved manhood so much, that he always
          desired to honor it; and since it is a high honor, and indeed the
          greatest dignity of manhood, that Jesus Christ was the Son of Man, he
          is wont to display this name, that he may as it were put rich stars
          upon the breast of manhood, and put a crown upon its head. Son of Man
          -- whenever he said that word he seemed to put a halo round the head
          of Adam's children. Yet there is perhaps a more lovely thought still.
          Jesus Christ called himself the Son of Man, because he loved to be a
          man. It was a great stoop for him to come from heaven and to be
          incarnate. It was a mighty stoop of condescension when he left the
          harps of angels and the songs of cherubims to mingle with the vulgar
          herd of his own creatures. But condescension though it was, he loved
          it. You will remember that when he became incarnate he did not become
          so in the dark. When he bringeth forth the only begotten into the
          world, he saith, "Let all the angels of God worship him." It was told
          in heaven; it was not done as a dark secret which Jesus Christ would
          do in the night that none might know it; but all the angels of God
          were brought to witness the advent of a Saviour a span long, sleeping
          upon a Virgin's breast, and lying in a manger. And ever afterwards,
          and even now, he never blushed to confess that he was man; never
          looked back upon his incarnation with the slightest regret; but always
          regarded it with a joyous recollection, thinking himself thrice happy
          that he had ever become the Son of Man. All hail, thou blessed Jesus!
          we know how much thou lovest our race; we can well understand the
          greatness of thy mercy towards thy chosen ones, inasmuch as thou art
          evermore using the sweet name which acknowledges that they are bone of
          thy bone and flesh of thy flesh, and thou art one of them, a brother
          and a near kinsman.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our text announces as a declaration of our Saviour, that he, the Son
          of Man, is come to seek and to save that which was lost. In addressing
          you this morning, I shall simply divide my discourse thus: -- First, I
          shall lay it down as a selfevident truth, that whatever was the
          intention of Christ in his coming into the world that intention most
          certainly shall never be frustrated. We shall then in the second
          place, look into the intention of Christ, as announced in the text,
          viz., "to seek and to save that which was lost." Then, in concluding,
          we shall derive a word of comfort, and perhaps one of warning, from
          the intention of our Saviour in coming into the world "to seek and to
          save that which was lost."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. You are aware that there has been a very great discussion amongst
          all Christians about the redemption of our Lord Jesus Christ. There is
          one class of men who believe in what is called general redemption,
          affirming it to be an undoubted truth that Jesus Christ hath shed his
          blood for every man, and that the intention of Christ in his death was
          the salvation of men considered as a whole; they have, however, to
          overlook the fact that in this case Christ's intention would be
          frustrated in a measure. There are others of us who hold what is
          called the doctrine of particular redemption. We conceive that the
          blood of Christ was of an infinite value, but that the intention of
          the death of Christ never was the salvation of all men; for if Christ
          had designed the salvation of all men, we hold that all men would have
          been saved. We believe that the intention of Christ's death is just
          equal to its effects, and therefore I start this morning by announcing
          what I regard to be a self-evident truth, that whatever was the
          intention of Jesus Christ in coming into the world, that intention
          most certainly shall be fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I shall make use of a few arguments to strengthen this doctrine,
          although I believe that on the very first announcement it commends
          itself to every thinking mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, it seems to be inconsistent with the very idea of
          God that he should ever intend anything which should not be
          accomplished. When I look at man I see him to be a creature so
          distracted with folly and so devoid of power, that I do not wonder
          that he often begins to build and is not able to finish, I do not
          marvel that full often he stops short because he hath not counted the
          cost: I wonder not, when I think how much there is that is above man's
          control, that he should sometimes propose but that God should dispose
          far differently from his proposition. I see man to be the insect of a
          day, a mere ephemera upon the bay-leaf of existence; and when I see
          him as a mere drop in the great sea of creation, I do not wonder that
          when he is ambitious he sometimes fashions in himself great designs
          which he is unable to accomplish because the wheels of providence and
          destiny will often run quite contrary to all the frolic of his will.
          But when I think of God whose name is, "I am that I am," the
          self-existent one, in whom we live and move and have our being, who is
          from everlasting to everlasting, the Almighty God; when I think of him
          as filling immensity, having all power and strength, knowing all
          things, having a fullness of wisdom, I cannot associate with such an
          idea of God the supposition of his ever failing in any of his
          intentions. It would seem to me that a God who could intend a thing
          and fail in his intention would be no God, but be a thing like
          ourselves perhaps superior in strength, but certainly not entitled to
          worship. I cannot anyhow think of God of a true and real God like
          Jehovah, except as a being who wills and it is accomplished, who
          speaks and it is done, who commands and it stands fast, for ever,
          settled in heaven. I cannot therefore imagine, since Jesus Christ was
          the Son of God, that in his atonement and redemption, his real
          intention and desire can in any way be frustrated. If I were a
          Socinian and believed Jesus Christ to be a mere man, I could of course
          imagine, that the result of his redemption would be uncertain; but
          believing that Jesus Christ was very God of very God, equal and
          co-eternal with the Father, I dare not, lest I should be guilty of
          presumption and blasphemy, associate with that name of Jehovah Jesus
          any suspicion that the design of his death shall remain
          unaccomplished.
        </p>
        <p>
          But again, we have before us the fact, that hitherto, all the works of
          God have accomplished their purpose. Whenever God has uttered, by the
          lips of his servants, a prophecy, it has surely come to pass. The
          instruments of accomplishing that purpose have often been the most
          factious and rebellious of men: they had no intention whatever of
          serving God; they have run contrary to his laws; but you will observe
          that when they have dashed wildly along, his bit has been still in
          their mouth and his bridle in their jaws. A great monarch has acted
          like leviathan in the sea; he hath moved himself wherever he pleased;
          he hath seemed mighty among the sons of men; all the rest of mankind
          were as minnows, while he was a huge leviathan: but we discover that
          God has been overruling his thought, that he has been in his council
          chamber, that the wildest speculations of his ambition have, after
          all, been but the fulfilling of Jehovah's stern decrees. Look ye
          abroad through all the nations of the earth, and tell me, is there one
          prophecy of God that hath failed? May he not still say, "Not one of
          them hath lost her mate?" Every word of God hath certainly been
          accomplished. The kings of the earth stood up and took counsel
          together against the Lord and against his anointed saying, Let us
          break his bands asunder and cast his cords from us. But he that
          sitteth in the heavens did laugh at them; the Lord did have them in
          derision. Still he worked his own sovereign will; let them do as they
          pleased, God was over them all, reigning and ruling evermore. If,
          then, God's purpose in providence certainly never has been frustrated,
          am I to imagine that God's purpose in the glorious sacrifice of Jesus
          Christ shall be null and void? If there be any of you who have arrived
          at such a contortion of intellect as to conceive that a less work
          being accomplished, a greater one shall fail, I must leave you to
          yourselves, with you I could not argue, I should think you incapable
          of an argument. Surely, if God the Master, the Judge, the King, hath
          in all things done according to his own pleasure in this lower world,
          in the mere creation and preservation of men, it is not to be dreamed
          of for a moment, that when he stoops himself from the highest heaven,
          to give his own heart's blood for our redemption, he shall in that be
          foiled. No though earth and hell be against him, every purpose of
          Jesus on the cross shall be consummated, and as the price was
          "finished," so shall the purchase be; as the means were fully
          provided, so shall the end be accomplished to its utmost jot and
          tittle.
        </p>
        <p>
          But again, I invite you to stand at the foot of the cross, and take a
          view of Jesus Christ, and then I will put it to you whether you can
          imagine that Jesus Christ could in any measure have died in vain.
          Come, believer, place thyself in the garden of Gethsemane, hide
          thyself among those dark olives, and listen to yonder man who is in
          agony. Dost hear those groans? They are the groans of an incarnate
          God. Dost hear those sighs? They are the sighs of the Son of Man. God
          over all, blessed for ever. Hearest thou those strong cries, and dost
          thou see those tears? They are the crying and the tears of him who is
          equal with his Father, but who condescended to be a man. Rise, for he
          has risen, Judas has betrayed him and taken him away. Look on that
          ground. Seest thou those gouts of gore? It is the bloody sweat of the
          man Christ Jesus. I conjure thee, answer this question. Standing in
          the garden of Gethsemane, with those blood gouts staining the white
          frost of that cold midnight, canst thou believe that one of those
          clots of blood shall fall to the ground and not effect its purposed I
          challenge thee, O Christian, whatever thy doctrinal opinions, to say
          me "Yes" to such a question as that. Canst thou imagine that a sweat
          of blood from the veins of incarnate Deity shall ever fall to the
          ground and fail? Why, beloved, the word of God which cometh forth out
          of his mouth shall not return unto him void, but it shall accomplish
          that which he pleases; how much more shall the Great WORD of God,
          which came forth from the loin; of Deity, accomplish the purpose
          whereunto God hath sent him, and prosper in the thing for which it
          pleased God to ordain him!
        </p>
        <p>
          But now come with me to the hall of judgment. See there your Master
          placed in mock state in the midst of a ribald band of soldiery. Do you
          see how they spit on those blessed cheeks, how they pluck his hair,
          how they buffet him? Do you see the crown of thorns with its ruby
          drops of gore? Hark! Can you hear the cry of the multitude, as they
          say, "Crucify him, crucify him?" And will you now stand there and look
          at this man whom Pilate has just brought forth, still bleeding from
          the lash of the scourge, covered with shame, and spitting and mockery,
          and as this "Ecce Homo" is presented to you, will you believe that
          this, the incarnate Son of God, shall be made such a spectacle to men,
          to angels, and to devils, and yet fail of his design? Can you imagine
          that one lash of that whip shall have a fruitless aim? Shall Jesus
          Christ suffer this shame and spitting, and yet endure what were far
          worse -- a disappointment in the fulfillment of his intentions? No,
          God forbid! By Gethsemane and Gabbatha, we are pledged to the strong
          belief that what Christ designed by his death, must certainly be
          accomplished.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then again, see him hanging on his cross. The nails have pierced his
          hands and feet, and there in the broiling sun he hangs, -- he hangs to
          die. The mockery has not ceased; still they put out the tongue and wag
          the head at him; still they taunt him with "If thou be the Son of God
          come down from the cross." And now his bodily pains increase, while
          his soul's anguish is terrible even unto death. Christian canst thou
          believe that the blood of Christ was shed in vain? Canst thou look at
          one of those precious drops as it trickles from his head or his hands
          or his feet, and canst thou imagine that it shall fall to the ground
          and perish there? Trust the waters may fail from the sea, the sun may
          grow dim with age, but I never can imagine that the value, the merit,
          the power of the blood of Jesus ever shall die out, or that its
          purpose shall be unaccomplished. It seems to me as clear as noonday,
          that the design of the Saviour's death must certainly be fulfilled, be
          it what it may.
        </p>
        <p>
          I might use a hundred other arguments. I might show that every
          attribute of Christ declares that his purpose must be accomplished. He
          certainly has love enough to accomplish his design of saving the lost,
          for he has a love that is bottomless and fathomless, even as the abyss
          itself. He certainly has no objection to the accomplishment of his own
          design, for "As I live, saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the
          death of him that dieth, but had rather that he should turn unto me
          and live." And certainly the Lord cannot fail for want of power, for
          where we have omnipotence there can be no deficiency of strength. Nor
          again, can the design be unaccomplished because it was unwise, for
          God's designs cannot be unwise, simply because they are of God -- that
          is to say -- they are of infinite wisdom. I cannot see anything in the
          character of Christ, nor anything the wide world over, that can for
          one moment make me imagine that Christ should die, and yet it should
          be said afterwards, "This man died for a purpose which he never lived
          to see accomplished: the object of his death was only partially
          fulfilled; he saw of the travail of his soul, but he was not
          satisfied, for he did not redeem all whom he intended to redeem."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, some persons love the doctrine of universal atonement because
          they say it so beautiful. It is a lovely idea that Christ should have
          died for all men; it commends itself, they say, to the instincts of
          humanity; there is something in it full of joy and beauty. I admit
          there is; but beauty may be often associated with falsehood. There is
          much which I might well admire in the theory of universal redemption
          but let me just tell you what the supposition necessarily involves. If
          Christ on his cross intended to save every man, then he intended to
          save those who were damned before he died; because if the doctrine be
          true, that he died for all men, he died for some that were in hell
          before he came into this world, for doubtless there were myriads there
          that had been cast away. Once again, if it were Christ's intention to
          save all men, how deplorably has he been disappointed! for we have his
          own evidence that there is a lake that burneth with fire and
          brimstone, and into that pit must be cast some of the very persons,
          who according to that theory, were bought with his blood. That seems
          to me a thousand times more frightful than any of those horrors, which
          are said to be associated with the Calvinistic and Christian doctrine
          of particular redemption. To think that my Saviour died for men in
          hell seems a supposition too horrible for me to imagine: that he was
          the substitute for the sons of men, and that God having first punished
          the substitute punished men again, seems to me to conflict with any
          idea of justice. That Christ should offer an atonement and
          satisfaction for the sins of men, and that afterwards those very men
          should be punished for the sins which Christ had already atoned for,
          seems to me, to be the most marvellous monstrosity that ever could
          have been imputed to Saturn, to Janus, ay, to the god of the Thugs, or
          the most diabolical heathen demons. God forbid that we should ever
          think thus of Jehovah, the just and wise. If Christ has suffered in
          man's stead, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and save
          us from all unrighteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I have thus started the first thought that the intention of
          Christ's death cannot be frustrated. And now methinks every one will
          anxiously listen, and every ear will be attentive, and the question
          will arise from every heart, "WHAT THING WAS THE INTENTION OF THE
          Saviour'S DEATH? AND IS IT POSSIBLE: THAT I CAN HAVE A PORTION IN IT?"
          For whom, then, did the Saviour die -- and is there the slightest
          probability that I have some lot or portion in that great atonement
          which he has offered? Beloved, my text is the answer to the question
          -- "The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost."
          Now, our text tells us of two things -- first, the subjects of the
          Saviour's atonement, the lost; and, secondly, the objects of it, he
          came to seek and save.
        </p>
        <p>
          I must now endeavor to pick out the objects of the Saviour's
          atonement. He came "to seek and to save that which was lost." Some of
          you may turn your heads away at once, and conclude that hitherto you
          have given no evidence that you have any portion in the death of
          Christ. You are very good sort of people; you never did much that was
          wrong -- perhaps a little now and then; but nothing particular ever
          troubles your conscience. You have a notion that you shall certainly
          enter into the kingdom of heaven, for you are no worse than your
          neighbors, and if you are not saved, God help other people! for if you
          do not go to heaven, who will? You are trusting in your own good
          works, and believing you are righteous. Now let us decide your case at
          once. Since you are ashamed to put yourselves among those who are
          lost, I have no Christ to preach to you till you are ready to come and
          confess that you are lost; for Christ himself tells us, that he came
          "not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance;" and inasmuch
          as you belong to the righteous, and trust in yourselves that you are
          good and excellent you may turn upon your heel and go, for in the
          blood of Christ there is no portion for men who live and die trusting
          in their own self-righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I may dismiss another part of you. Some of you are saying, "Well,
          sir, I know I am guilty, but still I am persuaded that by attention to
          the law of God in future, I shall certainly be able to take away the
          demerit of my guilt. I intend henceforward to reform, and I believe
          that by a consistent course of attention to religious ordinances, and
          by carefully regarding that which is right and wrong between God and
          man, and man and man, I shall, without doubt, make an atonement for
          the sins of the past." Ah, my friend, hitherto thou givest me no hope
          that thou had any portion in the death of Christ. Christ came not to
          die for men who can save themselves without him. If thou thinkest thou
          canst save thyself remember the door of mercy is shut in thy face.
          Christ came to bring robes from heaven, but not for you who can spin
          for yourselves. He came to bring bread for the hungry, but he will
          give none of it to you who can sow and reap, and make bread for
          yourselves. Christ helps the helpless, but they who can help
          themselves and have sufficient of their own strength and merit to
          carry them to heaven, may fight their way there alone, if they can --
          they shall have no help from him. Whom then did Christ die to save? It
          is said, he came to save "that which was lost."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, you must bear with me while I run over the different ways in
          which a man may be lost; and then I will conclude by noticing the term
          as it is used in the proper sense, when we may affirm that Christ died
          for such. We know that all men are lost in Adam; as soon as we are
          born into this world, we are lost, when the tiny bark of the infant is
          launched upon the river of life it is lost; unless Sovereign grace
          shall stretch forth its hand and save it in infancy, and carry it to
          heaven or save it afterwards, when it shall have grown up -- that
          infant is lost. "Behold," saith David, "I was born in sin and shapen
          in iniquity; in sin did my mother conceive me." "In Adam all die." The
          fall of Adam was the fall of the human race; then, you and I, and all
          of us fell down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, we are all lost by practice. No sooner does the child become
          capable of knowing right and wrong, than you discover that he chooses
          the evil and abhors the good. Early passions soon break out, like
          weeds immediately after the shower of rain; speedily the hidden
          depravity of the heart makes itself manifest and we grow up to sin and
          so we become lost by practice. But mark, a man may be lost in Adam,
          and lost by practice, and yet not be saved by Christ; but Christ is
          able to save you; though you be twice lost, his salvation is able to
          redeem you from death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there be some who go further still. The deadly tree of sin grows
          taller and taller some become lost to the church. After having been
          trained up religiously in our Midst, they turn aside; they give up all
          outward regard to the worship of God, the ministry of the gospel is
          neglected, the house of prayer is forsaken, and the church tolls its
          bell and says of such an one, "He is lost to the church." Some go
          further still; they are lost to society. I have seen many who are dead
          while they live. We have in the midst of us the harlot and the
          drunkard, who, like the leper in the camp of Israel, have to be put
          away, lest the contagion should spread; and those who seek after right
          are obliged to turn away from them, lest the evil should spread in the
          midst of the flock. Now there are many who are lost to society whom
          Jesus Christ came to save, and whom he will save. But a man may be
          lost to society and may be lost everlastingly; it is no proof that
          Christ will save him, because he is thus lost, while at the same time
          it is no proof that he will not save him, for Christ came to save even
          men who are lost like this. Again, the man may go further, and be lost
          to the family. We have known those who have become so vile, that even
          after society has shut them out, a parent has been obliged to shut
          then out too. That must be a hell of sin indeed which can make a
          father say to his son, "My son, you shall not want bread while I have
          any, but I must forbid you my house, for your brothers and sisters
          cannot endure your society; I feel you would destroy their souls if I
          should allow you to associate with them." Now, a man may be lost thus
          to his own family, and yet sovereign grace will save him. But, mark, a
          man may be lost to his family and yet not be saved; yea, that may be
          the increase of his condemnation, that he sinned against a mother's
          prayers and against a father's exhortations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I will tell you the people whom Christ will save -- they are those
          who are lost to themselves. Just imagine a ship at sea passing through
          a storm: the ship leaks, and the captain tells the passengers he fears
          they are lost. If they are far away from the shore, and have sprung a
          leak, they pump with all their might as long as they have any strength
          remaining; they seek to keep down the devouring element; they still
          think that they are not quite lost while they have power to use the
          pumps. At last they see the ship cannot be saved; they give it up for
          lost, and leap into the boats. The boats are beating for many a-day,
          full of men who have but little food to eat. "They are lost," we say,
          "lost out at sea." But they do not think so; they still cherish a hope
          that perhaps some stray ship may pass that way and pick them up. There
          is a ship in the horizon; they strain their eyes to look at her; they
          lift each other up; they wave a flag; they rend their garments to make
          something which shall attract attention; but she passes away; black
          night comes, and they are forgotten. At length the very last mouthful
          of food has been consumed; strength fails them, and they lay down
          their oars in the boat, and lay themselves down to die. You can
          imagine then how well they understand the awful meaning of the term --
          "lost." As long as they had any strength left they felt they were not
          lost; as long as they could see a sail they felt there was yet hope;
          while there was yet a mouldy biscuit left, or a drop of water, they
          did not give up all for lost. Now the biscuit is gone, and the water
          is gone; now strength has departed, and the oar lies still: they lie
          down to die by each other's side, mere skeletons; things that should
          have been dead days ago, if they had died when all enjoyment of life
          had ceased. Now they know, I say, what it is to be lost, and across
          the shoreless waters they seem to hear their deathknell pealing forth
          that awful word, Lost! lost! lost! Now, in a spiritual sense, these
          are the people Christ came to save. Sinner, thou too art condemned.
          Our Father Adam steered the ship awry and she split upon a rock, and
          she is filling even to her bulwarks now; and pump as philosophy may,
          it can never keep the waters of her depravity so low as to prevent the
          ship from sinking. Seeing that human nature is of itself lost, it hath
          taken to the boat. She is a fair boat, called the boat of Good
          Endeavour, and in her you are striving to row with all your might, to
          reach the shore; but your strength fails you. You say, "Oh, I cannot
          keep God's law. The more I strive to keep it, the more I find it to be
          impossible for me to do so. I climb; but the higher I climb, the
          higher is the top above me. When I was in the plains, I thought the
          mountain was but a moderate hill but now I seem to have ascended
          half-way up its steps, -- there it is, higher than the clouds, and I
          cannot discern the summit." However, you gather up your strength, you
          try again, you row once more, and at last unable to do anything, you
          lay down your oars, feeling that if you are saved, it cannot be by
          your own works. Still you have a little hope left. There are a few
          small pieces of mouldy biscuit remaining. You have heard that by
          attention to certain ceremonies you may be saved, and you munch your
          dry biscuit; but at last that fails you, and you find that neither
          baptism, nor the Lord's supper, nor any other outward rites, can make
          you clean, for the leprosy lies deep within. That done, you still look
          out. You are in hopes that there may be a sail coming, and while
          floating upon that deep of despair, you think you detect in the
          distance some new dogma, some fresh doctrine that may comfort you. It
          passes, however, like the wild phantom ship -- it is gone, and there
          you are left at last, with the burning sky of God's vengeance above
          you, with the deep waters of a bottomless hell beneath you, fire in
          your heart and emptiness in that ship which once was so full of hope,
          you lie down despairing, and you cry -- "Lord save me, or I perish!"
          Is that your condition this morning, my friend, or has that ever been
          your condition? If so, Christ came into the world to seek and to save
          you; and you he will save, and no one else. He will save only those
          who can claim this for their title, -- "Lost;" who have understood in
          their own souls what it is to be lost, as to all self-trust, all
          self-reliance, and all self-hope. I can look back to the time when I
          knew myself to be lost. I thought that God meant to destroy me. I
          imagined that because I felt myself to be lost, I was the special
          victim of Almighty vengeance; for I said unto the Lord. "Hast thou set
          me as the target of all thine arrows? Am I a seal or a whale, that
          thou hast set a mark upon me? Hast thou sewed up mine iniquities in a
          bag, and sealed my transgressions with a seal. Wilt thou never be
          gracious? Hast thou made me to be the center of all sorrow, the chosen
          one of heaven to be cursed for ever?" Ah! fool that I was! I little
          knew then, that those who have the curse in themselves are the men
          whom God will bless -- that we have the sentence of death in
          ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in him who died
          for us and rose again. Come, I will put the question once again -- can
          you say that you are lost? Was there a time when you traveled with the
          caravan through this wild wilderness world? Have you left the caravan
          with your companions, and are you left in the midst of a sea of sand
          -- a hopeless, arid waste? And do you look around you, and see no
          helper; and do you cast your eyes around and see no trust? Is the
          deathbird wheeling in the sky, screaming with delight because he hopes
          soon to feed upon your flesh and bones? Is the water-bottle dry, and
          doth the bread fail you? Have you consumed the last of your dry dates,
          and drunk the last of that brackish water from the bottle. and are you
          now without hope, without trust in yourself; ready to lie down in
          despair? Hark thee! The Lord thy God loveth thee; Jesus Christ has
          bought thee with his blood; thou art, thou shalt be his. He has been
          seeking thee all this time, and he has found thee at last, in the vast
          howling wilderness and now he will take thee upon his shoulders, and
          carry thee to his house rejoicing, and the angels shall be glad over
          thy salvation. Now, such people must and shall be saved. and this is
          the description of those whom Jesus Christ came to save. Whom he came
          to save he will save; you, ye lost ones -- lost to all hope and self
          confidence, shall be saved. Though death and hell should stand in the
          way, Christ will perform his vow, and accomplish his design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall be very brief in concluding my discourse; but we have now to
          notice THE OBJECTS OF THE DEATH OF CHRIST -- he came "to seek and to
          save that which was lost." I am so glad that these two words are both
          there, for if they were not, what hope would there be for any of us?
          The Arminian says Christ came to save those that seek him. Beloved,
          there is a sense in which that is true; but it is a lie. Christ did
          come to save those that seek him, but no one ever sought the Lord
          Jesus Christ, unless the Lord Jesus first sought him. Christ does not
          leave it to ourselves to seek him, or else it would be left indeed,
          for so vile is human nature that although heaven be offered, and
          though hell thunder in our ears, yet there never was and there never
          will be any man who, unconstrained by sovereign grace, will run in the
          way of salvation, and so escape from hell and flee to heaven. It is
          all in vain for me to preach to you, and all in vain for the most
          earnest exhortations to be addressed to any of you, unless the Holy
          Spirit shall be pleased to back them up; for man is so infatuated, his
          disease is one which causes such a madness of the brain, that he
          refuses the remedy, and puts away from him the healing draught which
          alone can give him life from the dead. "Ye will not come unto me that
          ye might have life." Let man alone, and with the cross of Christ
          before him and all hell behind him, he will shut his eyes and prefer
          to be damned rather than enter into eternal life by the blood of
          Christ the Lord. Hence Christ came first to seek men, and then to save
          them. Ah! what a task that is of seeking men! There are some of you
          to-day on the tops of the mountains of pride, and others of you in the
          deep glens of despair. Methinks I see the Saviour coming forth to seek
          you; he finds you to-day in the green pastures of the sanctuary, he
          comes near to you, and by these hands of mine he seeks to lay hold of
          you, but no sooner do you discern his approach then you run far away
          into the wild desert of sin. Perhaps this evening you will be spending
          the remnant of the Sabbath in profaning God's day. One of you at least
          I know who will be in the public house as soon as the evening sermon
          is over, and most probably will go home very late. If Christ intends
          to save you, he will go to you there; and while you are in that wild
          waste of sin, he will send some providence after you, and save you
          there. Away you fly then to the marshes of reformation, and you say,
          "The shepherd cannot overtake me. I shall be beyond his reach now, I
          have left off my drunkenness, I have given up my cursing." But he will
          come to you there, and wade for you ankle deep in your own
          self-righteousness. And then you will run away again and jump into the
          deep pit of despair, and there you will say to yourself, "He can never
          find me here." But I see him coming with that crook of his: he enters
          the pit, takes you by the feet, and casts you round his neck, and
          carries you home rejoicing, saying, "I have found him at last!
          Wherever he wandered, I sought him, and now I have found him." It is
          strange what queer places Christ finds some of his people in! I knew
          one of Christ's sheep who was found out by his Master while committing
          robbery. I knew another who was found out by Christ, while he was
          spiting his old mother by reading the Sunday newspaper and making fun
          of her. Many have been found by Jesus Christ, even in the midst of sin
          and vanity. I knew a preacher of the Gospel who was converted in a
          theater. He was listening to a play, an old-fashioned piece, that
          ended with a sailor's drinking a glass of gin before he was hung, and
          he said, "Here's to the prosperity to the British Nation, and the
          salvation of my immortal soul.", and down went the curtain; and down
          went my friend too, for he ran home with all his might. Those words,
          "The salvation of my immortal soul;" had struck him to the quick; and
          he sought the Lord Jesus in his chamber. Many a-day he sought him, and
          at last he found him to his joy and confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          But for the most part Christ finds his people in his own house; but he
          finds them often in the worst of tempers, in the most hardened
          conditions; and he softens their hearts, awakens their consciences,
          subdues their pride, and takes them to himself; but never would they
          come to him unless he came to them. Sheep go astray, but they do not
          come back again of themselves. Ask the shepherd whether his sheep come
          back, and he will tell you, "No, sir; they will wander, but they never
          return." When you find a sheep that ever came back of himself, then
          you may hope to find a sinner that will come to Christ of himself. No;
          it must be sovereign grace that must seek the sinner and bring him
          home.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when Christ seeks him he SAVES him. Having caught him at last,
          like the ram of old, in the thorns of conviction, he does not take a
          knife and slay him as the sinner expects, but he takes him by the hand
          of mercy, and begins to comfort and to save. Oh, ye lost sinners, the
          Christ who seeks you to-day in the ministry, and who has sought you
          many a-day by his providence, will save you. He will first find you
          when you are emptied of self, and then he will save you. When you are
          stripped he will bring forth the best robe and put it on you. When you
          are dying he will breathe life into your nostrils. When you feel
          yourselves condemned he will come and blot out your iniquities like a
          cloud, and your transgressions like a thick cloud. Fear not, ye
          hopeless and helpless souls, Christ seeks you to-day, and seeking, he
          will save you -- save you here, save you living, save you dying, save
          you in time, save you in eternity, and give you, even you, the lost
          ones, a portion among them that are sanctified. May the Lord now bless
          these words to your consolation!
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I shall not stop to say more, as I intended to have done, lest I
          should weary you. Let me only remind you, that the time is coming when
          that word "lost" will have a more frightful meaning to you, than it
          has to-day. In a few more months, some of you, my hearers, will hear
          the great bell of eternity tolling forth that awful word -- lost,
          lost, lost! The great sepulchres of hell will toll out your doom --
          lost, lost, lost! and through the shades of eternal misery this shall
          for ever assail your ear, that you are lost for ever. But if that bell
          is ringing in your ear to-day, that you are lost oh, be of good cheer,
          it is a good thing to be so lost, it is a happy thing to be lost to
          self, and lost to pride, and lost to carnal hope. Christ will save
          you. Believe that. Look to him as he hangs upon his cross. One look
          shall give you comfort. Turn your weeping eyes to him as he bleeds
          there in misery. He can, he will save you. Believe on him, for he that
          believeth and is baptized, shall be saved. He that believeth not must
          be damned, but whosoever among the lost ones will now cast himself on
          Christ Jesus, shall find everlasting life through his death and
          righteousness. May the Lord now gather in his lost sheep, for Jesus
          Christ's sake! Amen.
