        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.551)</p>

        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that
          have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of
          God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; grace and peace be multiplied unto
          you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, according as
          his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life
          and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to
          glory and virtue: whereby are given unto us exceeding great and
          precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine
          nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through
          lust." -- 2 Peter 1:1-4.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE two most important things in our holy religion are faith and life.
          He who shall rightly understand these two words is not far from being
          a master in experimental theology. Faith and life! these are vital
          points to a Christian. They possess so intimate a connection with each
          other that they are by no means to be severed; God hath so joined them
          together, let no man seek to put them asunder. You shall never find
          true faith unattended by true godliness; on the other hand, you shall
          never discover a truly holy life which has not for its root and
          foundation a living faith upon the righteousness of our Lord Jesus
          Christ. Woe unto those who seek after the one without the other! There
          be some who cultivate faith and forget holiness; these may be very
          high in orthodoxy, but they shall be very deep in damnation, in that
          day when God shall condemn those who hold the truth in
          unrighteousness, and make the doctrine of Christ to pander to their
          lusts. There are others who have strained after holiness of life, but
          have denied the faith; these are comparable unto the Pharisees of old,
          of whom the Master said, they were "whitewashed sepulchres;" they were
          fair to look upon externally, but inwardly, because the living faith
          was not there, they were full of dead men's bones and all manner of
          uncleanness. Ye must have faith, for this is the foundation; ye must
          have holiness of life, for this is the superstructure. Of what avail
          is the mere foundation of a building to a man in the day of tempest?
          Can he hide himself among sunken stones and concrete? He wants a house
          to cover him, as well as a foundation upon which that house might have
          been built; even so we need the superstructure of spiritual life if we
          would have comfort in the day of doubt. But seek not a holy life
          without faith, for that would be to erect a house which can afford no
          permanent shelter, because it has no foundation on a rock -- a house
          which must come down with a tremendous crash in the day when the rain
          descends, and the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat upon it.
          Let faith and life be put together, and, like the two abutments of an
          arch, they shall make your piety strong. Like the horses of Pharaoh's
          chariot, they pull together gloriously. Like light and heat streaming
          from the same sun, they are alike full of blessing. Like the two
          pillars of the temple, they are for glory and for beauty. They are two
          streams from the fountain of grace; two lamps lit with holy fire; two
          olive-trees watered by heavenly care; two stars carried in Jesus'
          hand. The Lord grant that we may have both of these to perfection,
          that his name may be praised.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, it will be clear to all, that in the four verses before us, our
          apostle has most excellently set forth the necessity of these two
          things -- twice over he insists upon the faith, and twice over upon
          holiness of life. We will take the first occasion first.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Observe, in the first place, what he says concerning the character
          and the origin of faith, and then concerning the character and origin
          of spiritual life.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that
          have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of
          God and our Saviour Jesus Christ." So far the faith. "Grace and peace
          be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our
          Lord, according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that
          pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that
          hath called us to glory and virtue." These two verses, you see,
          concern the spiritual life which comes with the faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us begin where Peter begins, with the FAITH. You have here a
          description of true saving faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, you have a description of its source. He says, "to them that
          have obtained like precious faith." See, then, my brethren, faith does
          not grow in man's heart by nature; it is a thing which is obtained. It
          is not a matter which springs up by a process of education, or by the
          example and excellent instruction of our parents; it is a thing which
          has to be obtained. Not imitation, but regeneration; not development,
          but conversion. All our good things come from without us, only evil
          can be educed from within us. Now, that which is obtained by us must
          be given to us; and well are we taught in Scripture that "faith is not
          of ourselves, it is the gift of God." Although faith is the act of
          man, yet it is the work of God. "With the heart man believeth unto
          righteousness;" but that heart must, first of all, have been renewed
          by divine grace before it ever can be capable of the act of saving
          faith. Faith, we say, is man's act, for we are commanded to "believe
          on the Lord Jesus Christ," and we shall be saved. At the same time,
          faith is God's gift, and wherever we find it, we may know that it did
          not come there from the force of nature, but from a work of divine
          grace. How this magnifies the grace of God, my brethren, and how low
          this casts human nature! Faith. Is it not one of the simplest things?
          Merely to depend upon the blood and righteousness of the Lord Jesus
          Christ, does it not seem one of the easiest of virtues? To be nothing,
          and to let him be everything -- to be still, and to let him work for
          me, does not this seem to be the most elementary of all the Christian
          graces? Indeed, so it is; and yet, even to this first principle and
          rudiment, poor human nature is so fallen and so utterly undone, that
          it cannot attain unto! Brethren, the Lord must not only open the gates
          of heaven to us at last, but he must open the gates of our heart to
          faith at the first. It is not enough for us to know that he must make
          us perfect in every good work to do his will, but we must be taught
          that he must even give us a desire after Christ; and when this is
          given, he must enable us to give the grip of the hand of faith whereby
          Jesus Christ becomes our Saviour and Lord. Now, the question comes
          (and we will try and make the text of today, a text of examination all
          the way through) have we obtained this faith? Are we conscious that we
          have been operated upon by the Holy Spirit? Is there a vital principle
          in us which was not there originally? Do we know today the folly of
          carnal confidence? Have we a hope that we have been enabled through
          divine grace to cast away all our own righteousness and every
          dependence, and are we now, whether we sink or swim, resting entirely
          upon the person, the righteousness, the blood, the intercession, the
          precious merit of our Lord Jesus Christ? If not, we have cause enough
          to tremble; but if we have, the while the apostle writes, "Unto them
          that have obtained like precious faith," he writes to us, and across
          the interval of centuries his benediction comes as full and fresh as
          ever, "Grace and peace be multiplied unto you."
        </p>
        <p>
          Peter having described the origin of this faith, proceeds to describe
          its object. The word "through" in our translation, might, quite as
          correctly, have been rendered "in" -- "faith in the righteousness of
          our God and our Saviour Jesus Christ." True faith, then, is a faith in
          Jesus Christ, but it is a faith in Jesus Christ as divine. That man
          who believes in Jesus Christ as simply a prophet, as only a great
          teacher, has not the faith which will save him. Charity would make us
          hope for many Unitarians, but honesty compels us to condemn them
          without exception, so far as vital godliness is concerned. It matters
          not how intelligent may be their conversation, nor how charitable may
          be their manners, nor how patriotic may be their spirit, if they
          reject Jesus Christ as very God of very God, we believe they shall
          without doubt perish everlastingly. Our Lord uttered no dubious words
          when he said, "He that believeth not shall be damned," and we must not
          attempt to be more liberal than the Lord himself. Little allowance can
          I make for one who receives Jesus the prophet, and rejects him as God.
          It is an atrocious outrage upon common sense for a man to profess to
          be a believer in Christ at all, if he does not receive his divinity. I
          would undertake, at any time, to prove to a demonstration, that if
          Christ were not God, he was the grossest impostor who ever lived. One
          of two things, he was either divine or a villain. There is no stopping
          between the two. I cannot imagine a character more evil than that
          which would be borne by a man who should lead his followers to adore
          him as God, without ever putting in a word by way of caveat, to stop
          their idolatry; nay, who should have spoken in terms so ambiguous,
          that two thousand years after his death, there should be found
          millions of persons resting upon him as God. I say, if he were not
          God, the atrocity of his having palmed himself upon us, his disciples,
          as God, puts aside altogether from consideration any of the apparent
          virtues of his life. He was the grossest of all deceivers, if he was
          not "very God of very God." O beloved, you and I have found no
          difficulties here; when we have beheld the record of his miracles,
          when we have listened to the testimony of his divine Father, when we
          have heard the word of the inspired apostles, when we have felt the
          majesty of his own divine influence in our own hearts, we have
          graciously accepted him as "the Wonderful, the Counsellor, the mighty
          God, the everlasting Father;" and, as John bear witness of him and
          said, "The Word was in the beginning with God, and the Word was God,"
          even so have we received him; so that at this day, he that was born of
          the virgin Mary, Jesus of Nazareth, the king of the Jews, is to us
          "God over all, blessed for ever."
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus is worthy to receive</p>
        <p>Honour and power divine:</p>
        <p>And blessings more than we can give,</p>
        <p>Be Lord for ever thine."</p>
        <p>
          Now, beloved friends, have we heartily and joyfully received Jesus
          Christ as God? My hearer, if thou hast not, I pray thee seek of God
          the faith that saves, for thou hast it not as yet, nor art thou in the
          way to it. Who but a God could bear the weight of sin? Who but a God
          shall be the "same yesterday, to-day, and for ever?" Concerning whom
          but a God could it be said, "I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye
          sons of Jacob are not consumed." We have to do with Christ, and we
          should be consumed if he changed; inasmuch, then, as he does not
          change, and we are not consumed, he must be divine, and our soul rolls
          the entire burden of its care and guilt upon the mighty shoulders of
          the everlasting God, who --
        </p>
        <p>"Bears the earth's huge pillars up,</p>
        <p>And spreads the heavens abroad."</p>
        <p>
          Remark in further dwelling upon the text, that the apostle has put in
          another word beside "God", and that is, "of God and our Saviour." As
          if the glory of the Godhead might be too bright for us, he has
          attempered it by gentler words "our Saviour." Now, to trust Jesus
          Christ as divine, will save no man, unless there be added to this a
          resting in him as the great propitiatory sacrifice. Jesus Christ is
          our Saviour because he became a substitute for guilty man. He having
          taken upon himself the form of manhood by union with our nature, stood
          in the room, place, and stead of sinners. When the whole tempest of
          divine wrath was about to spend itself on man, he endured it all for
          his elect; when the great whip of the law must fall, he bared his own
          shoulders to the lash; when the cry was heard, "Awake, O sword!" it
          was against Christ the Shepherd, against the man who was the fellow to
          the eternal God. And because he thus suffered in the place and stead
          of man, he received power from on high to become the Saviour of man,
          and to bring many sons into glory, because he had been made perfect
          through suffering. Now, have we received Jesus Christ as our Saviour?
          Happy art thou, if thou hast laid thy hand upon the head of him who
          was slain for sinners. Be glad, and rejoice in the Lord without
          ceasing, if today that blessed Redeemer who has ascended upon high has
          become thy Saviour, delivered thee from sin, passing by thy
          transgressions, and making thee to be accepted in the beloved. A
          Saviour is he to us when he delivers us from the curse, punishment,
          guilt and power of sin, "He shall save his people from their sins." O
          thou great God, be thou my Saviour, mighty to save.
        </p>
        <p>
          But be pleased to notice the word "righteousness." It is a faith in
          the righteousness of our God and our Saviour. In these days, certain
          divines have tried to get rid of all idea of atonement; they have
          taught that faith in Jesus Christ would save men, apart from any faith
          in him as a sacrifice. Ah, brethren, it does not say, "faith in the
          teaching of God our Saviour;" I do not find here that it is written,
          "faith in the character of God our Saviour, as our exemplar." No, but
          "faith in the righteousness of God our Saviour." That righteousness,
          like a white robe, must be cast around us. I have not received Jesus
          Christ at all, but I am an adversary and an enemy to him, unless I
          have received him as Jehovah Tsidkenu, the Lord our righteousness.
          There is his perfect life; that life was a life for me; it contains
          all the virtues, in it there is no spot; it keeps the law of God, and
          makes it honourable; my faith takes that righteousness of Jesus
          Christ, and it is cast about me, and I am then so beauteously, nay, so
          perfectly arrayed, that even the eye of God can see neither spot nor
          blemish in me. Have we, then, today a faith in the righteousness of
          God our Saviour? For no faith but this can ever bring the soul into a
          condition of acceptance before the Most High. Why," saith one, "these
          are the very simplicities of the gospel." Beloved, I know they are,
          and, therefore, do we deal them out this morning, for, thanks be to
          God, it is the simplicities which lie at the foundation; and it is
          rather by simplicities than by mysteries that a Christian is to try
          himself and to see whether he be in the faith or no. Put the question,
          brethren, have we, then, this like precious faith in God and our
          Saviour Jesus Christ?
        </p>
        <p>
          Our apostle has not finished the description, without saying that it
          is "like precious faith." All faith is the same sort of faith. Our
          faith may not be like that of Peter, in degree, but if it be genuine,
          it is like it as to its nature, its origin, its objects, and its
          results. Here is a blessed equality. Speak of "liberty, equality, and
          fraternity," you shall only find these things carried out within the
          Church of Christ. There is indeed a blessed equality here, for the
          poorest little-faith who ever crept into heaven on its hands and
          knees, has a like precious faith with the mighty apostle Peter. I say,
          brethren, if the one be gold, so is the other; if the one can move
          mountains, so can the other; for remember, that the privileges of
          mountain-moving, and of plucking up the trees, and casting them into
          the sea, are not given to great faith, but "if ye have faith as a
          grain of mustard seed," it shall be done. Little faith has a royal
          descent and is as truly of divine birth as is the greatest and fullest
          assurance which ever made glad the heart of man, hence it ensures the
          same inheritance at the last, and the same safety by the way. It is
          "like precious faith."
        </p>
        <p>
          He tells us too, that faith is "precious;" and is it not precious? for
          it deals with precious things, with precious promises, with precious
          blood, with a precious redemption, with all the preciousness of the
          person of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Well may that be a
          precious faith which supplies our greatest want, delivers us from our
          greatest danger, and admits us to the greatest glory. Well may that be
          called "precious faith," which is the symbol of our election, the
          evidence of our calling, the root of all our graces, the channel of
          communion, the weapon of prevalence, the shield of safety, the
          substance of hope, the evidence of eternity, the guerdon of
          immortality, and the passport of glory. O for more of this inestimably
          precious faith. Precious faith, indeed it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the apostle, Simon Peter, writes "to them that have obtained like
          precious faith with us, through the righteousness of God, and our
          Saviour Jesus Christ," does he write to you? does he write to me? If
          not, if we are not here addressed, remember that we can never expect
          to hear the voice which says, "Come ye blessed of my Father;" but we
          are today in such a condition, that dying as we now are, "Depart ye
          cursed" must be the thunder which shall roll in our ears, and drive us
          down to hell. So much, then, concerning faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we shall turn to notice with great brevity, the LIFE. "Grace and
          peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus
          our Lord, according as his divine power hath given unto us all things
          that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him
          that hath called us to glory and virtue." Here we have, then,
          brethren, the fountain and source of our spiritual life. Just as faith
          is a boon which is to be obtained, so you will perceive that our
          spiritual life is a principle which is given. A thing which is given
          to us, too, by divine power -- "according as his divine power hath
          given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness." To
          give life at all is the essential attribute of God. This is an
          attribute which he will not alienate; to save and to destroy belong
          unto the Sovereign of heaven. "He can create, and he destroy," is one
          of the profoundest notes in the ascription of our praise. Suppose a
          corpse before us. How great a pretender would he be who should boast
          that it was in his power to restore it to life. Certainly, it would be
          even a greater pretence if anyone should say that he could give to
          himself or to another the divine life, the spiritual life by which a
          man is made a Christian. My brethren, you who are partakers of the
          divine nature, know that by nature you were dead in trespasses and
          sins, and would have continued so until this day if there had not been
          an interposition of divine energy on your behalf. There you lay in the
          grave of your sin, rotten, corrupt. The voice of the minister called
          to you, but you did not hear. You were often bidden to come forth, but
          ye did not and could not come. But when the Lord said, "Lazarus, come
          forth," then Lazarus came forth; and when he said to you, "Live," then
          you lived also, and the spiritual life beat within you, with joy and
          peace through believing. This we ought never to forget, because, let
          us never fail to remember, that if our religion is a thing which
          sprang from ourselves, it is of the flesh, and must die. That which is
          born of the flesh in its best and most favourable moments, is flesh,
          and only that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. "Ye must be born
          again." If a man's religious life be only a refinement of his ordinary
          life, if it be only a high attainment of the natural existence, then
          is it not the spiritual life, and does not prepare him for the eternal
          life before the throne of God. No, we must have a supernatural spark
          of heavenly flame kindled within us. Just as nothing but the soul can
          quicken the body and make it live, so the Spirit alone can quicken the
          soul and make the soul live. We must have the third master-principle
          infused, or else we shall be but natural men, made after the image of
          the first Adam. We must have, I say, the new spirit, or else we shall
          not be like the second Adam, who was made a quickening spirit. Only of
          the Christian can we say that he is spirit, soul, and body; the
          ungodly man has only soul and body, and as to spiritual existence, he
          is as dead as the body would be if there were no soul. Now the
          implantation of this new principle, called the spirit, is a work of
          divine power. Divine power! What stupendous issues are grasped in that
          term, divine power! It was this which digged the deep foundations of
          the earth and sea! Divine power, it is this which guides the marches
          of the stars of heaven! Divine power! it is this which holds up the
          pillars of the universe, and which one day shall shake them, and hurry
          all things back to their native nothingness. Yet the selfsame power
          which is required to create a world and to sustain it, is required to
          make man a Christian, and unless that power be put forth, the
          spiritual life is not in any one of us.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will perceive, dear friends, that the apostle Peter wished to see
          this divine life in a healthy and vigorous state, and therefore he
          prays that grace and peace may be multiplied. Divine power is the
          foundation of this life; grace is the food it feeds upon, and peace is
          the element in which it lives most healthily. Give a Christian much
          grace, and his spiritual life will be like the life of a man who is
          well clothed and nurtured; keep the spiritual life without abundant
          grace, and it becomes lean, faint, and ready to die; and though die it
          cannot, yet will it seem as though it gave up the ghost, unless fresh
          grace be bestowed. Peace, I say, is the element in which it flourishes
          most. Let a Christian be much disturbed in mind, let earthly cares get
          into his soul, let him have doubts and fears as to his eternal safety,
          let him lose a sense of reconciliation to God, let his adoption be but
          dimly before his eyes, and you will not see much of the divine life
          within him. But oh! if God shall smile upon the life within you, and
          you get much grace from God, and your soul dwells much in the balmy
          air of heavenly peace, then shall you be strong to exercise yourself
          unto godliness, and your whole life shall adorn the doctrine of God
          your Saviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, again, that in describing this life, he speaks of it as one
          which was conferred upon us by our being called. He says, "We were
          called unto glory and virtue." I find translators differ here. Many of
          them think the word should be "By" -- "We are called by the glory and
          virtue of God" -- that is, there is a manifestation of all the
          glorious attributes of God, and of all the efficacious virtue and
          energy of his power in the calling of every Christian. Simon Peter
          himself was at his fishing and in his boat, but Jesus said to him,
          "Follow me;" and at once he followed Christ. He says there was in that
          calling, the divine glory and virtue; and, doubtless, when you and I
          shall get to heaven, and see things as they are, we shall discover in
          our effectual calling of God to grace, a glory as great as in the
          creation of worlds, and a virtue as great as in the healing of the
          sick, when virtue went from the garments of a Saviour. Now, can we say
          today, that we have a life within us which is the result of divine
          power, and have we, upon searching ourselves, reason to believe, dear
          friends, that there is that within us which distinguishes us from
          other men, because we have been called out by mankind by the glory and
          energy of the divine power? I am afraid some of us must say "Nay."
          Then the Lord in his mercy yet bring us into the number of his people.
          But if we can, however, tremblingly say, "Yes, I trust there is
          something of the life in me;" then as Peter did so, do I wish for you
          that benediction, "Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the
          knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ." O brethren, whatever
          men may say against the faith of God, there is nothing in the world
          which creates virtue like true faith. Wherever true faith enters,
          though it be into the heart of a harlot or of a thief, what a change
          it makes! See her there; she has polluted herself many times; she has
          gone far into sin. Mary has been a sinner; she hears the preaching of
          the Saviour; standing in the crowd she listens to him one day as he
          preaches concerning the prodigal, and how the loving father pressed
          him to his bosom; she comes to Jesus and she finds forgiveness. Is she
          a harlot any longer? Nay, there she is, washing his feet with her
          tears, and wiping them with the hairs of her head. The woman who was a
          sinner, hates her evil ways and loves her gracious Lord. We may say of
          her, "But she is washed, but she is sanctified, but she is saved."
          Take Saul of Tarsus. Foaming with blood, breathing out threatenings,
          he is going to Damascus to drag the saints of God to prison. On the
          road he is struck down; by divine mercy he is led to put his trust in
          Jesus. Is he a persecutor any longer? See that earnest apostle beaten
          with rods -- shipwrecked -- in labours more abundant than all the rest
          of them -- counting not his life dear unto him, that he may win Christ
          and be found in him. Saul of Tarsus becomes a majestic proof of what
          the grace of God can do. See Zaccheus, the grasping publican,
          distributing his wealth, the Ephesians burning their magical books,
          the jailer washing the apostle's stripes. Take the case of many now
          present. Let memory refresh itself this morning, with the recollection
          of the change which has been wrought in you. We have nothing to boast
          of; God forbid that we should glory, save in the cross of Christ, but
          yet some of us are wonderful instances of renewing grace. We were
          unclean, our mouths could utter blasphemy; our temper was hot and
          terrible; our hands were unrighteous; we were altogether as an unclean
          thing, but how changed now! Again, I say, we boast of nothing which we
          now are, for by the grace of God we are what we are, yet the change is
          something to be wondered at. Has divine grace wrought this change in
          you? Be not weary with my reiteration of this question. Let me put it
          again to you till I get an answer; nay, till I force you to an answer:
          Have you this precious faith? Can you not answer the question? Then,
          have you not that divine life, that life which is given by divine
          calling? If you have the one, you have the other; and if you have not
          both, you have neither; for where there is the one, the other must
          come, and where the one has come, the other has been there.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I have thus fully but feebly brought the subject before you, allow
          me to remind you that another verse remains which handles the same
          topics. In the fourth verse, he deals with the privileges of faith,
          and also with the privileges of the spiritual life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice the PRIVILEGE OF FAITH first. "Whereby are given unto us
          exceeding great and precious promises" -- here is the faith, "That by
          these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the
          corruption that is in the world through lust." Here is the life
          resulting from the faith. Now, the privileges of faith first. The
          privileges of faith are, that we have given to us "Exceeding great and
          precious promises." "Great and precious" -- two words which do not
          often come together. Many things are great which are not precious,
          such as great rocks, which are of little value; on the other hand,
          many things are precious which are not great -- such as diamonds and
          other jewels, which cannot be very great if they be very precious. But
          here we have promises which are so great, that they are not less than
          infinite, and so precious, that they are not less than divine. I shall
          not attempt to speak about their greatness or their preciousness, but
          just give a catalogue of them, and leave you to guess at both. We have
          some of them which are like birds in the hands -- we have them
          already; other promises are like birds in the bush, only that they are
          just as valuable and as sure as those which are in the hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note here, then, we have received by precious faith the promise and
          pardon. Hark thee, my soul, all thy sins are forgiven thee. He who
          hath faith in Christ hath no sin to curse him, his sins are washed
          away, they have ceased to be; they have been carried on the
          scape-goat's head into the wilderness; they are drowned in the Red
          Sea; they are blotted out; they are thrown behind God's back; they are
          cast into the depths of the sea. Here is a promise of perfect pardon.
          Is not this great and precious? -- as great as your sins are; and if
          your sins demanded a costly ransom, this precious promise is as great
          as the demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then comes the righteousness of Christ: you are not only pardoned,
          that is, washed and made clean, but you are dressed, robed in garments
          such as no man could ever weave. The vesture is divine. Jehovah
          himself has wrought out your righteousness for you; the holy life of
          Jesus the Son of God, has become your beauteous dress, and you are
          covered with it. Christian, is not this an exceeding great and
          precious promise? The law was great -- this righteousness is as great
          as the law. The law asked a precious revenue from man, more than
          humanity could pay -- the righteousness of Christ has paid it all. Is
          it not great and precious?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then next comes reconciliation. You were strangers, but you are
          brought nigh by the blood of Christ. Once aliens, but now
          fellow-citizens with the saints and of the household of God. Is not
          this great and precious?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then comes your adoption. "Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it
          doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall
          appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is." "And if
          children, then heirs, heirs of God, joint heirs with Jesus Christ, if
          so be we suffer with him that we may be glorified together." Oh, how
          glorious is this great and precious promise of adoption!
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we have the promise of providence: "all things work together for
          good to them that love God, to them that are called according to his
          purpose." "Thy place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks." "Thy
          bread shall be given thee and thy waters shall be sure." "As thy days
          thy strength shall be." "Fear not, I am with thee; be not dismayed, I
          am thy God." "When thou passest through the rivers, I will be with
          thee, the floods shall not overflow thee. When thou goest through the
          fire, thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flames kindle upon
          thee." When I think of providence, the greatness of its daily gifts,
          and the preciousness of its hourly boons, I may well say, here is an
          exceeding great and precious promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then you have the promise too, that you shall never taste of death but
          shall only sleep in Jesus. "Write, blessed are the dead which die in
          the Lord from henceforth. Yea, saith the Spirit, that they cease from
          their labours; and their works do follow them." Nor does the promise
          cease here, you have the promise of a resurrection. "For the trumpet
          shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall
          be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this
          mortal must put on immortality." Beloved, we know that if Christ rose
          from the dead, so also them who sleep in Jesus, will the Lord bring
          with him. Nor is this all, for we shall reign with Jesus; at his
          coming, we shall be glorified with him, we shall sit upon his throne,
          even as he has overcome and sits with his Father upon his throne. The
          harps of heaven, the streets of glory, the trees of paradise, the
          river of the water of life, the eternity of immaculate bliss -- all
          these, God hath promised to them who love him. "Eye hath not seen, nor
          ear heard, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him,
          but he hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit;" and by our faith we
          have grasped them, and we have today "the substance of things hoped
          for, and the evidence of things not seen." Now, beloved, see how rich
          faith makes you! -- what treasure! -- what a costly regalia! -- what
          gold mines! -- what oceans of wealth! -- what mountains of sparkling
          treasures has God conferred upon you by faith!
        </p>
        <p>
          But we must not forget the life, and with that we close. The text
          says, he has given us this promise, "that" -- "in order that." What
          then? What are all these treasures lavished for? For what these
          pearls? For what these jewels? For what, I say, these oceans of
          treasure? For what? Is the end worthy of the means? Surely God never
          giveth greater store than the thing which he would purchase will be
          worth. We may suppose, then, the end to be very great when such costly
          means have been given; and what is the end? Why, "that by these ye
          might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption
          that is in the world through lust." O, my brethren, if you have these
          mercies today by faith, do see to it that the result is obtained. Be
          not content to be made rich in these great and precious promises,
          without answering God's design in your being thus enriched. That
          design, you perceive, is twofold; it is first that you may be
          partakers of the divine nature; and, secondly, that you may escape the
          corruption which is in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be a partaker of the divine nature is not, of course, to become
          God. That cannot be. The essence of Deity is not to be participated in
          by the creature. Between the creature and the Creator there must ever
          be a gulf fixed in respect of essence; but as the first man Adam was
          made in the image of God, so we, by the renewal of the Holy Spirit,
          are in a yet diviner sense made in the image of the Most High, and are
          partakers of the divine nature. We are, by grace, made like God. "God
          is love;" we become love -- "He that loveth is born of God." God is
          truth; we become true, and we love that which is true, and we hate the
          darkness and the lie. God is good, it is his very name; he makes us
          good by his grace, so that we become the pure in heart who shall see
          God. Nay, I will say this, that we become partakers of the divine
          nature in even a higher sense than this -- in fact, in any sense,
          anything short of our being absolutely divine. Do we not become
          members of the body of the divine person of Christ? And what sort of
          union is this -- "members of his body, of his flesh, and of his
          bones?" The same blood which flows in the head flows in the hand, and
          the same life which quickens Christ, quickens his people; for, "Ye are
          dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God." Nay, as if this were
          not enough, we are married into Christ. He hath betrothed us unto
          himself in righteousness and in faithfulness; and as the spouse must,
          in the nature of things, be a partaker of the same nature as the
          husband, so Jesus Christ first became partaker of flesh and blood that
          they twain might be one flesh; and then he makes his Church partakers
          of the same spirit, that they twain may be one spirit; for he who is
          joined unto the Lord is one spirit. Oh, marvellous mystery! we look
          into it, but who shall understand it? One with Jesus, by eternal union
          one, married to him; so one with him that the branch is not more one
          with the vine than we are a part of the Lord, our Saviour, and our
          Redeemer. Rejoice in this, brethren, ye are made partakers of the
          divine nature, and all these promises are given to you in order that
          you may show this forth among the sons of men, that ye are like God,
          and not like ordinary men; that ye are different now from what flesh
          and blood would make you, having been made participators of the nature
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the other result which follows from it, was this, "Having escaped
          the corruption that is in the world through lust." Ah, beloved, it
          were ill that a man who is alive should dwell in corruption. "Why seek
          ye the living among the dead?" said the angel to Magdalene. Should the
          living dwell among the dead? Should divine life be found amongst the
          corruptions of worldly lusts? The bride of Christ drunken! Frequenting
          the ale-house! A member of Christ's body found intoxicated in the
          streets, or lying, or blaspheming, or dishonest! God forbid. Shall I
          take the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? How can
          I drink the cup of the Lord, and drink the cup of Belial? How can it
          be possible that I can have life, and yet dwell in the black, dark,
          foul, filthy, pestiferous tomb of the world's lusts? Surely, brethren,
          from these open lusts and sins ye have escaped: have ye also escaped
          from slothfulness? Have ye clean escaped from carnal security? Are we
          seeking day by day to live above worldliness, and love of the things
          of the world, and the ensnaring avarice which they nourish? Remember,
          it is for this that you have been enriched with the treasures of God.
          Do not, oh, I conjure you, do not, chosen of God and beloved by him,
          and so graciously enriched, do not suffer all this lavish treasure to
          be wasted upon you.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is nothing which my heart desires more than to see you, the
          members of this Church, distinguished for holiness: it is the
          Christian's crown and glory. An unholy Church! it is of no use to the
          world, and of no esteem among men. Oh! it is an abomination, hell's
          laughter, heaven's abhorrence. And the larger the Church, the more
          influential, the worse nuisance does it become, when it becomes dead
          and unholy. The worst evils which have ever come upon the world, have
          been brought upon her by an unholy Church. Whence came the darkness of
          the dark ages? From the Church of Rome. And if we want to see the
          world again sitting in Egyptian darkness, bound with fetters of iron,
          we have only to give up the faith, and to renounce holiness of life,
          and we may drag the world down again to the limbo of superstition, and
          bind her fast in chains of ignorance and vice. O Christian, the vows
          of God are upon you. You are God's priest: act as such. You are God's
          king: reign over your lusts. You are God's chosen: do not associate
          with Belial. Heaven is your portion; live like a heavenly spirit, so
          shall you prove that you have the true faith; but except ye do this,
          your end shall be to lift up your eyes in hell, and find yourself
          mistaken when it will be too late to seek or find a remedy. The Lord
          give us the faith and the life, for Jesus' sake. Amen.<br />
