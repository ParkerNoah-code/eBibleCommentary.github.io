        >We have, in these first three verses, a description of the hatred of
        men against the Messiah. No better comment is needed upon it than the
        apostolic song in Acts 4:27,28: "For of a truth against your holy child
        Jesus, whom you have anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the
        Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together, for to do
        whatever your hand and your counsel determined before to be done."
        <p align="justify">
          The Psalm begins abruptly with an angry interrogation; and well it
          may: it is surely but little to be wondered at, that the sight of
          creatures in arms against their God, should amaze the psalmist's mind.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We see the <font color="#818100">heathen raging, </font> roaring like
          the sea, tossed to and fro with restless waves, as the ocean in a
          storm; and then we mark the people in their hearts
          <font color="#818100"> imagining a vain thing </font>against God.
          Where there is much rage—there is generally some folly, and in this
          case there is an excess of it!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "Rage." The word with which Paul renders this in the Greek, denotes
          rage, pride, and restiveness, as of horses that neigh, and rush into
          the battle.

        It was not temporary rage—but deep seated hate, for they

        <font color="#818100">

        >They go about their warfare craftily, not with foolish haste—but
        deliberately. They use all the skill which human wisdom can give. Like
        Pharaoh, they cry, "Let us deal wisely with them." O that men were half
        as careful in God's service to serve him wisely, as his enemies are to
        attack his kingdom craftily. Sinners have their wits about them, and yet
        saints are dull. But what say they? What is the meaning of this
        commotion?
        <font color="#818100">
          <p align="justify">They gather together.</p></font
        >But why did they band themselves against the Lord, or against his
        Anointed? What was their desire of him? To have his goods? No, he had
        none for himself; but they were richer than he. To have his liberty?
        Nay, that would not suffice them, for they had bound him before. To
        bring the people unto dislike of him? Nay, that would not serve them,
        for they had done so already, until even his disciples were fled from
        him. What would they have, then? his blood? Yes, "they took counsel",
        says Matthew, "to put him to death." They had the devil's mind, which is
        not satisfied but with death. And how do they contrive it? He says,
        "they took counsel about it." <i>Henry Smith, </i>1578
        <font color="#818100">
          <p align="justify">Against Jehovah and against his Anointed.</p></font
        >What an honor it was to David to be thus publicly associated with
        Jehovah! And because he was HIS anointed, to be an object of hatred and
        scorn to the ungodly world! If this very circumstance fearfully
        augmented the guilt, and sealed the doom of these infatuated heathen,
        surely it was that which above everything else would preserve the mind
        of David calm and serene, yes, peaceful and joyful notwithstanding the
        proud and boastful vauntiness of his enemies.
        <p align="justify">
          When writing this Psalm, David was like a man in a storm, who hears
          only the roaring of the tempest, or sees nothing but the raging
          billows threatening destruction on every side of him. And yet his
          faith enabled him to say,
          <font color="#818100">The people imagine a vain thing. </font>They
          cannot succeed. They cannot defeat the counsels of heaven. They cannot
          injure the Lord's Anointed. <i>David Pitcairn, </i>1851.

        >These verses show that all trust in man in the service of God is vain.
        Inasmuch as men oppose Christ, it is not good to hang our trust upon
        <i>the multitude </i>for their number, <i>the earnest </i>for their
        zeal, <i>the mighty </i>for their countenance, or <i> the wise </i>for
        their counsel, since all these are far oftener against Christ than for
        him.

        Let us break their bands asunder. That is, "Let us be free to commit all
        manner of abominations. Let us be our own gods. Let us rid ourselves of
        all restraint."
        <p align="justify">
          Gathering impudence by the traitorous proposition of rebellion, they
          add— <font color="#818100">let us cast away; </font>as if it were an
          easy matter, "let us fling off
          <font color="#818100">their cords from us.</font>" What! O you kings,
          do you think yourselves Samsons? and are the bands of Omnipotence but
          as threads before you? Do you dream that you shall snap to pieces and
          destroy the mandates of God—the decrees of the Most High—as if they
          were but threads? and do you say, "Let us cast away their cords from
          us?" Yes! There are monarchs who have spoken thus, and there are still
          rebels upon thrones.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          However mad the resolution to revolt from God, it is one in which man
          has persevered ever since his creation, and he continues in it to this
          very day. The glorious reign of Jesus in the latter day will not be
          consummated, until a terrible struggle has convulsed the nations. His
          coming will be as a refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap, and the
          day thereof shall burn as an oven! Earth hates her rightful
          monarch—but clings to the usurper's sway! The terrible conflicts of
          the last days will illustrate both the world's love of sin—and
          Jehovah's power to give the kingdom to his only Begotten Son. To a
          <i>graceless neck</i>—the yoke of Christ is intolerable—but to the
          <i>saved sinner—</i>it is easy and light. We may judge ourselves by
          this—do we love that yoke, or do we wish to cast it from us?

          Resolved they were to run riot, as lawless, and aweless, and therefore
          they slander the sweet laws of Christ's kingdom as bonds and thick
          cords, which are signs of slavery. Jer 27:2,6-7. But what says our
          Savior? "My yoke is easy, and my burden is light." The law of Christ
          is no more burden to a regenerate man—than wings to a bird.
          <i>John Trapp.</i>

        <p align="justify">
          The true reason of the opposition of sinners to Christ's truth, is
          their hatred of the restraints of godliness.

        Let us now turn our eyes from the wicked counsel chamber and raging

          What does God say? What will the King do unto the men who reject his
          only begotten Son, the Heir of all things? Mark the quiet dignity of
          the Omnipotent One, and the contempt which he pours upon the princes
          and their raging people. He has not taken the trouble to rise up and
          do battle with them—he despises them, he knows how absurd, how
          irrational, how futile are their attempts against him—he therefore
          <i>laughs </i>at them.

        cruelties of their enemies, the derision, the persecution of all that
        are round about us—no more but matter of laughter? He laughs—but it is
        in scorn; he scorns—but it is with vengeance. Short is the joy of the

          The expression,
          <font color="#818100">He who sits in the heavens, </font>at once fixes
          our thoughts on a being infinitely exalted above impotent man. And
          when it is said, "HE <font color="#818100">shall laugh</font>," this
          word is designed to convey to our minds the idea, that the greatest
          confederacies among kings and peoples, and their most extensive and
          vigorous preparations, to defeat HIS purposes or to injure HIS
          servants—are in HIS sight altogether insignificant and worthless. HE
          looks upon their poor and puny efforts, not only without uneasiness or
          fear—but HE laughs at their folly! HE treats their impotency with
          derision. He knows how HE can crush them like a moth when HE pleases,
          or consume them in a moment with the breath of HIS mouth. How
          profitable it is for us to be reminded of truths such as these! Ah! it
          is indeed <font color="#818100">a vain thing </font>for the potsherds

        their fury most violent, <i>then </i>shall his Word go forth against
        them. And what is it, that he says? It is a very galling sentence—

          It is easy for God to destroy his foes. Behold Pharaoh, his wise men,
          his armies and his horses plunging and sinking like lead in the Red
          sea. Here is the end of one of the greatest plots ever formed against
          God's chosen. Of <i>thirty Roman emperors</i>, governors of provinces,
          and others high in office, who distinguished themselves by their zeal
          and bitterness in persecuting the early Christians, one became
          speedily deranged after some atrocious cruelty, one was slain by his
          own son, one became blind, the eyes of one bulged out of his head, one
          was drowned, one was strangled, one died in a miserable captivity, one
          fell dead in a manner that will not bear recital, one died of so
          loathsome a disease that several of his physicians were put to death
          because they could not abide the stench that filled his room, two
          committed suicide, a third attempted it—but had to call for help to
          finish the work, five were assassinated by their own people or
          servants, five others died the most miserable and excruciating deaths,
          several of them having an untold complication of diseases, and eight
          were killed in battle, or after being taken prisoners. Among these was
          Julian the apostate. In the days of his prosperity he is said to have
          pointed his dagger to heaven defying the Son of God, whom he commonly
          called <i>the Galilean</i>. But when he was wounded in battle, he saw
          that all was over with him, and he gathered up his clotted blood, and
          threw it into the air, exclaiming, "You have conquered, O Galilean."
          Voltaire has told us of the agonies of Charles the 9th of France,
          which drove the blood through the pores of the skin of that miserable
          monarch, after his cruelties and treachery to the Christians.

        the earth! Nay, beloved, Christ Jesus is not only higher than kings—but
        he is higher than the angels; yes, he is the head of angels, and,
        therefore, all the angels in heaven are commanded to worship him. Col
        2:12 Heb 1:6 ... He is King over all kingdoms, over all nations, over
        all governments, over all powers, over all people. Da 7:14 ... The very
        heathen are given to Christ, and the uttermost parts of the earth for
        his possession. Psalm 2:8 <i> <p align="justify">Secondly,</p></i>Jesus
        Christ is his <b>saints' </b>King. He is King of the bad, and of the
        good; but as for the wicked, he rules over them by his power and might;
        but the saints, he rules in them by his Spirit and graces. Oh! this is
        Christ's spiritual kingdom, and here he rules in the hearts of his
        people, here he rules over their consciences, over their wills, over
        their affections, over their judgments and understandings, and nobody
        has anything to do here but Christ. Christ is not only the King of
        nations—but the King of saints; the one he rules <i>over</i>, the other
        he rules

        be our King, when he is God's King. But you may say, how is Christ the
        Father's King? Because he rules for his Father. There is a twofold
        kingdom of God committed to Jesus Christ; <i>first</i>, a spiritual
        kingdom, by which he rules in the hearts of his people, and so is King
        of saints; and, <i>secondly</i>, a providential kingdom, by which he
        rules the affairs of this world, and so he is King of nations.

        >The divine decree concerning Christ, in connection with the decrees of
        election and providence. The Sonship of Jesus. This Psalm wears
        something of a dramatic form, for now another person is introduced as
        speaking. We have looked into the council chamber of the wicked, and to
        the throne of God, and now we behold the Anointed One declaring his
        rights of sovereignty, and warning the traitors of their doom.

        <p align="justify">
          God has laughed at the counsel and ravings of the wicked, and now
          Christ the Anointed himself comes forward, as the Risen Redeemer,
          "declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of
          holiness, by the resurrection from the dead." Ro 1:4. Looking into the
          angry faces of the rebellious kings, the Anointed One seems to say,
          "If this suffices not to make you silent"
          <font color="#818100">I will declare the decree</font>. Now this
          decree is directly in conflict with the device of man, for its tenor
          is the establishment of the very dominion against which the nations
          are raving.

        have I begotten you?" What a mercy to have a <i>Divine </i>Redeemer in

        it, for it is a great truth, a truth reverently to be received—but not
        irreverently to be questioned. It may be added, that if this relates to
        the Begotten One in his human nature, we must here also rejoice in the
        mystery—but not attempt to violate its sanctity by intrusive prying into
        the secrets of the Eternal God. The things which are revealed are
        enough, without venturing into vain speculations. In attempting to
        define the Trinity, or unveil the essence of Divinity, many men have
        lost themselves: here great ships have foundered. What have we to do in
        such a sea—with our frail skiffs?
        <p align="justify">
          The dispute concerning the eternal sonship of our Lord betrays more of
          <i>presumptuous curiosity, </i>than of reverent faith. It is an
          attempt to <i>explain</i>—where it is far better to <i>adore</i>. The
          controversy is one of the most unprofitable which ever engaged the
          pens of theologians.

        enemies are his inheritance. To their face he declares this decree, and
        "Lo! here", cries the Anointed One, as he holds aloft in that once
        pierced hand the scepter of his power, "He has given me this, not only
        the right to be a king—but the power to conquer."

          As the portrait painter looks on the person whose picture he would
          take, and draws his lines to answer him with the nearest similitude
          that he can, so God looks on Christ as the archetype to which he will
          conform the saint, in suffering, in grace, in glory; yet so that
          Christ has the preeminence in all. Every saint must <b>suffer</b>,
          because Christ suffered: Christ must not have a delicate body under a
          crucified head; yet never any suffered, or could suffer, what he
          endured. Christ is <b>holy</b>, and therefore so shall every saint
          be—but in an inferior degree; an image cut in clay cannot be so exact
          as that engraved on gold. Now, our conformity to Christ appears, that
          as the promises made to him were performed upon his prayers to his
          Father, his promises made to his saints are given to them in the same
          way of prayer: <font color="#818100">Ask of me, </font>says God to his
          Son, <font color="#818100">and I shall give you. </font>And the
          apostle tells us, "You have not, because you ask not." God has
          promised support to Christ in all his conflicts. Isa 42:1. "Behold my
          servant, whom I uphold;" yet he prayed "with strong cries and tears,"
          when his feet stood within the shadow of death. A seed is promised to
          him, and victory over his enemies, yet for both these he prays. Christ
          toward us acts as a <i>king</i>—but toward his Father as a
          <i>priest</i>. All he speaks to God is by prayer and intercession. So
          the saints, the promise makes them kings over their lusts, conquerors
          over their enemies; but it makes them priests toward God, by prayer
          humbly to sue out these great things given in the promise.

        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The <font color="#818100">rod </font>has a variety of meanings in
          Scripture. It might be of different materials, as it was employed for
          different purposes. At an early period, a <i>wooden </i>rod came into
          use as one of the insignia of royalty, under the name of scepter. By
          degrees the scepter grew in importance, and was regarded as
          characteristic of an empire, or of the reign of some particular king.
          A <i> golden </i>scepter denoted wealth and pomp. The
          <i>straight </i>scepter, of which we read in Psalm 45:6, is expressive
          of the justice and uprightness, the truth and equity, which shall
          distinguish Messiah's reign, after his kingdom on earth has been
          established. But when it is said in Re 19:15, that he, "whose name is
          called the Word of God," will smite the nations, and "rule them with a
          rod of iron," if the rod signifies "his scepter," then the "iron" of
          which it is made must be designed to express the severity of the
          judgments which the omnipotent "King of kings" will inflict on all who
          resist his authority. But to me it appears doubtful whether the "rod
          of iron" symbolizes the royal scepter of the Son of God at his second
          advent. It is mentioned in connection with "a sharp sword," which
          leads me to prefer the opinion that it also ought to be regarded as a
          weapon of war; at all events, the "rod of iron" mentioned in the Psalm
          we are endeavoring to explain is evidently not the emblem of sovereign
          <i>power</i>, although represented as in the hands of a king—but an
          instrument of <i>correction </i> and <i>punishment</i>. In this sense
          the word "rod" is often used.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When the correcting rod, is represented as in this second Psalm, to be
          of "iron," it only indicates how weighty, how severe, how effectual
          the threatened chastisement will be—it will not merely bruise—but it
          will break.
          <font color="#818100">You shall break them with a rod of iron.</font>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Now it is just such a complete breaking as would not readily be
          effected excepting by <i>an iron rod, </i>that is more fully expressed
          in the following clause of the verse, "You shall dash them in pieces
          like pottery." The completeness of the destruction, however, depends
          on two things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Even an iron rod, if gently used, or used against a hard and firm
          substance, might cause little injury; but, in the case before us, it
          is supposed to be applied with great force, "You shall
          <font color="#818100">dash </font>them;" and it is applied to what
          will prove as brittle and frangible as pottery, "You shall dash them
          <font color="#818100">in pieces</font>." Here, as in other respects,
          we must feel that the predictions and promises of this Psalm were but
          very partially fulfilled in the history of the literal David. Their
          real accomplishment, their solemn completion, abides the day when the
          spiritual David shall come in glory and in majesty as Zion's King,
          with a rod of iron to dash in pieces the great anti-Christian
          confederacy of kings and peoples, and to take possession of his long
          promised and dearly purchased inheritance. And the signs of the times
          seem to indicate that the coming of the Lord draws near.

        Jesus—and how dreadful is the folly of those who continue to be his
        enemies!
        <p align="justify">
          As Jesus is King of kings and Judge of judges, so the gospel is the
          teacher of the greatest and wisest. If any are so great as to spurn
          its admonitions, God will make little of them; and if they are so wise
          as to despise its teachings, their fancied wisdom shall make fools of
          them. The gospel takes a high tone before the rulers of the earth, and
          they who preach it should, like Knox and Melvill, magnify their office
          by bold rebukes and manly utterances even in the royal presence. A
          clerical sycophant is only fit to be a scullion in the devil's

          The first Psalm was a contrast between the righteous man—and the lost
          sinner; the second Psalm is a contrast between the tumultuous
          disobedience of the ungodly world—and the sure exaltation of the
          righteous Son of God. In the first Psalm, we saw the wicked driven
          away like chaff; in the second Psalm we see them broken in pieces like
          a potter's vessel. In the first Psalm, we beheld the righteous like a
          tree planted by the rivers of water; and here, we contemplate Christ
          the Covenant Head of the righteous, made better than a tree planted by
          the rivers of water, for <i>he </i>is made king of all the islands,
          and all the heathen bow before him and kiss the dust; while he himself
          gives a blessing to all those who put their trust in him. The two
          Psalms are worthy of the very deepest attention; they are, in fact,
          the preface to the entire Book of Psalms, and were by some of the
          ancients, joined into one.

        <p align="justify">
          They are, however, two Psalms; for Paul speaks of this as the second
          Psalm (Acts 13:33). The first shows us the character and lot of the
          righteous; and the next teaches us that the Psalms are Messianic, and
          speak of Christ the Messiah—the Prince who shall reign from the river
          even unto the ends of the earth. That they have both a far reaching
          prophetic outlook we are well assured—but we do not feel competent to
          open up that matter, and must leave it to abler hands.

          Then let us consider and magnify the goodness of God, who has brought
          us into this distance, that we may <i>kiss the Son</i>, that the
          expressing of this love lies in our hands, and that, whereas the love
          of the church, in the Old Testament, even in the Canticle, went no

        God inflicts such punishments as a king justly incensed would do, then
        God is thus angry. Now here, our case is heavier; it is not this great,
        and almighty, and majestic God, that may be angry—that is bad enough;
        but even the <i>Son</i>, whom we must <i>kiss</i>, may be angry.

        >To make peace with the Father—kiss the Son. "Let him kiss me," was the
        church's prayer. Song 1:2. Let us kiss him—that is our endeavor. Indeed,
        the Son must first kiss us by his mercy—before we can kiss him by our
        piety. Lord, grant in these mutual kisses and interchangeable embraces
        now, that we may come to the wedding supper hereafter; when the choir of
        heaven, even the voices of angels, shall sing nuptial songs, at the
        wedding of the spouse of the Lamb. <i>Thomas Adams. </i
