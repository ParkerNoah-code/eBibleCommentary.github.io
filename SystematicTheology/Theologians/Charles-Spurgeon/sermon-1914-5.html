          |Without shedding of blood there is no remission.| -- Hebrews 9:22.
        </p>
        <p>
          EVERYWHERE under the old figurative dispensation, blood was sure to
          greet your eyes. It was the one most prominent thing under the Jewish
          economy, scarcely a ceremony was observed without it. You could not
          enter into any part of the tabernacle, but you saw traces of the
          blood-sprinkling. Sometimes there were bowls of blood cast at the foot
          of the altar. The place looked so like a shambles, that to visit it
          must have been far from attractive to the natural taste, and to
          delight in it, a man had need of a spiritual understanding and a
          lively faith. The slaughter of animals was the manner of worship; the
          effusion of blood was the appointed rite, and the diffusion of that
          blood on the floor, on the curtains, and on the vestments of the
          priests, was the constant memorial. When Paul says that almost all
          things were, under the law, purged with blood, he alludes to a few
          things that were exempted. Thus you will find in several passages the
          people were exhorted to wash their clothes, and certain persons who
          had been unclean from physical causes were bidden to wash their
          clothes with water. Garments worn by men were usually cleansed with
          water. After the defeat of the Midianites, of which you read in the
          book of Numbers, the spoil, which had been polluted, had to be
          purified before it was claimed by the victorious Israelites. According
          to the ordinance of the law, which the Lord commanded Moses, some of
          the goods, such as raiment and articles made of skins or goat's hair,
          were purified with water, while other things that were of metal that
          could abide the fire, were purified by fire. Still, the apostle refers
          to a literal fact, when he says that almost all things, garments being
          the only exception, were purged, under the law, with blood. Then he
          refers to it as a general truth, under the old legal dispensation,
          that there was never any pardoning of sin, except by blood. In one
          case only was there an apparent exception, and even that goes to prove
          the universality of the rule, because the reason for the exception is
          so fully given. The trespass offering, referred to as an alternative,
          in Leviticus 5:11, might, in extreme cases of excessive poverty, be a
          bloodless offering. If a man was too poor to bring an offering from
          the flock, he was to bring two turtle-doves or young pigeons; but if
          he was too poor even for that, he might offer the tenth part of an
          ephah of fine flour for a sin offering, without oil or frankincense,
          and it was cast upon the fire. That is the one solitary exception
          through all the types. In every place, at every time, in every
          instance where sin had to be removed, blood must flow, life must be
          given. The one exception we have noticed gives emphasis to the statute
          that, |without shedding of blood, there is no remission.| Under the
          gospel there is no exception, not such an isolated one as there was
          under the law; no, not even for the extremely poor. Such we all are
          spiritually. Since we have not any of us to bring an offering, any
          more than an offering to bring; but we have all of us to take the
          offering which has already been presented, and to accept the sacrifice
          which Christ has, of himself, made in our stead; there is now no cause
          or ground for exemption to any man or woman born, nor ever shall there
          be, either in this world or in that which is to come, -- |Without
          shedding of blood, there is no remission.| With great simplicity,
          then, as it concerns our salvation, may I ask the attention of each
          one here present, to this great matter which intimately concerns our
          everlasting interests? I gather from the text, first of all, the
          encouraging fact that: --
        </p>
        <p>
          I. THERE IS SUCH A THING AS REMISSION -- that is to say, the remission
          of sins. |Without shedding of blood there is no remission.| Blood has
          been shed, and there is, therefore, hope concerning such a thing.
          Remission, notwithstanding the stern requirements of the law, is not
          to be abandoned in sheer despair. The word remission means the putting
          away of debts. Just as sin may be regarded as a debt incurred to God,
          so that debt may be blotted out, cancelled, and obliterated. The
          sinner, God's debtor, may cease to be in debt by compensation, by full
          acquittance, and may be set free by virtue of such remission. Such a
          thing is possible. Glory be to God, the remission of all sin, of which
          it is possible to repent, is possible to be obtained. Whatever the
          transgression of any man may be, pardon is possible to him if
          repentance be possible to him. Unrepented sin is unforgivable sin. If
          he confess his sin and forsake it, then shall he find mercy. God hath
          so declared it, and he will not be unfaithful to his word. |But is
          there not,| saith one, |a sin which is unto death?| Yea, verily,
          though I know not what it is; nor do we think that any who have
          enquired into the subject have been able to discover what that sin is;
          this much seems clear, that practically the sin is unforgivable
          because it is never repented of. The man who commits it becomes, to
          all intents and purposes, dead in sin in a more deep and lasting sense
          even than the human race is as a whole, and he is given up
          case-hardened -- his conscience seared, as it were, with a hot iron,
          and henceforth he will seek no mercy. But all manner of sin and
          blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men. For lust, for robbery, for
          adultery -- yea, for murder, there is forgiveness with God, that he
          may be feared. He is the Lord God, merciful and gracious, passing by
          transgression, iniquity, and sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this forgiveness which is possible is, according to the
          Scriptures, complete; that is to say, when God forgives a man his sin,
          he does it outright. He blots out the debt without any back reckoning.
          He does not put away a part of the man's sin, and have him accountable
          for the rest; but in the moment in which a sin is forgiven, his
          iniquity is as though it had never been committed; he is received in
          the Father's house and embraced with the Father's love as if he had
          never erred; he is made to stand before God as accepted, and in the
          same condition as though he had never transgressed. Blessed be God,
          believer, there is no sin in God's Book against thee. If thou hast
          believed, thou art forgiven -- forgiven not partially, but altogether.
          The handwriting that was against thee is blotted out, nailed to the
          cross of Christ, and can never be pleaded against thee any more for
          ever. The pardon is complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, this is a present pardon. It is an imagination of some (very
          derogatory to the gospel) that you cannot get pardon till you come to
          die, and, perhaps, then in some mysterious way, in the last few
          minutes, you may be absolved; but we preach to you, in the name of
          Jesus, immediate and present pardon for all transgressions -- a pardon
          given in an instant -- the moment that a sinner believes in Jesus; not
          as though a disease were healed gradually and required months and long
          years of progress. True, the corruption of our nature is such a
          disease, and the sin that dwelleth in us must be daily and hourly
          mortified; but as for the guilt of our transgressions before God, and
          the debt incurred to his justice, the remission thereof is not a thing
          of progress and degree. The pardon of a sinner is granted at once; it
          will be given to any of you tonight who accept it -- yea, and given
          you in such a way that you shall never lose it. Once forgiven, you
          shall be forgiven for ever, and none of the consequences of sin shall
          be visited upon you. You shall be absolved unreservedly and eternally,
          so that when the heavens are on a blaze, and the great white throne is
          set up, and the last great assize is held, you may stand boldly before
          the judgment-seat and fear no accusation, for the forgiveness which
          God himself vouchsafes he will never revoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will add to this one other remark. The man who gets this pardon may
          know he has it. Did he merely hope he had it, that hope might often
          struggle with fear. Did he merely trust he had it, many a qualm might
          startle him; but to know that he has it is a sure ground of peace to
          the heart. Glory be to God, the privileges of the covenant of grace
          are not only matters of hope and surmise, but they are matters of
          faith, conviction, and assurance. Count it not presumption for a man
          to believe God's Word. God's own Word it is that says, |Whosoever
          believeth in Jesus Christ is not condemned.| If I believe in Jesus
          Christ, then I am not condemned. What right have I to think I am? If
          God says I am not, it would be presumption on my part to think I am
          condemned. It cannot be presumption to take God's Word just as he
          gives it to me. |Oh!| saith one, |how happy should I be if this might
          be my case.| Thou hast well spoken, for blessed is he whose
          transgression is forgiven, and whose sin is covered. Blessed is the
          man to whom the Lord doth not impute iniquity. |But,| saith another,
          |I should hardly think such a great thing could be possible to such an
          one as I am.| Thou reasonest after the manner of the sons of men. Know
          then that as high as the heavens are above the earth, so high are
          God's ways above your ways, and his thoughts above your thoughts. It
          is yours to err; it is God's to forgive. You err like a man, but God
          does not pardon like a man; he pardons like a God, so that we burst
          forth with wonder, and sing, |Who is a God like unto thee, that
          passeth by transgression, iniquity, and sin?| When you make anything,
          it is some little work suitable to your abilities, but our God made
          the heavens. When you forgive, it is some forgiveness suitable to your
          nature and circumstances; but when he forgives, he displays the riches
          of his grace on a grander scale than your finite mind can comprehend.
          Ten thousand sins of blackest dye, sins of a hellish hue he doth in a
          moment put away, for he delighteth in mercy; and judgment is his
          strange work. |As I live, saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the
          death of him that dieth, but had rather that he turn unto me and
          live.| This is a joyful note with which my text furnishes me. There is
          no remission, except with blood; but there is remission, for the blood
          has been shed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coming more closely to the text, we have now to insist on its great
          lesson, that: --
        </p>
        <p>II. THOUGH THERE BE PARDON OF SIN, IT IS NEVER WITHOUT BLOOD.</p>
        <p>
          That is a sweeping sentence, for there are some in this world that are
          trusting for the pardon of sin to their repentance. It, beyond
          question, is your duty to repent of your sin. If you have disobeyed
          God, you should be sorry for it. To cease from sin is but the duty of
          the creature, else sin is not the violation of God's holy law. But be
          it known unto you, that all the repentance in the world cannot blot
          out the smallest sin. If you had only one sinful thought cross your
          mind, and you should grieve over that all the days of your life, yet
          the stain of that sin could not be removed even by the anguish it cost
          you. Where repentance is the work of the Spirit of God, it is a very
          precious gift, and is a sign of grace; but there is no atoning power
          in repentance. In a sea full of penitential tears, there is not the
          power or the virtue to wash out one spot of this hideous uncleanness.
          Without the blood-shedding, there is no remission. But others suppose
          that, at any rate, active reformation growing out of repentance may
          achieve the task. What if drunkenness be given up, and temperance
          become the rule? What if licentiousness be abandoned, and chastity
          adorn the character? What if dishonest dealing be relinquished, and
          integrity be scrupulously maintained in every action? I say, 'tis
          well; I would to God such reformations took place everywhere -- yet
          for all that, debts already incurred are not paid by our not getting
          into debt further, and past delinquencies are not condoned by future
          good behaviour. So sin is not remitted by reformation. Though you
          should suddenly become immaculate as angels (not that such a thing is
          possible to you, for the Ethiopian cannot change his skin, nor the
          leopard his spots), your reformations could make no atonement to God
          for the sins that are past in the days that you have transgressed
          against him. |What then,| saith the man, |shall I do?| There are those
          who think that now their prayers and their humblings of soul may,
          perhaps, effect something for them. Your prayers, if they be sincere,
          I would not stay; rather do I hope they may be such prayers as betoken
          spiritual life. But oh! dear hearer, there is no efficacy in prayer to
          blot out sin. I will put it strongly. All the prayers of all the
          saints on earth, and, if the saints in heaven could all join, all
          their prayers could not blot out through their own natural efficacy
          the sin of a single evil word. No, there is no deterrent power in
          prayer. God has never set it to be a cleanser. It has its uses, and
          its valuable uses. It is one of the privileges of the man who prays,
          that he prays acceptably, but prayer itself can never blot out the sin
          without the blood. |Without the shedding of blood there is no
          remission,| pray as you may.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are persons who have thought that self-denial and mortifications
          of an extraordinary kind might rid them of their guilt. We do not
          often come across such people in our circle, yet there be those who,
          in order to purge themselves of sin, flagellate their bodies, observe
          protracted fasts, wear sackcloth and hair shirts next to their skin,
          and even some have gone so far as to imagine that to refrain from
          ablutions, and to allow their body to be filthy, was the readiest mode
          of purifying their soul. A strange infatuation certainly! Yet today,
          in Hindostan, you shall find the fakir passing his body through
          marvellous sufferings and distortions, in the hope of getting rid of
          sin. To what purpose is it all? Methinks I hear the Lord say, |What is
          this to me that thou didst bow thy head like a bulrush, and wrapt
          thyself in sackcloth, and eat ashes with thy bread, and mingle
          wormwood with thy drink? Thou hast broken my law; these things cannot
          repair it; thou hast done injury to my honour by thy sin; but where is
          the righteousness that reflects honour upon my name?| The old cry in
          the olden days was, |Wherewithal shall we come before God?| and they
          said, |Shall we give our firstborn for our transgression, the fruit of
          our body for the sin of our soul?| Alas! it was all in vain. Here
          stands the sentence. Here for ever must it stand, |Without shedding of
          blood there is no remission.| It is the life God demands as the
          penalty due for sin, and nothing but the life indicated in the
          blood-shedding will ever satisfy him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, again, how this sweeping text puts away all confidence in
          ceremony, even the ceremonies of God's own ordinance. There are some
          who suppose that sin can be washed away in baptism. Ah! futile fancy!
          The expression where it is once used in Scripture implies nothing of
          the kind -- it has no such meaning as some attach to it, for that very
          apostle, of whom it was said, gloried that he had not baptized many
          persons lest they should suppose there was some efficacy in his
          administration of the rite. Baptism is an admirable ordinance, in
          which the believer holds fellowship with Christ in his death. It is a
          symbol; it is nothing more. Tens of thousands and millions have been
          baptized and have died in their sins. Or what profit is there in the
          unbloody sacrifice of the Mass, as Antichrist puts it? Do any say it
          is |an unbloody sacrifice,| yet at the same time offer it for a
          propitiation for sin -- we fling this text in their faces, |Without
          shedding of blood there is no remission.| Do they reply that the blood
          is there in the body of Christ? We answer that even were it so, that
          would not meet the case, for it is without the shedding of blood --
          without the blood-shedding; the blood as distinct from the flesh;
          without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here I must pass on to make a distinction that will go deeper
          still. Jesus Christ himself cannot save us, apart from his blood. It
          is a supposition which only folly has ever made, but we must refute
          even the hypothesis of folly, when it affirms that the example of
          Christ can put away human sin, that the holy life of Jesus Christ has
          put the race on such a good footing with God that now he can forgive
          its faults and its transgression. Not so; not the holiness of Jesus,
          not the life of Jesus, not the death of Jesus, but the blood of Jesus
          only; for |Without shedding of blood there is no remission.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And I have met with some who think so much of the second coming of
          Christ, that they seem to have fixed their entire faith upon Christ in
          his glory. I believe this to be the fault of Irvingism -- that, too
          much it holds before the sinner's eye Christ on the throne, whereas,
          though Christ on the throne is ever the loved and adorable, yet we
          must see Christ upon the cross, or we never can be saved. Thy faith
          must not be placed merely in Christ glorified, but in Christ
          crucified. |God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our
          Lord Jesus Christ.| |We preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a
          stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness.| I remember one person
          who was united with this church (the dear sister may be present now),
          that had been for some years a professor, and had never enjoyed peace
          with God, nor produced any of the fruits of the Spirit. She said, |I
          have been in a church where I was taught to rest upon Christ
          glorified, and I did so fix my confidence, such as it was, upon him,
          that I neither had a sense of sin, nor a sense of pardon, from Christ
          crucified! I did not know, and until I had seen him as shedding his
          blood and making a propitiation, I never entered into rest.| Yes, we
          will say it again, for the text is vitally important: |Without the
          shedding of blood, there is no remission,| not even with Christ
          himself. It is the sacrifice that he has offered for us, that is the
          means of putting away our sin -- this, and nothing else. Let us pass
          on a little further with the same truth: --
        </p>
        <p>
          III. THIS REMISSION OF SIN IS TO BE FOUND AT THE FOOT OF THE CROSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is remission to be had through Jesus Christ, whose blood was
          shed. The hymn we sang at the commencement of the service gave you the
          marrow of the doctrine. We owe to God a debt of punishment for sin.
          Was that debt due or not? If the law was right, the penalty ought to
          be exacted. If the penalty was too severe, and the law inaccurate,
          then God made a mistake. But it is blasphemy to suppose that. The law,
          then, being a righteous law, and the penalty just, shall God do an
          unjust thing? It will be an unjust thing for him not to carry out the
          penalty. Would you have him to be unjust? He had declared that the
          soul that sinned should die; would you have God to be a liar? Shall he
          eat his words to save his creatures? |Let God be true, and every man a
          liar.| The law's sentence must be carried out. It was inevitable that
          if God maintained the prerogative of his holiness, he must punish the
          sins that men have committed. How, then, should he save us? Behold the
          plan! His dear Son, the Lord of glory, takes upon himself human
          nature, comes into the place of as many as the Father gave him, stands
          in their standing, and when the sentence of justice has been
          proclaimed, and the sword of vengeance has leaped out of its scabbard,
          behold the glorious Substitute bares his arm, and he says, |Strike, O
          sword, but strike me, and let my people go.| Into the very soul of
          Jesus the sword of the law pierced, and his blood was shed, the blood,
          not of one who was man only, but of One who, by his being an eternal
          Spirit was able to offer up himself without spot unto God, in a way
          which gave infinite efficacy to his sufferings. He, through the
          eternal Spirit, we are told, offered himself without spot to God.
          Being in his own nature infinitely beyond the nature of man,
          comprehending all the natures of man, as it were, within himself, by
          reason of the majesty of his person, he was able to offer an atonement
          to God of infinite, boundless, inconceivable sufficiency.

          What our Lord suffered none of us can tell. I am sure of this: I would
          not disparage or under-estimate his physical sufferings -- the
          tortures he endured in his body -- but I am equally sure that we can
          none of us exaggerate or over-value the sufferings of such a soul as
          his; they are beyond all conception. So pure and so perfect, so
          exquisitely sensitive, and so immaculately holy was he, that to be
          numbered with transgressors, to be smitten by his Father, to die
          (shall I say it?) the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of
          strangers, was the very essence of bitterness, the consummation of
          anguish. |Yet it pleased the Father to bruise him; he hath put him to
          grief.| His sorrows in themselves were what the Greek liturgy well
          calls them, |unknown sufferings, great griefs.| Hence, too, their
          efficacy is boundless, without limit. Now, therefore, God is able to
          forgive sin. He has punished the sin on Christ; it becomes justice, as
          well as mercy, that God should blot out those debts which have been
          paid. It were unjust -- I speak with reverence, but yet with holy
          boldness -- it were unjust on the part of the infinite Majesty, to lay
          to my charge a single sin which was laid to the charge of my
          Substitute. If my Surety took my sin, he released me, and I am clear.
          Who shall resuscitate judgment against me when I have been condemned
          in the person of my Saviour? Who shall commit me to the flames of
          Gehenna, when Christ, my Substitute, has suffered the tantamount of
          hell for me? Who shall lay anything to my charge when Christ has had
          all my crimes laid to his charge, answered for them, expiated them,
          and received the token of quittance from them, in that he was raised
          from the dead that he might openly vindicate that justification in
          which by grace I am called and privileged to share? This is all very
          simple, it lies in a nutshell, but do we all receive it -- have we all
          accepted it? Oh! my dear hearers, the text is full of warning to some
          of you. You may have an amiable disposition, an excellent character, a
          serious turn of mind, but you scruple at accepting Christ; you stumble
          at this stumbling-stone; you split on this rock. How can I meet your
          hapless case? I shall not reason with you. I forbear to enter into any
          argument. I ask you one question. Do you believe this Bible to be
          inspired of God? Look, then, at that passage, |Without the shedding of
          blood there is no remission.| What say you? Is it not plain, absolute,
          conclusive? Allow me to draw the inference. If you have not an
          interest in the blood-shedding, which I have briefly endeavoured to
          describe, is there any remission for you? Can there be? Your own sins
          are on your head now. Of your hand shall they be demanded at the
          coming of the great Judge. You may labour, you may toil, you may be
          sincere in your convictions, and quiet in your conscience, or you may
          be tossed about with your scruples; but as the Lord liveth, there is
          no pardon for you, except through this shedding of blood. Do you
          reject it? On your own head will lie the peril! God has spoken. It
          cannot be said that your ruin is designed by him when your own remedy
          is revealed by him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He bids you take the way which he appoints, and if you reject it, you
          must die. Your death is suicide, be it deliberate, accidental, or
          through error of judgment. Your blood be on your own head. You are
          warned.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, what a far-reaching consolation the text gives us!
          |Without shedding of blood there is no remission,| but where there is
          the blood-shedding, there is remission. If thou hast come to Christ,
          thou art saved. If thou canst say from thy very heart: --
        </p>
        <p>|My faith doth lay her hand</p>
        <p>On that dear head of thine,</p>
        <p>While like a penitent I stand,</p>
        <p>And here confess my sin.|</p>
        <p>
          Then, your sin is gone. Where is that young man? where is that young
          woman? where are those anxious hearts that have been saying, |We would
          be pardoned now|? Oh! look, look, look, look to the crucified Saviour,
          and you are pardoned. Ye may go your way, inasmuch as you have
          accepted God's atonement. Daughter, be of good cheer, thy sins, which
          are many, are forgiven thee. Son, rejoice, for thy transgressions are
          blotted out.
        </p>
        <p>
          My last word shall be this. You that are teachers of others and trying
          to do good, cleave fast to this doctrine. Let this be the front, the
          centre, the pith, and the marrow of all you have to testify. I often
          preach it, but there is never a Sabbath in which I go to my bed with
          such inward content as when I have preached the substitutionary
          sacrifice of Christ. Then I feel, |If sinners are lost, I have none of
          their blood upon me.| This is the soul-saving doctrine; grip it, and
          you shall have laid hold of eternal life; reject it, and you reject it
          to your confusion. Oh! keep to this. Martin Luther used to say that
          every sermon ought to have the doctrine of justification by faith in
          it. True; but let it have the doctrine of atonement in it. He says he
          could not get the doctrine of justification by faith in to the
          Wurtembergers' heads, and he felt half inclined to take the book into
          the pulpit and fling it at their heads, in order to get it in. I am
          afraid he would not have succeeded if he had. But oh! how would I try
          to hammer again, and again, and again upon this one nail, |The blood
          is the life thereof.| |When I see the blood, I will pass over you.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ giving up his life in pouring out his blood -- it is this that
          gives pardon and peace to every one of you, if you will but look to
          him -- pardon now, complete pardon; pardon for ever. Look away from
          all other confidences, and rely upon the sufferings and the death of
          the Incarnate God, who has gone into the heavens, and who lives today
          to plead before his Father's throne, the merit of the blood which, on
          Calvary, he poured forth for sinners. As I shall meet you all in that
          great day, when the crucified One shall come as the King and Lord of
          all, which day is hastening on apace, as I shall meet you then, I pray
          you bear me witness that I have striven to tell you in all simplicity
          what is the way of salvation; and if you reject it, do me this favour,
          to say that at least I have proffered to you in Jehovah's name this,
          his gospel, and have earnestly urged you to accept it, that you may be
          saved. But the rather I would God that I might meet you there, all
          covered in the one atonement, clothed in the one righteousness, and
          accepted in the one Saviour, and then together will we sing, |Worthy
          is the Lamb that was slain, and hath redeemed us to God by his blood
          to receive honour, and power, and dominion for ever and ever.| Amen.
