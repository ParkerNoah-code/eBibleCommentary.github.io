          1. These three kinds of existence, then, having, according to them,
          been now formed, -- one from the passion, which was matter; a second
          from the conversion, which was animal; and the third, that which she
          (Achamoth) herself brought forth, which was spiritual, -- she next
          addressed herself to the task of giving these form. But she could not
          succeed in doing this as respected the spiritual existence, because it
          was of the same nature with herself. She therefore applied herself to
          give form to the animal substance which had proceeded from her own
          conversion, and to bring forth to light the instructions of the
          Saviour. And they say she first formed out of animal substance him who
          is Father and King of all things, both of these which are of the same
          nature with himself, that is, animal substances, which they also call
          right-handed, and those which sprang from the passion, and from
          matter, which they call left-handed. For they affirm that he formed
          all the things which came into existence after him, being secretly
          impelled thereto by his mother. From this circumstance they style him
          Metropator, Apator, Demiurge, and Father, saying that he is Father of
          the substances on the right hand, that is, of the animal, but Demiurge
          of those on the left, that is, of the material, while he is at the
          same time the king of all. For they say that this Enthymesis, desirous
          of making all things to the honour of the Æons, formed images of them,
          or rather that the Saviour did so through her instrumentality. And
          she, in the image of the invisible Father, kept herself concealed from
          the Demiurge. But he was in the image of the only-begotten Son, and
          the angels and archangels created by him were in the image of the rest
          of the Æons.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. They affirm, therefore, that he was constituted the Father and God
          of everything outside of the Pleroma, being the creator of all animal
          and material substances. For he it was that discriminated these two
          kinds of existence hitherto confused, and made corporeal from
          incorporeal substances, fashioned things heavenly and earthly, and
          became the Framer (Demiurge) of things material and animal, of those
          on the right and those on the left, of the light and of the heavy, and
          of those tending upwards as well as of those tending downwards. He
          created also seven heavens, above which they say that he, the
          Demiurge, exists. And on this account they term him Hebdomas, and his
          mother Achamoth Ogdoads, preserving the number of the first-begotten
          and primary Ogdoad as the Pleroma. They affirm, moreover, that these
          seven heavens are intelligent, and speak of them as being angels,
          while they refer to the Demiurge himself as being an angel bearing a
          likeness to God; and in the same strain, they declare that Paradise,
          situated above the third heaven, is a fourth angel possessed of power,
          from whom Adam derived certain qualities while he conversed with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. They go on to say that the Demiurge imagined that he created all
          these things of himself, while he in reality made them in conjunction
          with the productive power of Achamoth. He formed the heavens, yet was
          ignorant of the heavens; he fashioned man, yet knew not man; he
          brought to light the earth, yet had no acquaintance with the earth;
          and, in like manner, they declare that he was ignorant of the forms of
          all that he made, and knew not even of the existence of his own
          mother, but imagined that he himself was all things. They further
          affirm that his mother originated this opinion in his mind, because
          she desired to bring him forth possessed of such a character that he
          should be the head and source of his own essence, and the absolute
          ruler over every kind of operation [that was afterwards attempted].
          This mother they also call Ogdoad, Sophia, Terra, Jerusalem, Holy
          Spirit, and, with a masculine reference, Lord. Her place of habitation
          is an intermediate one, above the Demiurge indeed, but below and
          outside of the Pleroma, even to the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. As, then, they represent all material substance to be formed from
          three passions, viz., fear, grief, and perplexity, the account they
          give is as follows: Animal substances originated from fear and from
          conversion; the Demiurge they also describe as owing his origin to
          conversion; but the existence of all the other animal substances they
          ascribe to fear, such as the souls of irrational animals, and of wild
          beasts, and men. And on this account, he (the Demiurge), being
          incapable of recognising any spiritual essences, imagined himself to
          be God alone, and declared through the prophets, "I am God, and
          besides me there is none else." They further teach that the spirits of
          wickedness derived their origin from grief. Hence the devil, whom they
          also call Cosmocrator (the ruler of the world), and the demons, and
          the angels, and every wicked spiritual being that exists, found the
          source of their existence. They represent the Demiurge as being the
          son of that mother of theirs (Achamoth), and Cosmocrator as the
          creature of the Demiurge. Cosmocrator has knowledge of what is above
          himself, because he is a spirit of wickedness; but the Demiurge is
          ignorant of such things, inasmuch as he is merely animal. Their mother
          dwells in that place which is above the heavens, that is, in the
          intermediate abode; the Demiurge in the heavenly place, that is, in
          the hebdomad; but the Cosmocrator in this our world. The corporeal
          elements of the world, again, sprang, as we before remarked, from
          bewilderment and perplexity, as from a more ignoble source. Thus the
          earth arose from her state of stupor; water from the agitation caused
          by her fear; air from the consolidation of her grief; while fire,
          producing death and corruption, was inherent in all these elements,
          even as they teach that ignorance also lay concealed in these three
          passions.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Having thus formed the world, he (the Demiurge) also created the
          earthy [part of] man, not taking him from this dry earth, but from an
          invisible substance consisting of fusible and fluid matter, and then
          afterwards, as they define the process, breathed into him the animal
          part of his nature. It was this latter which was created after his
          image and likeness. The material part, indeed, was very near to God,
          so far as the image went, but not of the same substance with him. The
          animal, on the other hand, was so in respect to likeness; and hence
          his substance was called the spirit of life, because it took its rise
          from a spiritual outflowing. After all this, he was, they say,
          enveloped all round with a covering of skin; and by this they mean the
          outward sensitive flesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. But they further affirm that the Demiurge himself was ignorant of
          that offspring of his mother Achamoth, which she brought forth as a
          consequence of her contemplation of those angels who waited on the
          Saviour, and which was, like herself, of a spiritual nature. She took
          advantage of this ignorance to deposit it (her production) in him
          without his knowledge, in order that, being by his instrumentality
          infused into that animal soul proceeding from himself, and being thus
          carried as in a womb in this material body, while it gradually
          increased in strength, might in course of time become fitted for the
          reception of perfect rationality. Thus it came to pass, then,
          according to them, that, without any knowledge on the part of the
          Demiurge, the man formed by his inspiration was at the same time,
          through an unspeakable providence, rendered a spiritual man by the
          simultaneous inspiration received from Sophia. For, as he was ignorant
          of his mother, so neither did he recognise her offspring. This
          [offspring] they also declare to be the Ecclesia, an emblem of the
          Ecclesia which is above. This, then, is the kind of man whom they
          conceive of: he has his animal soul from the Demiurge, his body from
          the earth, his fleshy part from matter, and his spiritual man from the
          mother Achamoth.<br />
