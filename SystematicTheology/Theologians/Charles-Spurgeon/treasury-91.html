 </p>
</b></font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">SUBJECT AND DIVISION. </p>
<p align="justify">This Psalm is fragmentary, and the only division of any 
    service to us would be that suggested by Albert Barnes, viz.—A description 
    of the sick man's sufferings (Psalm 88:1-9), and a prayer for mercy and 
    deliverance (Psalm 88:10-18). We shall, however, consider each verse 
    separately, and so exhibit the better the incoherence of the author's grief. 
    The reader had better first peruse the Psalm as a whole.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. O Lord God of my salvation. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This is a hopeful title by which to address the Lord, and 
    it has about it the only ray of comfortable light which shines throughout 
    the Psalm. The writer has salvation, he is sure of that, and God is the sole 
    author of it. <i>While a man can see God as his Savior, it is not altogether 
    midnight with him.</i> While the living God can be spoken of as the life of 
    our salvation, our hope will not quite expire. <i>It is one of the 
    characteristics of true faith that she turns to Jehovah, the saving God, 
    when all other confidences have proved liars unto her. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">I have cried day and night before you. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">His distress had not blown out the sparks of his 
    prayer—but quickened them into a greater ardency, until they burned 
    perpetually like a furnace at full blast. His prayer was <i>personal</i>—whoever 
    had not prayed, he had done so; it was intensely <i>earnest</i>, so that it 
    was correctly described as a cry, such as children utter to move the pity of 
    their parents; and it was <i>unceasing</i>, neither the business of the day 
    nor the weariness of the night had silenced it: surely such entreaties could 
    not be in vain.</p>
<p align="justify">Perhaps, if Heman's pain had not been incessant, his 
    supplications might have been intermittent; it is a good thing that sickness 
    will not let us rest if we spend our restlessness in prayer.</p>
<p align="justify">Day and night are both suitable to prayer; it is no work 
    of darkness, therefore let us go with Daniel and pray when men can see us; 
    yet, since supplication needs no light, let us accompany Jacob and wrestle 
    at Jabbok until the day breaks.<i> Evil is transformed to good when it 
    drives us to prayer</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">One expression of the text is worthy of special note; 
    "before you" is a remarkable intimation that the Psalmist's cries had an aim 
    and a direction towards the Lord, and were <i>not the mere clamors of 
    nature—but the groanings of a gracious heart towards Jehovah</i>, the God of 
    salvation. Of what use are arrows shot into the air? The archer's business 
    is to look well at the mark he drives at. Prayers must be directed to Heaven 
    with earnest care. So thought Heman—his cries were all meant for the heart 
    of his God. He had no eye to onlookers as Pharisees have—but all his prayers 
    were before his God.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. Let my prayer come before you. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Admit it to an audience; let it speak with you. Though it 
    be my prayer, and therefore very imperfect—yet deny it not your gracious 
    consideration. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Incline your ear unto my cry. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It is not music save to the ear of mercy—yet be not vexed 
    with its discord, <i>though it be but a cry, for it is the most natural 
    expression of my soul's anguish</i>. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">When my heart speaks, let your ear hear.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">There may be obstacles which impede the upward flight of 
    our prayers—let us entreat the Lord to remove them; and as there may also be 
    offences which prevent the Lord from giving favorable regard to our 
    requests—let us implore him to put these out of the way. He who has prayed 
    day and night cannot bear to lose all his labor. Only those who are 
    indifferent in prayer will be indifferent about the outcome of prayer.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. For my soul is full of troubles. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">I am satiated and nauseated with them. Like a vessel full 
    to the brim with vinegar, my heart is filled up with adversity until it can 
    hold no more. He had his <i>house </i>full and his <i>hands </i>full of 
    sorrow; but, worse than that, he had his <i>heart </i>full of it.<i> Trouble 
    in the soul, is the soul of trouble</i>. A little soul trouble is painful; 
    what must it be to be satiated with it? And how much worse still to have 
    your prayers return empty when your soul remains full of grief. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And my life draws near unto the grave. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He felt as if he must die, indeed he thought himself half 
    dead already. All his life was going, his <i>spiritual </i>life declined, 
    his <i>mental </i>life decayed, his <i>bodily </i>life flickered; he was 
    nearer dead than alive. Some of us can enter into this experience, for many 
    a time have we traversed this valley of death-shade, yes and dwelt in it by 
    the month together. </p>
<p align="justify">Really to die and be with Christ will be a gala day's 
    enjoyment compared with our misery when a worse than physical death has cast 
    its dreadful shadow over us. Death would be welcomed as a relief by those 
    whose depressed spirits make their existence a living death. Are godly men 
    ever permitted to suffer thus? Indeed they are; and some of them are even 
    all their life time subject to bondage. </p>
<p align="justify">O Lord, Be pleased to set free your prisoners of hope! 
    Let, none of your mourners imagine that a strange thing has happened unto 
    him—but rather rejoice as he sees the footprints of brethren who have 
    trodden this desert before.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. I am counted with them that go down into the 
    pit. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">My weakness is so great that both by myself and others I 
    am considered as good as dead. If those about me have not ordered my coffin 
    they have at least conversed about my sepulcher, discussed my estate, and 
    reckoned their share of it.<i> Many a man has been buried before he was 
    dead, and the only mourning over him has been because he refused to fulfill 
    the greedy expectations of his hypocritical relatives by going down to the 
    pit at once</i>. It has come to this with some afflicted believers, that 
    their hungry heirs think they have lived too long.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">I am as a man who has no strength.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">I have but the name to live; my constitution is broken 
    up; I can scarce crawl about my sick room, my mind is even weaker than my 
    body, and my faith weakest of all. The sons and daughters of sorrow will 
    need but little explanation of these sentences, they are to such tried ones 
    as household words.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. I am set apart among the dead. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Unbound from all that links a man with life, familiar 
    with death's door, a freeman of the city of the sepulcher, I seem no more 
    one of earth's drudges—but begin to anticipate the rest of the tomb. It is a 
    sad case when our only hope lies in the direction of death, our only liberty 
    of spirit amid the congenial horrors of corruption. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Like the slain that lie in the grave, whom you remember 
    no more.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He felt as if he were as utterly forgotten as those whose 
    carcasses are left to rot on the battlefield. As when a soldier, mortally 
    wounded, bleeds unheeded amid the heaps of slain, and remains to his last 
    expiring groan unpitied and unsuccoured, so did Heman sigh out his soul in 
    loneliest sorrow, feeling as if even God himself had quite forgotten him.</p>
<p align="justify">How low the spirits of good and brave men will sometimes 
    sink. Under the influence of certain disorders everything will wear a somber 
    aspect, and the heart will dive into the profoundest deeps of misery. </p>
<p align="justify">It is all very well for those who are in robust health 
    and full of spirits to blame those whose lives are sicklied over with the 
    pale cast of melancholy—but the evil is as real as a gaping wound, and all 
    the more hard to bear because it lies so much in the region of the soul that 
    to the inexperienced it appears to be a mere matter of diseased imagination.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Reader, never ridicule the nervous and depressed, their 
    pain is real; though much of the evil lies in the imagination, it is not 
    imaginary. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And they are cut off from your hand. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Poor Heman felt as if God himself had put him away, 
    smitten him and laid him among the corpses of those executed by divine 
    justice. He mourned that the hand of the Lord had gone out against him, and 
    that lie was divided from the great author of his life. This is the essence 
    of wormwood. <i>Man's blows are trifles—but God's smitings are terrible to a 
    gracious heart. </i>To feel utterly forsaken of the Lord and cast away as 
    though hopelessly corrupt is the very climax of heart desolation.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. You have laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, 
    in the deeps.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">What a collection of forcible metaphors, each one 
    expressive of the utmost grief. Heman compared his forlorn condition to an 
    imprisonment in a subterranean dungeon, to confinement in the realms of the 
    dead, and to a plunge into the abyss. None of the similes are strained. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The mind can descend far lower than the body</p></i>, for it 
    has bottomless pits. The flesh can bear only a certain number of wounds and 
    no more—but <i>the soul can bleed in ten thousand ways, and die over and 
    over again each hour</i>. It is grievous to the good man to see the Lord 
    whom he loves laying him in the <i>sepulcher of despondency</i>; piling 
    nightshade upon him, putting out all his candles, and heaping over him solid 
    masses of sorrow. Evil from so good a hand seems evil indeed, and yet if 
    faith could but be allowed to speak she would remind the depressed spirit 
    that it is better to fall into the hand of the Lord than into the hands of 
    man, and moreover she would tell the despondent heart that God never placed 
    a <i>Joseph </i>in a pit without drawing him up again to fill a throne; that 
    he never caused a horror of great darkness to fall upon an <i>Abraham </i>
    without revealing his covenant to him; and never cast even a <i>Jonah </i>
    into the deeps without preparing the means to land him safely on dry land.
<p align="justify">Alas, when under <i>deep depression the mind </i>forgets 
    all this, and is only conscious of its unutterable misery; the man sees the
    <i>lion </i>but not the honey in its carcass, he feels the <i>thorns </i>but 
    he cannot smell the roses which adorn them. </p>
<p align="justify">He who now feebly expounds these words knows within 
    himself more than he would care or dare to tell of the abysses of inward 
    anguish. He has sailed round the <i>Cape of Storms</i>, and has drifted 
    along by the dreary <i>headlands of despair</i>. He has groaned out with one 
    of old, "My bones are pierced in me in the night season; and my sinews take 
    no rest. I go morning without the sun. Terrors are turned upon me, they 
    pursue my soul as the wind." </p>
<p align="justify">Those who know this bitterness by experience will 
    sympathize—but from others it would be idle to expect pity, nor would their 
    pity be worth the having if it could be obtained. It is an unspeakable 
    consolation that our Lord Jesus knows this experience right well, having, 
    with the exception of the sin of it, felt it all and more than all in 
    Gethsemane when he was exceeding sorrowful even unto death.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. Your wrath lies hard upon me. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Dreadful plight this, the worst in which a man can be 
    found. <i>Wrath </i>is heavy in itself; <i>God's </i>wrath is crushing 
    beyond conception, and when that presses hard the soul is oppressed indeed.<i> 
    The wrath of God is the very Hell of Hell</i>, and when it weighs upon the 
    conscience a man feels a torment such as only that of damned spirits can 
    exceed. Joy or peace, or even numbness of indifference, there can be none to 
    one who is loaded with this most tremendous of burdens. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And you have afflicted me with all your waves.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Or all your breakers. He pictures God's wrath as breaking 
    over him like those waves of the sea which swell, and rage, and dash with 
    fury upon the shore. How could his frail barque hope to survive those cruel 
    breakers, white like the hungry teeth of death. Seas of affliction seemed to 
    rush in upon him with all the force of omnipotence. He felt himself to be 
    oppressed and afflicted like Israel in Egypt, when they cried by reason of 
    their afflictions. It appeared impossible for him to suffer more, he had 
    exhausted the methods of adversity and endured all its waves. </p>
<p align="justify">So have we imagined, and yet it is not really quite so 
    bad.<i> The worst case might be worse, there are alleviations to every woe;
    </i>God has other and more terrible waves which, if he chose to let them 
    forth, would sweep us into the infernal abyss, whence hope has long since 
    been banished. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Selah. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">There was need to rest. Above the breakers the swimmer 
    lifts his head and looks around him, breathing for a moment, until the next 
    wave comes. Even lamentation must have its pauses. Nights are broken up into 
    watches, and even so mourning has its intervals. Such sorrowful music is a 
    great strain both on voices and instruments, and it is well to give the 
    singers the relief of silence for a while.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. You have put away my acquaintance far from me.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">If ever we need friends it is in the dreary hour of 
    despondency and the weary time of bodily sickness; therefore does the 
    sufferer complain because divine providence had removed his friends. </p>
<p align="justify">Perhaps his disease was infectious or defiling, so that 
    he was legally separated from his fellow men; perhaps their fears kept them 
    away from his plague stricken house, or else his good name had become so 
    injured that they naturally avoided him. <i>Most friends require but small 
    excuse for turning their backs on the afflicted</i>. The swallows offer no 
    apology for leaving us to winter by ourselves. Yet it is a piercing pain 
    which arises from the desertion of dear associates; it is a wound which 
    festers and refuses to be healed. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">You have made me an abomination unto them.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">They turned from him as though he had become loathsome 
    and contaminating, and this because of something which the Lord had done to 
    him; therefore, he brings his complaint to the prime mover in his trouble. 
    He who is still flattered by the companions of his pleasure can little guess 
    the wretchedness which will be his portion should he become poor, or 
    slanderously accused—for then one by one the parasites of his prosperity 
    will go their way and leave him to his fate, not without cutting remarks on 
    their part to increase his misery. </p>
<p align="justify">Men have not so much power to bless by friendship, as to 
    curse by treachery. <i>Earth's poisons are more deadly than her medicines 
    are healing. </i>The mass of men who gather around a man and flatter him are 
    like tame leopards; <i>when they lick his hand it is well for him to 
    remember that with equal gusto they would drink his blood</i>. "Cursed is he 
    who trusts in man." </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">I am shut up, and I cannot come forth. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He was a prisoner in his room, and felt like a leper in 
    the lazaretto, or a condemned criminal in his cell. His mind, too, was bound 
    as with fetters of iron; he felt no liberty of hope, he could take no 
    flights of joy. When God shuts friends out, and shuts us in to pine away 
    alone, it is no wonder if we water our couch with tears.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. my eye mourns by reason of affliction. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He wept his eyes out. He exhausted the lachrymal glands, 
    he wore away the sight itself. Tears in showers are a blessing, and work our 
    good; but in floods they become destructive and injurious. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Lord, I have called daily upon you.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">His tears wetted his prayers—but did not damp then 
    fervor. He prayed still, though no answer came to dry his eyes. <i>Nothing 
    can make a true believer cease praying; it is a part of his nature, and pray 
    he must. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">I have stretched out my hands unto you. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He used the appropriate posture of a supplicant, of his 
    own accord. Men need no posture maker, or master of the ceremonies, when 
    they are eagerly pleading for mercy, nature suggests to them attitudes both 
    natural and correct. <i>As a little child stretches out its hands to its 
    mother while it cries, so did this afflicted child of God. </i>He prayed all 
    over, his eyes wept, his voice cried, his hands were outstretched, and his 
    heart broken. This was prayer indeed.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. Will you show wonders to the dead? </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Why then allow me to die? While I live you can in me 
    display the glories of your grace—but when I have passed into the unknown 
    land, how can you illustrate in me your love? If I perish you will lose a 
    worshiper who both reverenced, and in his own experience illustrated, the 
    wonders of your character and acts. </p>
<p align="justify">This is good pleading, and therefore he repeats it. Shall 
    the dead arise and praise you? He is thinking only of the present, and not 
    of the last great day, and he urges that the Lord would have one the less to 
    praise him among the sons of men. Shadows take no part in the quires of the 
    Sabbath, ghosts sing no joyous Psalms, sepulchers and vaults send forth no 
    notes of thanksgiving. True the souls of departed saints render glory to 
    God—but the dejected Psalmist's thoughts do not mount to Heaven but survey 
    the gloomy grave: he stays on this side of eternity, where in the grave he 
    sees no wonders and hears no songs. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Selah. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">At the mouth of the tomb he sits down to meditate, and 
    then returns to his theme.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. Shall your loving-kindness be declared in the 
    grave? </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Your tender goodness—who shall testify concerning it in 
    that cold abode where the worm and corruption hold their riot? The living 
    may write "meditations among the Tombs"—but the dead know nothing, and 
    therefore can declare nothing.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Or your faithfulness in destruction? </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">If the Lord suffered his servant to die before the divine 
    promise was fulfilled, it would be quite impossible for his faithfulness to 
    be proclaimed. The poet is dealing with this life only, and looking at the 
    matter from the point of view afforded by time and the present race of men; 
    if a believer were deserted and permitted to die in despair, there could 
    come no voice from his grave to inform mankind that the Lord had rectified 
    his wrongs and relieved him of his trials; no songs would leap up from the 
    cold sod to hymn the truth and goodness of the Lord; but as far as men are 
    concerned, a voice which loved to magnify the grace of God would be 
    silenced, and a loving witness for the Lord removed from the sphere of 
    testimony.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. Shall your wonders be known in the dark? </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">If not here permitted to prove their goodness of Jehovah, 
    how could the singer do so in the land of darkness and death shade? Could 
    his tongue, when turned into a clod, charm the dull cold ear of death? Is 
    not a living dog better than a dead lion, and a living believer of more 
    value to the cause of God on earth than all the departed put together? </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">What shall be told concerning you in the regions of 
    oblivion? Where memory and love are lost, and men are alike unknowing and 
    unknown, forgetful and forgotten, what witness to the divine holiness can be 
    borne? The whole argument amounts to this—if the believer dies unblessed, 
    how will God's honor be preserved? Who will bear witness to his truth and 
    righteousness?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. But unto you have I cried, O LORD.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">I have continued to pray for help to you, O Jehovah, the 
    living God, even though you have so long delayed to answer. A true born 
    child of God may be known by his continuing to cry; a hypocrite is great at 
    a spurt—but the genuine believer holds on until he wins his suit. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And in the morning shall my prayer comes before you.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He meant to plead on yet, and to increase his 
    earnestness. He intended to be up early, to anticipate the day light, and 
    begin to pray before the sun was up. If the Lord is pleased to delay, he has 
    a right to do as he wills—but we must not therefore become tardy in 
    supplication. If we count the Lord slack concerning his promise we must only 
    be the more eager to outrun him, lest sinful sloth on our part should hinder 
    the blessing.</p>
<p align="justify">"Let prayer and holy hymn<br/>
    Perfume the morning air; <br/>
    Before the world with smoke is dim<br/>
    Bestir your soul to prayer."</p>
<p align="justify">"While flowers are wet with dew<br/>
    Lament your sins with tears,<br/>
    And before the sun shines forth anew<br/>
    Tell to your Lord your fears."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14. O LORD, why have you cast off my soul? </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Have you not aforetime chosen me, will you now reject me? 
    Shall your elect ones become your reprobates? Do you, like changeable men, 
    give a writing of divorcement to those whom your love has espoused? Can your 
    beloveds become your cast offs? Why hide you your face from me? Will you not 
    so much as look upon me? Can you not afford me a solitary smile? Why this 
    severity to one who has in brighter days basked in the light of your favor?
    </p>
<p align="justify">We may put these questions to the Lord, nay, we ought to 
    do so. It is not undue familiarity—but holy boldness. It may help us to 
    remove the evil which provokes the Lord to jealousy, if we seriously beg him 
    to show us why he contends with us. <i>He cannot act towards us in other 
    than a right and gracious manner, therefore for every stroke of his rod 
    there is a sufficient reason in the judgment of his loving heart; let us try 
    to learn that reason and profit by it.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 15. I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth 
    up. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">His affliction had now lasted so long that he could 
    hardly remember when it commenced; it seemed to him as if he had been at 
    death's door ever since he was a child. This was no doubt an exaggeration of 
    a depressed spirit, and yet perhaps Heman may have been born under the 
    cypress, and have been all his days afflicted with some chronic disease or 
    bodily infirmity. There are holy men and women whose lives are a long 
    apprenticeship to sickness, and these deserve both our sympathy and our 
    reverence—our reverence we have ventured to say, for since the Savior became 
    the acquaintance of grief, sorrow has become honorable in believers' eyes. A 
    life-long sickness may by divine grace prove to be a life-long blessing. <i>
    Better suffer from childhood to old age than to be let alone to find 
    pleasure in sin. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">While I suffer your terrors I am distracted. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Long use had not blunted the edge of sorrow, God's 
    terrors had not lost their terror; rather had they become more overwhelming 
    and had driven the man to despair. He was unable to collect his thoughts, he 
    was so tossed about that he could not judge and weigh his own condition in a 
    calm and rational manner. <i>Sickness alone will thus distract the mind; and 
    when a sense of divine anger is added thereto, it is not to be wondered at 
    if reason finds it hard to hold the reins</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">How near akin to madness soul depression sometimes may 
    be, it is not our province to decide; but we speak what we do know when we 
    say that a feather weight might be sufficient to turn the scale at times. 
    Thank God O tempted ones who yet retain your reason! Thank him that the 
    devil himself cannot add that feather while the Lord stands by to adjust all 
    things. </p>
<p align="justify">Even though we have grazed upon the rock of utter 
    distraction, we bless the infinitely gracious Steersman that the vessel is 
    seaworthy yet, and answers to her helm: tempest tossed from the hour of her 
    launch even to this hour—yet she mounts the waves and defies the hurricane.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 16. Your fierce wrath goes over me. </p>

<p align="justify">What an expression, "fierce wrath", and it is a man of 
    God who feels it! Do we seek an explanation? It seemed so to him—but "things 
    are not what they seem." <i>No punitive anger ever falls upon the saved one, 
    for Jesus shields him from it all; but a father's anger may fall upon his 
    dearest child, none the less but all the more, because he loves it. </i>
    Since Jesus bore my guilt as my substitute, my Judge cannot punish me—but my 
    Father can and will correct me. In this sense the Father may even manifest 
    "fierce wrath" to his erring child, and under a sense of it that dear broken 
    down one may be laid in the dust and covered with wretchedness, and yet for 
    all that he may be accepted and beloved of the Lord all the while. </p>
<p align="justify">Heman represents God's wrath as breaking over him as 
    waves over a wreck. Your terrors have cut me off. They have made me a marked 
    man, they have made me feel like a leper separated from the congregation of 
    your people, and they have caused others to look upon me as no better than 
    dead. Blessed be God this is the sufferer's idea and not the very truth, for 
    the Lord will neither cast off nor cut off his people—but will visit his 
    mourners with choice refreshments.</p>

<p align="justify">Verse 17. They came round about me daily like water. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">My troubles, and your chastisement poured in upon me, 
    penetrating everywhere, and drowning all. Such is the permeating and 
    pervading power of spiritual distress, there is no shutting it out; it soaks 
    into the soul like the dew into Gideon's fleece; it sucks the spirit down as 
    the quicksand swallows the ship; it overwhelms it as the deluge submerged 
    the green earth. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">They compassed me about together. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Griefs hemmed him in. He was like the deer in the hunt, 
    when the dogs are all around and at his throat. Poor soul! and yet he was a 
    man greatly beloved of Heaven!</p>

<p align="justify">Verse 18. Lover and friend have you put far from me.</p></b>

<p align="justify">Even when they are near me bodily, they are so unable to 
    swim with me in such deep waters, that they stand like men far away on the 
    shore while I am buffeted with the billows; but, alas, they shun me, the 
    dearest lover of all is afraid of such a distracted one, and those who took 
    counsel with me avoid me now! </p>
<p align="justify">The Lord Jesus knew the meaning of this in all its 
    wormwood and gall when in his passion. In dreadful loneliness he trod the 
    winepress, and all his garments were stained with the red blood of those 
    sour grapes. Lonely sorrow falls to the lot of not a few; let them not 
    repine—but enter herein into close communion with that dearest lover and 
    friend who is never far from his tried ones. </p>

<p align="justify">And my acquaintance into darkness</p></b>.
<p align="justify">Or better still, my acquaintance is darkness. I am 
    familiar only with sadness, all else has vanished. I am a child crying alone 
    in the dark. Will the heavenly Father leave his child there? Here he breaks 
    off, and anything more from us would only spoil the abruptness of the 
    unexpected FINIS. </p>
<p align="justify">(We have not attempted to interpret this Psalm concerning 
    our Lord—but we fully believe that where the members are, the Head is to be 
    seen preeminently. To have given a double exposition under each verse would 
    have been difficult and confusing; we have therefore left the Messianic 
    references to be pointed out in the Notes, where, if God the Holy Spirit be 
    pleased to illustrate the page, we have gathered up more than enough to lead 
    each devout reader to behold Jesus, the man of sorrows and the acquaintance 
    of grief.)</p>
