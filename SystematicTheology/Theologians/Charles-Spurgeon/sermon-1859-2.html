        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.226)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Evening, November 28th, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "The governor of the feast called the bridegroom, and saith unto him,
          every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have
          well drunk, then that which is worse; but thou hast kept the good wine
          until now." -- John 2:9-10.
        </p>
        <p>
          I HAD EXHAUSTED my time this morning by describing the feast of Satan
          -- how at the four tables, whereat did sit the profligate, the
          self-righteous, the worldly, and the secretly sinful, the course of
          Satan, was always on this wise, -- first, the good wine, and when men
          had well drunken, that which was worse. His feast diminished in its
          value as it proceeded, and went from the bright crackling of the thorn
          under the pot to the blackness of darkness for ever. I had then in my
          second point to show, that the rule of Christ's banquet is just the
          very reverse -- that Christ doth always give the best wine last --
          that he doth save the good things until the end of the feast; nay,
          that sometimes the first cups at the table of Christ are full of
          wormwood and gall, and are exceeding bitter, but that if we tarry at
          the feast, they will grow sweeter, and sweeter, and sweeter, until at
          last, when we shall come into the land Beulah, and especially when we
          shall enter into the city of our God, we shall be compelled to say,
          "Thou hast kept the good wine until now."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my dear friends, this is a great fact, that Christ's feast
          increaseth in sweetness. When first the lord Jesus Christ proclaimed a
          feast for the sons of men, the first cup he set upon the table was but
          a very little one, and it had in it but few words of consolation. You
          remember the inscription upon that ancient vessel, the first cup of
          consolation that was ever held to the sons of men -- "The seed of the
          woman shall bruise the serpent's head." There was to them but little
          sweetness there: much to us, because we can understand it better, and
          some to them, because God's Spirit might help them to understand it,
          but still in the revelation of it there seemed but little promise. As
          the world went on, there were greater cups of precious wine brought
          forth, whereof patriarchs and ancient saints did drink; but beloved,
          all the wine they ever had under the Old Testament dispensation was
          far behind that of which we drink. He that is least in the kingdom of
          heaven is more highly favoured than he who is chief under the Old
          Testament dispensation. Our fathers did eat manna, but we do eat the
          bread that came down from heaven; they did drink of water in the
          wilderness, but we drink of that living water whereof if a man drink
          he shall never thirst. It is true they had much sweetness; the cups of
          the ancient tabernacle had precious wine in them; there was in the
          outward symbol the sign and the shadow, much that was delightful to
          the faith of the true believer; but we must remember that we are
          drinking to-day of that wine which prophets and kings desired to drink
          of, but died without a taste thereof. They guessed its sweetness; they
          could by faith foresee what it would be; but lo! we are allowed to sit
          at the table and quaff full draughts of wines on the lees well
          refined, which God hath given to us in this mountain wherein he hath
          made a feast of fat things for all people.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, beloved, the text still stands true of us -- there is better wine
          to come. We are in our privileges superior to patriarchs, and kings,
          and prophets. God has given us a brighter and a clearer day than they
          had; theirs was but the twilight of the morning, compared with the
          noon-day which we enjoy. But think not that we are come to the best
          wine yet. There are more noble banquets for God's church; and who
          knoweth how long, ere the best of the precious wine shall be broached?
          Know ye not that the King of Heaven is coming again upon this earth;
          Jesus Christ, who came once and broached his heart for us on Calvary,
          is coming again, to flood the earth with glory. He came once with a
          sin-offering in his hand: behold, he comes no more with a
          sin-offering, but with the cup of salvation and of thanksgiving, to
          call upon the name of the Lord and joyously to take unto himself the
          throne of his father David. You and I, if we be alive and remain,
          shall yet set that cup to our lips; and if we die, we have this
          privilege, this happy consolation, that we shall not be behind hand,
          for "the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
          incorruptible," and we shall drink of that millennial wine which
          Christ our Saviour hath reserved to the last. Saints! ye cannot tell
          what golden goblets those are of which ye shall drink in the thousand
          years of the Redeemer's triumph. Ye cannot tell what wine, sparkling
          and red, that shall be, which shall come from the vintage of the hills
          of glory, when he whose garments are red with treading the wine-press,
          shall descend in the great day and stand upon the earth. Why, the very
          thought of this cheered Job. "I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that
          he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though after my
          skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God." Let
          this rejoice and cheer thee, Christian, that the good wine is kept
          even unto that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, having shown that this is the rule of Christ in the great
          dispensation which he uses to all his Church, I shall come to the
          subject of this evening, which is this: First, The fact that the
          believer shall find that Christ keeps for him the best wine till the
          last; secondly, The reason of Christ for so doing; and thirdly, The
          lesson which we ought to learn therefrom.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, THE FACT THAT CHRIST KEEPS HIS GOOD WINE TILL THE LAST. I
          was thinking as I rode here how very true this is of some of God's
          people. Why there are some of God's best beloved who have their names
          upon the breastplate of the great high priest, who are purchased with
          his blood, and are very dear to his soul, who have not known from
          their youth up what it is to get out of the depths of poverty. They
          have to live from hand to mouth, not knowing one day whence another
          meal shall come. How many more there are of God's people that are
          lying on beds of affliction. Some of the most precious of God's
          diamonds are lying on the dunghill of disease. Ye may go and climb to
          many a chamber where ye shall see the victims of all kinds of
          diseases, loathsome, protracted, and painful, and ye shall see God's
          dear ones languishing out a dying life. I might point you to others of
          God's servants, whose days are spent in toil. There is needed for the
          human body, and especially for the soul, a little rest and a little of
          the food of knowledge; but these have had so little instruction that
          they cannot get mental food ready for themselves; if they read they
          can scarce understand, and they have hard bondage in this life, which
          maketh their life bitter and hindereth them from knowledge. They have
          to work from morning to night, with scarce a moment's rest. Oh,
          beloved, will it not be true of them, when death shall give them their
          discharge, when they shall leave this world, which has been to them,
          with an emphasis, a vale of tears? Will not they have to say: "Thou
          hast kept the good wine until now?" Oh, what a change for her who has
          come limping along these many Sabbath days to the sanctuary! for
          there, she shall go no more up to the Lord's house limping and lame,
          but the "lame man shall leap like the hart," and like Miriam, she
          shall dance with the daughters of Israel. Ah, ye may have had to
          suffer sickness and sorrow and pain, blindness and deafness, and a
          thousand of this world's ills: what a change for you, when you find
          them all gone! No racking pains, no pining want, no anxious care. Ye
          shall not have to cry for the sunlight to penetrate your abodes, or
          weep because your sight is failing through incessant labour with that
          murderous needle; but ye shall see the light of God, brighter than the
          light of the sun, and ye shall rejoice in the beams that proceed from
          his countenance. Ye shall have no more infirmities; immortality shall
          have covered and swallowed them up; that which was sown in weakness
          shall be raised in power; that which was sown disordered, full of pain
          and sorrow, and disjointed and full of agony, shall be raised full of
          delectable delights, no wore capable of anguish, but quivering with
          joy and bliss unspeakable. Ye shall no more be poor; ye shall be rich,
          richer than the miser's dream. Ye shall no more have to labour; there
          shall ye rest upon your beds, each one of you walking in your
          uprightness. Ye shall no more suffer from neglect and scorn and
          ignominy and persecution; ye shall be glorified with Christ, in the
          day when he shall come to be admired of them that love him. What a
          change for such! The best wine indeed is kept to the last, in their
          case, for they have never had any good wine here, to the eyes of men,
          though secretly they have had many a drink from the bottle of Jesus.
          He has often put his cordial cup to their lips. They have been like
          the ewe lamb that belonged to the man in Nathan's parable: they have
          drunk out of Christ's own cup on the earth, but still even sweeter
          than that cup shall he the draught which they shall receive at the
          last.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, my dear friends, although I put these first, as especially
          feeling the change, because we can see the difference, yet will it be
          true of the most favoured of God's children, all of them shall say,
          "The best wine is kept till now." Of all the men whom I might envy, I
          think I should first of all envy the apostle Paul. What a man! How
          highly favoured! how greatly gifted! how much blessed! Ah, Paul, thou
          couldst talk of revelations and of visions from on high. He heard
          things which it was unlawful for a man to utter, and he saw that which
          few eyes have ever seen. He was caught up into the third heaven. What
          draughts of joy the apostle Paul must have had! what lookings into the
          deep things of God! what soarings into the heights of heaven! Perhaps
          there was never a man who was more favoured of God; to have his mind
          expanded, and then to have it filled full with the wisdom and the
          revelation of the knowledge of the Most High. But ask the apostle Paul
          whether he believes there is anything better to come, and he tells
          you, "Now we see through a glass darkly, but then shall we see face to
          face; now we know in part, hut then shall we know even as we are
          known." He was evidently expecting something more than he had
          received; and, beloved, he was not disappointed. There was a heaven as
          much above all the enjoyments of Paul, as the enjoyments of Paul were
          above the depressions of his spirit, when he said, "O wretched man
          that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" There
          are children of God who have all that they can need of this world's
          goods; they seem to be free from earthly care, and they have faith
          enough to trust their God with regard to the future. Their faith is
          firm and strong; they have much love to the Redeemer; they are engaged
          in some delightful work, and the Holy Spirit attends that work with
          great success. Their days follow steadily one after another, like the
          waves of the still calm sea. God is with them, and they are greatly
          blessed; they spread out their roots by the river, their leaf also
          doth not wither, and whatsoever they do, it prospereth; whichever way
          they turn their hand the Lord their God is with them, in whatsoever
          land they put their feet they are like Joshua, that land is given to
          them to be an inheritance to them for ever. But, beloved, even these
          shall see greater things than they have as yet heheld. High as their
          Master has taken them into the house of banqueting, lofty though the
          room be in which they now feast, the Master shall say to them, "Come
          up higher." They shall know more, enjoy more, feel more, do more,
          possess more. They shall be nearer to Christ ; they shall have richer
          enjoyments and sweeter employments than they have had; and they shall
          feel that their Master hath kept his good wine even until now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Entering into particulars for a moment, very briefly, I must just
          observe, that there are many aspects under which we may regard the
          heavenly state, and in each of these we shall have to say, that Christ
          hath kept the good wine until then. Here on earth the believer enters
          into rest by faith; the Christian enjoys rest even in the wilderness;
          the promise is fulfilled. "They shall dwell safely in the wilderness,
          and sleep in the woods." God giveth to his beloved sleep; there is a
          peace that passeth all understanding, which we may enjoy even in this
          land of turmoil, strife, and alarms, -- a peace which the worldling
          knoweth not of, nor can he guess it.
        </p>
        <p>"A holy calm within the heart,</p>
        <p>The pledge of glorious rest.</p>
        <p>Which for the church of God remains,</p>
        <p>The end of cares, the end of pains."</p>
        <p>
          But beloved, drink as we may of the cup of peace, the good wine is
          kept until a future time. The peace we drink to-day is dashed with
          some drops of bitter. There are disturbing thoughts; the cares of this
          world will come, doubts will arise; live as we may in this world, we
          must have disquietudes; thorns in the flesh must come. But oh! the
          "rest that remaineth for the people of God." What good wine shall that
          be! God hath a sun without a spot, a sky without a cloud, a day
          without a night, a sea without a wave, a world without a tear. Happy
          are they who, having passed through this world, have entered into
          rest, and ceased from their own works, as God did from his, bathing
          their weary souls in seas of heavenly rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          View heaven under another aspect. It is a place of holy company. In
          this world we have had some good wine of sweet company. We can tell of
          many of the precious sons of Zion with whom we have taken sweet
          counsel; blessed be the Lord; the righteous have not all failed from
          among men. Some of you can remember golden names that were very dear
          to you in the days of your youth -- of men and women with whom you
          used to go up to God's house and take sweet counsel. Ah, what words
          used to drop from their lips, and what sweet balm you had in the days
          of your sorrow when they comforted and consoled you: and you have
          friends still left, to whom you look up with some degree of reverence,
          while they look upon you with intense affection. There are some men
          that are comforters to your soul, and when you talk to them you feel
          that their heart answers to your heart, and that you can enjoy union
          and communion with them. But beloved, the good wine is kept till the
          last. All the fellowship with the saints that we have had here, is as
          nothing compared with what we are to enjoy in the world to come. How
          sweet it is for us to recollect, that in heaven we shall be in the
          company of the best men, the noblest men, the most mighty men, the
          most honourable and the most renowned. We shall sit with Moses, and
          talk with him of all his life of wonders; we shall walk with Joseph,
          and we shall hear from him of the grace that kept him in his hour of
          peril; I doubt not you and I shall have the privilege of sitting by
          the side of David, and hearing him recount the perils and the
          deliverances through which he passed. The saints of heaven make but
          one communion, they are not divided into separate classes; we shall be
          allowed to walk through all the glorious ranks, and hold fellowship
          with all of them; nor need we doubt but that we shall be able to know
          them all. There are many reasons which I could not now enumerate, for
          it would occupy me too much time, that seem to my mind to settle the
          point, that in heaven we shall know even as we are known, and shall
          perfectly know each other; and that indeed, makes us long to be there.
          "The general assembly and church of the first-born, whose names are
          written in haven." Oh, to get away from this poor church here, that is
          full of strifes and divisions, and bickerings and jealousies and
          animosities -- to get away from the society of men that are full of
          infirmities, although they have much grace, and to get into a place
          where there shall be no infirmities in those with whom we talk -- no
          hasty tempers, -- where we cannot possibly strike a chord that would
          make a jarring note -- when it shall not be in our power to raise
          among those holy birds of Paradise a cause of strife -- when we shall
          walk in the midst of them all, and see love beaming from every eye,
          and feel that deep affection is seated in every heart. Oh! that will
          be the best wine. Are you not longing to drink of it? -- to enter into
          that great church fellowship, and attend those glorious church
          meetings,
        </p>
        <p>"Where all the chosen race</p>
        <p>Shall meet around the throne,</p>
        <p>To bless the conduct of his grace,</p>
        <p>And make his wonders known."</p>
        <p>
          Again, look at heaven, if you will, in the point of knowledge. We know
          very much on earth that makes us happy; Jesus Christ hath taught us
          many things that give us joy and gladness. It is a world of ignorance,
          but still through grace we have entered into the school of the gospel,
          and we have learned some sweet truths. It is true we are very much
          like the boy who is beginning to write. We had to make many ugly
          pothooks and hangers, and we have not yet learned to write the sweet
          running hand of joy; but nevertheless, the Lord has taught us some
          great truths to fill our heart with joy; -- the great doctrine of
          election, the knowledge of our redemption, the fact of our security in
          Christ; these great but simple doctrines have filled our hearts with
          bliss. But, brethren, the best wine is kept till the last, when the
          Lord Jesus Christ shall take the book and break the seals thereof, and
          permit us to read it all, then shall we rejoice indeed, for the best
          wine will be at our lips. There are old casks of knowledge that
          contain the richest wine, and Christ shall stave them in, and we shall
          drink of them to the full. It is not fit that we should know all
          things now, -- we could not bear many things, and therefore Christ
          keeps them back; but
        </p>
        <p>"There shall you see and hear and know</p>
        <p>All you desired or wished below,</p>
        <p>And every power find sweet employ</p>
        <p>In that eternal world of joy."</p>
        <p>
          You may, if you please, look at heaven in another sense -- as a place
          of manifestations and of joys. Now this world is a place of
          manifestations to the believer. Shall I venture for a moment, or even
          for a second, to talk of manifestations of himself which Christ is
          pleased to afford to his poor children on earth? No, beloved, your own
          experience shall supply my lack. I will only say that there are times
          when the Lord Jesus saith unto his beloved, "Come, my beloved, let us
          go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages. Let us get up
          early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the
          tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give
          thee my loves." But, what must be the fellowship of heaven? I fail
          to-night in attempting to talk to you of the best wine, for this
          simple reason -- I believe there are very few men that can preach of
          heaven so as to interest you much, for you feel that all we can say is
          so far behind the reality, that we might as well have let it alone.
          Baxter might write a Saint's Rest, but I am no Baxter -- would God I
          were! The day may come perhaps, when I may talk more copiously of
          these blessings; but at present, in my own soul, when I begin to talk
          of the communion of heaven, I seem overcome, I cannot imagine it; for
          the next thought that always succeeds my first attempt to think of it,
          is a thought of overwhelming gratitude, coupled with a kind of fear
          that this is too good for such an unworthy worm as I. It was a
          privilege for John to put his head on the Master's bosom, but that is
          nothing compared with the privilege of lying in his embrace forever.
          Oh! we must wait until we get there, and as one of old said, "In five
          minutes you shall know more of heaven than I could tell you in all my
          life." It needs but that we should see our Lord, that we should fly
          into his arms, that we should feel his embrace, that we should fall at
          his feet, and, was I about to say, weep for joy? No, that were
          impossible, but lie there, as it were dissolved away in ecstacy -- to
          feel that we at least have arrived in that dear place which he hath
          spoken to us of when he said: "Let not your heart be troubled; ye
          believe in God, believe also in me; in my Father's house there are
          many mansions; if it were not so I would have told you; I go to
          prepare a place for you." Truly he hath kept the best wine until the
          last.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now, WHAT IS OUR LORD'S REASON FOR DOING THIS? That was the
          second point. Very briefly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord might have given us the best wine first, but he will not act
          as the devil doth; he will always make a broad distinction between his
          dealings and the dealings of Satan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, he will not give us the best wine first, because that is not
          his good pleasure. "Fear not, little flock, it is your Father's good
          pleasure to give you the kingdom." That is the only reason why you
          will get it at all; and the reason why you do not receive it now is
          because it is not your Father's good pleasure that you should have it
          just yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again; your Father doth not give you the good wine now, because he is
          giving you an appetite for it. At the old feasts of the Romans men
          used to drink bitter things, and all kinds of singular and noxious
          mixtures, to make them thirsty. Now, in this world, God is, as it
          were, making his children thirsty, that they may take deeper draughts
          of heaven. I cannot think that heaven would be so sweet to me if I had
          not first to dwell on earth. Who knoweth best the sweet of rest? Is it
          not the labourer? Who understandeth best the joy of peace? Is it not
          the man who hath dwelt in the land of war? Who knoweth most the
          sweetness of joy? Is it not the man who hath passed through a world of
          sorrow? Ye are having your appetites sharpened by these trials; ye are
          being made ready to receive the fulness of joy that is in the presence
          of God for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the Lord hath this also in view. He is making you fit for the
          best wine, that he may be glorified by the trial of your faith. If it
          were in my power to go to heaven to-night, and I could enter there,
          yet if I should have a suspicion that there was more to do or more to
          suffer here, I would infinitely prefer to wait my Father's time;
          because, methinks, in heaven we shall bless God for all we have
          suffered. When it is all over, how sweet it will be to talk of it!
          When you and I shall meet each other in the streets of heaven -- and
          there be some of you that have had but few trials, but few doubtings
          and fearings, and tribulations and conflicts, -- you will talk of how
          God delivered you; but you will not be able to talk as some of the
          tried saints will. Ah! what sweet stories some of them will tell! I
          should like to go by the side of Jonah, and hear how he went down to
          the bottom of the mountains, and how he thought the earth with her
          bars was about him for ever. And Jeremiah, -- I often think what a
          deal we shall get out of Jeremiah in eternity, -- what he will have to
          tell, who took such plunges into the sea of sorrow! And David, too,
          the sweet Psalmist, so full of experience, he will never have done
          talking of what the Lord has done for him! And I think you and I, when
          we get to heaven, will have enough to think of. As a poor woman once
          said, when she was in great doubt and fear whether she should be saved
          at all; she said in her prayer, "Lord, if thou wilt save me, only one
          thing I can promise thee. If thou wilt take me to heaven thou shalt
          never hear the last of it, for I will praise thee while immortality
          lasts, and I will tell the angels thou savedst ME." And this is the
          constant burden of heaven. They are each one wondering that he is
          there. Beloved, if we did not have to pass through these trials and
          troubles, and these soul conflicts, and such like, we should have very
          little to talk about in heaven. I have no doubt that the babes in
          paradise are as happy as the rest, but I do not wish to be a babe in
          paradise. I bless God I did not go to heaven when an infant: I shall
          have the more to praise God for, when I shall look back through a life
          of mercies, a life of trials, and yet a life of sustaining grace.
          There will be a louder song, because the deeper have been our
          troubles. These, I think, are some of God's reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, dear brethren and sisters, what shall I say about the
          LESSON WE ARE TO LEARN FROM THIS FACT of Christ keeping the best wine
          until now? Going home the other night I noticed the difference between
          the horse's pace in coming here and going home, and I thought to
          myself, "Ah! the horse goes well, because he is going home;" and the
          thought struck me, "How well a Christian ought to go, cause he is
          going home." You know, if we were going from home, every rough stone
          in the road might check us, and we might need a good deal of whip to
          make us go. But it is going home. Bless God, every step we take is
          going home. It may be knee-deep in trouble, but it is all on the road;
          we may be ancle-deep in fear, but it is going home; I may stumble, but
          I always stumble homewards. All my afflictions and griefs, when they
          cast me down, but cast me onwards towards heaven. The mariner does not
          mind the waves, if every wave sends him nearer his haven, and he does
          not care how loudly howl the winds, if they only blow him nearer port.
          That is the Christian's happy lot: he is going homeward. Let that
          cheer thee, Christian, and make thee travel on joyfully, not needing
          the whip to urge thee to duty, but always going on with alacrity
          through duty and through trial, because thou art going homeward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: if we have the best things to come dear friends, do not let us
          be discontented. Let us put up with a few of the bad things now, for
          they only seem to be so. A traveller who is on a journey in a hurry,
          if he has to stay for a night at an inn, he may grumble a little at
          the want of accommodation, but he does not say very much, because he
          is off to-morrow, he is only stopping a short time at the inn; he
          says, "I shall get home to-morrow night," and then he thinks of the
          joys of home, and does not care about the discomforts of his hard
          journey. You and I are travellers. It will soon be over. We may have
          had but a very few shillings a week compared with our neighbour, but
          we shall be equal with him when we get there. He may have had a large
          house, with a great many rooms, while we had, it may be only one upper
          room; ah! we shall have as large a mansion as he in Paradise. We shall
          soon be at the journey's end, and then the road will not signify, long
          as we have got there. Come! let us put up with these few
          inconveniences on the road, for the best wine is coming; let us pour
          away all the vinegar of murmuring, for the best wine shall come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more; if the Christian has the best wine to come, why should he
          envy the worldling? David did; he was discontented when he saw the
          prosperity of the wicked, and you and I are often tempted to do it;
          but you know what we ought to say when we see the wicked prosper, when
          we see them happy, and full of delights of sinful pleasure. We ought
          to say, "Ah! my good wine is to come; I can bear that you should have
          your turn; my turn will tome afterwards; I can be put off with these
          things, and lie with Lazarus at the gate, while the dogs lick my
          sores; my turn is to come, when the angels shall carry me into
          Abraham's bosom, and your turn is to come too, when in hell you lift
          up your eyes, being in torments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian, what more shall I say to thee? -- though there be a
          thousand lessons to learn from this, that the best wine is kept to the
          last. "Take heed to thyself, that thou also keepest thy good wine
          until the last. The further thou goest on the road, seek to bring to
          thy Saviour the more acceptable sacrifice. Thou hadst little faith
          years ago: man! bring out the good wine now! Seek to have more faith.
          Thy Master is better to thee every day, and thou shalt see him to he
          the best of all Masters and friends. Seek to be better to thy Master
          every day; be more generous to his cause, more active to labour for
          him, more kind to his people, more diligent in prayer; and take heed
          that as thou growest in years thow growest in grace, so that when thou
          comest at last to the river Jordan, and the Master shall give thee the
          best wine, thou mayest also give to him the best wine, and praise him
          most loudly when the battle shall just be over, and when the whirlwind
          is dying away into the everlasting peace of paradise."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, dear friends, I am conscious that I have totally failed in
          endeavouring to bring forth this good wine; but it is written that God
          hath revealed it unto us by his Spirit, but that ear hath not heard
          it. Now, if I had told it to you to-night your ear would have heard
          it, and the text would not have been true; and as I have unwittingly
          proved the truth of this Scripture, I cannot be very sorry at having
          helped to witness the truth of my Master's word. Only this I say, --
          the nearer you live to Christ the nearer you will be to heaven, for if
          there is one place next door to Pisgah it is Calvary. It may seem
          strange, but if you live much on Calvary you live very near Nebo; for
          although Moses may have seen Canaan from Nebo, I have never seen
          heaven anywhere but close to Calvary. When I have seen my Saviour
          crucified, then I have seen him glorified; when I have read my name
          written in his blood, then I have seen afterwards my mansion which he
          has prepared for me. When I have seen my sins washed away, then I have
          seen the white robe that I am to wear for ever. Live near to the
          Saviour, man, and you shall not be very far off heaven. Recollect,
          after all, it is not far to heaven. It is only one gentle sigh, and we
          are there. We talk of it as a land very far off, but close it is, and
          who knows but that the spirits of the just are here to-night? Heaven
          is close to us; we cannot tell where it is, but this we know, that it
          is not a far off land. It is so near, that, swifter than thought, we
          shall be there, emancipated from our care and woe, and blessed for
          ever.<br />
