 </p>
</b></font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">This brief Psalm is without title or name of author, but 
    its subject is obvious enough, being stated in the very first line. It is 
    the Psalm of Omnipotent Sovereignty: Jehovah, despite all opposition, reigns 
    supreme. Possibly at the time this sacred ode was written, the nation was in 
    danger from its enemies, and the hopes of the people of God were encouraged 
    by remembering that the Lord was still King. What sweeter and surer 
    consolation could they desire?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. The LORD reigns.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Or Jehovah reigns. Whatever opposition may arise, his 
    throne is unmoved; he has reigned, does reign, and will reign forever and 
    ever. Whatever turmoil and rebellion there may be beneath the clouds, the 
    eternal King sits above all in supreme serenity; and everywhere he is really 
    Master, let his foes rage as they may. <i>All things are ordered according 
    to his eternal purposes, and his will is ever done. </i></p>

<p align="justify">In the verse before us it would seem as if the Lord had 
    for a while appeared to vacate the throne—but on a sudden he puts on his 
    regal apparel and ascends his lofty seat, while his happy people proclaim 
    him with new joy, shouting "The Lord reigns." What can give greater joy to a 
    loyal subject than a sight of the king in his beauty? Let us repeat the 
    proclamation, "the Lord reigns," whispering it in the ears of the 
    desponding, and publishing it in the face of the foe.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">He is clothed with majesty.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Not with emblems of majesty—but with majesty itself: 
    everything which surrounds him is majestic. His is not the semblance but the 
    reality of sovereignty<i>. In nature, providence, and salvation the Lord is 
    infinite in majesty. </i>Happy are the people among whom the Lord appears in 
    all the glory of his grace, conquering their enemies, and subduing all 
    things unto himself; then indeed is he seen to be clothed with majesty.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The LORD is clothed with strength. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">His garments of glory are not his only array, he wears 
    strength also as his belt. He is always strong—but sometimes he displays his 
    power in a special manner, and may therefore be said to be <i>clothed </i>
    with it; just as he is always majestic essentially—but yet there are seasons 
    when he reveals his glory, and so wears his majesty, or shows himself in it.
    </p>
<p align="justify">May the Lord appear in his church, in our day in manifest 
    majesty and might, saving sinners, slaying errors, and honoring his own 
    name. O for a day of the Son of man, in which the King Immortal and Almighty 
    shall stand upon his glorious high throne, to be feared in the great 
    congregation, and admired by all them that believe.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">With which he has girded himself. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">As men gird up their loins for running or working, so the 
    Lord appears in the eyes of his people to be preparing for action, girt with 
    his omnipotence. Strength always dwells in the Lord Jehovah—but he hides his 
    power full often, until, in answer to his children's cries, he puts on 
    strength, assumes the throne, and defends his own. It should be a constant 
    theme for prayer, that in our day the reign of the Lord may be conspicuous, 
    and his power displayed in his church and on her behalf. "May Your kingdom 
    come" should be our daily <i>prayer</i>. That the Lord Jesus does actually 
    reign should be our daily <i>praise</i>.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The world also is established, that it cannot be moved.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Because Jehovah reigns terrestrial things for a while are 
    stable. We could not be sure of anything, if we were not sure that he has 
    dominion. When he withdraws his manifest presence from among men, all things 
    are out of order; blasphemers rave, persecutors rage, the profane grow bold, 
    and the licentious increase in wantonness; but when the divine power and 
    glory are again manifested, then order is restored, and the poor distracted 
    world is at peace again. </p>
<p align="justify">Society would be the football of the basest of mankind, 
    if God did not establish it.<i> Even the globe itself would fly through 
    space, like thistle down across the common, if the Lord did not hold it in 
    its appointed orbit. </i>That there is any stability, either in the world or 
    in the church, is the Lord's doings, and he is to be adored for it.<i> 
    Atheism is the mother of anarchy</i>; the reigning power of God exhibited in 
    true religion is the only security for the human commonwealth. A belief in 
    God is the foundation and cornerstone of a well ordered state.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. Your throne is established of old. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Though you may just now appear in more conspicuous 
    sovereignty—yet yours is no upstart sovereignty. In the most ancient times 
    your dominion was secure, yes, before time was your throne was set up. </p>
<p align="justify">We often hear of ancient dynasties—but what are they when 
    compared with the Lord? Are they not as the bubble on the breaker, born an 
    instant ago and gone as soon as seen? </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">You are from everlasting.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">The Lord himself is eternal. Let the believer rejoice 
    that the government under which he dwells has an immortal ruler at its head, 
    has existed from all eternity and will flourish when all created things 
    shall have forever passed away. Vain are the rebellions of mortals—but the 
    kingdom of God is not shaken.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. The floods have lifted up, O LORD. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Men have raged like angry waves of the sea—but vain has 
    been their tumult. Observe that the psalmist turns to the Lord when he sees 
    the billows foam, and hears the breakers roar; he does not waste his breath 
    by talking to the waves, or to violent men; but like Hezekiah he spreads the 
    blasphemies of the wicked before the Lord. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up 
    their waves. <br/>
<br/>
</p></b>These repetitions are needed for the sake both of the poetry and the 
    music—but they also suggest the frequency and the violence of wicked 
    assaults upon the government of God, and the repeated defeats which they 
    sustain. Sometimes men are furious in words—they lift up their voice; and at 
    other times they rise to acts of violence—they lift up their waves; but the 
    Lord has control over them in either case. <i>The ungodly are all foam and 
    fury, noise and bluster, during their little hour, and then the tide turns 
    or the storm is hushed, and we hear no more of them</i>; while the kingdom 
    of the Eternal abides in the grandeur of its power.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of 
    many waters.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The utmost of their power is to him but a sound and he 
    can readily master it, therefore he calls it a noise by way of contempt. 
    When men combine to overthrow the kingdom of Jesus, plot secretly, and by 
    and by rage openly, the Lord thinks no more of it than of so much noise upon 
    the sea beach. Jehovah, the self-existent and omnipotent, cares not for the 
    opposition of dying men, however many or mighty they may be.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Yes, than the mighty waves of the sea. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">When the storm raises Atlantic billows, and drives them 
    on with terrific force, the Lord is still able to restrain them. In the same 
    way, when impious men are haughty and full of rage—the Lord is able to 
    subdue them and overrule their malice. Kings or mobs, emperors or savages, 
    all are in the Lord's hands, and he can forbid their touching a hair of the 
    heads of his saints.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. Your testimonies are very sure. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">As in <i>providence </i>the throne of God is fixed beyond 
    all risk, so in <i>revelation </i>his truth is beyond all question. Other 
    teachings are uncertain—but the revelations of Heaven are infallible. As the 
    rocks remain unmoved amid the tumult of the sea—so does divine truth resist 
    all the currents of man's opinion and the storms of human controversy; they 
    are not only sure—but <i>very </i>sure. </p>
<p align="justify">Glory be to God, we have not been deluded by a cunningly 
    devised fable: our faith is grounded upon the eternal truth of the Most 
    High. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Holiness becomes your house, O LORD, forever. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Truth changes not in its doctrines, which are very sure, 
    nor holiness in its precepts, which are incorruptible. The teaching and the 
    character of God are both unalterable. God has not admitted evil to dwell 
    with him, he will not tolerate it in his house, he is eternally its enemy, 
    and is forever the sworn friend of holiness. </p>
<p align="justify">The church must remain unchanged, and forever be holiness 
    unto the Lord; yes, her King will preserve her undefiled by the intruder's 
    foot. Sacred unto the Lord is the church of Jesus Christ, and so shall she 
    be kept evermore. "Jehovah reigns!" is the first word and the main doctrine 
    of the psalm, and holiness is the final result; a due esteem for the great 
    King will lead us to adopt a behavior becoming his royal presence. </p>
<p align="justify">Divine sovereignty both confirms the promises as sure 
    testimonies, and enforces the precepts as befitting in the presence of so 
    great a Lord. The whole psalm is most impressive, and is calculated to 
    comfort the distressed, confirm the timorous, and assist the devout. </p>
<p align="justify">O you who are so great and gracious a King, reign over us 
    forever! We do not desire to question or restrain your power, such is your 
    character that we rejoice to see you exercise the rights of an absolute 
    monarch. All power is in your hands, and we rejoice to have it so. Hosanna! 
    Hosanna!</p>
