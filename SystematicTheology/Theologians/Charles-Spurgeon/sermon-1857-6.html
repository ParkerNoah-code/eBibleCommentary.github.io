        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.112)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, January 11, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>

          |And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men and go out, fight with
          Amalek; to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of
          God in mine hand.| -- Exodus 17:9.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE CHILDREN of Israel were led out of Egypt with a strong hand and an
          out-stretched arm. They were conducted into the vast howling
          wilderness, where there were few, if any, permanent abodes of men. For
          some time they pursued their march in solitude, discovering wells and
          other traces of a nomadic population, but not meeting with any to
          disturb their loneliness. But it appears that then, as now, there were
          wandering tribes who, like the Bedouin Arabs, wandered to and fro
          through that very country which the people of Israel were now treading
          with their feet. These people, excited by the hope of spoil, fell
          suddenly upon the rear of the children of Israel, smote the hindmost
          of them in a most cowardly manner, took their spoil, and then swiftly
          decamped. Gathering strength and courage from this successful foray,
          they then dared to attack the whole host of Israel, which at that time
          must have amounted to two or three millions of souls, who had been
          brought out of Egypt and fed by miracle in the wilderness. This time
          Israel was not to be surprised; for Moses had said unto Joshua --
          |Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to-morrow I will
          stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand;|
          pleading with God, in order that every blow struck with the sword
          might be made doubly powerful by the mighty assistance of God. We are
          told that a great victory was achieved; the Amalekites were put to the
          rout, and because of their unprovoked attack upon the children of
          Israel, they were condemned to extermination; for we find it written
          thus: -- |Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the
          ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek
          from under heaven. And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it
          Jehovah-nissi. For he said, Because the Lord hath sworn that the Lord
          will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, beloved, this scene of warfare is not recorded in Scripture as in
          interesting circumstance to amuse the lover of history, but it is
          written for our edification; for we remember the text which says --
          |Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our
          profit.| There is some profit to be derived from this -- and we
          believe a peculiar profit, too, since God was pleased to make this the
          first writing commanded by Divine authority as a record for
          generations to come. We think that the journeys of the children of
          Israel furnish us with many emblems of the journey of God's church
          through the world; and we believe, that this fight with Amalek is a
          metaphor and an emblem of that constant and daily fight which all
          God's people must carry on with sins without and sins within. This
          morning I shall more particularly confine myself to sin without; I
          shall speak of the great battle which at the present moment is being
          waged for God and for his truth, against the enemies of the Cross of
          Christ. I shall endeavour, first, to make a few remarks upon the war
          itself, then to review the authorised method of warfare, which is
          twofold -- hard blows and hard prayers, and then I shall finish by
          stirring up God's church to great and earnest diligence in the warfare
          for God and for his truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, we shall make some remarks upon THE GREAT WARFARE
          which we think is typified by the content between the children of
          Israel and Amalek.
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, note that this crusade, this sacred, holy war of which I
          speak, is not with men, but with Satan and with error. |We wrestle not
          with flesh and blood.| Christian men are not at war with any man that
          walks the earth. We are at war with infidelity, but the persons of
          infidels we love and pray for; we are at warfare with any heresy, but
          we have no enmity against heretics; we are opposed to, and cry war to
          the knife with everything that opposes God and his truth: but towards
          every man we would still endeavour to carry out the holy maxim, |Love
          your enemies, do good to them that hate you.| The Christian soldier
          hath no gun and no sword, for he fighteth not with men. It is with
          |spiritual wickedness in high places| that he fights, and with other
          principalities and powers than with those that sit on thrones and hold
          sceptres in their hands. I have marked, however, that some Christian
          men -- and it is a feeling to which all of us are prone -- are very
          apt to make Christ's war a war of flesh and blood, instead of a war
          with wrong and spiritual wickedness. Have you never noticed in
          religious controversies how men will fall foul of each other, and make
          personal remarks and abuse each other? What is that but forgetting
          what Christ's war is? We are not fighting against men; we are fighting
          for men rather than against them. We are fighting for God and his
          truth against error and against sin; but not against men. Woe, woe, to
          the Christian who forgets this sacred canon of warfare. Touch not the
          persons of men, but smite their sin with a stout heart and with strong
          arm. Slay both the little ones and the great; let nothing be spared
          that is against God and his truth; but we have no war with the persons
          of poor mistaken men. Rome we hate even as we abhor hell, yet for her
          votaries we ever pray. Idolatry and infidelity we fiercely denounce,
          but the men who debase themselves by either of them are the objects
          not of wrath, but pity. We fight not against the men, but against the
          things which we consider in God's sight to be wrong. Let us always
          make that distinction, otherwise the conflict with Christ's church
          will be degraded into a mere battle of brute force and garments rolled
          in blood; and so the world will again be an Aceldama -- a field of
          blood. It is this mistake which has nailed martyrs to the stake and
          cast confessors into prison, because their opponents could not
          distinguish between the imaginary error and the man. While they spoke
          stoutly against the seeming error; in their ignorant bigotry they felt
          that they must also persecute the man, which they need not and ought
          not to have done. I will never be afraid to speak out my mind with all
          the Saxon words I can get together, and I am not afraid of saying hard
          things against the devil, and against what the devil teaches; but with
          every man in the wide world I am friends, nor is there one living with
          whom I am at enmity for a moment any more than with the babe that has
          just been brought into the world. We must hate error, we must abhor
          falsehood; but we must not hate men, for God's warfare is against sin.
          May God help us always to make that distinction.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now let us observe that the warfare which the Christian carries
          on, may be said for his encouragement, to be a most righteous warfare.
          In every other conflict in which men have engaged, there have been two
          opinions, some have said the war was right, and some have said it was
          wrong; but in regard to the sacred war in which all believers have
          been engaged, there has been only one opinion among right-minded men.
          When the ancient priest stirred up the Crusaders to the fight, he made
          them shout Deus vult -- God wills it. And we may far more truly say
          the same. A war against falsehood, a war against sin, is God's war; it
          is a war which commends itself to every Christian man, seeing he is
          quite certain that he has the seal of God's approval when he goes to
          wage war against God's enemies. Beloved, we have no doubt whatever,
          when we lift up our voices like a trumpet against sin, that our
          warfare is justified by the eternal laws of justice. Would to God that
          every war had so just and true an excuse as the war which God wages
          with Amalek -- with sin in the world!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us recollect again, that it is a war of the greatest importance.
          In other wars it is sometimes said -- |Britons! fight for your hearths
          and your homes, for your wives and for your children -- fight and
          repel the foe!| But in this war it is not merely for our hearths and
          for our homes, for our wives and for our children, but it is for
          something more than this. It is not against them that kill the body,
          and after that have no more that they can do; but it is a fight for
          souls, for eternity, against those who would plunge man into eternal
          perdition, a fight for God, for the deliverance of men's souls from
          wrath to come. It is a war which ought, indeed, to be commenced, to be
          followed up, and carried out in spirit, by the whole army of God's
          elect, seeing that no war can be more important. The instrumental
          salvation of men is above all things the highest object to which we
          can attain, and the routing of the foes of truth is a victory beyond
          all things to be desired. Religion must be the foundation of every
          blessing which society can hope to enjoy. Little as men think it,
          religion has much to do with our liberty, our happiness, and our
          comfort. England would not have been what it now is, if it had not
          been for her religion; and in that hour when she shall forsake her
          God, her glory shall have fallen, and |Ichabod| shall be written upon
          her banners.
        </p>
        <p>
          In that day when the Gospel shall be silenced, when our ministers
          shall cease to preach; when the Bible shall be chained; in that day --
          God forbid it should ever come to pass -- in that day, England may
          write herself among the dead, for she hath fallen, since God hath
          forsaken her, seeing she hath cast off her allegiance to him.
          Christian men, in this fight for right, ye are fighting for your
          nation, for your liberties, your happiness and your peace; for unless
          religion, the religion of heaven be maintained, these will most
          certainly be destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us reflect, in the next place, that we are fighting with insidious
          and very powerful foes, in this great warfare for God and Christ. Let
          me again make the remark, that whilst speaking of certain characters,
          I am not speaking of the men, but of their errors. At this time we
          have peculiar difficulties in the great content for truth -- peculiar,
          because very few appreciate them. We have enemies of all classes, and
          all of them far wider awake than we are. The infidel hath his eyes
          wide open, he is spreading his doctrines everywhere; and while we
          think -- good easy men -- that full surely our greatness is ripening,
          that frost is nipping many of our fair shoots, and unless we awaken,
          God help us! In almost every place infidelity seems to have a great
          away; not the bold bragging infidelity of Tom Payne, but a more polite
          and moderate infidelity; not that which slayeth religion with a
          bludgeon, but that which seeks to poison it with a small dose of
          poison, and goeth its way, and saith still it hath not hurt public
          morals. Everywhere this is increasing; I fear that the great mass of
          our population are imbued with an infidel spirit. Then we have more to
          fear than some of us suppose from Rome; not from Rome openly; from
          that we have little to fear; God hath given to the people of England
          such a bold Protestant spirit, that any open innovation from the Pope
          of Rome would be instantly repelled; but I mean the Romanism that has
          crept into the Church of England under the name of Puseyism.
          Everywhere that has increased; they are beginning to light candles on
          the altar, which is only a prelude to those greater lights with which
          they would consume our Protestantism. Oh! that there were men who
          would unmask them! We have much to fear from them; but I would not
          care one whit for that if it were not for something which is even
          worse. We have to deal with a spirit, I know not how to denominate it,
          unless I call it a spirit of moderatism in the pulpits of protestant
          churches. Men have begun to rub off the rough edges of truth, to give
          up the doctrines of Luther and Zwingle, and Calvin, and to endeavour
          to accommodate them to polished tastes. You might go into a Roman
          Catholic chapel now-a-days, and hear as good a sermon from a Popish
          priest as you hear in many cases from a Protestant minister, because
          he does not touch disputed points, or bring out the angular parts of
          our Protestant religion. Mark, too, in the great majority of our books
          what a dislike there is to sound doctrine! the writers seem to fancy
          that truth is of no more value than error; that as for the doctrines
          we preach, it cannot matter what they are; still holding that
        </p>
        <p>|He can't be wrong whose life is in the right.|</p>
        <p>
          There is creeping into the pulpits of Baptists and every other
          denomination, a lethargy and coldness, and with that a sort of
          nullification of all truth. While they for the most part preach but
          little notable error, yet the truth itself is uttered in so minute a
          form that no one detects it, and in so ambiguous a style, that no one
          is struck with it. So far as man can do it, God's arrows are blunted,
          and the edge of his sword is turned in the day of battle. Men do not
          hear the truth as they used to. The velvet mouth is succeeding to the
          velvet cushion, and the organ is the only thing in the building which
          giveth forth a certain sound. From all such things, |good Lord deliver
          us!| May heaven put an end to all this moderatism; we want out-and-out
          truth in these perilous days; we want a man just now to speak as God
          tells him, and care for nobody. Oh! if we had some of the old Scotch
          preachers! Those Scotch preachers made kings tremble; they were no
          men's servants; they were very lords, wherever they went, because each
          of them said, |God has given me a message; my brow is like adamant
          against men; I will speak what God bids me.| Like Micah, they said,
          |As the Lord my God liveth, whatsoever my God saith unto me, that will
          I speak.| Heroes of the truth, soldiers of Christ awake! Even now
          there are enemies. Think not that the fight is over; the great warfare
          of truth waxes more hot and fierce than ever. Oh! soldiers of Christ!
          take your swords from your scabbards! stand up for God and for his
          truth again, lest a free grace gospel should be forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me just say, once more, concerning this war, that it is one that
          is to be of perpetual duration. Let us recollect, my beloved, that
          this war between right and wrong must be continued, and never must
          cease until truth has the victory. If you suppose that our forefathers
          did enough for truth and for God, and that you may be idle, you have
          made a great mistake. Until that day when the might with the right,
          and the right with the might shall be, we must never sheathe our
          swords; until that happy hour when Christ shall reign, when he shall
          be Master of all lands, when |swords shall be beaten into
          ploughshares, and spears into pruning hooks,| and men shall not learn
          way any more; until that day the conflict is to be kept up. Let no man
          think we are in such a position that we have no need for watchfulness:
          terrible as the war has been before, it is as terrible now, though in
          another manner. We have not now to resist unto blood, striving against
          sin, but we have need of as stern a power of resistance as ever was
          possessed by martyrs and confessors in days gone by. Brethren, we must
          awake; the army must be aroused, the soldiers of the Lord must be
          quickened to a consciousness of their position. Now, now, we blow the
          trumpet; rush to the fight ye slumbering soldiers! Up, up, up! Let
          your banners wave, and let your swords be taken from your scabbards;
          it is a day of fight -- a day of war and contention.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot, however, conclude this section of my discourse without
          remarking that it is not merely error in religion with which we have
          to fight, but error in practice. Oh! beloved this world is a wicked
          world still, and London is an abominable city still. We have a fine
          gloss everywhere -- a fair exterior, but, alas, within the hidden
          parts sin is still dominant. This is the great city of pretence, the
          gaudy house of sham, the foul home of pollution. Our streets are lined
          with fair houses; but what have we behind them? what have we there, in
          the very vitals of our city? This city is a colossal culprit, it is a
          behemoth sinner, and everywhere there are those who live in the vilest
          of vices, and yet go unchecked and unreproved, for it is unfashionable
          to tell men of their sins and there are few who have the spirit to
          speak out plainly of men's sins. When we consider the mass of female
          profligacy which numbers it votaries by tens of thousands, are we not
          driven to conclude that the same sin must be rife enough with men. And
          ah! that there should be need to utter it. Are not the men who ensnare
          and seduce the poor unfortunates, allowed to enter society as
          respectable and moral. What is this but abominable hypocrisy. We are
          greater sinners in London than many suppose. Everything is painted
          over. But think not that you can deceive God in this way? Sin is
          stalking through the land at a horrid pace; iniquity still runs down
          our streets, covered up, it is true, not open sin, but still offensive
          alike to God and to good men. Oh! my brethren, the world is not good
          yet; it is filmed over, but all the while the loathsome disease lurks
          within. Up, again, I say, soldiers of Christ; the war against sin is
          not finished, it is scarce begun.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But now, secondly, we have to notice, briefly the APPOINTED MEANS
          OF WARFARE. When Amalek came out against Israel, God appointed two
          means of combating them. If he had chosen, he could have sent a wind
          and driven them away, or have cut off their hosts by the blast of the
          pestilence; but it did not so please him; for he would put honor upon
          human effort, and, therefore, he said to Joshua, |Choose out your men,
          and go fight with Amalek.| It is true Joshua might, by God's strength,
          have overcome the foe; but says God, |While I honor human effort, I
          will still make men see that God doeth all. Moses! go up to yonder
          hill; stand there in prayer, hold up thy rod, and whilst the soldiers
          of Joshua rush into the fight, Moses shall plead, and you shall be
          unitedly successful. Your prayer, O Moses, without the sword of
          Joshua, shall not prosper; and the sword of Joshua, without the rod of
          Moses, shall not be effectual.| The two ways of fighting sin are these
          -- hard blows and hard prayers.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the church must employ hard blows and hard fighting against
          sin. It is of no use for you to shut yourselves up in your houses, and
          pray to God to stay sin, unless you go and do something yourselves. If
          you pray away till you are dumb, you shall never have a blessing
          unless you exert yourselves. Let the farmer pray for a harvest; will
          he ever have it, unless he ploughs the field and then sows his seed?
          Let the warrior pray for victory, and let his soldiers stand
          peacefully to be shot at, will he gain a triumph? No, there must be an
          active exercise of the power given by God, or else prayer without it
          will be of no avail. Let us, then, brethren and sisters, each in our
          spheres, deal hard blows at the enemy. This is a fight in which all
          can do something who are the Lord's people. Those who halt upon there
          crutches can use them for weapons of war, as well as the mighty men
          can wield their swords! We have each an allotted work to do, if we are
          the Lord's elect; let us take care that we do it. You are a tract
          distributor; go on with your work, do it earnestly. You are a
          Sunday-school teacher; go on, do not stay in that blessed work, do it
          as unto God, and not as unto man. You are a preacher; preach as God
          giveth you ability, remembering that he requireth of no man more than
          he hath given to him; therefore, be not discouraged if you have little
          success, still go on. Are you like Zebulon, one that can handle the
          pen? Handle it wisely; and you shall smite through the loins of kings
          therewith. And if you can do but little, at least furnish the shot for
          others, that so you may help them in their works of faith and their
          labours of love. But let us all do something for Christ. I will never
          believe there is a Christian in the world who cannot do something.
          There is not a spider hanging on the king's wall but hath its errand;
          there is not a nettle that groweth in the corner of the churchyard but
          hath its purpose; there is not a single insect fluttering in the
          breeze but accomplisheth some divine decree; and I will never have it
          that God created any man, especially any Christian man, to be a blank,
          and to be a nothing. He made you for an end. Find out what that end
          is; find our your niche, and fill it. If it be ever so little, if it
          is only to be a hewer of wood and drawer of water, do something in
          this great battle for God and truth. Joshua must go out and take his
          men. I think I see him; he appears to have been a man of war from his
          youth; but what a motley host he had to choose from! Why, they were a
          set of slaves; they had never seen a sword in their lives, except in
          the hands of the Egyptians; they were poor, miserable creatures; they
          were cowards when they saw their old enemies at the Red Sea, and now
          their weapons were those which were washed up from the Red Sea, and
          their regimentals were of all descriptions upon earth. Joshua,
          however, chooses out the strongest of them, and says, |Come with me.|
          It was indeed, as one called it, a |ragged regiment| with which he
          went to fight: and yet the ragged regiment was the victorious one.
          Joshua won the day against the Amalekites, who had been trained to a
          predatory life. So, ye children of God, ye may know little of the
          tactics of warfare, your enemies may overthrow you in arguments, and
          annihilate you in logic; but, if you are God's children, they that are
          with you are more than a match for your foes; you shall live to see
          them yet dead upon the field; only fight on with faith in God, and you
          shall be victorious.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this is not all. Joshua might have fought; but he would have been
          routed, had it not been for Moses on the brow of the hill. They were
          both necessary. Do you not see the battle! It is not on a very large
          scale, but it is still worthy of your earnest attention. There is
          Amalek, rushing to the war with discordant cries; see, Israel is
          repulsing them, and Amalek flees! But what is it that I notice? Now
          Israel turns back and flees; now again they rally and Amalek is put to
          the flight! Lo! they are cut to pieces by the sword of Joshua, and
          mighty Amalek wavers like the corn beneath the mower's scythe. The
          crowd of Amalek are dropping. But again! again the battle wavers;
          Joshua flees; but once again he rallies his troops! And have you not
          observed the wonderous phenomenon? There, on the brow of the hill
          stands Moses. You will notice that when his hands were outstretched,
          Israel routed Amalek; but the moment when from weariness he dropped
          his hands, then Amalek had a temporary victory; and when again he held
          up his rod, Israel routed the foe. Each time the hand of prayer fell
          down, victory wavered between the combatants. Do you see the venerable
          intercessor? Moses, being an aged man, becomes weary from standing so
          many hours, they seat him upon a stone; still, arms are not iron, and
          the hands are drooping; but see! his eyes are flashing fire, and his
          hands are lifted up to heaven; tears are beginning to flow down his
          cheeks and his ejaculatory prayers are going to heaven like so many
          darts, which shall find their target in the ear of God. Do you see
          him, He is the hinge of victory; as he falters Amalek prevails; and as
          he is strong the chosen people gain the victory. See! Aaron is holding
          his hand for a moment; and anon Hur is supporting it, and the good old
          man changes his hands, for the battle lasts all day long, and in the
          hot sun it is wearisome work to hold them in one position. But see how
          manfully he holds them; stiff, as though they were cut out of stone;
          weary and worn, still his hands are out-stretched, as if he were a
          statue, and his friends assist his zeal. And see now, the ranks of
          Amalek are broken like thin clouds before a Biscay gale. They fly!
          they fly! Still his hands are motionless; still they fight; still the
          Amalekites fly; still Joshua prevails, until at last all the foes lie
          dead on the plain, and Joshua returns with the shout of joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now this teaches that there must be prayer as well as effort.
          Minister! preach on; you shall have no success unless you pray. If you
          do not know how to wrestle with God on your knees, you will find it
          hard work to wrestle with men on your feet in the pulpit. You may make
          efforts to do so, but you shall not be successful, unless you back up
          your efforts with prayer. You are not so likely to fail in your
          efforts as in your prayers. We never read that Joshua's hand was weary
          with wielding the sword, but Moses' hand was weary with holding the
          rod. The more spiritual the duty, the more apt we are to tire of it.
          We could stand and preach all day, but we could not be in our closets
          all day one-half so easily. To spend a night with God in prayer would
          be far more difficult than to spend a night with men in preaching. Oh!
          take care, take care, church of Christ, that thou dost not cease thy
          prayers! Above all, I speak to my own much loved church, my own
          people. You have loved me, and I have loved you, and God has given us
          great success, and blessed us. But, mark, I trace all of it to your
          prayers. You have assembled together in multitudes, perfectly
          unparalleled, to pray for me on each Monday evening, and I know I am
          mentioned at your family altars, as one who is very dear to your
          hearts; but I am afraid lest you should cease your prayers. Let the
          world say, |Down with him;| I will stand against them all, if you will
          pray for me; but if you cease your prayers it is all up with me and
          all over with you. Your prayers make us mighty; the praying legion is
          the thundering legion. If I might compare myself to a military
          commander, I should say, that when I see my men rise to pray in such
          large numbers, I feel like Napoleon, when he sent out his old guards.
          The battle had wavered; |There,| said he, |they go; now the victory is
          sure.| Or, like our own guards, the black caps, who, wherever they
          went carried victory with them. The praying legion is a thundering
          legion everywhere. Men can stand against anything but prayer. We would
          pray the very gates of hell off their hinges, if we could pray as some
          men have done. Oh! that we had might in prayer. Do not, I beseech you,
          I entreat you, do not cease to pray; cease what you please, but do not
          give up that; down on your knees, wrestle with God, and verily the
          Lord our God will bless us, |and all the ends of the earth shall fear
          him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now I am to close up with just a few remarks, in the third
          place, TO STIR YOU UP TO THE WARFARE. Remember, O children of God,
          that there are many things that should make you valiant for God and
          for his truth. The first thing I will bring to your remembrance is the
          fact, that this warfare in which you are engaged is an hereditary
          warfare; it is not one which you began, but it is one which has been
          handed to you from the moment when the blood of Abel cried aloud for
          vengeance. Each martyr that has died has passed the blood-red flag to
          the next, and he in his turn has passed it on to another. Every
          confessor who has been nailed to the stake to burn, has lit his
          candle, and handed it to another, and said, |Take care of that!| And
          now here is the old |sword of the Lord and of Gideon.| Remember what
          hands have handled the hilt; remember what arms have wielded it;
          remember how often it has |pierced to the dividing asunder of the
          joints and marrow.| Will you disgrace it. Will you disgrace it? There
          is the great banner: it has waved in many a breeze; long ere the flag
          of this our land was made, this flag of Christ was born aloft, Will
          you stain it? Will you stain it? Will you not hand it to your
          children, still unsullied, and say, |Go on, go on; we leave you the
          heritage of war; go on, go on, and conquer. What your fathers did, do
          you again; still keep up the war, till time shall end.| I love my
          Bible because it is a Bible baptized with blood; I love it all the
          better, because it has the blood of Tyndal on it; I love it, because
          it has on it the blood of John Bradford, and Rowland Taylor, and
          Hooper; I love it, because it is stained with blood. I sometimes think
          I like the baptismal pool because that has been stained with blood,
          and is now upon the continent, forbidden by law. I love it, because I
          see in it the blood of men and of women who had been martyred, because
          they loved the truth. Will you not, then, stand by the banner of
          truth, after such an illustrious pedigree of warriors have held it in
          their hands?
        </p>
        <p>
          I would that I could have addressed you as I desired, but my voice
          fails me; I cannot, therefore, urge you, except by one consideration,
          and that is, the prospect of ultimate victory. It is certain that ere
          long we shall triumph; therefore let us not give up the fight. I have
          been much gratified of late to hear that there is a revival in the
          ranks of Christ's church; here and there I hear of great evangelists
          who are starting up. Some have said to me, when they have mentioned
          their names, |What say you to them?| My answer is, |Would God that all
          the Lord's servants were prophets!| Oh! that God might send thousands
          and thousands of men, who would gather multitudes together to hear his
          word. I would that the day were come, when every church and every
          chapel in England were as full of souls as this, and as large as this.
          I do think the churches are reviving; but if they are not, still
          victory is certain -- God will still get the victory; Jehovah will
          triumph. Satan may dream he will, but he will not. Therefore, men and
          brethren, on to victory; let the crown that is before you, nerve you
          to the fight; to victory; to victory; and on, on, on! for God is with
          you. Remember the great intercessor; Christ is on the hill, and whilst
          you are in the valley he pleads, and must prevail, therefore, go on,
          and conquer, for Christ's sake!
        </p>
        <p>
          I can no longer address you, but must finish up by repeating the words
          with which I always like to conclude my sermons: |He that believeth on
          the Lord Jesus and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth
          not shall be damned!| Oh! that ye would believe in Christ; oh! that
          God would give you faith to put your trust in him; this is the only
          way of salvation. |Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be
          saved.|
