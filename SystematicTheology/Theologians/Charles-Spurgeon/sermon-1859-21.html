        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.245)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, March 27th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>"No man cometh unto the Father, but by me." -- St. John 14:6.</p>
        <p>
          THERE ARE many men in this world, who so far from coming to God, are
          going as far as they can from him. Nothing would delight such men so
          much as to be clean rid of his presence, and to be entirely escaped
          from the bounds of his dominions. They would be content to make their
          bed in hell, if they could thus find a satisfactory answer to the
          question, "Whither shall I go from thy Spirit, or whither shall I flee
          from thy presence?" Their hearts are at enmity with God; they hate his
          words and his ways. They know that God is angry with them; and they in
          return are angry with God. There is another class, who are but very
          little in advance of these. It cannot be said of them, with the same
          emphatic meaning, that they actually hate God, but nevertheless they
          run from him. Perhaps they would indignantly repel a charge of
          abhorring God, but nevertheless, it is true of them, that they live in
          utter disregard of him. They say in their hearts "No God." God is not
          in all their thoughts. They may have sublime thoughts of nature, but
          few yearnings after him who made nature. They think much of time, and
          sense, and of the things that are below; but as to eternity and its
          substantial realities, the things that are unseen and everlasting,
          these they scarce can think upon. "Beware, ye that forget God," for
          your state is no better than the state of those I first described.
          "The wicked shall be turned into hell." those who hate God shall feel
          his torment, but so shall their companions, for thus runs the text,
          "The wicked shall be cast into hell with all the nations that forget
          God." It is not needful that you should hate God; that you should go
          to war with him in order to destroy yourself; the simple neglect of
          him is enough to ruin you. Thus has the apostle put it, "How shall we
          escape if we neglect so great salvation?" Ye need not fly upon the
          thick bosses of Jehovah's buckler, ye need not rush upon the point of
          his glittering spear. Stand still and do nothing; regard him not; shut
          your eyes to his existence, and engross yourself with the grovelling
          toys of earth, and ye have as surely destroyed yourselves, as if ye
          had defied him to his face. Neglect of God is the open gate of
          damnation. To forget God is to ensure a portion in the lake which
          burneth with fire and brimstone. There is to be found, however, upon
          the face of the earth a third class of men, who would not like to be
          classed among the enemies of God and who can truly say that they are
          not utterly indifferent with regard to his favor. They would prefer to
          be numbered with those who are seeking God. Their desire is to go to
          their Father. They may not as yet, perhaps, be brought to that only
          way at coming which he has ordained, but still their profession is
          that they desire to worship God, and to come before him with
          thanksgiving, and show themselves glad in him. It is to this very
          character, one that has so much that is hopeful in it, that I shall
          address myself particularly this morning; but indeed, to every one in
          this assembly, would I desire to preach the great truth of the text.
          No man -- desire he never so earnestly, labor he never so diligently
          -- no man cometh unto the Father, but by Jesus Christ.

        <p>
          When Adam was perfect in the garden of Eden, God walked with him in
          the cool of the day. God and man held the most intimate and
          affectionate intercourse with one another. Man was a happy creature,
          God was a condescending Creator, and the two met together and held
          sweet converse and communion. But from the moment when Adam touched
          the forbidden fruit, the way from God to man became blocked up, the
          bridge was broken down, a great gulph was fixed, so that if it had not
          been for the divine plan of grace, we could not have ascended to God,
          neither could God in justice come down to us. Happily, however, the
          everlasting covenant ordered in all things and sure, had provided for
          this great catastrophe. Christ Jesus the Mediator had in old eternity
          been ordained to become the medium of access between man and God. If
          you want a figure of him, remember the memorable dream of Jacob. He
          laid him down in a solitary place, and he dreamed a dream, which had
          in it something more substantial than anything he had seen with his
          eyes wide open. He saw a ladder, the foot whereof rested upon earth,
          and the top thereof reached to heaven itself. Upon this ladder he saw
          angels ascending and descending. Now this ladder was Christ. Christ in
          his humanity rested upon the earth, he is bone of our bone, and flesh
          of our flesh. In his divinity he reaches to the highest heaven, for he
          is very God of very God. When our prayers ascend on high they must
          tread the staves of this ladder, and when God's blessings descend to
          us, the rounds of this marvellous ladder must be the means of their
          descent. Never has a prayer ascended to God save through Jesus Christ.
          Never has a blessing come down to man save through the same Divine
          Mediator. There is now a highway, a way of holiness wherein the
          redeemed can walk to God, and God can come to us. The king's highway,
          --
        </p>
        <p>"The way the holy prophets went --</p>
        <p>The road that leads from banishment."</p>
        <p>Jesus Christ, the way, the truth, and the life.</p>
        <p>
          Let us think for a moment of Jesus Christ as the way to God. The
          reason why man cannot come to God as he did in the garden is, that God
          is the same, but man is changed. God is as affectionate and as
          condescending as ever, but man is unholy and impure. Now, God is as
          pure as he is affectionate, while God is love it is just as true that
          God is infinitely just and holy. His holy eyes cannot endure iniquity.
          If, then, a sinful creature could obtain access to God, if a
          rebellious creature could come into the immediate presence of the Most
          High, the effect must be disastrous in the extreme, for it would be a
          necessity of God's nature that he must utterly devour the creature in
          which he sees sin to be. Come into the presence of God, O sinner, and
          thou mightest as well march into a consuming fire. As Nebuchadnezzar's
          furnace burned the men who came to throw in the three holy children so
          must God, the consuming fire, burn and destroy us, even if we approach
          him with our prayers and thanksgivings, were it not for the
          interposition of Jesus Christ the Mediator. I say, this is a necessity
          of his nature. God is necessarily just, and justice cannot endure a
          sin. God is necessarily pure and holy: he might sooner cease to be God
          than cease to be pure. Now, the approach of impurity to him he must
          repel. Though no laws can bind him, yet the law of his nature never
          can be broken. His nature is, "I will by no means clear the guilty."
          He is slow to anger, he is great in power, and he is ready to forgive,
          but so long as guilt lies unforgiven he is also ready to punish, nay,
          he must punish or else cease to be. Consequently, no man can come to
          God as a sinner, unless he comes to him to be utterly destroyed, and
          that without remedy. You do not wish so to come to God. Happy is it,
          then, that we are enabled to tell to all our fellow-creatures of a way
          whereby we can come with joy and gladness to the Father, through Jesus
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, this morning I shall have to divide my subject into three or four
          heads, and notice. --
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Some men have a desire to come to God in worship, but there are
          many who desire to come to him the wrong way. You will sometimes meet
          with men who say, "Well, I do not go up to a church or chapel it is
          all ridiculous. I do not read the Bible; I have no faith in Christ;
          but I spend my Sunday in the open air -- in that glorious temple which
          God has built. How divinely can I worship him there, while the lark,
          singing, up to heaven's gate ascends;' while every flower tells me of
          him whose breath perfumes it, and whose pencil paints; while all the
          cattle on a thousand hills are lowing forth his his; praise feel that
          in his temple doth everyone speak of his glory. What need for me to go
          and hear what you call the gospel, to join in the united song of
          praise, or bend my knee in prayer? I worship the god of nature," says
          such a man, "not the God of revelation, but the god of nature." To
          this man we reply in the words of our text. Your thanksgiving and your
          praise are unacceptable to the God you worship, for that God has
          declared that no man cometh to him except through his Son, Jesus
          Christ. If then, you reject the way of access, and persist in bringing
          your prayers and your thanksgivings to him in a way which he does not
          acknowledge, remember, this shalt thou have as the answer to thy
          prayers and thy thanksgivings; thou shalt lie down in sorrow when God
          shall come to judge thee at the last great day. The true Christian can
          "go from nature up to natures God," because he has come from nature's
          God down to nature. No man can climb the steeps, and "go from nature
          up to nature's God," unless he has first descended. God must take thee
          up into the mount where he dwells, first, and then thou canst come
          down, as Moses did from the top of Sinai; but, until he hath caught
          thee up thither, thy weary feet shall be exhausted, and thy strength
          decay, ere thou canst reach the God of nature through his works. Not
          my friend, you may be very sincere, as you imagine, in all your
          prayers and thanksgivings offered to the unpropitiated God of nature,
          in your garden, or in the fields, but, sincere though they be, they
          miss the mark; they are not shot from a bow which is strong enough to
          carry them to their desired target. They miss the mark, I say, and
          they shall fall back on thine own head to thy injury, but they shall
          not reach the throne of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I observe here, that those men who talk about natural religion, as
          far as I know them, have no religion at all. I have noticed that the
          people who say, "I can worship God without attending any religious
          service, or believing in Jesus," do not really do so. I have sometimes
          had an opportunity on a Sunday of seeing many worshippers of the god
          of nature come down the lane where I reside. They consist, for the
          most part, of men who carry cages with them in which to catch birds on
          the common. There is another very respectable confraternity of men,
          who go to a boxing-place somewhere about there, where they spend their
          day in the bowling alley, and divers pugilistic encounters. These
          might adopt the cry of our genteel sinners, "We don't want to go into
          a church or chapel: we spend our Sunday in the worship of the god of
          nature." And very fine worship it is. I mostly find that those people
          who worship the "god of nature" worship the god of fallen nature --
          that is, the devil: not the God of the glorious nature which is spread
          about us in the roaring sea, the rolling flood and the blooming meads
          -- no, for the most part, the men who talk like that, know in their
          own conscience, that the god they worship, is their belly, their own
          lusts; and they glory in their shame. Don't believe all the nonsense
          that you hear from the Sunday league and all that, when they talk
          about worshipping the god of nature. Do they do it? Follow any of them
          into their privacy, and see whether any of this fine devotion of
          theirs, has any existence whatever, and I think you will discover at
          once, that they are greater hypocrites than the men they call
          hypocrites.
        </p>
        <p>
          But again, is it not rather a suspicious circumstance, that these men
          who are so much ahead of us, that they worship the god of nature
          prefer the company, according to their own confession, of sheep, and
          bullocks and horses, and skylarks, to the presence of the saints of
          God? It looks rather suspicious, when a man finds more congenial
          company in a sheepfold than he does in an assembly of intelligent
          beings. It looks as if his own mind were brutish, when he can never
          get his spirit wound up into devotion till he gets into the midst of
          brutes. For my part, I feel more able to worship God in the great
          congregation, in the assembly of the saints, than anywhere else: "In
          the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem;
          praise ye the Lord!" I know that all his works praise him. It is my
          joy to feel, that the changing seasons are but the varied God: that
          spring speaks of his tenderness and love, summer of his majesty,
          autumn of his bounty, and winter of his awful power: but still I know,
          that in his sanctuary I behold his glory yet more fully, and there I
          discover him to my heart's solace and delight. The true Christian can
          worship God in nature; but a man who has not learnt to worship God in
          his house, I am quite sure has not learnt to worship God anywhere.
          Natural religion is just a lie; men may say much about it, but it does
          not exist. Trace these Pharasaic members of the synagogue of Satan to
          their homes, and you will find that they make this natural religion an
          excuse for religion. It is an utter impossibility for any man to come
          to God in worship, save through Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          See, then, how my text shuts out of all acceptance with God all those
          who do not receive Christ to be the Son of God, the Mediator. Men
          sometimes say, "All are right; whether they are Jews or Gentiles,
          whatever they may be, they are all right." Now, be it understood once
          for all, that the religion of Christ gives no heed to such a fancy. It
          claims for itself alone the solitary throne in the kingdom of
          religious truth. It uses no chains and racks to obtain an unwilling
          profession of its faith; but the unbeliever is not flattered with
          promises of security, but, rather, he is threatened with a doom
          dreadful beyond all thought. There is not, in this book of God, one
          single sentence which could lead me to believe that there is a way to
          God for the Mahomedan, for the Jew, or for any one who does not come
          to him through Jesus Christ. The religion of Christ is exclusive in
          this. It declares, that other foundation can no man lay, than that
          which is laid, Jesus Christ. It declares that no man can come to God
          except through Jesus. All the charity of which some men talk is
          deceitful and valueless. We can have no hope for those who receive not
          Christ. We pity them, we love them, we pray for them, we plead for
          them that they may be brought to this; but we dare not deceive them,
          we dare not tell them that God will hear their prayers, if they will
          not come to him through Jesus Christ. No, we will be as tolerant as
          Jesus was, but Jesus himself said, "He that believeth not must be
          damned," and whatever thou mayest be, -- Unitarian, Socinian, infidel,
          deist, theist, or what-not, however sincere thy prayers, God abhors
          and hates them if thou dost not offer them through Jesus Christ, the
          one way between the sinner and God.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Other men there are who, conselous that they cannot come to God as
          perfect beings in the crazy of worship, desire to approach him in the
          way of penitence. But mark, even in the way of penitence, no man can
          come to God except through Jesus Christ. Those tears in thine eyes,
          when Jesus the sun of righteousness shines on them, are as diamonds in
          the esteem of the God of mercy; but even thy tears, and sighs, and
          groans, cannot prevail with the heart of God, unless they be mingled
          with a humble faith in Jesus Christ his only Son. In vain thou weepest
          till thine eyes are red to blindness; in vain thou groanest till thy
          ribs burst with thine expanding heart of agony, in vain thou kneelest
          till thy knees are stiff with prayer: God hears thee not, he accepts
          thee not, until thou makest mention of Jesus the crucified, his Son,
          the Saviour of mankind. Oh! it is mournful to see how men try to
          approach God in any way but through Jesus Christ. You have the Romish
          church putting men to penance, in order that they may so come to God.
          It was but one day this week I went into a Romish cathedral, and
          there, to my disgust and horror, I saw poor women on their knees,
          going entirely round the cathedral having as a penance to pray before
          a whole set of pictures that were exhibited upon the walls. Well, I
          thought, if this be acceptable to their God, I am sure it would not be
          to mine. To give these poor women the rheumatism, or something worse,
          in order that God might be pleased with them, is the most
          extraordinary way of going to work that I know of. What a God must
          theirs be, that is pleased with poor souls when they torture
          themselves. Behold the monk -- if he would gratify his god, he must
          not wash himself; for their god is a god of filth, and according to
          their own confession, cleanliness is not acceptable to him. Again, he
          must fast -- their god is a god of starvation; it is quite clear he is
          not our God, -- for he is a God of bounty. The poor monk must flog
          himself: he must flagellate his poor back till the blood runs down in
          streams, their god delights in the blood of his creatures, evidently
          and nothing pleases him so much, according to their own confession, as
          for his creatures to torture themselves. Happily however, their god
          has nothing whatever to do with our God. Their god is an old Romish
          pagan demon that was cursed of old and is cursed now; but our God is a
          God who takes delight in the happiness of his creatures, who, if there
          be any merit anywhere, would sooner see it in our happiness than in
          our sorrow, although, mark you, there is no merit in either. When we
          come to God in penitence we must bring but one oblation, for there is
          but one way of offering acceptable penitence to God, and that is
          through Jesus Christ our Lord. We will imagine there is a man over
          yonder who is feeling that he has been guilty, but he desires to be
          forgiven. "Oh!" says he, "I know I am guilty; I feel that I deserve
          God's wrath. Well, I will promise I will never be drunk again; I will
          not swear make a resolution that I will be better." Ah! friend; ah!
          friend! you will never come to God in penitence that way. O man, that
          way -- that way of works -- is a way of death. The very first time
          thou puttest thy foot on it I can hear the low mutterings of the
          thunder-curse: "Cursed is every man that continueth not in all things
          that are written in the book of the law to do them." Go on with thy
          resolves; try to carry them out; thou shalt find that this road of
          thine will grow more difficult every day. The more thou dost the more
          thou wilt have to do; when thou hast climbed a hill, thou wilt see a
          mountain beyond, when thou hast forded a stream, thou wilt see a sea
          before thee, and no means of crossing it. The way to heaven through
          good works would be a very hard one, even if it were a possible one.
          Conscience is like the horse-leech -- it always cries, "Give, give,
          give." Conscience is never satisfied with the best works that we can
          do; it always wants more. But ah, I remind thee, man, that if thou
          goest on in that way of works, and seekest to be forgiven through it,
          thy destruction is as sure as if thou didst run in the way of sin.
          Mark thee, man, the Jews of old would not accept the righteousness of
          Christ, and they went about to establish their own righteousness, and
          would not submit themselves to the righteousness of Christ, and hence
          they perished, and that without mercy. And so shall you. O turn from
          that way! God will not receive thee in it; turn from it! then. If you
          were perfect, and had never broken God's law at all, then might you be
          saved by the law; but one sin breaks the law to shivers, and thou
          canst not mend the breach. Thou art lost if thou standest on the
          footing of works. Come away! then, come away! come to the cross of
          Christ! There is no way to heaven but by Jesus Christ; come! both from
          thy works and thy sins; look to him and live; look to him and see thy
          sins forgiven; look to him, and behold thy penitence accepted, and a
          gracious answer given.

          III. There are other men who feel, "Well, we know Jesus must forgive
          our sins, it is through his sufferings that I must be pardoned; but,"
          say they, "we desire now to be acceptable to God all the days of our
          life; we will therefore endeavor to come to God in a way in which he
          shall accept us." Many there are that light upon a way like this, "We
          will be very scrupulous," say they, "in all our transactions, exact in
          our dealings with men, and bountiful in our liberality to God; in this
          way shall we be accepted. Christ," say they, "shall be trusted to take
          away our sins but we will have the clothing of ourselves with a robe
          of righteousness; we will let Christ wash us, and wash our works too,
          if he pleases; but at least we will be the manufacturers of our own
          virtues and excellencies. God shall accept us through what we do;
          Jesus shall make up the deficiency he shall darn a hole or two that
          may occur in the garment, but nevertheless we will stick to the old
          cloth throughout and though we do hear that our righteousnesses are as
          filthy rags, yet we will have them washed, and wear them over again,
          rags though they be." Now, mark, my hearers, as when we come to God
          first we must bring nothing with us but the blood of Christ, so when
          we come to him afterwards, we must still bring nothing but the same
          offering. A guilty sinner, when he approaches God's throne, can never
          be pardoned, except by pleading the blood once shed by Christ, and the
          highest saint, the most eminent believer, can no more be accepted by
          God than the meanest sinner, unless he still pleads the blood and
          righteousness of Jesus Christ. The Arminian, despite his denial of it,
          has in his own mind, a notion that his acceptance with God in some
          measure depends upon his own actions. Although many Arminian divines
          say, that they do not believe this, yet they must nevertheless believe
          it; it lies at the very root and basis of their fallen doctrine. They
          do believe, that let the Christian fall into sin, God will cast him
          out of his family, and I say it follows as a necessary influence, that
          the acceptance of a Christian must on that theory, depend on good
          works; so that in coming to God he comes through his own good
          behavior, and not through what Jesus did. Now, mark, this is an
          egregious falsehood, and as damnable an error as if I were to preach
          that salvation was entirely by works. There is no part of the
          Christian's experience in which a Christian can deal with God
          otherwise than through Christ. At the beginning it is all through
          Christ; in the middle it is all through Christ; and in the end it must
          be the same. If it were possible for thee, my brother, to be clean rid
          of sin, yet thou couldest not come to God except through Christ. When
          thy faith shall grow into assurance, when the follies of thy life
          shall all be expunged, when thy character shall be saintly, when thy
          heart shall be perfectly sanctifed, even then the means of access and
          the mode of acceptance of thy soul before God will remain unalterable
          and unchanged. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, the path for the sinner and the
          way for the saint. No road to God -- even for the holiest man -- no
          road to God's acceptance, but through Jesus, and through Jesus only.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do we not each of us in ourselves at times an aptness to come to God
          in some other way than through Jesus Christ? "Now you have preached
          well," says Satan; "you have been successful in such-and-such a labor.
          Ah!" says the devil, "how liberal you have been in such-and-such a
          cause. Now go to God in prayer." And we go, and we pray with such
          assurance; we think we are sure to be heard. But perhaps without our
          knowing it, there is lurking at the bottom of our excellent fluency in
          prayer an evil thought that surely God will hear us, for we have been
          so diligent, and liberal. And on the other hand, when we have been
          committing sin, when conscience chides us, then we go to the throne,
          and we are half afraid, because we say God will not hear us. Is not
          that still pride? Why, were we ever better than we are now? Were we
          not always, and are we not now, as bad as ever we can be? In ourselves
          is there anything that can commend us to God? Is not the very fact
          that when in our good state we come boldly, and when in our low state
          we come timidly, proof that there is lurking in us a secret suspicion
          that we are to come to God by something that is in us? Oh! if we could
          but learn this truth and stand to it, that our acceptance with God
          depends upon nothing that we do or can do, nothing that we can think,
          or feel, or be, but depends wholly and entirely and solely upon what
          Jesus is, and what he has done, and what he has suffered, let us once
          get that thought -- and it is in the text -- we shall then be able, by
          the divine assistance of the Holy Spirit, to come to God at all times
          with boldness, knowing that we were so coming through Christ, and
          therefore we might always come boldly to the throne of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have I here to-day? -- I am sure I have -- some timid soul that is
          afraid to come to God through Christ? Ah! my dear brother, I know thy
          fear, and I can pity thee; but I know thy fear, and I can blame thee
          too. What! art thou afraid to come to God through Christ, and dost
          thou want some one to speak to Christ for thee? Oh! foolish heart! You
          do need a Mediator in coming to God, but you do not need any in coming
          to Christ. Go to him just as you are, without making yourself any
          better; go straight away, rags, and sin, and leprosy, and blotches,
          and sores, and all, straight away to him. Do not be afraid that the
          Father will reject you if you come alone through him. Let me lead you
          my poor timid brother to this way. Come with me. Do you see yon cross?
          Do you mark that glorious man dying on it in agonies that cannot be
          described? Do you not think that those sufferings are enough to
          expiate the wrath of God? Why, hear him! Will you not believe what he
          says? -- "It is finished!" he cries ere he gives up the ghost. Now, if
          Jesus thought it finished, do you not think it so? If he himself
          thought that he had done enough, is not that enough for you that is
          enough for him? Come boldly, for Jesus smiles upon you. His blood is
          dropping; his heart is still flowing with the blood and water. Come!
          none ever were cast out; shalt thou be the first? Those arms that are
          nailed to the cross are wide open, as if they would show thee that
          they can receive the biggest of sinners. Those feet that are nailed to
          the cross are fastened there as if they meant to stop there, and wait
          to be gracious to thee. O see you his pierced side, it seems as if it
          said to thee, "My heart is not hard to reach. See there is a straight
          road to it opened by the Roman spear. Come, breathe thy sighs into my
          heart, and I will hear and answer." Come, soul! Come to this way. How
          safe it is, for o'er it hangs the banner of Jehovah's love; and on the
          ground is the bloodmark of the Saviour's footsteps. This gory pathway
          to the throne of God, I now entreat thee to enter. Jesus made it;
          Jesus smoothed it; Jesus dyed it with his blood. The stain ran; all
          along a purple clue. to guide thee through the labyrinths of all thy
          doubts and fears. Come, come away poor soul! Come put thy trust alone
          in Jesus, and then, thou need'st not come to God the Father with
          trembling and with dismay. God help thee, timid one, God help thee.
          Thou hast no need to despond: Jesus saith he will cast out none that
          come to him by faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. I shall not keep you much longer, but I must now observe, that
          there are others who desire to come to God in communion. You will meet
          every now and then with a devout man who has but very imperfect
          notions of the gospel, and who, nevertheless, has a kind of reverence
          for the living God. He is an astronomer, and he will tell you that an
          undevout astronomer is mad; he says, that while his eyes look through
          the telescope glass upon the wondrous worlds that float in ether, he
          communes with God, marvels at his power, and admires his matchless
          benevolence and skill. The geologist, too, will tell you, that when
          digging into the deep foundations of the world and bringing out those
          old inhabitants, who in days of yore stalked through gigantic forests,
          he feels he can talk with God the Eternal One; that those grey hairs
          of an ancient world remind him of the Ancient of days, and the bones
          of a buried generation, all remind him of the Eternal One, who was
          before all things, and by whom all things consist. Now, these men are
          sincere; but do not imagine for an instant that their devotion is
          acceptable, or that their communion is true and real, unless in this
          they tincture and savor their communion with the knowledge, that Jesus
          Christ is the only way of access to God. Oh, soul, if thou wouldest
          walk with God, as Adam did in Eden, and it is quite possible; it thou
          wouldest walk with him as Enoch did, and that is quite possible, too;
          if thou wouldest see him face to face, and talk to him as a man would
          talk with his friend, remember thou must be set in the cleft of the
          rock Christ Jesus, or else thou canst not do it. Once let a man stand
          in that cleft and see Jesus' blood, then he can commune with God in
          nature readily enough. Standing at the foot of the mountain he may see
          that hill like a wedge piercing the ebon darkness, and his soul may
          climb the summit and enter into the invisible; he may look upon that
          awful summit as upon an ambassador sent from earth to heaven; and his
          spirit may seem to rise on the mountain top, until it appears to grasp
          the hand of the Almighty One. But mark, the steep summit of fellowship
          cannot be climbed, except Jesus Christ lend himself to be the sacred
          ladder, and gives strength to the weary footsteps of our faith. He is
          the way to God; he is the truth to guide us; be is the life to enable
          us to run in the road. Without Christ there is no way to communion, no
          truth in communion, and no life in our pretended fellowship.
          Christian, take heed that thou never triest to commune with God except
          through Jesus Christ. Never try to commune with him even through the
          Holy Spirit, if thou forgettest Christ. The Holy Spirit acts the
          communion; but still Christ is the medium through which it flows. The
          Holy Spirit runs through Christ as through a channel. As water from
          the conduit runs through the pipe, so fellowship must run through
          Jesus Christ. There can be no coming of God to us, and no going of our
          soul to God, except through the highway of communion, Jesus Christ,
          the man and yet the God.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. And lastly, to conclude: Who is there among us who does not desire
          to come to God in heaven? Lives there a man with soul so dead that he
          has no pantings for another and a better world? Is there a heart so
          seared that it never longs to be at rest -- an eye so blind that it
          never looks into the hereafter, and a soul so stolid that it never
          leaps with exulting spirit, in the prospect of a world of joy and
          happiness? The wild untutored savage of the woods looks to another
          world, and when some beloved one is buried, he lights a fire upon the
          grave, to light the spirit through the dreary shades of death, that it
          may find its way to paradise; and then he sits upon the grave, when
          the fire is quenched, and days of the spirit that is gone, and hopes
          for it that it has gone to the kingdom of the blessed, to the land of
          the hereafter. Never is he content, unless he hopes that the spirit of
          his beloved one is gone to a better land. And shall it be imagined
          that any of us who are living in a Christian country are shutting our
          eyes to the future, and never think of looking beyond the grave there
          are many here -- nay, all of us are longing for another and a better
          world. O world of woe, what wert thou, if thou wert not a
          stepping-stone to a world of bliss? O land of graves and shrouds, of
          pick-axe and of spade, what wert thou if we did not dive through thee
          into the land of light? O vale of tears, what wert thou, if it were
          not that thou art the pathway to the mountain of transfiguration? O
          valley of Baca, filled with tears of sorrow, till the pools thereof
          are overflowing! what wert thou, if thou didst not lead to the
          tabernacles of our God, the peaceful sanctuary in which we hope to
          dwell?
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is no way to heaven, whatever our hopes may be, but through
          Christ. O spirit of man, there is no way to the gates of pearl but
          through the bleeding side of Jesus. These are the gates of paradise --
          these bleeding wounds. If thou wouldst find thy way to God's bright
          throne, find first thy way to Jesus' shameful cross; if thou wouldst
          know the way to happiness, tread in that path of misery which Jesus
          trod. What! attempt another way? Man, art thou mad enough to think
          that thou canst rend the posts, and bars, and gates of heaven from
          their perpetual places, and force thy way by thy created strength? The
          arm of God shall dash thee down to the nethermost pit. Or dost thou
          think to purchase with thy riches and thy gold a foothold in paradise?
          Fool! what is thy gold where streets are made of it, and where the
          gates are solid pearl -- where the foundations are of jasper, and the
          walls whereof are precious gems? And dost thou think to get there by
          thy merits? Ah! fool that thou art, by pride fell the angels, and by
          thy pride thou fallest. In thy talking of merit thou confessest that
          thou art Lucifer himself incarnate. Away with thee! Heaven is not for
          such as thou art. But dost thou say, "I will leave my wealth after I
          have gone. I will build an hospital, or feed the poor." Then let men
          pay thee. Thou hast wrought for thy nation, let them pay the debt; let
          them rear the stony pillar, and set thy effigy upon the top thereof.
          If thou hast wrought for thy country, let thy country pay thee what
          they owe to thee. But God, what does he owe to thee? Thou hast
          forgotten him, thou hast despised his Son, thou hast rejected his
          gospel. Be thou warrior, statesman, patriot -- let men pay thee; God
          owes thee nothing, and all thou canst do will not bribe him to admit
          thee to his palace, if thou comest not in the right way through Jesus
          Christ, who lived and died, and is alive for evermore, and hath the
          keys of heaven at his girdle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, now, ye that have nothing to bring, come to Christ this morning,
          ye perishing, ye guilty, and ye lost. God a ambassador stands before
          you, and as though Christ did woo you, he pleads with you to come to
          Jesus now. Ye that are under conviction of sin, and want salvation,
          believe on him now. In thine heart poor sinner, say --
        </p>
        <p>"Just as I am, without one plea,</p>
        <p>But that thy blood was shed for me,</p>
        <p>And that thou bidd'st me come to thee,</p>
        <p>O Lamb of God, I come."</p>
        <p>
          The invitation is freely given, the proclamation is openly made. My
          God is not a God of hatred and of anger; he is a God of love. He bids
          you who are thirsty, who are longing to see his face, he bids you now
          come; and he tells you, and he confirms the same with an oath -- "As I
          live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the
          wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn
          ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?" Come
          now! "The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth
          say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let
          him take the water of life freely." O Spirit of God! draw sinners to
          Christ! O glorious One! do thou be pleased now to draw them to the
          Father, through Jesus Christ, the Son of God.<br />
