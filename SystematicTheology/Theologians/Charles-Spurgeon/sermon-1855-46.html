        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.49)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, November 4, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>"Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen," -- Romans 15:33.</p>
        <p>
          PAUL ONCE ADVISED the Romans to strive. Three verses before our text
          he actually gives them an exhortation to strive, and yet he here
          utters a prayer that the God of peace might be with them all. Lest you
          should think him to be a man of strife, you must read the verse. He
          says: "Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake,
          and for the love of the spirit, that ye strive together with me in
          your prayers to God for me." That is a holy strife, and such a strife
          as that we wish always to see in the church, a strife in prayer, a
          surrounding the throne together, besieging God's mercy seat, a crying
          out before God, until it actually amounts to a striving together in
          our prayers. There is also another kind of striving which is allowed
          in the church, and that is striving earnestly after the best gifts: a
          sweet contention which of us shall excel all others in love, in duty,
          and in faith. May God send us more strife of that kind in our
          churches, a strife in prayer, a strife in duty; and when we have
          mentioned these strifes we find them of so peaceable a kind that we
          come back to the benediction of our text: "Now the God of peace be
          with you all. Amen." Without any preface, we shall consider, first,
          the title -- "the God of peace;" and secondly, the benediction -- "the
          God of peace be with you all. Amen."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First of all, the title. Mars amongst the heathens was called the
          god of war; Janus was worshipped in periods of strife and bloodshed;
          but our God Jehovah styles himself not the God of war, but the God of
          peace. Although he permits ware in this world, sometimes for necessary
          and useful purposes; although he superintends them, and has even
          styled himself the Lord, mighty in battle, yet his holy mind abhors
          bloodshed and strife; his gracious spirit loves not to see men
          slaughtering one another, he is emphatically, solely, and entirely,
          and without reserve, "the God of peace." Peace is his delight; "peace
          on earth and goodwill towards men." Peace in heaven (for that purpose
          he expelled the angels): peace throughout his entire universe, is his
          highest wish and his greatest delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you consider God in the trinity of his persons for a few moments,
          you will see that in each -- Father, Son, and Holy Ghost -- the title
          is apt and correct, "the God of peace." There is God the everlasting
          Father, he is the God of peace, for he from all eternity planned the
          great covenant of peace, whereby he might bring rebels nigh unto him,
          and make strangers and foreigners fellow-heirs with the saints, and
          joint-heirs with his Son Christ Jesus. He is the God of peace, for he
          justifies, and thereby implants peace in the soul, he accepted Christ,
          and, as the God of peace, he brought him again from the dead; and he
          ordained peace, peace eternal with his children, through the blood of
          the everlasting covenant; he is the God of peace. So is Jesus Christ,
          the second person, the God of peace for "he is our peace who hath made
          both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between
          us." He makes peace between God and man. His blood sprinkled on the
          fiery wrath of God turned it to love, or rather that which must have
          broken forth in wrath, though it was love for ever, was allowed to
          display itself in loving-kindness through the wondrous mediatorship of
          Jesus Christ; and he is the God of peace because he makes peace in the
          conscience and in the heart. When he says, "Come unto me all ye that
          are heavy laden "he gives "rest," and with that rest he gives; the
          peace of God which passeth all understanding," which keeps our heart
          and mind. He is moreover the God of peace in the Church, for wherever
          Jesus Christ dwells, he creates a holy peace. As in the case of Aaron
          of old, the ointment poured upon the head of Christ trickles down to
          the very skirts of his garments, and thereby he gives peace, -- peace
          by the fruit of the lips, and peace by the fruit of the heart, unto
          all them that love Jesus Christ in sincerity. So is the Holy Ghost the
          God of peace. He of old brought peace, when chaotic matter yeas in
          confusion, by the brooding of his wings: he caused order to appear
          where once there was nothing but darkness and chaos. So in dark
          chaotic souls he is the God of peace. When winds from the mountains of
          Sinai, and gusts from the pit of hell sweep across the distressed
          soul; when, wandering about for rest, our soul fainteth within us, he
          speaks peace to our troubles, and gives rest to our spirits. When by
          earthly cares we are tossed about, like the sea-bird, up and down, up
          and down, from the base of the wave to the billows' crown, he says,
          "Peace be still." He it is who on the Sabbath-day brings his people
          into a state of serenity, and bids them enjoy
        </p>
        <p>"That holy calm, that sweet repose</p>
        <p>Which none but he that feels it knows."</p>
        <p>
          And he shall be the God of peace when at life's latest hour he shall
          still the current of Jordan, shall hush all the howlings of the
          fiends, shall give us peace with God through Jesus Christ, and land us
          safe in heaven. Blessed Trinity! however we consider thee, whether as
          Father, Son, or Holy Ghost, still is thy name thrice well deserved,
          the God of peace, and the God of love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now enter into the subject, and see wherein God is a God of
          peace. We remark that he is the God of peace, for he created peace
          originally. He is the God of peace, for he is the restorer of it;
          though wars have broken out through sin. He is the God of peace,
          because he preserves peace when it is made; and he is the God of peace
          because he shall ultimately perfect and consummate peace between all
          his creatures and himself. Thus he is the God of peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, he is the God of peace because he created nothing but
          peace. Go back in your imagination to the time when the majestic
          Father stepped from his solitude and commenced the work of creation.
          Picture to yourself the moment when he speaks the word and the first
          matter is formed. Before that time there had been neither space, nor
          time, nor aught existing, save himself. He speaks and it is done, he
          commands and it stands fast. Behold him scattering from his mighty
          hands stars as numerous as the sparks from an anvil. Witness how by
          his word worlds are fashioned, and ponderous orbs roll through that
          immensity which first of all he had decreed to be their dwelling
          place. Lift up now your eyes and behold these great things which he
          has created already, let the wings of your fancy carry you through the
          immensity of space and the vast profound, and see if you can discover
          anywhere the least sign or trace of war. Go through it from the north
          even to the south, from the east even unto the west, and mark well if
          ye can discover one sign of discord; whether there is not one
          universal harmony, whether everything is not lovely, pure, and of good
          report. See if in the great harp of nature, there is one string which
          when touched by its Maker's finger giveth forth discord, see if the
          pipes of this great organ God has made do not all play harmoniously,
          mark ye well, and note it. Are there bulwarks formed for war? Are
          there spears and swords? Are there clarions and trumpets? Hath God
          created any material with which to destroy his creatures and desolate
          his realms? No; everything is peaceable above, beneath, and all
          around; all is peace, there is nothing else but calm and quietness.
          Hark when he makes the angels. He speaks -- winged seraphs fly abroad,
          and cherubs flash through the air on wings of fire. He speaks, and
          multitudes of angels in their various hierarchies are brought forth,
          while Jesus Christ as a mighty Prince of angels is decreed to be their
          head. Is there now in any one of those angels one sign of sorrow? When
          God made them did he make one of them to be his enemy? Did he fashion
          one of them with the least implacability or ill-will within his bosom?
          Ask the shining cohorts, and they tell you, "We were not made for war,
          but for peace. He has not fashioned us spirits of battle, but spirits
          of love, and joy, and quietness." And if they sinned, he made them not
          to sin. They did so; they brought woe into the world of their own
          accord. God created no war. The evil angel brought it first. Left to
          his free will, he fell. The elect angels being confirmed by grace,
          stood fast and firm; but God was not the author of any war, or any
          strife. Satan of himself conceived the rebellion, but God was not the
          author of it. He may from all eternity have foreseen it, and it may
          even be said in some sense that he ordained it to manifest his justice
          and his glory, and to show his mercy and sovereignty in redeeming man;
          but God had no hand in it whatsoever. The Eternal abjures war; he was
          not the author of it. Satan led the van, that morning star who sang
          together with the rest, fell of himself, God was not the author of his
          confusion, but the author of eternal and blessed order. Look, too at
          God in the creation of this world. Go into the garden of Eden: walk up
          and down its bowers; recline under its trees, and partake of its
          fruits. Roam through the entire world. Sit down by the sea-shore, or
          stretch yourself upon the mountain. Do you see the least sign of war?
          Nothing like it. There is nothing of tumult and of noise no
          preparation of destruction. See Adam and Eve: their days are perpetual
          sunshine, their nights are balmy evenings of sweet repose. God has put
          nothing in their hearts which can disturb them; he has no ill will
          towards them, but on the contrary, he walks with them in the evening
          under the trees in the cool of the day. He condescends to talk with
          his creatures, and hold fellowship with them. He is in no sense
          whatever the author of the present confusion in this world; that was
          brought about by our first parents through the temptation of the evil
          one. God did not create this world for strife. When he first fashioned
          it, peace, peace, peace, was the universal order of the day. May there
          come a time when peace once more shall be restored to this great
          earth, and tranquility to this world! Do you not observe that God is
          the God of peace because he created it originally? When he pronounced
          his creation "very good," it was entirely without the slightest
          exception, a peaceful creation. God is the God of peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, secondly, he is the God of peace because he restores it. Nothing
          shows a man to be much fonder of peace than when he seeks to make
          peace between others; or, when others have offended him, he endeavors
          to make peace between himself and them. If I should be able at all
          times to maintain peace with myself, and should never provoke a
          quarrel, I should of course be considered a peaceful spirit, but if
          other persons choose to quarrel and disagree with me, and I desire and
          purposely set to work to bring about a reconciliation, then everyone
          says I am a man of peace. "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they are
          the children of God." God is the great Peacemaker; and thus he is
          indeed the God of peace. When Satan fell, there was war in heaven. God
          made peace there, for he smote Satan and cast him and all his rebel
          hosts into eternal fire. He made peace by his might and power and
          majesty, for he drove him out of heaven, and expelled him by his
          flaming brand, never again to pollute the sacred floor of bliss, and
          never more to endanger Paradise by misleading his peers in heaven. So
          he made peace in heaven by his power. But when man fell, God made
          peace not by his power, but by his mercy. Man transgresses. Poor man!
          Mark how God goes after him to make peace with him! "Adam, where art
          thou?" Adam never said "God, where art thou?" But God came after Adam,
          and he seemed to say with a voice of affection and pity, "Adam, poor
          Adam, where art thou? Hast thou become a God? The evil spirit said
          thou wouldst be a God, art thou so? Where art thou now poor Adam? Thou
          wast once in holiness and perfection, where art thou now?" And he saw
          the truant Adam running away from his Master, running away from the
          great Peacemaker, to hide himself beneath the trees of the garden.
          Again God calls, "Adam, where art thou?" But he says, "I heard thy
          voice in the midst of the garden, and I was afraid, because I was
          naked, and I hid myself." And God says, "Who told thee that thou wast
          naked?" How kind it is. You can see he is a Peacemaker even then; but
          when after having cursed the serpent, and sent the cursed obliquely on
          the ground, he comes to talk to Adam, you see him as the Peacemaker
          still more. "I will," said he, "put enmity between thee and the woman,
          between thy seed and her seed. It shall bruise thy head, and thou
          shalt bruise his heel." There he was making peace through the blood of
          the cross. Do not conceive, however that that was the first
          preparation of peace God ever made. That was the first display of it,
          but he had been making peace from all eternity. Through the covenant
          he made with Jesus Christ from all eternity, God's people were at
          peace with God. Although God saw that man shall fall; though he
          foresaw that his elect would with the rest depart from rectitude, and
          become his enemies, yet he did long before the fall draw up a covenant
          with Jesus, wherein Jesus stipulated that he would pay the debts of
          all his people, and the Father on their behalf did actually and
          positively forgive their sins, and justify their persons, take away
          their guilt, acquit them, accept and receive them unto peace with him.
          Though that was never developed until the fall, and though to each of
          us it is not known until we believe, yet there was always peace
          between God and the elect. I must tell you a tale of a poor bricklayer
          who met with an accident, and every one thought he was going to die,
          and he did die. A clergyman said to him, "My poor fellow, I am afraid
          you will die. Try to make your peace with God." With tears in his
          eyes, he looked the clergyman in the face, and said, "Make my peace
          with God, sir? I thank God that was made for me in the eternal
          covenant by Jesus Christ, long before I was born." So beloved, it was.
          There was a peace, a perfect peace which God made with his Son. Jesus
          was not our ambassador merely, but he was our peace; not the maker of
          peace merely, but our peace; and since there was a Christ before all
          worlds, there was peace before all worlds. Since there always will be
          a Christ, so there always will be peace between God and all those
          interested in the covenant. Oh, if we can but feel we are in the
          covenant, if we know we are numbered with the chosen race, and
          purchased with redeeming blood, then we can rejoice, because God has
          been to us the Restorer of breaches, the Builder of cities to dwell
          in, and hath given us peace which once we lost; he is the Restorer of
          peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, he is the preserver of peace. Whenever I see peace in the
          world, I ascribe it to God, and if it is continued, I shall always
          believe it is because God interferes to prevent war. So combustible
          are the materials of which this great world is made, that I am ever
          apprehensive of war. I do not account it wonderful that one nation
          should strive against another, I account if far more wonderful that
          they are not all at arms. Whence come wars and fightings? Come they
          not from your lusts? Considering how much lust there is in the world,
          we might well conceive that there would be more war than we see. Sin
          is the mother of wars; and remembering how plentiful sin is, we need
          not marvel if it brings forth multitudes of them. We may look for
          them. If the coming of Christ be indeed drawing nigh, then we must
          expect wars and rumors of wars through all the nations of the earth;
          but when peace is preserved, we consider it to be through the
          immediate interposition of God. If then we desire peace between
          nations, let us seek it of God, who is the great Pacificator; but
          there is an inward peace which God alone can keep. Am I at peace with
          myself, with the world, and with my Maker? Oh! if I want to retain
          that peace, God alone can preserve it. I know there are some people
          who once enjoyed peace, who do not possess it now. Some of you once
          had confidence in God, but may have lost it; you once thought
          yourselves to be in a glorious state from which now you seem to have
          somewhat departed. Beloved, no one can maintain peace in the heart but
          God, as he is the only one who can put it there. Some people talk
          about doubts and fears and seem to think they are very allowable. I
          have heard some say, "Well a sailor in the sunshine knows his
          reckoning, and can tell where he is, he has no doubt; but if the sun
          withdraws, he cannot tell his longitude and latitude, and he knows not
          where he is." That is not however a fair description of faith. Always
          wanting the sun is wanting to live by sight; but living by faith is to
          say, "I cannot tell my longitude and my latitude, but I know the
          Captain is at the helm, and I will trust him everywhere." But still
          you cannot keep in that peaceful state of mind unless you have God in
          the vessel to help you to smile at the storm. We can be peaceful at
          times, but if God goes away, how we begin quarrelling with ourselves!
          God alone can preserve peace. Backslider! hast thou lost it? Go and
          seek it again of God. Christian! is thy peace marred? Go to God, and
          he can say to every doubt, "tie down doubt," and to every fear,
          "Begone." -- He can speak to every wind that can blow across thy soul,
          and can say, "Peace, be still; "for he is the God of peace, since he
          preserves it. Trust in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly, God is the God of peace because he shall perfect and
          consummate it at last. There is war in the world now; there is an evil
          spirit walking to and fro, a restless being, eager, like a lion to
          devour, walking through dry places, seeking rest and finding none; and
          there are men bewitched by that evil spirit who are at war with God,
          and at war with one another; but there is a time coming -- let us wait
          a little longer -- when there shall be peace on earth and peace
          throughout all God's dominions. In a few more years we do look for a
          lasting and perpetual peace on earth. Perhaps, to-morrow, Jesus
          Christ, the Son of God will come again, without a sin offering unto
          salvation. We know not either the day or the hour wherein the Son of
          man shall come; but by-and-bye he shall descend from heaven with a
          shout, and with the noise of a trumpet; he shall come, but not as once
          he came, a lowly and humble man, but a glorious and exalted monarch.
          Then he will cause wars to cease. From that day forth and for ever
          they will hang the useless helm on high, and study war no more; the
          lion shall lie down with the kid and eat straw like the ox; the
          cockatrice and the serpent shall lose their hurtful powers; the weaned
          child shall lead the lion and the leopard, each one by his beard with
          his little hands. The day is coming, and that speedily, when there
          shall not be found on earth a single man who hates his brother, but
          when each one shall find in every other a brother and a friend; and we
          shall be able to say, as the old poet did, but in a larger sense, "I
          know not that there is one Englishman alive with whom I am one jot at
          odds more than the infant that is born to-night." We shall all be
          united; rationalities will be levelled, because made into one, and the
          Lord Jesus Christ shall be king of the entire earth. After that time
          shall come the consummation of peace, when the last great day shall
          have passed away, and the righteous have been severed from the wicked,
          when the monster battle of Armageddon shall have been fought and won
          when all the righteous shall have been gathered into heaven, and the
          lost sent down to hell. Where will be the room for the battle then?
          Look at the foemen, bruised and mangled in the pit, perpetually
          howling, the victims of God's vengence; there is no fear of war from
          them. There is Satan himself, crest-fallen, bruised battered, slain;
          his head is broken; there he lies despoiled a king without his crown;
          there can be no fear of war from him; and mark the angels, who were
          once under his supremacy, can they arise? No; they writhe in tortures,
          and bite their iron bands in misery; they have no power to lift a
          lance against the God of heaven; and look on sinful man, condemned for
          his sin to dwell with those fallen being; can he again provoke his
          Maker? Will he again blaspheme? Can he oppose the gospel? No, injured
          in dungeons of hot iron, there he is, an abject, ruined spirit; ten
          thousand times ten thousand lost and perished sinners are there; but
          could all unite in solemn league and covenant to break the bands of
          death and sever the laws of justice, he that sitteth in the heavens
          would laugh at them, the Lord would have them in derision. Peace is
          consummated because the enemy is crushed. They look up yonder; there
          is no fear of war from those bright spirits; the angels cannot fall
          now; their period of probation is passed for ever, a second Satan
          shall never drag with him a third part of the stars of heaven; no
          angel will totter any more, and the ransomed spirits, blood-bought,
          and washed in the fountain of Jesu's blood, will never fall again.
          Universal peace is come, the olive branch hath outlived the laurel the
          sword is sheathed, the banners are furled, the stains of blood are
          washed out of the world; again it moves in its orb, and sings like its
          sister stars; but the one song is peace, for the God who made it is
          the God of peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now we come to the benediction. "The God of peace be with you
          all." I am not about to address you concerning that inward peace which
          rests in the heart. I am sure I wish above all things that you may
          always enjoy a peace with your conscience, and be at peace with God.
          May you always know that you have the blood of Jesus to plead, that
          you have his righteousness to cover you, that you have his atonement
          to satisfy for you, and that there is nothing which can hurt you; but
          I wish to address you as a church, and exhort you to peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I will remind you that there is great need to pray this prayer
          for you all, because there are enemies to peace always lurking in all
          societies. Petrarch says there are five great enemies to peace --
          avarice, ambition, envy, anger, and pride. I shall alter them a
          little, but use the same number. Instead of avarice I shall commence
          with error. One of the greatest means of destroying peace is error.
          Error in doctrine leads to the most lamentable consequences with
          regard to the peace of the church. I have noticed that the greatest
          failings out have been among those who are most erroneous in doctrine.
          Though I admit that some called Calvinists are the most quarrelsome
          set breathing, this is the reason -- while they have the main part of
          the truth, many of them are leaving out something important, and
          therefore God chastices them because they are some of his best
          children. It may be a sign of life that they are so eager after truth,
          that they kill one another in order to get it; but I wish they would
          leave off their quarrelling for it is a disgrace to our religion. If
          they had more peace I might hope better for the progress of truth.
          Everyone says to me -- "Look there at your brethren! I never saw such
          a set of cut-throats in my life. I never saw a church, where they have
          the gospel, where they are not always falling out." Well, that is
          nearly the truth, and I am ashamed to confess it. I pray God, however,
          to send a little more peace where he has sent the gospel. There are,
          however, strifes among our opponents which we do not see. The bishop
          uses his strong hand, and the people dare not disagree; the pastor has
          such power and authority, that the crush of his mailed hand is
          sufficient to put down everything because there is no freedom. Now, I
          would rather have a row in the church than have the members all
          asleep. I would rather have them falling to ears than sitting down in
          indifference. You never expect dead churches to have strife, but where
          there is a little life, if there is error, it always begets strife.
          What is the most litigious denomination now existing? No one would
          have a difficulty in pointing to our excellent friends the Wesleyans,
          for just at this moment they are quarrelling and finding fault with
          one another, splitting up into numberless sections, and making
          reformed churches, and so on. What is the cause of it? Because they
          are in the wrong track altogether with regard to church government,
          and with regard to some other things. John Wesley was a good man at
          making churches, I dare say; but he did not understand what the church
          ought to be in these days. He might do for a hundred years ago but he
          bound his poor followers too tightly, and now they are trying to break
          out into freedom and liberty. If they had been right at first they
          might have gone on, and a thousand years would not have spoiled their
          system. It would have done now as well as then. Error is the root of
          bitterness in the church. Give us sound doctrine, sound practice,
          sound church government, and you will find that the God of peace will
          be with us. My brethren, seek to uproot error out of your own hearts.
          If one of you do not really believe the great cardinal doctrines of
          the gospel, I beseech you, then, for the good of the church to leave
          it, for we want those who love the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next enemy to peace is ambition. "Diotrephes loveth to have the
          pre-eminence," and that fellow has spoiled many a happy church. A man
          does not want, perhaps, to be pre-eminent, but then he is afraid that
          another should be, and so he would have him put down. Thus brethren
          are finding fault, they are afraid that such an one will go too fast,
          and that such another will go too fast. The best way is to try to go
          as fast as he does. It is of no use finding fault because some may
          have a little pre-eminence. After all, what is the pre-eminence. It is
          the pre-eminence of one little animalcule over another. Look in a drop
          of water. One of these little fellows is five times as big as another,
          but we never think of that. I dare say he is very large, and thinks,
          "I have the pre-eminence inside my drop." But he does not think the
          people of Park Street ever talk about him. So we live in this little
          drop of the world, not much bigger in God's esteem than a drop of the
          bucket, and one of us seems a little larger than the other, a worm a
          little above his fellow worm; but, O how big we get! and we want to
          get a little bigger, to get a little more prominent but what is the
          use of it? for when we get ever so big we shall then be so small teat
          an angel would not find us out if God did not tell him where we were.
          Whoever heard up in heaven anything about emperors and kings? Small
          tiny insects: God can see the animalculae, therefore he can see us,
          but if he had not an eye to see the most minute he would never
          discover us. O may we never get ambition in this church. The best
          ambition is, who shall be the servant of all. The strangers seek to
          have dominion, but children seek to let the father have dominion, and
          the father only.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next enemy to peace is anger. There are some individuals in the
          world that cannot help getting angry very quickly. They grow on a
          sudden very wrathful; while others who are not passionate, who take a
          longer time to be angry, are fearful enough when they do speak. Others
          who dare not speak at all, are worse still, for they get brewing their
          anger.
        </p>
        <p>"Nursing their wrath to keep it warm."</p>
        <p>
          They go into a sulky fit, disagreeing with everybody, eternally
          grumbling; they are like dogs in the flock -- only barking, and
          yielding no fleece. O that nasty anger! If it gets into the church it
          will split it to pieces. Somehow or other we cannot help getting angry
          sometimes. O that we could come into the church and leave ourselves
          behind us! There is nobody I should like to run away from half so much
          as from myself. Try, beloved, to curb your tempers; and when you do
          not exactly see with another brother, do not think it necessary to
          knock him on the eyes to make him see, that is the worst thing in all
          the world to do, he will not see any the better for it, for
        </p>
        <p>"The man convinced against his will,</p>
        <p>Is of the same opinion still."</p>
        <p>
          Then envy is another fearful evil. One minister, perhaps, is envious
          of another, because one church is full and the other not. How can
          teachers agree in the Sunday-school if there is any envy there? How
          can church members agree if envy creeps in? One member thinks another
          is thought more highly of than he deserves. Why, beloved, you are all
          too much thought of; but, after all, it does not matter what you are
          thought of by man, it only matters what God thinks of you -- and God
          thinks as much of Little-faith as of Great-heart; he thinks as much of
          Mrs. Despondency as of Christiana herself. Drive, then, that
          "green-eyed monster" away, and keep him at a distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, there is pride, which gives rise to ill-feeling and bad blood.
          Instead of being affable to one another, and "condescending to men of
          low estate," we want that every punctilio of respect should be given
          to us, that we should be made lords and masters. That I am sure can
          never exist in a peaceable church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, then, are our five great enemies. I would I could see the
          execution of them all Banish them, transport them for ever, send them
          away amongst lions and tigers; we do not want any of them amongst us;
          but though I thus speak, it is not because I conceive that any of
          these have thoroughly crept in amongst you, but because I would have
          kept them away. I am most jealous in this matter. I am always afraid
          of the slightest contention, and I desire the God of peace to be ever
          with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let me briefly show you the appropriateness of this prayer. We
          indeed ought to have peace amongst ourselves. Joseph said to his
          brethren when they were going home to his father's house, "See that ye
          fall not out by the way." There was something extremely beautiful in
          that exhortation. "See that ye fall not out by the way." Ye have all
          one father, ye are of one family. Let men of two nations disagree; but
          you are of the seed of Israel, you are of one tribe and nation; your
          home is in one heaven. "See that ye fall not out by the way." The way
          is rough; there are enemies to stop you. See that if ye fall out when
          ye get home, ye do not fall out by the way Keep together; stand by one
          another, defend each other's character, manifest continual affection,
          for recollect you will want it all. The world hateth you because you
          are not of the world. Oh! you must take care that you love one
          another. You are all going to the same house. You may disagree here,
          and not speak to one another, and be almost ashamed to sit at the same
          table even at the sacrament; but you will all have to sit together in
          heaven. Therefore do not fall out by the way. Consider, again, the
          great mercies you have all shared together. You are all pardoned, you
          are all accepted, elected, justified, sanctified, and adopted. See
          that ye fall not out when ye have so many mercies, when God has given
          you so much. Joseph has filled your sacks, but if he has put some
          extra thing into Benjamin's sack, do not quarrel with Benjamin about
          that, but rather rejoice because your sacks are full. You have all got
          enough, you are all secure, you have all been dismissed with a
          blessing, and, therefore, I say once more, "See that ye fall not out
          by the way."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, dear brethren is there anything I can plead with you this
          morning, in order that you may always dwell in peace and love? God has
          happily commenced a blessed revival amongst us, and under our means,
          by the help of God, that revival will spread through the entire
          kingdom. We have seen that "the word of the Lord is quick and
          powerful." We know that there is nothing that can stop the progress of
          his kingdom, and there is nothing that can impede your success as a
          church except this. If the unhappy day should arrive -- let the day be
          accursed when it does come -- when you amongst yourselves should
          disagree, there would be a stop to the building of the Lord's house at
          once, when those that carry the trowel and bear the spears do not
          stand side by side, then the work of God must tarry. It is sad to
          think how much our glorious cause has been impeded by the different
          failings out amongst the disciples of the Lamb. We have loved one
          another, brethren, up till now, with a true heart and fervently and I
          am not afraid but that we shall always do so. At the same time, I am
          jealous over you, lest there should come in by any possibility any
          root of bitterness to trouble you. Let us this morning throw around
          you the bands of a man, let us unite you together with a three-fold
          cord that cannot be broken, let us entreat you to love one another;
          let us entreat you by your one Lord, one faith, one baptism, to
          continue one; let us beg of you, by our great success, to let our
          unity be commensurate therewith. Remember "how good and how pleasant
          it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!" The devil wants you to
          disagree, and nothing will please him better than for you to fall at
          ears among yourselves. The Moabites and Anmonites cut down one
          another. Do not let us do that.
        </p>
        <p>"Those should in strictest concord dwell,</p>
        <p>Who the same God obey."</p>
        <p>
          It is continual bickering and jealousy that has brought disgrace upon
          the holy name of Christ. He has been wounded in the house of his
          friends. The arrows we have shot at one another have hurt us more than
          all that ever came from the bow of the devil. We have done more injury
          to the escutcheon of Christ by our contentions than Satan has ever
          been able to do. I beseech you, brethren, love one another. I know not
          how I could endure anything like discord among you. I can bear the
          scoff of the world, and the laughter of the infidel, methinks I could
          bear martyrdom; but I could not bear to see you divided. I beseech my
          God and Master to suffer me first to wear my shroud, before I ever
          wear a garment of heaviness on account of your divisions. While I feel
          that I have your love and affection, and that you are bound to one
          another, I care not for the devils in hell, nor for men on earth. We
          have been, and we shall be omnipotent, through God; and by faith we
          will stand firm to one another and to his truth. Let each one resolve
          within himself -- "if there is strife, I will have nothing to do with
          it." "The beginning of strife is like the letting out of water," and I
          will not turn the tap. If you will take care not to let the first drop
          in, I will be surety about the second. Brethren, again I say, for the
          gospel's sake, for the truth's sake, that we may laugh at our enemies,
          and rejoice with joy unspeakable, let us love one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though I may not have preached to the worldly this morning, I have
          been asking you to preach to them, for when you love one another, that
          is a beautiful sermon to them. There is no sermon like what you can
          see with your own eyes. I went to the Orphan-house, last Wednesday, on
          Ashley Down, near Bristol, and saw that wonder of faith -- I had some
          conversation with that heavenly-minded man Mr. Muller. I never heard
          such a sermon in my life as I saw there. They asked me to speak to the
          girls, but I said, "I could not speak a word for the life of me." I
          had been crying all the while to think how God had heard this dear
          man's prayer, and how all those three hundred children had been fed by
          my Father through the prayer of faith. Whatever is wanted, comes
          without annual subscriptions, without asking anything, simply from the
          hand of God. When I found that it was all correct that I had heard, I
          was like the queen of Sheba, and I had no heart left in me. I could
          only stand and look at those children, and think, did my heavenly
          Father feed them, and would he not feed me and all his family? Speak
          to them? They had spoken to me quite enough, though they had not said
          a word -- Speak to them? I thought myself ten thousand fools that I
          did not believe God better. Here am I, I cannot trust him day by day;
          but this good man can trust him for three hundred children. When he
          has not a sixpence in hand he never fears. "I know God," he might say,
          "too well to doubt him. I tell my God, thou knowest what I want to-day
          to keep these children, and I have not anything. My faith never
          wavers, and my supply always comes." Simply by asking of God in this
          way, he has raised (I believe) £17,000 towards the erection of a new
          orphan-house. When I consider that, sometimes think we will try the
          power of faith here, and see if we should not get sufficient funds
          whereby to erect a place to hold the people that crowd to hear the
          Word of God. Then we may have a tabernacle of faith as well as an
          orphan-house of faith. God send us that, and to Him shall be all the
          glory.<br />
