        <p>A Sermon</p>

        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, January 22nd, 1860, by the</p>

          "The forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace." --
          Ephesians 1:7.
        </p>
        <p>
          AS IS ISAIAH among the prophets, so is Paul among the apostles; each
          stands forth with singular prominence, raised up by God for a
          conspicuous purpose, and shining as a star of extraordinary
          brilliance. Isaiah spake more of Christ, and described more minutely
          his passion and his death than all the other prophets put together.
          Paul proclaimed the grace of God -- free, full, sovereign, eternal
          race -- beyond all the glorious company of the apostles. Sometimes he
          soared to such amazing heights, or dived into such unsearchable
          depths, that even Peter could not follow him. He was ready to confess
          that "our beloved brother Paul, according to his wisdom given unto
          him," had written "some things hard to be understood." Jude could
          write of the judgments of God, and reprove with terrible words,
          "ungodly men, who turned the grace of God into lasciviousness." But he
          could not tell out the purpose of grace as it was planned in the
          eternal mind, or the experience or grace as it is felt and realized in
          the human heart, like Paul. There is James again: he, as a faithful
          minister, could deal very closely with the practical evidences of
          Christian character. And yet he seems to keep very much on the
          surface; he does not bore down deep into the substratum on which must
          rest the visible soil of all spiritual graces. Even John, most
          favoured of all those apostles who were companions of our Lord on
          earth -- sweetly as the beloved disciple writes of fellowship with the
          Father and his Son Jesus Christ -- even John doth not speak of grace
          so richly as Paul, "in whom God first showed forth all long-suffering
          as a pattern to hem which should hereafter believe on him to life
          everlasting." Not, indeed, that we are at any liberty to prefer one
          apostle above another. We may not divide the Church, saying, I am of
          Paul, I of Peter, I of Apollos; but we may acknowledge the instrument
          which God was pleased to use; we may admire the way in which the Holy
          Ghost fitted him for his work; we may, with the churches of Judea,
          "glorify God in Paul." Among the early fathers Augustine was singled
          out as the "Doctor of Grace;" so much did he delight in those
          doctrines that exhibit the freeness of divine favour. And surely we
          might affirm the like of Paul. Among his compeers he outstripped them
          all in declaring the grace that bringeth salavation. The sense of
          grace pervaded all his thoughts as the life blood circulates through
          all the veins of one's body. Does he speak of conversion, "he was
          called by grace." Nay, he sees grace going before his conversion, and
          "separating him from his mother's womb." He attributes all his
          ministry to grace. "To me, who am less than the least of all saints,
          is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the
          unsearchable riches of Christ." See him at any time, and under any
          circumstances, whether bowed down with infirmity, or lifted to the
          third heavens with revelation, he has but one account to give of
          himself, "By the grace of God I am what I am."
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no ministers who contend so fully and so unflinchingly for
          free, sovereign, unconditional grace, as those who before their
          conversion have revelled in gross and outrageous sin. Your gentleman
          preachers who have been piously brought up, and sent from their cradle
          to school, from school to college, and from college to the pulpit,
          without encountering much temptation, or being rescued from the haunts
          of profanity -- they know comparatively little, and speak with little
          emphasis of free grace. It is a Bunyan who breathed curses, a Newton
          who was a ver monster in sin; it is the like of these, who cannot
          forget for one hour of their lives afterwards, the grace that snatched
          them from the pit, and plucked them as brands from the burning.
          Strange indeed that God should have it so. The providence is
          inscrutable that permits some of the Lord's chosen people to wander
          and rove as far as sheep can stray. Such men, however, make the most
          valiant champions for that grace which only can rescue any sinner from
          eternal woe.
        </p>
        <p>
          This morning we propose to expound to you "the riches of God's grace;
          this is the Treasure; then, secondly, we shall speak of the
          "Forgiveness of Sins," which is to be judged of by that Measure; the
          forgiveness is according to the riches of his grace; and we shall
          afterwards wind up by considering some of the privileges connected
          therewith.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, consider the RICHES OF HIS GRACE. In attempting to search
          out that which is unsearchable, we must, I suppose, use some of those
          comparisons by which we are wont to estimate the wealth of the
          monarchs, and mighty ones of this world. It happened once that the
          Spanish ambassador, in the haleyon days of Spain, went on a visit to
          the French ambassador, and was invited by him to see the treasures of
          his master. With feelings of pride he showed the repositories,
          profusely stored with earth's most precious and most costly wealth.
          "Could you show gems so rich," said he, "or aught the life of this for
          magnificence of possessions in all your sovereign's kingdom?" "Call
          your master rich?" replied the ambassador of Spain, "why; my master's
          treasures have no bottom" -- alluding, of course, to the mines of Peru
          and Petrosa. So truly in the riches of grace there are mines too deep
          for man's finite understanding ever to fathom. However profound your
          investigation, there is still a deep couching beneath that baffles all
          research. Who can ever discover the attributes of God? Who can find
          out the Almighty to perfection? We are at a loss to estimate the ver
          quality and properties of grace as it dwells in the mind of Deity.
          Love in the human breast is a passion. With God it is not so. Love is
          an attribute of the divine essence. God is love. In men, grace and
          bounty may grow into a habit, but grace with God is an intrinsic
          attribute of his nature. He cannot but be gracious. As by necessity of
          his Godhead he is omnipotent, and omniprescent, so by absolute
          necessity of his divinity is he gracious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come then, my brethren, into this glittering mine of the attributes of
          the grace of God. Every one of God's attributes is infinite, and
          therefore this attribute of grace is without bounds. You cannot
          conceive the infinity of God, why, therefore, should I attempt to
          describe it. Recollect however, that as the attributes of God are of
          the like extent, the gauge of one attribute must be the gauge of
          another. Or, further, if one attribute is without limit, so is another
          attribute. Now, you cannot conceive any boundary to the omnipotence of
          God. What cannot he do? He can crate, he can destroy; he can speak a
          myriad universe into existence; or he can quench the light of myriads
          of stars as readily as we tread out a spark. He hath but to will it,
          and creatures without number sing his praise; yet another volition,
          and those creatures subside into their naked nothingness, as a
          moment's foam subsides into the wave that bears it, and is lost for
          ever. The astronomer turns his tube to the remotest space, he cannot
          find a boundary to God's creating power; but could he seem to find a
          limit, we would then inform him that all the worlds on worlds that
          cluster in space, hick as the drops of morning dew upon the meadows,
          are but the shreds of God's power. He can make more than all these,
          can dash those into nothingness, and can begin again. Now as boundless
          as is his power, so infinite is his grace. As he hath power to do
          anything, so hath he grace enough to give anything -- to give
          everything to the very chief of sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take another attribute if you please -- God's omniscience, there is no
          boundary to that. We know that his eye is upon every individual of our
          race -- he sees him as minutely as if he were the only creature that
          existed. It is boasted of the eagle that though he can outstare the
          sun, yet when at his greatest height, he can detect the movement of
          the smallest fish in the depths of the sea. But what is this compared
          with the omniscience of God? His eye tracks the sun in his marvellous
          course, his eye marks the winged comet as it flies through space. His
          eye discerns the utmost bound of creation inhabited or uninhabited.
          There is nothing hid from the light thereof, with him there is no
          darkness at all. If I mount to heaven he is there; if I dive to hell
          he is there; if I fly mounted on the morning ray beyond the western
          sea,
        </p>
        <p>"His swifter hand shall first arrive,</p>
        <p>And there arrest the fugitive."</p>
        <p>
          There is no limit to his understanding, nor is there to his grace. As
          his knowledge comprehendeth all things, so doth his grace comprehend
          all the sins, all the trials all the infirmities of the people upon
          whom his heart is set. Now, my dear brethren, the next time we fear
          that God's grace will be exhausted, let us look into this mine, and
          then let us reflect that all that has ever been taken out of it has
          never diminished it a single particle. All the clouds that have been
          taken from the sea have never diminished its depth, and all the love,
          and all the mercy that God has given to all but infinite numbers of
          the race of man, has not disminished by a single rain the mountains of
          his grace. But to proceed further; we sometimes judge of the wealth of
          men, not only by their real estate in mines and the like, but by what
          they have on hand stored up in the treasury. I must take you now, my
          brethren, to the glittering treasury of divine grace. Ye know its
          names, it is called the Covenant, have you not head the marvellous
          story of what was done in the olden time before the world was made.
          God foreknew that man would fall, but he determined of his own
          infinite purpose and will that he would raise out of this fall a
          multitude which no man can number. The Eternal Father held a solemn
          council with the Son and Holy Spirit. Thus spoke the Father: -- "I
          will that those whom I have chosen be saved!" Thus said the Son: --
          "My Father, I am ready to bleed and die that thy justice may not
          suffer and that thy purpose may be executed." "I will," said the Holy
          Spirit, "that those whom the Son redeems with blood shall be called by
          grace, shall be quickened, shall be preserved, shall be sanctified and
          perfected, and brought safely home." Then was the Covenant written,
          signed, and sealed, and ratified between the Sacred Three. The Father
          gave his Son, the Son gave himself, and the Spirit promises all his
          influence, all his presence, to all the chosen. Then did the Father
          give to the Son the persons of his elect, then did the Son give
          himself to the elect, and take them into union with him; and then did
          the Spirit in covenant vow that these chosen ones should surely be
          brought safe home at last. Whenever I think of the old covenant of
          grace, I am perfectly amazed and staggered with the grace of it. I
          could not be an Arminian on any inducement; the ver poetry of our holy
          religion lies in these ancient things of the everlasting hills, that
          glorious covenant signed and sealed, and ratified, in all things
          ordered well from old eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pause here, my hearer, awhile, and think before this world was made,
          ere God had settled the deep foundations of the mountains, or poured
          the seas from the laver of the bottom of his hand, he had chosen his
          people, and set his heart on hem. To them he had given himself, his
          Son, his heaven, his all. For them did Christ determine to resign his
          bliss, his home, his life; for them did the Spirit promise all his
          attributes, that they might be blessed. O grace divine, how glorious
          thou art, without beginning, without end. How shall I praise thee?
          Take up the strain ye angels; sing these noble themes, the love of the
          Father, the love of the Son, the love of the Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, my brethren, if ye think it over, may well make you estimate
          aright the riches of God's grace. If you read the roll of the covenant
          from beginning to end, containing as it does, election, redemption,
          calling, justification, pardon, adoption, heaven, immortality -- if
          you read all his, you will say, "This is riches of grace -- God, great
          and infinite! Who is a God like unto thee for the riches of thy love!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The riches of great kings again, may often be estimated by the
          munificence of the monuments which they reared to record their feats.
          We have been amazed in these modern times at the marvellous riches of
          the kings of Nineveh and Babylon. Modern monarchs with all their
          appliances, would fail to erect such monstrous piles of palaces as
          those in which old Nebuchadnezzar walked in times of yore. We turn to
          the pyramids, we see there what the wealth of nations can accomplish;
          we look across the sea to Mexico and Peru, and we see the relics of a
          semi-barbarous people but we are staggered and amazed to think what
          wealth and what mines of riches they must have possessed ere such
          works could have been accomplished. Solomon's riches are perhaps best
          judged of by us when we think of those great cities which he built in
          the wilderness, Tadmore and Palmyra. When we go and visit those ruins
          and see the massive columns and magnificent sculpture, we say, Solomon
          indeed was rich. We feel as we walk amid the ruins somewhat like the
          queen of Sheba, even in Scripture the half has not been told us of the
          riches of Solomon. My brethren, God has led us to inspect mightier
          trophies than Solomon, or Nebuchadnezzar, or Montezuma, or all the
          Pharaohs. Turn your eyes yonder, see that blood-bought host arrayed in
          white, surrounding the throne -- hark, how they sing, with voice
          triumphant, with melodies seraphic, "Unto him that loved us, and
          washed us from our sins in his own blood, to him be glory and dominion
          for ever and ever." And who are these? Who are these trophies of his
          grace? Some of them have come from the stews of harlotry; many of them
          have come from the taverns of drunkenness. Nay, more, the hands of
          some of those so white and fair, were once red with the blood of
          saints. I sere yonder the men that nailed the Saviour to the tree; men
          who cursed God, and invoked on themselves death and damnation. I see
          there Manasseh, who shed innocent blood so much, and the thief who in
          the last moment looked to Christ, and said, "Lord, remember me." But I
          need not turn your gaze so far aloft; look, my brethren, around, you
          do not know your next neighbour by whom you are sitting his morning,
          it may be. But there are stories of grace that might be told by some
          here this morning, that would make the ver angels sing more loudly
          than they have done before. Well, I know these cheeks have well nigh
          been scarlet with tears when I have heard the stories of free grace
          wrought in this congregation. Then are those known to me, but of
          course not so to you, who were among the vilest of men, the scum of
          society. We have here those to whom cursing was as their breath, and
          drunkenness had grown to be a habit; and yet here they are servants of
          God, and of his church; and it is their delight to testify to others
          what a Saviour they have found. Ah, but my hearer, perhaps thou art
          one of those trophies, and if so, the best proof of the riches of his
          grace is that which thou findest in thy own soul. I think God to be
          gracious when I see others saved, I know he is because he has saved
          me; that wayward, wilful boy, who scoffed a mother's love, and would
          not be melted by all her prayers, who only wished to know a sin in
          order to perpetrate it? Is he standing here to preach the gospel of
          the grace of God to you to-day? Yes. Then there is no sinner out of
          hell that has sinned too much for grace to save. That love which can
          reach to me, can reach to you. Now I know the riches of his grace,
          because I hope I prove it, and feel it in my own inmost heart, my dear
          hearer, and may you know it too, and then you will join with our poet,
          who says --
        </p>
        <p>"Then loudest of the crowd I'll sing,</p>
        <p>While heavens resounding mansions ring</p>
        <p>With shouts of sovereign grace."</p>
        <p>
          Go a little further now. We have thus looked at the wine and
          treasures, and at the monuments. But more. One thing which amazed the
          queen of Sheba, with regard to the riches of Solomon, was the
          sumptuousness ofhis table. Suth multitudes sat down to it to eat and
          drink, and though they were many, yet they all had enough and to
          spare. She lost all heart when she saw the provisions of a single day
          brought in. I forget just now, although I meant to refer to the
          passage how many fat beast, how many bullocks of the pasture, how many
          bucks and fallow deer and game of all sorts, and how many measures of
          flour and how many gallons of oil were brought to Solomon's table
          every day, but it was something marvellous; and the multitudes that
          had to feast were marvellous also, yet had they all enough. And now
          think my brethren of the hospitalities of the God of grace each day.
          Ten thousand of his people are this day sitting down to feast; hungry
          and thirsty they bring large appetites with them to he banquet, but
          not one of them returns unsatisfied; there is enough for each, enough
          for all, enough for evermore. Though the host that feed there is
          countless as the stars of heaven, yet I find that not one lacks his
          portion. He openeth his hand and supplies the want of every living
          saint upon the face of the earth. Think how much grace one saint
          requires, so much that nothing but the Infinite could supply him for
          one day. We burn so much fuel each day to maintain the fire of love in
          our hearts, that we might drain the mines of England of all their
          wealth of coal. Surely were it not that we have infinite treasures of
          race, the daily consumption of a single saint might out-demand
          everything that is to be found upon the face of the earth. And yet it
          is not one but many saints, and many hundreds, not for one day, but
          for many years; not for many years only, but generation after
          generation, century after century, race after race of men, living on
          the fulness of God in Christ. Yet are none of hem starved; they all
          drink to he full; they eat and are satisfied. What riches of grace
          then may we see in the sumptuousness of his hospitality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, my brethren, I have thought if I might but get the broken
          meat at God's back door of grace I should be satisfied; like the woman
          who said, "The dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from the master's
          table;" or like the prodigal who said, "Make me as one of thy hired
          servants." But you will remember that no child of God is ever made to
          live on husks; God does not give the parings of his grace to he
          meanest of them, but they are all fed like Mephibosheth; they eat from
          the kings own table the daintiest dishes. And if one may speak for the
          rest, I think in matters of grace we all have Benjamin's mess -- we
          all have ten times as we could have expected, and though not more than
          our necessities, yet are we often amazed at the marvellous plenty of
          grace which God gives us in the covenant and the promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we turn to another point to illustrate the greatness of the riches
          of God's grace. A man's riches may often be judged of by the equipage
          of his children, the manner in which he dresses his servants and those
          of his household. It is not to be expected that the child of the poor
          man, though he is comfortably clothed, should be arrayed in like
          garments to those which are worn by the sons of princes. Let us see,
          then, what are the robes in which God's people are apparelled, and how
          they are attended. Here again I speak upon a subject where a large
          imagination is needed, and my own utterly fails me. God's children are
          wrapped about with a robe, a seamless robe, which earth and heaven
          could not buy the like of if it were once lost. For texture it excels
          the fine linen of the merchants; for whiteness it is purer than the
          driven snow; no looms on earth could make it, but Jesus spent his life
          to work my robe of righteousness. There was a drop of blood in every
          throw of the shuttle, and every thread was made of his own heart's
          agonies. Tis a robe that is divine, complete; a better one than Adam
          wore in the perfection of Eden. He had but a human righteousness
          though a perfect one, but we have a divinely perfect righteousness.
          Strangely, my soul, art thou arrayed, for thy Saviour's garment is on
          thee; the royal robe of David is wrapped about his Jonathan. Look at
          God's people as they are clothed too in the garments of
          sanctification. Was there ever such a robe as that? It is literally
          stiff with jewels. He arrays the meanest of his people every day as
          though it were a wedding day; he arrays them as a bride adorneth
          herself with jewels; he has given Ehtiopia and Sheba for them, and he
          will have them dressed in gold of Ophir. What riches of grace then
          must there be in God who thus clothes his children!
        </p>
        <p>
          But to conclude this point upon which I have not as yet begun. If you
          would know the full riches of divine grace, read the Father's heart
          when he sent his Son upon earth to die; read the lines upon the
          Father's countenance when he pours his wrath upon his only begotten
          and his well-beloved Son. Read too the mysterious handwriting on the
          Saviour's flesh and soul, when on the cross quivering in agony the
          waves of swelling grief do o'er his bosom roll. If ye would know love
          ye must repair to Christ, and ye shall see a man so full of pain, that
          his head, his hair, his garments bloody be. Twas love that made him
          sweat as it were great drops of blood. If ye would know love, you must
          see the Omnipotent mocked by his creatures, you must hear the
          Immaculate slandered by sinners, you must hear the Eternal One
          groaning out his life, and crying in the agonies of death, "My God, my
          God, why hast thou forsaken me?" In fine, to sum up all in one, the
          riches of the grace of God are infinite, beyond all limit; they are
          inexhaustible, they can never be drained; they are all-sufficient,
          they are enough for every soul that ere shall come to take of them;
          there shall be enough for ever while earth endureth, until the last
          vessel of mercy shall be brought home safely.
        </p>
        <p>So much, then, concerning the riches of His grace.</p>
        <p>
          II. For a minute or two, let me now dwell upon THE FORGIVENESS OF
          SINS. The treasure of God's grace is the measure of our forgiveness;
          this forgiveness of sins is according to the riches of his grace. We
          may infer, then, that the pardon which God gives to the penitent is no
          niggard pardon. Have not you asked a man's pardon sometimes, and he
          has said, "Yes, I forgive you," and you have thought, "Well, I would
          not even have asked for pardon if I thought you would have given it in
          such a surly style as that; I might as well have continued as I was,
          as to be so ungraciously forgiven." But when God forgives a man,
          though he be the chief of sinners, he puts out his hand and freely
          forgives; in fact, there is as much joy in the heart of God when he
          forgives, as there is in the heart of the sinner when he is forgiven;
          God is as blessed in giving as we are in receiving. It is his very
          nature to forgive; he must be gracious, he must be loving, and when he
          lets his heart of love out to free us from our sins it is with no
          stinted stream; he doth it willingly, he upbraideth it not. Again: if
          pardon be in proportion to the riches of his grace, we may rest
          assured it is not a limited pardon, it is not the forgiving of some
          sins and the leaving of others upon the back. No, this were not
          Godlike, it were not consistent with the riches of his grace. When God
          forgives he draws the mark through every sin which the believer ever
          has committed, or ever will commit. That last point may stagger you,
          but I do believe with John Kent, that in the blood of Christ
        </p>
        <p>"There's pardon for transgressions past,</p>
        <p>It matters not how black their cast;</p>
        <p>And, oh! My soul, with wonder view,</p>
        <p>For sins to come there's pardon too."</p>
        <p>
          However many, however heinous, however innumerable your sins may have
          been, the moment you believe they are ever one of them blotted out. In
          the Book of God there is not a single sin against any man in this
          place whose trust is in Christ, not a single one, not even the shadow
          of one, not a spot, or the remnant of a sin remaining, all is gone.
          When Noah's flood covered the deepest mountains, you may rest assured
          it covered the mole-hills; and when God's love covers the little sins
          it covers the big ones, and they are all gone at once! When a bill is
          receipted fully there is not an item which can be charged again, and
          when God pardons the sins of the believer there is not one single sin
          left; not even half-an-one can ever be brought to his remembrance
          again. Nay, more than this; when God forgives, he not only forgives
          all but once for all. Some tell us that God forgives men and yet they
          are lost. A fine god yours! They believe that the penitent sinner
          finds mercy, but that if he slips or stumbles in a little while he
          will be taken out of the covenant of grace and will perish. Such a
          covenant I could not and would not believe in; I tread it beneath my
          feet as utterly despicable. The God whom love when he forgives never
          punishes afterwards. By one sacrifice there is a full remission of all
          sin that ever was against a believer, or that ever will be against
          him. Though you should live till your hair is bleached thrice over,
          till Methuselah's thousand years should pass over your furrowed brow,
          not a single sin shall ever stand against you, nor shall you ever be
          punished for a single sin; for every sin is forgiven, fully forgiven,
          so that not even part of the punishment shall be executed against you.
          "Well, but," saith one, "how is it that God does punish his children?"
          I answer, he does not. He chastises them as a father, but that is a
          different thing from the punishment of a judge. If the child of a
          judge were brought up to the bar, and that child were freely forgiven
          all that he had done amiss, if justice exonerated and acquitted him,
          it might nevertheless happen that there was evil in the heart of that
          child which the father, out of love to the child, might have to whip
          out of him. But there is a great deal of difference between a rod in
          the hand of the executioner, and a rod in a father's hand. Let God
          smite me, if I sin against him, yet it is not because of the guilt of
          sin, there is no punishment in it whatever, the penal clause is done
          away with. It is only that he may cure me of my fault, that he may
          fetch the folly out of my heart. Do you chasten your children
          vindictively because you are angry with them? No; but because you love
          them; if you are what parents should be, the chastisement is a proof
          of your affection, and your heart smarts more than their body pains,
          when you have to chasten them for what they have done amiss. God is
          not angry against his children, nor is there a sin in hem which he
          will punish. He will whip it out of them, but punish them for it he
          will not. O glorious grace! It is a gospel worth preaching.
        </p>
        <p>"The moment a sinner believes,</p>
        <p>And trusts in his crucified God,</p>
        <p>His pardon at once he receives</p>
        <p>Redemption in full through Christ's blood."</p>
        <p>
          All is gone; every atome gone; gone for ever and ever; and well he
          knows it.
        </p>
        <p>"Now freed from sin I walk at large,</p>
        <p>My Saviour's blood my full discharge;</p>
        <p>At his dear feet my soul I lay,</p>
        <p>A sinner saved, and homage pay."</p>
        <p>
          Having thus spoken of the pardon of sin as being fully commensurate
          with the grace of God, I will put this question to my hearer: My
          friend, are you a forgiven man? Are your sins all gone? "No," saith
          one, "I cannot say they are, but I am doing my best to reform." Ah!
          you may do your best to reform, I hope you will, but that will never
          wash away a single blood-red stain of guilt. "But," saith one, "may I,
          just I am, believe that my sins are forgiven?" No, but I tell thee
          what thou mayst do. If God help thee, thou mayst now cast thyself
          simply upon the blood and righteousness of Christ; and the moment thou
          dost that, thy sins are all gone, and gone so that they never can
          return again. "He that believeth on the Lord Jesus Christ shall be
          saved." Nay, he is saved in the moment of his faith. He is no more in
          the sight of God received as a sinner; Christ has been punished for
          him. The righteousness of Christ is wrapped about him, and he stands
          accepted in the beloved. "Well, but," saith one, "I can believe that a
          man, after he has been a long time a Christian, may know his sins to
          be forgiven, but I cannot imagine that I can know it at once." The
          knowledge of our pardon does not always come the moment we believe,
          but the fact of our pardon is before our knowledge of it, and we may
          be pardoned before we know it. But if thou believest on the Lord Jesus
          Christ with all hine heart, I will tell thee this: If thy faith be
          free of all self-trust thou shalt know to-day that thy sins are
          forgiven, for the witness of the Spirit shall bear witness with thy
          heart, and thou shalt hear that secret, still small voice, saying, "Be
          of good cheer; thy sins, which are many, are all forgiven." "Oh,"
          saith one, "I would give all I have for that." And you might give all
          you have, but you would not have it at that price. You might give the
          firstborn for your transgression, the fruit of your body for the sin
          of your soul, you might offer rivers of oil, and ten thousand of the
          fat of fed beasts; you would not have it for money, but you may have
          it for nothing; it is freely brought to you; you are bidden to take
          it. Only acknowledge your sin, and put your trust in Christ, and there
          is not one man among you who shall hear aught about his sin in the day
          of judgment. It shall be cast into the depth of the sea -- it shall be
          carried away for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will give you a picture, and then leave this subject. See, there
          stands the high-priest of the Jews. A goat is brought to him: it is
          called "the scape-goat." He puts his hands upon the head of this goat,
          and begins to make confession of sin. Will you come and do the like?
          Jesus Christ is the scape-goat; come and lay your hand on his
          thorn-crown'd head by faith, and make confession of your sin, as the
          high-priest did of old. Have you done it? Is your sin confessed? Now
          believe that Jesus Christ is able and willing to take your sin away.
          Rest wholly and entirely on him. Now what happens? The high-priest
          takes the scape-goat, gives it into the hand of a trusty man, who
          leads it over hill and down dale, till he is many miles away, and
          then, suddenly loosing its bonds, he frightens it, and the goat flees
          with all its might. The man watches it till it is gone, and he can see
          it no more. He comes back, and he says, "I took the scape-goat away,
          and it vanished out of my sight; it is gone into the wilderness." Ah,
          my hearer, and if thou hast put thy sins on Christ by a full
          confession, remember he has taken hem all away, as far as the east is
          from the west, they are gone, and gone eternally. Thy drunkenness, thy
          swearing is gone, thy lying, thy theft is gone, thy Sabbath-breaking,
          thy evil thoughts are gone -- all gone, and thou shalt never see them
          again --
        </p>
        <p>"Plunged, as in a shoreless sea,</p>
        <p>Lost, as in immensity."</p>
        <p>
          III. And now I conclude by noticing THE BLESSED PRIVILEGES WHICH
          ALWAYS FOLLOW THE FORGIVENESS WHICH IS GIVEN TO US ACCORDING TO THE
          GRACE OF GOD. I think here are a great many people who do not believe
          there is any reality in religion at all. They think it is a very
          respectable thing to go to church and to go to chapel, but as to ever
          enjoying a consciousness that their sins are all forgiven, they never
          think about that. And I must confess that, in the religion of these
          modern times, there does not seem to be much reality. I do not hear at
          this day that clear ringing distinct proclamation of the gospel that I
          want to hear. It is a grand thing to carry the gospel to all manner of
          men, to take it to the theatre, and the like, but we want to have the
          gospel undiluted -- the milk must have a little less water with it.
          There must be a more distinct, palpable truth taught to the people, a
          something that they can really lay hold of, a something that they can
          understand, even if they will not believe it. I trust no man will
          misunderstand me this morning in what I have said. There is such a
          thing as having all our sins forgiven now. There is such a thing as
          knowing it and enjoying it. Now I will show you what will be the
          happiness resulting to you, should you obtain this blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, you will have peace of conscience, that heart of
          yours that throbs so fast when you are alone will be quite still and
          quiet. You will be least alone when you are alone. That fear of yours
          which makes you quicken your step in the dark because you are afraid
          of something, and you do not know what, will all be gone. I have heard
          of a man who was so constantly in debt, and continually being arrested
          by the bailiffs, that once upon a time, when going by some area
          railings, having caught his sleeve upon one of the rails, he turned
          round and said, "I don't owe you anything, Sir." He thought it was a
          bailiff. And so it is with unforgiven sinners, wherever they are, they
          think they are going to be arrested. They can enjoy nothing. Even
          their mirth, what is it, but the colour of joy, the crackling of
          thorns under the pot; there is no solid steady fire. But when once a
          man is forgiven, he can walk anywhere, He says, "to me it is nothing
          whether I live or die, whether ocean depths engulf me, or whether I am
          buried beneath the avalanche, with sin forgiven, I am secure. Death
          has no sting to him. His conscience is at rest. Then he goes a step
          further. Knowing his sins to be forgiven he has joy unspeakable. No
          man has such sparkling eyes as the true Christian; a man then knows
          his interest in Christ, and can read his title clear. He is a happy
          man, and must be happy. His troubles, what are they? Less than nothing
          and vanity; for all his sins are forgiven. When the poor slave first
          lands in Canada, it may be he is without a single farthing in his
          purse, and scarcely anything but rags on his back; but he puts his
          foot on British soil, and is free; see him leap and dance, and clap
          his hands, saying, "Great God I thank thee, I am a free man." So it is
          with the Christian, he can say in his cottage when he sits down to his
          crust of bread, thank God I have no sin mixed in my cup -- it is all
          forgiven. The bread may be dry, but it is not half so dry as it would
          be if I had to eat it with the bitter herbs of a guilty conscience,
          and with a terrible apprehension of the wrath of God. He has a joy
          that will stand all weathers, a joy that will keep in all climates, a
          joy that shines in the dark, and glitters in the night as well as in
          the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, to go further, such a man has access to God. Another man with
          unforgiven sin about him stands afar off; and if he thinks of God at
          all it is as a consuming fire. But the forgiven Christian looking up
          to God when he sees the mountains and the hills, and rolling streams
          and the roaring flood, he says, "My Father made them all;" and he
          clasps hands with the Almighty across the infinite expanse that
          sunders man from his Maker. His heart flies up to God. He dwells near
          to him, and he feels that he can talk to God as a man talketh with his
          friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then another effect of this is that the believer fears no hell. There
          are solemn things in the Word of God, but they do not affright the
          believer. There may be a pit that is bottomless, but into that his
          foot shall never slide; it is true there is a fire that never shall be
          quenched, but it cannot burn him. That fire is for the sinner, but he
          has no sin imputed to him; it is all forgiven. The banded host of all
          the devils in hell cannot take him there, for he has not a single sin
          that can be laid to his charge. Daily sinning though he is, he feels
          those sins are all atoned for; he knows that Christ has been punished
          in his stead, and therefore Justice cannot touch him again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, the forgiven Christian is expecting heaven. He is waiting
          for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, for if death should intervene
          before that glorious advent, he knows that to him sudden death is
          sudden glory; and in the possession of a quiet conscience and of peace
          with God, he can go up to his chamber when the last solemn hour shall
          come; he can gather up his feet in his bed; he can bid farewell to his
          brethren and companions, to his wife and to his children, and can shut
          his eye in peace without a fear that he shall open them in heaven.
          Perhaps never does the joy of forgiven sin come out more brightly than
          it does on a dying bed. It has often been my privilege to test the
          power of religion when I have been sitting by the bedside of the
          dying. There is a young girl in heaven now, once a member of this our
          church. I went with one of my beloved deacons to see her when she was
          very near her departure. She was in the last stage of consumption.
          Fair and sweetly beautiful she looked, and I think I never heard such
          syllables as those which fell from that girl's lips. She had had
          disappointments, and trials, and troubles, but all these she had not a
          word to say about, except that she blessed God for hem; they had
          brought her nearer to the Saviour. And when we asked her whether she
          was not afraid of dying, "No," she said, "the only thing I fear is
          his, I am afraid of living, lest my patience should wear out. I have
          not said an impatient word yet, sir, hope I shall not. It is sad to e
          so ver weak, but I think if I had my choice I would rather be here
          than be in health, for it is very precious to me; I know that my
          Redeemer liveth, and I am waiting for the moment when he shall send
          his chariot of fire to take me up to him." I put the question, "Have
          you not any doubts?" "No, none, sir, why should I? I clasp my arms
          around the neck of Christ." "And have not you any fear about your
          sins?" "No, sir, they are all forgiven, I trust the Saviour's precious
          blood." "And do you think that you will be as brave as this when you
          come actually to die?" "Not if he leaves me, sir, but he will never
          leave me, for he has said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.'"
          There is faith, dear brothers and sisters, may we all have it and
          receive forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace.<br />
