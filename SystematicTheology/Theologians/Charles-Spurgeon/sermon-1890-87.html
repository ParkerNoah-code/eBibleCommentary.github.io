          A Discourse Which Was in the Presence of Antoninus Cæsar, and He
          Exhorted The Said Cæsar to Acquaint Himself with God, and Showed to
          Him the Way of Truth.
        </p>
        <p>He began to speak as follows: --</p>
        <p>
          "It is not easy," said Melito, "speedily to bring into the right way
          the man who has a long time previously been held fast by error. It
          may, however, be effected: for, when a man turns away ever so little
          from error, the mention of the truth is acceptable to him. For, just
          as when the cloud breaks ever so little there comes fair weather, even
          so, when a man turns toward God, the thick cloud of error which
          deprived him of true vision is quickly withdrawn from before him. For
          error, like disease and sleep, long holds fast those who come under
          its influence; but truth uses the word as a goad, and smites the
          slumberers, and awakens them; and when they are awake they look at the
          truth, and also understand it: they hear, and distinguish that which
          is from that which is not. For there are men who call iniquity
          righteousness: they think, for example, that it is righteousness for a
          man to err with the many. But I, for my part, affirm that it is not a
          good excuse for error that a man errs with the many. For, if one man
          only sin, his sin is great: how much greater will be the sin when many
          sin together!
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now, the sin of which I speak is this: when a man abandons that which
          really exists, and serves that which does not really exist. There is'
          that which really exists, and it is called God. He, I say, really
          exists, and by His power doth everything subsist. This being is in no
          sense made, nor did He ever come into being; but He has existed from
          eternity, and will continue to exist for ever and ever. He changeth
          not, while everything else changes. No eye can see Him, nor thought
          apprehend Him, nor language describe Him; and those who love Him speak
          of Him thus: Father, and God of Truth.'
        </p>
        <p>
          "If, therefore, a man forsake the light, and say that there is another
          God, it is plain from what he himself says that it is some created
          thing which he calls God. For, if a man call fire God, it is not God,
          because it is fire; and, if a man call water God, it is not God,
          because it is water; and, if he so call this earth on which we tread,
          or these heavens which are seen by us, or the sun, or the moon, or
          some one of these stars which run their course without ceasing by
          Divine command, and do not speed along by their own will, neither are
          these gods; and, if a man call gold and silver gods, are not these
          objects things which we use as we please? and, if he so call those
          pieces of wood which we burn, or those stones which we break, how can
          these things be gods? For, lo! they are for the use of man. How can
          they' escape the commission of great sin, who in their speech change
          the great God into those things which, so long as they continue,
          continue by Divine command?
        </p>
        <p>
          "But, notwithstanding this, I say that so long as a man does not hear,
          and so does not discern or understand that there is a Lord over these
          creatures, he is not perhaps to be blamed: because no one finds fault
          with a blind man though he walk ever so badly. For, in the same manner
          as the blind, so men also, when they were seeking after God, stumbled
          upon stones and blocks of wood; and such of them as were rich stumbled
          upon gold and silver, and were prevented by their stumblings from
          finding that which they were seeking after. But, now that a voice has
          been heard through all the earth, declaring that there is a God of
          truth, and there has been given to every man an eye wherewith to see,
          those persons are without excuse who are ashamed of incurring the
          censure of their former companions in error, and yet desire to walk in
          the right way. For those who are ashamed to be saved must of necessity
          perish. I therefore counsel them to open their eyes and see: for, lo!
          light is given abundantly to us all to see thereby; and if, when light
          has arisen upon us, any one close his eyes so as not to see, into the
          ditch he must go. But why is a man ashamed of the censure of those who
          have been in error along with himself? Rather does it behove him to
          persuade them to follow in his steps; and, if they should not be
          persuaded by him, then to disengage himself from their society. For
          there are some men who are unable to rise from their mother earth, and
          therefore also do they make them gods from the earth their mother; and
          they are condemned by the judgments of truth, forasmuch as they apply
          the name of Him who is unchangeable to those objects which are subject
          to change, and shrink not from calling those things gods which have
          been made by the hands of man, and dare to make an image of God whom
          they have not seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But I have to remark further, that the Sibyl also has said concerning
          them that it is the images of deceased kings that they worship. And
          this is easy to understand: for, lo! even now they worship and honour
          the images of those of Cæsarean rank more than their former gods; for
          from those their former gods both pecuniary tribute and produce accrue
          to Cæsar, as to one who is greater than they. On this account, those
          who despise them, and so cause Cæsar's revenue to fall short, are put
          to death. But to the treasury of other kings also it is appointed how
          much the worshippers in various places shall pay, and how many
          vesselfuls of water from the sea they shall supply. Such is the
          wickedness of the world -- of those who worship and fear that which
          has no sensation. Many of them, too, who are crafty, either for the
          sake of gain, or for vainglory, or for dominion over the multitude,
          both themselves worship, and incite those who are destitute of
          understanding to worship, that which has no sensation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I will further write and show, as far as my ability goes, how and for
          what causes images were made to kings and tyrants, and how they came
          to be regarded as gods. The people of Argos made images to Hercules,
          because he belonged to their city, and was strong, and by his valour
          slew noxious beasts, and more especially because they were afraid of
          him. For he was subject to no control, and carried off the wives of
          many: for his lust was great, like that of Zuradi the Persian, his
          friend. Again, the people of Acte worshipped Dionysus, a king, because
          he had recently planted the vine in their country. The Egyptians
          worshipped Joseph the Hebrew, who was called Serapis, because he
          supplied them with corn during the years of famine. The Athenians
          worshipped Athene, the daughter of Zeus, king of the island of Crete,
          because she built the town of Athens, and made Ericthippus her son
          king there, whom she had by adultery with Hephæstus, a blacksmith, son
          of a wife of her father. She was, too, always courting the society of
          Hercules, because he was her brother on her father's side. For Zeus
          the king became enamoured of Alcmene, the wife of Electryon, who was
          from Argos, and committed adultery with her, and she gave birth to
          Hercules. The people of Phoenicia worshipped Balthi, queen of Cyprus,
          because she fell in love with Tamuz, son of Cuthar king of the
          Phoenicians, and left her own kingdom and came and dwelt in Gebal, a
          fortress of the Phoenicians, and at the same time made all the
          Cyprians subject to King Cuthar. Also, before Tamuz she had fallen in
          love with Ares, and committed adultery with him; and Hephæstus, her
          husband, caught her, and his jealousy was roused against her, and he
          came and killed Tamuz in Mount Lebanon, as he was hunting wild boars;
          and from that time Balthi remained in Gebal, and she died in the city
          of Aphiki, where Tamuz was buried. The Elamites worshipped Nuh,
          daughter of the king of Elam: when the enemy had carried her captive,
          her father made for her an image and a temple in Shushan, a royal
          residence which is in Elam. The Syrians worshipped Athi, a Hadibite,
          who sent the daughter of Belat, a person skilled in medicine, and she
          healed Simi, the daughter of Hadad king of Syria; and some time
          afterwards, when Hadad himself had the leprosy upon him, Athi
          entreated Elisha the Hebrew, and he came and healed him of his
          leprosy. The people of Mesopotamia also worshipped Cuthbi, a Hebrew
          woman, because she delivered Bakru, the paternal king of Edessa, from
          his enemies. With respect to Nebo, who is worshipped in Mabug, why
          should I write to you? For, lo! all the priests who are in Mabug know
          that it is the image of Orpheus, a Thracian Magus. Hadran, again, is
          the image of Zaradusht, a Persian Magus. For both of these Magi
          practised magic at a well which was in a wood in Mabug, in which was
          an unclean spirit, and it assaulted and disputed the passage of every
          one who passed by in all that country in which the town of Mabug is
          situated; and these Magi, in accordance with what was a mystery in
          their Magian system, bade Simi, the daughter of Hadad, to draw water
          from the sea and pour it into the well, so that the spirit should not
          come up and commit assault. In like manner, the rest of mankind made
          images to their kings and worshipped them; of which matter I will not
          write further.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But thou, a person of liberal mind, and familiar with the truth, if
          thou wilt properly consider these matters, commune with thine own
          self; and, though they should clothe thee in the garb of a woman,
          remember that thou art a man. Believe in Him who is in reality God,
          and to Him lay open thy mind, and to Him commit thy soul, and He is
          able to give thee immortal life for ever, for everything is possible
          to Him; and let all other things be esteemed by thee just as they are
          -- images as images, and sculptures as sculptures; and let not that
          which is only made be put by thee in the place of Him who is not made,
          but let Him, the ever-living God, be constantly present to thy mind.
          For thy mind itself is His likeness: for it too is invisible and
          impalpable, and not to be represented by any form, yet by its will is
          the whole bodily frame moved. Know, therefore, that, if thou
          constantly serve Him who is immoveable, even He exists for ever, so
          thou also, when thou shalt have put off this body, which is visible
          and corruptible, shall stand before Him for ever, endowed with life
          and knowledge, and thy works shall be to thee wealth inexhaustible and
          possessions unfailing. And know that the chief of thy good works is
          this: that thou know God, and serve Him. Know, too, that He asketh not
          anything of thee: He needeth not anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Who is this God? He who is Himself truth, and His word truth. And
          what is truth? That which is not fashioned, nor made, nor represented
          by art: that is, which has never been brought into existence, and is
          on that account called truth. If, therefore, a man worship that which
          is made with hands, it is not the truth that he worships, nor yet the
          word of truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have very much to say on this subject; but I feel ashamed for those
          who do not understand that they are superior to the work of their own
          hands, nor perceive how they give gold to the artists that they may
          make for them gods, and give them silver for their adornment and
          honour, and move their riches about from place to place, and then
          worship them. And what infamy can be greater than this, that a man
          should worship his riches, and forsake Him who bestowed those riches
          upon him? and that he should revile man, yet worship the image of man;
          and slay a beast, yet worship the likeness of a beast? This also is
          evident, that it is the workmanship of their fellowmen that they
          worship: for they do not worship the treasures while they are laid by
          in the bag, but when the artists have fashioned images out of them
          they worship them; neither do they worship the gold or the silver
          considered as property, but when the gravers have sculptured them then
          they worship them. Senseless man! what addition has been made to thy
          gold, that now thou worshippest it? If it is because it has been made
          to resemble a winged animal, why dost thou not worship the winged
          animal itself? And if because it has been made like a beast of prey,
          lo! the beast of prey itself is before thee. And if it is the
          workmanship itself that pleases thee, let the workmanship of God
          please thee, who made all things, and in His own likeness made the
          workmen, who strive to do like Him, but resemble Him not.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But perhaps thou wilt say: How is it that God did not so make me that
          I should serve Him, and not images? In speaking thus, thou art seeking
          to become an idle instrument, and not a living man. For God made thee
          as perfect as it seemed good to Him. He has given thee a mind endowed
          with freedom; He has set before thee objects in great number, that
          thou on thy part mayest distinguish the nature of each thing and
          choose for thyself that which is good; He has set before thee the
          heavens, and placed in them the stars; He has set before thee the sun
          and the moon, and they too every day run their course therein; He has
          set before thee the multitude of waters, and restrained them by His
          word; He has set before thee the wide earth, which remains at rest,
          and continues before thee without variation: yet, lest thou shouldst
          suppose that of its own nature it so continues, He makes it also to
          quake when He pleaseth; He has set before thee the clouds, which by
          His command bring water from above and satisfy the earth -- that from
          hence thou mayest understand that He who puts these things in motion
          is superior to them all, and mayest accept thankfully the goodness of
          Him who has given thee a mind whereby to distinguish these things from
          one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wherefore I counsel thee to know thyself, and to know God. For
          understand how that there is within thee that which is called the soul
          -- by it the eye seeth, by it the ear heareth, by it the mouth
          speaketh; and how it makes use of the whole body; and how, whenever He
          pleaseth to remove the soul from the body, this falleth to decay and
          perisheth. From this, therefore, which exists within thyself and is
          invisible, understand how God also moveth the whole by His power, like
          the body; and that, whenever it pleases Him to withdraw His power, the
          whole world also, like the body, will fall to decay and perish.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But why this world was made, and why it passes away, and why the body
          exists, and why it falls to decay, and why it continues, thou canst
          not know until thou hast raised thy head from this sleep in which thou
          art sunk, and hast opened thine eyes and seen that God is One, the
          Lord of all, and hast come to serve Him with all thy heart. Then will
          He grant thee to know His will: for every one that is severed from the
          knowledge of the living God is dead and buried even while in his body.
          Therefore is it that thou dost wallow on the ground before demons and
          shadows, and askest vain petitions from that which has not anything to
          give. But thou, stand thou up from among those who are lying on the
          earth and caressing stones, and giving their substance as food for the
          fire, and offering their raiment to idols, and, while themselves
          possessed of senses, are bent on serving that which has no sensation;
          and offer thou for thy imperishable soul petitions for that which
          decayeth not, to God who suffers no decay -- and thy freedom will be
          at once apparent; and be thou careful of it, and give thanks to God
          who made thee, and gave thee the mind of the free, that thou mightest
          shape thy conduct even as thou wilt. He hath set before thee all these
          things, and showeth thee that, if thou follow after evil, thou shalt
          be condemned for thy evil deeds; but that, if after goodness, thou
          shalt receive from Him abundant good, together with immortal life for
          ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          "There is, therefore, nothing to hinder thee from changing thy evil
          manner of life, because thou art a free man; or from seeking and
          finding out who is the Lord of all; or from serving Him with all thy
          heart: because with Him there is no reluctance to give the knowledge
          of Himself to those that seek it, according to the measure of their
          capacity to know Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Let it be thy first care not to deceive thyself. For, if thou sayest
          of that which is not God: This is God, thou deceivest thyself, and
          sinnest before the God of truth. Thou fool! is that God which is
          bought and sold? Is that God which is in want? Is that God which must
          be watched over? How buyest thou him as a slave, and servest him as a
          master? How askest thou of him, as of one that is rich, to give to
          thee, and thyself givest to him as to one that is poor? How dost thou
          expect of him that he will make thee victorious in battle? for, lo!
          when thy enemies have conquered thee, they strip him likewise.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Perhaps one who is a king may say: I cannot behave myself aright,
          because I am a king; it becomes me to do the will of the many. He who
          speaks thus really deserves to be laughed at: for why should not the
          king himself lead the way to all good things, and persuade the people
          under his rule to behave with purity, and to know God in truth, and in
          his own person set before them the patterns of all things excellent --
          since thus it becomes him to do? For it is a shameful thing that a
          king, however badly he may conduct himself, should yet judge and
          condemn those who do amiss.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My opinion is this: that in this' way a kingdom may be governed in
          peace -- when the sovereign is acquainted with the God of truth, and
          is withheld by fear of Him from doing wrong to those who are his
          subjects, and judges everything with equity, as one who knows that he
          himself also will be judged before God; while, at the same time, those
          who are under his rule are withheld by the fear of God from doing
          wrong to their sovereign, and are restrained by the same fear from
          doing wrong to one another. By this knowledge of God and fear of Him
          all evil may be removed from the realm. For, if the sovereign abstain
          from doing wrong to those who are under his rule, and they abstain
          from doing wrong to him and to each other, it is evident that the
          whole country will dwell in peace. Many blessings, too, will be
          enjoyed there, because amongst them all the name of God will be
          glorified. For what blessing is greater than this, that a sovereign
          should deliver the people that are under his rule from error, and by
          this good deed render himself pleasing to God? For from error arise
          all those evils from which kingdoms suffer; but the greatest of all
          errors is this: when a man is ignorant of God, and in God's stead
          worships that which is not God.
        </p>
        <p>
          "There are, however, persons who say: It is for the honour of God that
          we make the image: in order, that is, that we may worship the God who
          is concealed from our view. But they are unaware that God is in every
          country, and in every place, and is never absent, and that there is
          not anything done and He knoweth it not. Yet thou, despicable man!
          within whom He is, and without whom He is, and above whom He is, hast
          nevertheless gone and bought thee wood from the carpenter's, and it is
          carved and made into an image insulting to God. To this thou offerest
          sacrifice, and knowest not that the all-seeing eye seeth thee, and
          that the word of truth reproves thee, and says to thee: How can the
          unseen God be sculptured? Nay, it is the likeness of thyself that thou
          makest and worshippest. Because the wood has been sculptured, hast
          thou not the insight to perceive that it is still wood, or that the
          stone is still stone? The gold also the workman taketh according to
          its weight in the balance. And when thou hast had it made into an
          image, why dost thou weigh it? Therefore thou art a lover of gold, and
          not a lover of God. And art thou not ashamed, perchance it be
          deficient, to demand of the maker of it why he has stolen some of it?
          Though thou hast eyes, dose thou not see? And though thou hast
          intelligence, dose thou not understand? Why dost thou wallow on the
          ground, and offer supplication to things which are without sense? Fear
          Him who shaketh the earth, and maketh the heavens to revolve, and
          smiteth the sea, and removeth the mountain from its place -- Him who
          can make Himself like a fire, and consume all things; and, if thou be
          not able to clear thyself of guilt, yet add not to thy sins; and, if
          thou be not able to know God, yet doubt not that He exists.

          "Again, there are persons who say: Whatsoever our fathers have
          bequeathed to us, that we reverence. Therefore, of course, it is, that
          those whose fathers have bequeathed them poverty strive to become
          rich! and those whose fathers did not instruct them, desire to be
          instructed, and to learn that which their fathers knew not! And why,
          forsooth, do the children of the blind see, and the children of the
          lame walk? Nay, it is not well for a man to follow his predecessors,
          if they be those whose course was evil; but rather that we should turn
          from that path of theirs, lest that which befell our predecessors
          should bring disaster upon us also. Wherefore, inquire whether thy
          father's course was good: and, if so, do thou also follow in his
          steps; but, if thy father's course was very evil, let thine be good,
          and so let it be with thy children after thee. Be grieved also for thy
          father because his course is evil, so long as thy grief may avail to
          help him. But, as for thy children, speak to them thus: There is a
          God, the Father of all, who never came into being, neither was ever
          made, and by whose will all things subsist. He also made the
          luminaries, that His works may see one another; and He conceals
          Himself in His power from all His works: for it is not permitted to
          any being subject to change to see Him who changes not. But such as
          are mindful of His words, and are admitted into that covenant which is
          unchangeable, they' see God -- so far as it is possible for them to
          see Him. These also will have power to escape destruction, when the
          flood of fire comes upon all the world. For there was once a flood and
          a wind, and the great men were swept away by a violent blast from the
          north, but the just were left, for a demonstration of the truth.
          Again, at another time there was a flood of water, and all men and
          animals perished in the multitude of waters, but the just were
          preserved in an ark of wood by the command of God. So also will it be
          at the last time: there shall be a flood of fire, and the earth shall
          be burnt up, together with its mountains; and mankind shall be burnt
          up, along with the idols which they have made, and the carved images
          which they have worshipped; and the sea shall be burnt up, together
          with its islands; but the just shall be preserved from wrath, like as
          were their fellows of the ark from the waters of the deluge. And then
          shall those who have not known God, and those who have made them
          idols, bemoan themselves, when they shall see those idols of theirs
          being burnt up, together with themselves, and nothing shall be found
          to help them.

          "When thou, Antoninus Cæsar, shall become acquainted with these
          things, and thy children also with thee, then wilt thou bequeath to
          them an inheritance for ever which fadeth not away, and thou wilt
          deliver thy soul, and the souls of thy children also, from that which
          shall come upon the whole earth in the judgment of truth and of
          righteousness. For, according as thou hast acknowledged Him here, so
          will He acknowledge thee there; and, if thou account Him here
          superfluous, He will not account thee one of those who have known Him
          and confessed Him.
