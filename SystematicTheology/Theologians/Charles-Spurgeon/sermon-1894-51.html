          This has been explained in the Introduction (pages xii-xiii) as a term
          applied to a highly characteristic form of prophetic literature,
          amounting to spiritual drama: actual dramatic dialogue and action
          being combined with other literary modes of expression to produce the
          general effect of dramatic realisation and movement. Some of the
          examples (I-III) are complete rhapsodies; IV is a discourse that
          becomes rhapsodic at its conclusion; V is a rhapsodic morceau, a
          single thought cast in this literary form; VI and VII are integral
          portions of one of the long rhapsodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          /I. Rhapsody of the Drought./ This is a simple and clear example of
          rhapsodic writing. It opens with scenic description of the drought;
          the rest is dialogue between God, Repentant Israel, and the Prophet.
          The action of the rhapsody consists in the gradual effect of
          intercession: God at first refuses so much as to answer the sinful
          People, and speaks only through the Prophet; at last he answers the
          People directly, but only to threaten; finally he shows mercy to the
          repentant remnant.
        </p>
        <p>
          /II. Habakkuk's Rhapsody of the Chaldeans./ This is a thoroughly
          typical and a splendid specimen of the rhapsody as a form of
          literature, (1) The historic situation is the appearance of the
          Chaldeans as a conquering power trampling down surrounding nations.
          This suggests the thought of judgment upon unpunished sin in Israel.
          But the Prophet feels a difficulty: how can a righteous God use a
          godless people as an instrument for the punishment of wickedness that
          is less than its own? The elaboration of this spiritual problem, in
          dramatic dialogue between God and the Prophet, makes the first section
          of the rhapsody. -- (2) The Divine solution of this problem comes
          under the image of intoxication: the haughty career of the Chaldean is
          no more than the drunkard's reeling which precedes his fall. But as
          the idea of the fall of the Chaldean is reached there is a sudden
          change from dialogue to the doom form. This Doom of the Chaldeans has
          five stanzas of the usual combination between prose and verse: the
          prose is Divine denunciation, the verse passages are the imagined
          triumphing of the down-trodden nations over their fallen oppressor.
          Four of the stanzas express the fall of the Chaldean in four images:
          his uninterrupted career has been a heaping up of usury, but the
          exactor shall come; it has been building a house of refuge, but shame
          has been built into its walls; it has been building a huge city only
          to make a bigger bonfire to the glory of the avenging God; it has been
          giving drink to behold shame, but the drink of shame shall be given to
          the oppressor. The fifth stanza goes to the root of the matter: the
          Chaldean has trusted to senseless idols: Jehovah is the true teacher.
          -- (3) So far the overthrow of the Chaldeans has been presented as a
          thing of the distant future; in the third section it is realised as
          visibly present: thus the movement of the rhapsody has been steadily
          advancing from the first forming of a problem to the climax of its
          solution. The literary form now changes to that of an Ode, realising
          the idea of Jehovah come to judgment. The prelude and postlude express
          the Prophet's feelings at the vision he hears and sees; the body of
          the ode realises the theophany itself. [Strophe, All nature convulsed
          as God comes; antistrophe, Is it against nature that the coming is
          directed? conclusion, Nay, but God comes to deliver his people.
          Compare Psalm cxiv.]

          /Page 205./ <i>I have heard the report of thee.</i> This
          <i>report</i>, and so <i>the voice</i> in the second line of the
          postlude, refer to the voice supposed to sing what makes the body of
          the ode. This is the voice of Israel, heard in the vision describing
          the advent of Jehovah. --
          <i>O LORD revive thy work in the midst of the years</i>: compare on
          page 202 <i>though it tarry, wait for it</i>: the Prophet prays God to
          interpose before it is too late.
        </p>
        <p>
          /Page 207./ <i>I trembled in my place</i>, etc. The Prophet has a
          strange mingling of different feelings: terror at the vision of
          Jehovah's advent, though it be for his deliverance, and confidence, as
          a result of this vision, in the midst of desolation.
        </p>

          /III. Joel's Rhapsody of the Locust Plague./ This rhapsody may be
          founded on an historic plague of locusts, but the notion is idealised
          into mystic forces of destruction. Nothing else in the historic
          situation has any bearing on the rhapsody, it is ideal all through:
          desolation because of sin, and 'judgment,' in the double sense of
          first a judgment on Israel that is turned by repentance to
          purification, then a judgment as between Israel and the nations. As
          arranged in the text the movement of this rhapsody explains itself.
        </p>

          /VI./ This selection is the Prelude to the elaborate 'Rhapsody of Zion
          Redeemed' [Isaiah volume, pages 127-209]. Like the overture of many
          modern musical compositions, this Prelude is a lyric anticipation or
          foreshadowing of the whole work. A word of comfort for Jerusalem is
          spoken by God, and Voices are heard carrying the glad tidings on the
          way towards Jerusalem. The words spoken by these voices are
          anticipations of subsequent parts of the rhapsody.
        </p>
        <p>
          /VII./ This selection is the third Act or 'Vision' of the same
          rhapsody. It brings out in dramatic realisation the Awakening of Zion.
          Successive appeals are made by Jehovah to Zion without response. The
          Celestial Hosts join in the appeal: still without response from Zion.
          At last the awakening of Zion is brought out by the Chorus of Zion's
          Watchmen recognising the advent of the messengers who bring the glad
          tidings (compare the Prelude), and calling upon the city to awake and
          rejoice.
