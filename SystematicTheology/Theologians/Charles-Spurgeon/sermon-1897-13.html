        <p>1st. The Prayer before the Pax .</p>
        <p>
          Pr. "O Lord God, Who art simplex, not compound, and hidden in essence
          sublime! God the Father, from Whom all paternity which is in heaven
          and earth is named , Source of Divinity, of those who participate in
          the Divine Nature, and Perfector of those who attain perfection; Good
          above all good, and Beautiful above all beautiful; Peaceful repose,
          Peace, Concord and Union of all souls; compose the dissensions which
          divide us from one another, and lead them back to an union with
          charity, which has a kind of similitude to Thy sublime essence: and as
          Thou art One above all, and we, one, through the unanimity of a good
          mind; that we may be found before Thee simplex and not divided, whilst
          celebrating this mystery; and that through the embraces of Charity and
          bonds of Love, we may be spiritually one, both with ourselves and with
          one another, through that Thy Peace pacifying all; through the Grace
          and Compassion and Love towards man of Thine Only-begotten Son;
          through Whom, and with Whom is due to Thee, glory, honour and
          dominion, with Thy most holy Spirit." P. "Amen." Pr. "Pax" (to all).
          P. "And with thy spirit." D. "Let each one give the Peace." P. "All."
          D. "Post." P. "Before Thee, O Lord." Pr. "Giver of Holiness, and
          distributor of every good, O Lord, Who sanctifiest every rational
          creature with sanctification, which is from Thee; sanctify, through
          Thy Holy Spirit, us Thy servants, who bow before Thee; free us from
          all servile passions of sin, from envy, treachery, deceit, hatred,
          enmities, and from him, who works the same, that we may be worthy,
          holily to complete the ministry of these life-giving Sacraments,
          through the heavenly Pontiff, Jesus Christ, Thine Only-begotten Son,
          through Whom, and with Whom, is due to Thee, glory and honour." P.
          "Amen." Pr. "Essentially existing, and from all ages; Whose nature is
          incomprehensible, Who art near and present to all, without any change
          of Thy sublimity; Whose goodness every existing thing longs for and
          desires; the intelligible indeed, and creatures endowed with
          intelligence, through intelligence; those endowed with sense, through
          their senses; Who, although Thou art One essentially, nevertheless art
          present with us, and amongst us, in this hour, in which Thou hast
          called and led us to these Thy holy mysteries; and hast made us worthy
          to stand before the sublime throne of Thy majesty, and to handle the
          sacred vessels of Thy ministry with our impure hands: take away from
          us, O Lord, the cloke of iniquity in which we are enfolded, as from
          Jesus, the son of Josedec the High Priest, Thou didst take away the
          filthy garments, and adorn us with piety and justice, as Thou didst
          adorn him with a vestment of glory; that clothed with Thee alone, as
          it were with a garment, and being like temples crowned with glory, we
          may see Thee unveiled with a mind divinely illuminated, and may feast,
          whilst we, by communicating therein, enjoy this sacrifice set before
          us; and render to Thee glory and praise." P. "Amen." D. "Let us stand
          becomingly." P. "The Mercies of God." Pr. "Charity." P. "And with thy
          spirit." Pr. "Lift up your hearts." P. "We lift them to the Lord." Pr.
          "Let us give thanks to the Lord." P. "It is meet and right." Priest
          (bending low), "For truly the celebration of Thy benefits, O Lord,
          surpasses, the powers of mind, of speech, and of thought; neither is
          sufficient every mouth, mind and tongue, to glorify Thee worthily.
          For, by Thy word the heavens were made, and by the breath of Thy mouth
          all the celestial powers; all the lights in the firmament, sun and
          moon, sea and dry land, and whatever is in them. The voiceless, by
          their silence, the vocal, by their voices, words and hymns,
          perpetually bless Thee; because Thou art essentially good and beyond
          all praise, existing in Thy essence incomprehensibly. This visible and
          sensible creature praises Thee, and also that intellectual, placed
          above sensible perception. Heaven and earth glorify Thee. Sea and air
          proclaim Thee. The sun, in his course, praises Thee; the Moon, in her
          changes, venerates Thee. Troops of Archangels, and hosts of Angels;
          those virtues, more sublime than the world and mental faculty, send
          benedictions to Thine abode. Rays of light, eminent and hidden, send
          their sanctus to Thy glory. Principalities and Orders praise Thee,
          with their Jubilate. Powers and dominions venerate Thee. Virtues,
          Thrones and Seats inaccessible exalt Thee. Splendours of light eternal
          -- mirrors without flaw -- holy essences -- recipients of wisdom
          sublime -- beyond all, investigators of the will hidden from all, in
          clearest modulations of inimitable tones, and by voices becoming a
          rational creature; many eyed Cherubim of most subtle movement, bless
          Thee. Seraphin, furnished with six wings intertwined, cry Sanctus unto
          Thee. Those very ones, who veil their faces with their wings, and
          cover their feet with wings, and flying on every side, and clapping
          with their wings, (that they may not be devoured by Thy devouring
          fire) sing one to another with equal harmony of all, sweet chants,
          pure from every thing material, rendering to Thee, eternal glory;
          crying with one hymn, worthy of God, and saying," P. "Holy, holy,
          holy." Priest (bending) -- "Holy art Thou, O God the Father,
          Omnipotent, Maker and Creator of every creature -- Invisible and
          visible, and sensible; Holy art Thou, O God, the Only-begotten Son,
          Power and Wisdom of the Father, Lord and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
          Holy art Thou, O God, the Holy Spirit, Perfector and Sanctifier of
          Saints. Triad, Holy and undivided: -- co-essential and of equal glory,
          Whose compassion towards our race is most effusive. Thou art holy, and
          making all things holy. Who didst not leave that, our very race, in
          exile from Paradise, although in the meantime involved in every kind
          of sin, but wast manifested to it by the Word, Who, in the presence of
          the" world, suffered extreme poverty; it in very truth, He, the Word,
          took, being made like to it in all things, sin excepted, that it might
          make Him prepared beforehand unto holiness, and disposed for this
          life-giving feast. (Raising his voice) Who being conceived, formed and
          configured by the Holy Spirit, and from virgin blood of the Virgin
          Mary, holy genitrix of God, was born indeed Man, and from the pure and
          most holy body of the same, and receiving Deity in Flesh, whilst the
          law and properties of nature were preserved, but in a manner beyond
          nature, and was acknowledged God in the Spirit, and Man in the flesh;
          and inasmuch as the Word existed before the ages, from Thee, as was
          worthy of God, was born, and by power and miracles, such as became the
          Maker of all, was testified that He was such, from the very fact that
          He has freely imparted a complete healing and a perfect salvation to
          the whole human race. Likewise, in the end and consummation of His
          dispensation on our behalf, and before His saving Cross, He took bread
          into His pure and holy hands, and looked to Thee, O God the Father;
          giving thanks, He blessed, sanctified, brake and gave to His
          disciples, the holy Apostles, saying, "Take and eat from it and
          believe that it is my body, that same, which for you and for many is
          broken and given, for the expiation of faults, the remission of sins,
          and eternal life." P. "Amen." Pr. "Likewise, in the same manner, over
          the cup also, which He mingled with wine and water, He gave thanks,
          blessed, sanctified, and gave to the same disciples and holy apostles,
          saying, Take, drink from it, all of you, and believe that this is My
          blood of the new covenant, which is shed and given for you and for
          many, for the expiation of faults, remission of sins, and eternal
          life.'" P. "Amen."
        </p>
        <p>
          Pr. "Himself also, through the same holy Apostles, gave a precept to
          the whole company and congregation of the faithful, saying, This do to
          the memory of Me, and as oft as ye shall eat this bread and drink the
          commixture which is in this cup, and shall celebrate this feast, ye
          shall perform a commemoration of My death until I come.'" P. "Of Thy
          death, O Lord, we perform a memorial." Pr. "Obeying, then, Thy
          sovereign precept, and celebrating a commemoration of Thy death and
          resurrection, through this sacrifice in perpetual mystery, we await
          also Thy second coming, the renovation of our race, and the
          vivification of our mortality. For, not simply, but with glory worthy
          of God, in Spirit ineffable, Thou wilt terribly come, and seated upon
          the lofty throne of Thy majesty, Thou wilt exact the acknowledgment of
          Thy royal power, from all things created and made: and justly, Thou
          wilt take vengeance for Thy image upon those who have corrupted it
          through evil passions. This sacrifice, here celebrated, we commemorate
          to Thee, O Lord, and the sufferings which Thou didst endure on the
          Cross for us. Be propitious, O Good, and Lover of men, in that hour
          full, of fear and trembling, to this congregation of those adoring
          Thee, and to all sons of the holy Church, bought by Thy precious
          blood. May coals of fire be kept from those who are tinged with Thy
          blood, and sealed by Thy sacraments in Thy holy Name, as formerly the
          Babylonian flame from the youths of the house of Hanania; for neither
          do we know others beside Thee, O God, nor in other have we hope of
          attaining salvation, since indeed Thou art the Helper and Saviour of
          our race; and on this account, our wise Church, through all our lips
          and tongues, implores Thee, and through Thee, and with Thee, Thy
          Father, saying" --
        </p>
        <p>
          P. "Have mercy." Pr. "We also." D. "How tremendous is this hour." (The
          Priest bending, says the prayer of the invocation of the Holy Spirit.)
          Pr. "I invoke Thee, O God the Father, have mercy upon us, and wash
          away, through Thy grace, the uncleanness of my evil deeds; destroy,
          through Thy mercy, what I have done, worthy of wrath; for I do not
          extend my hands to Thee with presumption, for I am not able even to
          look to heaven on account of the multitude of my iniquities and the
          filth of my wickedness. But, strengthening my mind, in Thy
          loving-kindness, grace and long-suffering, I crave Thy holy Spirit,
          that Thou wouldst send Him upon me, and upon these oblations, here set
          forth, and upon Thy faithful people." Pr. "Hear me, O Lord." P. "Kyrie
          eleison," three times. Pr. "Through His alighting upon them, and His
          overshadowing, may He make this bread indeed, living body, and
          procuring life to our souls; body salutary -- body celestial -- body
          saving our souls and bodies -- body of our Lord God and Saviour, Jesus
          Christ -- for remission of sins, and eternal life, for those receiving
          it." P. "Amen." Pr. "And the commixture, which is in this cup, may He
          make living blood, and procuring life to all our souls; blood salutary
          -- blood celestial -- blood saving our souls and bodies -- blood of
          our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ, for remission of sins to those
          receiving them." P. "Amen." Pr. "Further, according to the tradition,
          and Divine recommendation of those, who were eye witnesses of Thy
          mysteries, and interpreters of Thy wonderful acts, we offer this
          Eucharist before Thee, O Lord, and through it we commemorate Thy
          charity towards us, and the universal dispensation of Thine
          Only-begotten One, in this world, that Thou wouldst also be reminded
          through it of Thy mercy, cognate and natural to Thee, which, at all
          hours, is shed upon Thy creatures, and wouldst snatch us from the
          wrath, reserved for the wicked; and from the punishments of those who
          work iniquity; and from the cruel attack of demons, who attack our
          souls, when we shall go hence; and wouldst make us worthy of Thy
          kingdom, and the habitations of those who have kept Thy precepts; and
          we will render to Thee, glory and the giving of thanks, &amp;c." P.
          "Amen." Pr. (bending) "By Thy words, that cannot lie, and by Thy most
          true teachings, Thou hast said, O Lord, that great is the joy in
          heaven over one sinner that repenteth. Rejoice then now, O Lord, in
          the conversion of Thy servants, who stand here before Thee; add also,
          exultation over us, to the souls of the pious and just Fathers --
          Patriarchs -- Prophets -- Apostles -- Preachers -- Evangelists --
          Martyrs -- Confessors -- Zealots" of Divine Worship -- Benefactors --
          Givers of Alms -- of those who minister to the necessities of the poor
          -- and from all, may there be one act of praise to-day, before Thee,
          at this holy Altar, and in the heavenly Jerusalem." (Elevating his
          voice) "And on account of these, and other things of the same kind,
          may Thy holy Church, which is from one end of the earth to the other,
          be established, and preserved in tranquillity and peace, in doctrines
          evangelical and apostolical, by Divine Hierarchs, rightly dispensing
          the word of truth, and instructing, by the dogmas of true religion:
          through holy Priests, who embrace the word of life, and carry
          themselves illustriously in dispensing Thy celestial mysteries:
          through Deacons, who are modest, and perform the pure and royal
          ministry without flaw, through true, faithful ones, who occupy
          themselves in words and acts worthy of a Christian; through choirs of
          virgins of each sex, bearing about in their members the life-giving
          mortification of Thy Only-begotten Son. And from hence, in one troop,
          may we all be sent to that Church, the Jerusalem of the firstborn,
          whose names are written in the heavens, and there let us spiritually
          glorify Thee, O God the Father, and Thine Only-begotten Son, and Thy
          Holy Spirit." P. "Amen." Pr. "Assist also, O Lord, all those who
          assist Thy Holy Church, by offerings -- by tenths -- by ministry --
          and by oblations; and those also, who ask the prayers of our
          littleness, give to them the object of those their prayers, O Lord,
          Lover of men." (Raising his voice) "Send also perfect attention and
          full health to all those who have the charge of the poor, who provide
          food for orphans and widows, and visit the infirm and afflicted.
          Restore to them, here indeed abundance and goods, there also delights
          incorruptible, because thou art Lord of each age, and distributor of
          immense reward. And to Thee beseems beneficence, both here and there,
          and to Thine Only-begotten Son." P. "Amen." Pr. (bending) "Restrain, O
          King of Kings, the wrath of kings, mitigate the fury of soldiers, take
          away wars and seditions, cast down the pride of heretics, and the
          sentences pronounced against us by Justice, may Thy love for mankind
          overcome, and turn into the gentleness of benignity"; (raising his
          voice) "Tranquillity and Peace from Thee, concede to the earth and all
          its inhabitants, visit it with Thy benefits and the care of Thy mercy,
          with a good and temperate condition of atmosphere, copiousness of
          fruits, and abundance of crops, and variety of flowers; preserve it
          from all pests of fury, and all unjust attacks of enemies, both
          spiritual and sensible, that without any injury of passion, we may
          sing perpetual hymns of praise, to Thee and to Thine Only-begotten
          Son." P. "Amen." Pr. (bending) "At this altar, and at that more
          exalted one in heaven, may there be a good remembrance of all those,
          who, out of the world, have pleased Thee -- chiefly indeed of the Holy
          genitrix of God, of John the Messenger, Baptist and Forerunner, of
          Peter and Paul, and of the holy company of the Apostles, of Stephen
          also, and of the whole multitude of Martyrs, and of all those, who,
          before them, with them and after them, have pleased, and do please
          Thee." (Raising his voice) "And since indeed Thou art Omnipotent, to
          the company of those beloved ones and to Thy family, join our
          weakness, O Lord, to that blessed congregation, to this Divine part,
          that, through them may be received our oblations and prayers, before
          the lofty throne of Thy Majesty, inasmuch as we are weak and infirm,
          and wanting in confidence before Thee. Forsooth, our sin and our
          righteousness are as nothing in comparison with the ocean, broad and
          immense, of Thy mercy. Looking then, into the hearts of each, send to
          each one good returns for their petitions, that in all and in each may
          be adored and praised, Thy Majesty, and that of Thine Only-begotten
          Son." P. "Amen." Pr. (bending) "Remember, O Lord, all Bishops, Doctors
          and Prelates of Thy holy Church, those, who from James, Apostle,
          Bishop and Martyr, to this present day, have pleased, and do please
          Thee." (Raising his voice) "Engraft in us, O Lord, their true faith,
          and their zeal for the true religion; their sincere charity without
          defect; their morals without stain; in order that, adhering to their
          footsteps, we may be partakers of their reward, and of the crowns of
          victory which are prepared for them in Thy heavenly kingdom, and
          there, together with them, we may sing to Thee, Glory unceasing, and
          to Thy Only-begotten Son." P. "Amen." Pr. (bending) "Remember, O Lord,
          all those who are fallen asleep, who have laid themselves down in Thy
          hope, in the true faith. More especially, and by name, our Fathers,
          Brothers and Masters, and those, on behalf of whom, and by favour of
          whom, this holy oblation is offered," (raising his voice) "join, O
          Lord, their names, with the names of Thy Saints in the blessed
          habitation of those, who feast and rejoice in Thee; not recalling
          against them the memory of their sins, nor bringing to their memory
          the things which they have foolishly done. For no one is tied to the
          flesh, and at the same time, innocent in Thy sight. For One alone has
          been seen on earth without sin, Jesus Christ, Thine Only-begotten Son;
          Simplex , who came to composition, through whom we also have hope of
          obtaining mercy." P. "Keep quiet." Pr. (bending) "Remitting our and
          their voluntary sins, knowingly or ignorantly committed. Be
          propitious, O Lord, Lover of men." (Raising his voice) "And grant to
          us a peaceful end, departure with mercy, that we may stand without
          fault on the right hand; and, with open face, and confidence, run to
          meet the arising of Thine Only-begotten Son, and His second and
          glorious manifestation from heaven; and may hear from Him, that
          blessed voice, which He shall pronounce at the last day to the
          Blessed." "Blessed of my Father receive the inheritance of the
          heavenly kingdom," "that in this, as in all, may be glorified and
          praised, Thy most venerated Name." P. "That, &amp;c." Pr. "Peace." P.
          "And with thy spirit." The Priest breaks the Host, and says the
          prayer, before "Our Father." Pr, "Father of all, and Beginning, Which
          is above all things -- Light eternal, and Fountain of Light, Which
          illuminates all natures endowed with reason; Who callest the poor from
          the dust, and raisest the beggar from the dunghill; and hast called
          us, lost, rejected, and infirm, to the liberty and household dignity
          of Thy sons, through Thy beloved Son, grant to us, that we may appear
          in Thy sight, holy sons, and not unworthy of the name; and may also
          perform all our ministry after a blameless manner; and with purity of
          soul, and cleanness of intellect, and with a godly mind, whenever we
          invoke Thee, God the Father Omnipotent, holy and heavenly, we pray and
          say, Our Father, which art in heaven." P. "Hallowed be Thy Name,
          &amp;c." Pr. "Free us, Thy servants and sons, from all temptations,
          most difficult, and surpassing our forces; and from all griefs, which
          can bring loss to our body or soul. Guard us, at the same time from
          the evil one, and from his universal power, and from his most
          pernicious devices. For Thou art King of all, and to Thee we render
          glory." P. "Amen." Pr. "Peace," P. "And with thy spirit." D. "Before"
          (Ante). P. "Before Thee, O Lord." (Coram.) Pr. "Look, O Lord, upon Thy
          faithful people, who bend before Thee, and await Thy gift, and
          contemplate the deposit of the Sacraments of Thy Only-begotten, O God
          the Father. Take not away Thy grace from us, and cast us not away from
          Thy ministry, and from participation in Thy sacraments, but prepare
          us, that we may be pure and without flaw, and worthy of this feast;
          and that, with a conscience unblamable, we may ever enjoy His precious
          body and blood; and in a life, glorious and endless, may recline in a
          spiritual habitation, and may feast at the table of Thy kingdom, and
          may render to Thee glory and praise." P. "Amen." Pr. "Peace." P. "And
          with thy spirit." D. "With fear." Pr. "Holy things to holy persons."
          P. "One holy Father." D. "Let us stand becomingly." P. "Before Thee."
          Pr. "We give thanks to Thee, O Lord, and with grateful mind we
          acknowledge Thy loving-kindness; because, from nothing, Thou hast led
          us forth to that which we are, and hast made us members of Thy
          household, and sons of Thy sacraments; and hast entrusted this
          religious ministry to us, and hast made us worthy of this spiritual
          table. Preserve in us, O Lord, the deposit of Thy Divine Mysteries,
          that we may frame and complete our life in Thy sight, after the
          fashion of the angels; that we may be secured and inseparable through
          the reception of Thy holy (mysteries); performing Thy great and
          perfect will, and may be found ready for that last consummation, and
          to stand before Thy Majesty, and may be made worthy of the pleasure of
          Thy kingdom, through the grace, mercy and love towards man, of Thy
          Only-begotten Son, through Whom, and with Whom, is due to Thee, glory,
          honour, &amp;c." P. "Amen." Pr. "Peace." P. "And with thy spirit." D.
          "After" (Post), P. "Before Thee, O Lord." Pr. "O Christ, the King of
          Glory, and Father of the Age to come; Holy Sacrifice; heavenly
          Hierarch; Lamb of God, Who takest away the sin of the world, spare the
          sins of Thy people, and dismiss the foolishness of Thy flock. Preserve
          us, through, the communication of Thy Sacraments, from every sin,
          whether it be committed by word, or thought, or deed; and from
          whatever makes us far from the familiarity of Thy household, that our
          bodies may be guarded by Thy body, and our souls renewed through Thy
          sacraments. And may Thy benediction, O Lord, be in our whole man,
          within and without; and may Thou be glorified in us, and by us, and
          may Thy right hand rest upon us, and that of Thy blessed Father, and
          of Thy most holy Spirit." P. "Amen." D. "Bless, O Lord."
