        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1801)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, September 28th, 1884, by</p>

        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them,
          doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after
          that which is lost, until he find it? And when he hath found it, he
          layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he
          calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice
          with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost. I say unto you,
          that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth,
          more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance"
          -- Luke 15:4-7.
        </p>
        <p>
          OUR Lord Jesus Christ while he was here below was continually in the
          pursuit of lost souls. He was seeking lost men and women, and it was
          for this reason that he went down among them, even among those who
          were most evidently lost, that he might find them. He took pains to
          put himself where he could come into communication with them, and he
          exhibited such kindliness toward them that in crowds they drew near to
          hear him. I dare say it was a queer-looking assembly, a disreputable
          rabble, which made the Lord Jesus its centre. I am not astonished that
          the Pharisee, when he looked upon the congregation, sneered and said,
          "He collects around him the pariahs of our community, the wretches who
          collect taxes for the foreigner of God's free people; the fallen women
          of the town, and such-like riffraff make up his audiences; he, instead
          of repelling them, receives them, welcomes them, looks upon them as a
          class to whom he has a peculiar relationship. He even eats with them.
          Did he not go into the house of Zaccheus, and the house of Levi, and
          partake of the feasts which these low people made for him?" We cannot
          tell you all the Pharisees thought, it might not be edifying to
          attempt it; but they thought as badly of the Lord as they possibly
          could, because of the company which surrounded him. And so, he deigns
          in this parable to defend himself; -- not that he cared much about
          what they might think, but that they might have no excuse for speaking
          so bitterly of him. He tells them that he was seeking the lost, and
          where should he be found but among those whom he is seeking? Should a
          physician shun the sick? Should a shepherd avoid the lost sheep? Was
          he not exactly in his right position when there "drew near unto him
          all the publicans and sinners for to hear him"?
        </p>
        <p>
          Our divine Lord defended himself by what is called an argumentum ad
          hominem, an argument to the men themselves; for he said, "What man of
          you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not go
          after that which is lost, until he find it?" No argument tells more
          powerfully upon men than one which comes close home to their own daily
          life, and the Saviour put it so. They were silenced, if they were not
          convinced. It was a peculiarly strong argument, because in their case
          it was only a sheep that they would go after, but in his case it was
          something infinitely more precious than all the flocks of sheep that
          ever fed on Sharon or Carmel; for it was the soul of man which he
          sought to save. The argument had in it not only the point of peculiar
          adaptation, but a force at the back of it unusually powerful for
          driving it home upon every honest mind. It may be opened out in this
          fashion, -- "If you men would each one of you go after a lost sheep,
          and follow in its track until you found it, how much more may I go
          after lost souls, and follow them in all their wanderings until I can
          rescue them?" The going after the sheep is a part of the parable which
          our Lord meant them to observe: the shepherd pursues a route which he
          would never think of pursuing if it were only for his own pleasure;
          his way is not selected for his own ends, but for the sake of the
          stray sheep. He takes a track up hill and down dale, far into a
          desert, or into some dark wood, simply because the sheep has gone that
          way, and he must follow it until he finds it. Our Lord Jesus Christ,
          as a matter of taste and pleasure, would never have been found among
          the publicans and sinners, nor among any of our guilty race: if he had
          consulted his own ease and comfort he would have consorted only with
          pure and holy angels, and the great Father above; but he was not
          thinking of himself, his heart was set upon the lost ones, and
          therefore he went where the lost sheep were; "for the Son of man is
          come to seek and to save that which was lost." The more steadily you
          look at this parable the more clearly you will see that our Lord's
          answer was complete. We need not this morning regard it exclusively as
          an answer to Pharisees, but we may look at it as an instruction to
          ourselves; for it is quite as complete in that direction. May the good
          Spirit instruct us as we muse upon it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In the first place, I call attention to this observation: THE ONE
          SUBJECT OF THOUGHT to the man who had lost his sheep. This sets forth
          to us the one thought of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd,
          when he sees a man lost to holiness and happiness by wandering into
          sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shepherd, on looking over his little flock of one hundred, can
          only count ninety-nine. He counts them again, and he notices that a
          certain one has gone: it may be a white-faced sheep with a black mark
          on its foot: he knows all about it, for "the Lord knoweth them that
          are his." The shepherd has a photograph of the wanderer in his mind's
          eye, and now he thinks but little of the ninety and nine who are
          feeding in the pastures of the wilderness, but his mind is in a
          ferment about the one lost sheep. This one idea possesses him: "a
          sheep is lost!" This agitates his mind more and more -- "a sheep is
          lost." It masters his every faculty. He cannot eat bread; he cannot
          return to his home; he cannot rest while one sheep is lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          To a tender heart a lost sheep is a painful subject of thought. It is
          a sheep, and therefore utterly defenseless now that it has left its
          defender. If the wolf should spy it out, or the lion or the bear
          should come across its track, it would be torn in pieces in an
          instant. Thus the shepherd asks his heart the question -- "What will
          become of my sheep? Perhaps at this very moment a lion may be ready to
          spring upon it, and, if so, it cannot help itself!" A sheep is not
          prepared for fight, and even for flight it has not the swiftness of
          its enemy. That makes its compassionate owner the more sad as he
          thinks again -- "A sheep is lost, it is in great danger of a cruel
          death." A sheep is of all creatures the most senseless. If we have
          lost a dog, it may find its way home again; possibly a horse might
          return to its master's stable; but a sheep will wander on and on, in
          endless mazes lost. It is too foolish a thing to think of returning to
          the place of safety. A lost sheep is lost indeed in countries where
          lands lie unenclosed and the plains are boundless. That fact still
          seems to ring in the man's soul -- "A sheep is lost, and it will not
          return, for it is a foolish thing. Where may it not have gone by this
          time? Weary and worn, it may be fainting; it may be far away from
          green pastures, and be ready to perish with hunger among the bare
          rocks or upon the arid sand." A sheep is shiftless; it knows nothing
          about providing for itself. The camel can scent water from afar, and a
          vulture can espy its food from an enormous distance; but the sheep can
          find nothing for itself. Of all wretched creatures a lost sheep is one
          of the worst. If anybody had stepped up to the shepherd just then, and
          said, "Good sir, what aileth you? you seem in great concern;" he would
          have replied, "And well I may be, for a sheep is lost." "It is only
          one, sir; and I see you have ninety-nine left." "Do you call it
          nothing to lose one? You are no shepherd yourself, or you would not
          trifle so. Why, I seem to forget these ninety-nine that are all safe,
          and my mind only remembers that one which is lost."
        </p>
        <p>
          What is it which makes the Great Shepherd lay so much to his heart the
          loss of one of his flock? What is it that makes him agitated as he
          reflects upon that supposition -- "if he lose one of them"?
        </p>
        <p>
          I think it is, first, because of his property in it. The parable does
          not so much speak of a hired shepherd, but of a shepherd proprietor.
          "What man of you having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them."
          Jesus, in another place, speaks of the hireling, whose own the sheep
          are not, and therefore he flees when the wolf comes. It is the
          shepherd proprietor who lays down his life for the sheep. It is not a
          sheep alone, and a lost sheep, but it is one of his own lost sheep
          that this man cares for. This parable is not written about lost
          humanity in the bulk -- it may be so used if you please -- but in its
          first sense it is written about Christ's own sheep; as also is the
          second parable concerning the woman's own money; and the third, not
          concerning any prodigal youth, but the father's own son. Jesus has his
          own sheep, and some of them are lost; yea, they were all once in the
          same condition; for "all we like sheep have gone astray; we have
          turned every one to his own way." The parable refers to the
          unconverted, whom Jesus has redeemed with his most precious blood, and
          whom he has undertaken to seek and to save: these are those other
          sheep whom also he must bring in. "For thus saith the Lord God; Behold
          I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out. As a shepherd
          seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are
          scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of
          all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day."
          The sheep of Christ are his long before they know it -- his even when
          they wander; when they are brought into the fold by the effectual
          working of his grace they become manifestly what they were in covenant
          from of old. The sheep are Christ's, first, because he chose them from
          before the foundations of the world -- "Ye have not chosen me, but I
          have chosen you." His, next, because the Father gave them to him. How
          he dwells upon that fact in his great prayer in John 17: "Thine they
          were, and thou gavest them me;" "Father, I will that they also, whom
          thou hast given me, be with me where I am." We are the Lord's own
          flock, furthermore, by his purchase of us; he says: "I lay down my
          life for the sheep." It is nearly nineteen centuries ago since he paid
          the ransom price, and bought us to be his own; and we shall be his,
          for that purchase-money was not paid in vain. And so the Saviour looks
          upon his hands, and sees the marks of his purchase; he looks upon his
          side, and sees the token of the effectual redemption of his own elect
          unto himself by the pouring out of his own heart's blood before the
          living God. This thought, therefore, presses upon him, "One of my
          sheep is lost." It is a wonderful supposition, that is contained in
          this parable -- "if he lose one of them." What! lose one whom he loved
          before ever the earth was? It may wander for a time, but he will not
          have it lost for ever, that he cannot bear. What! lose one whom his
          Father gave him to be his own? Lose one whom he has bought with his
          own life? He will not endure the thought. That word -- "if he lose one
          of them" sets his soul on fire. It shall not be. You know how much the
          Lord has valued each one of his chosen, laying down his life for his
          redemption. You know how dearly he loves every one of his people: it
          is no new passion with him, neither can it grow old. He has loved his
          own and must love them to the end. From eternity that love has endured
          already, and it must continue throughout the ages, for he changeth
          not. Will he lose one of those so dearly loved? Never; never. He has
          eternal possession of them by a covenant of salt, wherein the Father
          has given them to him: this it is that in great measure stirs his soul
          so that he thinks of nothing but this fact, -- One of my sheep is
          lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, he has yet another reason for this all-absorbing thought,
          namely, his great compassion for his lost sheep. The wandering of a
          soul causes Jesus deep sorrow; he cannot bear the thought of its
          perishing. Such is the love and tenderness of his heart that he cannot
          bear that one of his own should be in jeopardy. He can take no rest as
          long as a soul for whom he shed his blood still abides under the
          dominion of Satan and under the power of sin; therefore the Great
          Shepherd neither night nor day forgets his sheep: he must save his
          flock, and he is straitened til it be accomplished.
        </p>
        <p>
          He has a deep sympathy with each stray heart. He knows the sorrow that
          sin brings, the deep pollution and the terrible wounding that comes of
          transgression, even at the time; and the sore heart and the broken
          spirit that will come of it before long; so the sympathetic Saviour
          grieves over each lost sheep, for he knows the misery which lies in
          the fact of being lost. If you have ever been in a house with a mother
          and father, and daughters and sons, when a little child has been lost,
          you will never forget the agitation of each member of the household.
          See the father as he goes to the police-station, and calls at every
          likely house; for he must find his child or break his heart. See the
          deep oppression and bitter anguish of the mother; she is like one
          distracted until she has news of her darling. You now begin to
          understand what Jesus feels for one whom he loves, who is graven on
          the palms of his hands, whom he looked upon in the glass of his
          foreknowledge, when he was bleeding his life away upon the tree; he
          hath no rest in his spirit til his beloved is found. He has compassion
          like a God, and that doth transcend all the compassion of parents or
          of brothers, -- the compassion of an infinite heart brimming over with
          an ocean of love. This one thought moves the pity of the Lord -- "if
          he lose one of them."
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the man in the parable had a third relation to the sheep,
          which made him possessed with the one thought of its being lost, -- he
          was a shepherd to it. It was his own sheep, and he had therefore for
          that very reason become its shepherd; and he says to himself, "If I
          lose one of them my shepherd-work will be ill-done." What dishonour it
          would be to a shepherd to lose one of his sheep! Either it must be for
          want of power to keep it, or want of will, or want of watchfulness;
          but none of these can appertain to the Chief Shepherd. Our Lord Jesus
          Christ will never have it said of him that he has lost one of his
          people, for he glories in having preserved them all. "While I was with
          them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me
          I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that
          the scripture might be fulfilled." The devil shall never say that
          Jesus suffered one whom his Father gave him to perish. His work of
          love cannot in any degree become a failure. His death in vain! No, not
          in jot or tittle. I can imagine, if it were possible, that the Son of
          God should live in vain; but to die in vain! It shall never be. The
          purpose that he meant to achieve by his passion and death he shall
          achieve, for he is the Eternal, the Infinite, the Omnipotent; and who
          shall stay his hand, or baffle his design? He will not have it. "If he
          lose one of them," says the passage; imagine the consequence. What
          scorn would come from Satan! What derision would he pour upon the
          Shepherd! How hell would ring with the news, "He hath lost one of
          them." Suppose it to be the feeblest; then would they cry, "He could
          keep the strong, who could keep themselves." Suppose it to be the
          strongest; then would they cry, "He could not even keep one of the
          mightiest of them, but must needs let him perish." This is good
          argument, for Moses pleaded with God, "What will the Egyptians say?"
          It is not the will of your Father which is in heaven that one of these
          little ones shall perish, neither is it for the glory of Christ that
          one of his own sheep should be eternally lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          You see the reason for the Lord's heart being filled with one burning
          thought; for first, the sheep is his own; next, he is full of
          compassion; and then again, it is his office to shepherd the flock.
        </p>
        <p>
          All this while the sheep is not thinking about the shepherd, or caring
          for him in the least degree. Some of you are not thinking at all about
          the Lord Jesus. You have no wish nor will to seek after him! What
          folly! Oh, the pity of it, that the great heart above should be
          yearning over you to-day, and should fall to rest because you are in
          peril, and you, who will be the greater loser, for you will lose your
          own soul, are sporting with sin, and making yourself merry with
          destruction. Ah, me! how far you have wandered! How hopeless would
          your case be if there were not an Almighty Shepherd to think upon you.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now we come to the second point, and observe THE ONE OBJECT OF
          SEARCH. This sheep lies on the shepherd's heart, and he must at once
          set out to look for it. He leaves the ninety-and-nine in the
          wilderness and goes after that which is lost until he find it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe here that it is a definite search. The shepherd goes after the
          sheep, and after nothing else; and he has the one particular sheep in
          his mind's eye. I should have imagined, from the way in which I have
          seen this text handled, that Christ, the Shepherd, went down into the
          wilderness to catch anybody's sheep he could find. Many were running
          about, and he did not own any one of them more than another, but was
          content to pick up the one that he could first lay hold upon; or
          rather, that which first came running after him. Not so is the case
          depicted in the parable. It is his own sheep that he is seeking, and
          he goes distinctly after that one. It is his sheep which was lost, --
          a well-known sheep; well known not only to himself, but even to his
          friends and neighbours, -- for he speaks to them as if it was
          perfectly understood which sheep it was that he went to save. Jesus
          knows all about his redeemed, and he goes definitely after such and
          such a soul. When I am preaching in the name of the Lord, I delight to
          think that I am sent to individuals with the message of mercy. I am
          not going to draw the bow at a venture at all; but when the Divine
          hands are put on mine to draw the bow, the Lord takes such aim that no
          arrow misses its mark; into the very centre of the heart the word
          finds its way; for Jesus goes not forth at a peradventure in his
          dealings with men. He subdues the will and conquers the heart, making
          his people willing in the day of his power. He calls individuals and
          they come. He says, "Mary," and the response is, "Rabboni." I say, the
          man in the parable sought out a distinct individual, and rested not
          til he found it; so does the Lord Jesus in the movements of his love
          go forth at no uncertainty; he does not grope about to catch whom he
          may, as if he played at Blindman's-buff with salvation, but he seeks
          and saves the one out of his own sheep which he has his eye upon in
          its wanderings. Jesus knows what he means to do, and he will perform
          it to the glory of the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this is an all-absorbing search. He is thinking of nothing
          but his own lost sheep. The ninety-and-nine are left in safety; but
          they are left. When we read that he leaves them in the wilderness we
          are apt to think of some barren place; but that is not intended: it
          simply means the open pasturage, the steppe, the prairie: he leaves
          them well provided for, leaves them because he can leave them. For the
          time being he is carried away with the one thought that he must seek
          and save the lost one, and therefore he leaves the ninety-and-nine in
          their pasture. "Shepherd, the way is very rocky!" He does not seem to
          know what the way is, his heart is with his lost sheep. "Shepherd, it
          is a heavy climb up yon mountainside." He does not note his toll; his
          excitement lends him the feet of the wild goat; he stands securely
          where at other times his foot would slip. He looks around for his
          sheep and seems to see neither crag nor chasm. "Shepherd, it is a
          terrible path by which you must descend into yonder gloomy valley." It
          is not terrible to him: his only terror is lest his sheep should
          perish; he is taken up with that one fear, and nothing else. He leaps
          into danger, and escapes it by the one strong impulse which bears him
          on. It is grand to think of the Lord Jesus Christ with his heart set
          immovably upon the rescue of a soul which at this moment is lost to
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is an active search too; for observe, he goes after that which is
          lost, until he finds it; and he does this with a personal search. He
          does not say to one of his underlings, "Here, hasten after that sheep
          which was lost, and bring it home." No, he follows it himself. And if
          ever there is a soul brought from sin to grace, it is not by us poor
          ministers working alone, but it is by the Master himself, who goes
          after his own sheep. It is glorious to think of him still personally
          tracking sinners, who, though they fly from him with a desperateness
          of folly, yet are still pursued by him -- pursued by the Son of God,
          by the Eternal Lover of men -- pursued by him until he finds them.
        </p>
        <p>
          For notice the perseverance of the search: "until he find it." He does
          not stop til he has done the deed. You and I ought to seek after a
          soul, how long? Why, until we find it; for such is the model set
          before us by the Master. The parable says nothing about his not
          finding it; no hint of failure is given; we dream not that there may
          be a sheep belonging to him which he will never find. Oh, brethren,
          there are a great many whom you and I would never find; but when Jesus
          is after his own lost sheep, depend upon it such is his skill, so
          clearly does he see, and so effectually does he intervene, that he
          will surely bring them in. A defeated Christ I cannot conceive of. It
          is a personal search, and a persevering search, and a successful
          search, until he finds it. Let us praise and bless his name for this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe that when the shepherd does find it, there is a little touch
          in the parable not often noticed, -- he does not appear to put it back
          into the fold again: I mean, we do not find it so written, as a fact
          to be noted. I suppose he did so place it ultimately; but for the time
          being he keeps it with himself rather than with its fellows. The next
          scene is the shepherd at home, saying, "Rejoice with me; for I have
          found my sheep which was lost." It looks as if Jesus did not save a
          soul so much to the church as to himself, and though the saved are in
          the flock, the greatest joy of all is that the sheep is with the
          shepherd. This shows you how thoroughly Christ lays himself out that
          he may save his people. There is nothing in Christ that does not tend
          toward the salvation of his redeemed. There are no pullbacks with him,
          no half-consecrated influences which make him linger. In the pursuit
          of certain objects we lay out a portion of our faculties; but Jesus
          lays out all his powers upon the seeking and saving of souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole Christ seeks after each sinner; and when the Lord finds it,
          he gives himself to that one soul as if he had but that one soul to
          bless. How my heart admires the concentration of all the Godhead and
          manhood of Christ in his search after each sheep of his flock.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now, we must pass on very briefly to notice a third point. We
          have had one subject of thought and one object of search; now we have
          ONE BURDEN OF LOVE. When the seeking is ended, then the saving
          appears, -- "When he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders,
          rejoicing." Splendid action this! How beautifully the parable sets
          forth the whole of salvation. Some of the old writers delight to put
          it thus: in his incarnation he came after the lost sheep; in his life
          he continued to seek it; in his death he laid it upon his shoulders;
          in his resurrection he bore it on its way, and in his ascension he
          brought it home rejoicing. Our Lord's career is a course of
          soul-winning, a life laid out for his people; and in it you may trace
          the whole process of salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, see, the shepherd finds the sheep, and he lays it on his
          shoulders. It is an uplifting action, raising the fallen one from the
          earth whereon he has strayed. It is as though he took the sheep just
          as it was, without a word of rebuke, without delay or hesitancy, and
          lifted it out of the slough or the briers into a place of safety. Do
          you not remember when the Lord lifted you up from the horrible pit?
          When he sent from above, and delivered you, and became your strength?
          I shall never forget that day. What a wonderful lift it was for me
          when the Great Shepherd lifted me into newness of life. The Lord said
          of Israel, "I bare you on eagles' wings;" but it is a dearer emblem
          still to be born upon the shoulders of the incarnate Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          This laying on the shoulders was an appropriating act. He seemed to
          say, "You are my sheep, and therefore I lay you on my shoulders." He
          did not make his claim in so many words, but by a rapid action he
          declared it: for a man does not bear away a sheep to which he has no
          right: this was not a sheep-stealer, but a shepherd-proprietor. He
          holds fast the sheep by all four of its legs, so that it cannot stir,
          and then he lays it on his own shoulders, for it is all his own now.
          He seems to say, "I am a long way from home, and I am in a weary
          desert; but I have found my sheep, and these hands shall hold it."
          Here are our Lord's own words, "I give unto my sheep eternal life, and
          they shall never perish; neither shall any pluck them out of my hand."
          Hands of such might as those of Jesus will hold fast the found one.
          Shoulders of such power as those of Jesus will safely bear the found
          one home. It is all well with that sheep, for it is positively and
          experimentally the Good Shepherd's own, just as it always had been his
          in the eternal purpose of the Father. Do you remember when Jesus said
          unto you, "Thou art mine"? Then I know you also appropriated him, and
          began to sing --
        </p>
        <p>"So I my best Beloved's am,</p>
        <p>And he is mine."</p>
        <p>
          More condescending still is another view of this act: it was a deed of
          service to the sheep. The sheep is uppermost, the weight of the sheep
          is upon the shepherd. The sheep rides, the shepherd is the
          burden-bearer. The sheep rests, the shepherd labours. "I am among you
          as he that serveth," said our Lord long ago. "Being found in fashion
          as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the
          death of the cross." On that cross he bore the burden of our sin, and
          what is more, the burden of our very selves. Blessed be his name, "The
          Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all," and he hath laid us on
          him, too, and he beareth us. Remember that choice Scripture: "In his
          love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried
          them all the days of old." Soul-melting thought, the Son of God became
          subservient to the sons of man! The Maker of heaven and earth bowed
          his shoulders to bear the weight of sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a rest-giving act, very likely needful to the sheep which could
          go no further, and was faint and weary. It was a full rest to the poor
          creature if it could have understood it, to feel itself upon its
          shepherd's shoulders, irresistibly carried back to safety. What a rest
          it is to you and to me to know that we are born along by the eternal
          power and Godhead of the Lord Jesus Christ! "The beloved of the Lord
          shall dwell in safety by him, and he shall dwell between his
          shoulders." The Christ upbears us to-day: we have no need of strength:
          our weakness is no impediment, for he bears us. Hath not the Lord
          said, "I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry and will
          deliver you"? We shall not even stumble, much less fall to ruin: the
          shepherd's feet shall traverse all the road in safety. No portion of
          the way back should cause us fear, for he is able to bear us even to
          his home above. What a sweet word is that in Deuteronomy: "The Lord
          thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye
          went, until ye came into this place." Blessed rest of faith, to give
          yourself up entirely to those hands and shoulders to keep and carry
          you even to the end! Let us bless and praise the Lord. The shepherd is
          consecrated to his burden: he bears nothing on his shoulders but his
          sheep; and the Lord Jesus seemeth to bear no burden but that of his
          people. He lays out his omnipotence to save his chosen; having
          redeemed them first with price of blood, he redeems them still with
          all his power. "And they shall be mine, saith the Lord, in that day
          when I make up my jewels." Oh the glorious grace of our unfailing
          Saviour, who consecrates himself to our salvation, and concentrates
          upon that object all that he has and is!
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. We close by noticing one more matter, which is -- THE ONE SOURCE
          OF JOY. This man who had lost his sheep is filled with joy, but his
          sheep is the sole source of it. His sheep has so taken up all his
          thought, and so commanded all his faculties, that as he found all his
          care centred upon it, so he now finds all his joy flowing from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I invite you to notice the first mention of joy we get here: "When he
          hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing." "That is a
          great load for you, shepherd!" Joyfully he answers, "I am glad to have
          it on my shoulders." The mother does not say when she has found her
          lost child, "This is a heavy load." No; she presses it to her bosom.
          She does not mind how heavy it is; it is a dear burden to her. She is
          rejoiced to bear it once again. "He layeth it on his shoulders,
          rejoicing." Remember that text: "Who for the joy that was set before
          him endured the cross, despising the shame." A great sorrow was on
          Christ when our load was laid on him; but a greater joy flashed into
          his mind when he thought that we were thus recovered from our lost
          estate. He said to himself, "I have taken them up upon my shoulders,
          and none can hurt them now, neither can they wander to destruction. I
          am bearing their sin, and they shall never come into condemnation. The
          penalty of their guilt has been laid on me that it may never be laid
          on them. I am an effectual and efficient Substitute for them. I am
          bearing, that they may never bear, my Father's righteous ire." His
          love to them made it a joy to feel every lash of the scourge of
          justice; his love to them made it a delight that the nails should
          pierce his hands and feet, and that his heart should be broken with
          the absence of his Father, God. Even "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani,"
          when the deeps of its woe have been sounded, will be found to have
          pearls of joy in its caverns. No shout of triumph can equal that cry
          of grief, because our Lord joyed to bear even the forsaking by his
          Father for the sin of his chosen whom he had loved from before the
          foundation of the world. Oh, you cannot understand it except in a very
          feeble measure! Let us try to find an earthly miniature likeness. A
          son is taken ill far away from home. He is laid sick with a fever, and
          a telegram is sent home. His mother says she must go and nurse him;
          she is wretched til she can set out upon the journey. It is a dreary
          place where her boy lies, but for the moment it is the dearest spot on
          earth to her. She joys to leave the comforts of her home to tarry
          among strangers for the love of her boy. She feels an intense joy in
          sacrificing herself; she refuses to retire from the bedside, she will
          not leave her charge; she watches day and night, and only from utter
          exhaustion does she fall asleep. You could not have kept her in
          England, she would have been too wretched. It was a great, deep,
          solemn pleasure for her to be where she could minister to her own
          beloved. Soul, remember you have given Jesus great joy in his saving
          you. He was for ever with the Father, eternally happy, infinitely
          glorious, as God over all; yet he must needs come hither out of
          boundless love, take upon himself our nature, and suffer in our stead
          to bring us back to holiness and God. "He layeth it on his shoulders,
          rejoicing." That day the shepherd knew but one joy. He had found his
          sheep, and the very pressure of it upon his shoulders made his heart
          light, for he knew by that sign that the object of his care was safe
          beyond all question.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now he goes home with it, and this joy of his was then so great that
          it filled his soul to overflowing. The parable speaks nothing as to
          his joy in getting home again, nor a word concerning the joy of being
          saluted by his friends and neighbours. No, the joy of having found his
          sheep eclipsed all other gladness of heart, and dimmed the light of
          home and friendship. He turns around to friends and neighbours and
          entreats them to help him to bear the weight of his happiness. He
          cries, "Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost."
          One sinner had repented, and all heaven must make holiday concerning
          it. Oh, brethren, there is enough joy in the heart of Christ over his
          saved ones to flood all heaven with delight. The streets of Paradise
          run knee-deep with the heavenly waters of the Saviour's joy. They flow
          out of the very soul of Christ, and angels and glorified spirits bathe
          in the mighty stream. Let us do the same. We are friends if we are not
          neighbours. He calls us to-day to come and bring our hearts, like
          empty vessels, that he may fill them with his own joy, that our joy
          may be full. Those of us who are saved must enter into the joy of our
          Lord. When I was trying to think over this text I rejoiced with my
          Lord in the bringing in of each of his sheep, for each one makes a
          heaven full of joy. But, oh to see all the redeemed brought in! Jesus
          would have no joy if he should lose one: it would seem to spoil it
          all. If the purpose of mercy were frustrated in any one instance it
          were a dreary defeat of the great Saviour. But his purpose shall be
          carried out in every instance. He "shall see of the travail of his
          soul, and shall be satisfied." He shall not fail nor be discouraged.
          He shall carry out the will of the Father. He shall have the full
          reward of his passion. Let us joy and rejoice with him this morning!
        </p>
        <p>
          But the text tells us there was more joy over that one lost sheep than
          over the ninety-and-nine that went not astray. Who are these just
          persons that need no repentance? Well, you should never explain a
          parable so as to make it run on four legs if it was only meant to go
          on two. There may not be such persons at all, and yet the parable may
          be strictly accurate. If all of us had been such persons, and had
          never needed repentance, we should not have given as much joy to the
          heart of Christ as one sinner does when he repents. But suppose it to
          mean you and me who have long ago repented -- who have, in a certain
          sense, now no need of repentance, because we are justified men and
          women -- we do not give so much joy to the heart of God, for the time
          being, as a sinner does when he first returns to God. It is not that
          it is a good thing to go astray, or a bad thing to be kept from it.
          You understand how that is: there are seven children in a family, and
          six of them are all well; but one dear child is taken seriously ill,
          and is brought near to the gates of death. It has recovered, its life
          is spared, and do you wonder that for the time being it gives more joy
          to the household than all the healthy ones? There is more expressed
          delight about it a great deal than over all those that have not been
          ill at all. This does not show it is a good thing to be ill. No,
          nothing of the kind; we are only speaking of the joy which comes of
          recovery from sickness. Take another case: you have a son who has been
          long away in a far country, and another son at home. You love them
          both equally, but when the absent son comes home he is for a season
          most upon your thoughts. Is it not natural that it should be so? Those
          at home give us joy constantly from day to day, but when the stream of
          joy has been dammed back by his absence, it pours down in a flood upon
          his return. Then we have "high days and holy days" and "bonfire
          nights."
        </p>
        <p>
          There are special circumstances about repentance and conversion which
          produce joy over a restored wanderer. There was a preceding sorrow,
          and this sets off the joy by contrast. The shepherd was so touched
          with compassion for the lost sheep, that now his sorrow is inevitably
          turned into joy. He suffered a dreadful suspense, and that is a
          killing thing; it is like an acid eating into the soul. That suspense
          which makes one ask, Where is the sheep? Where can it be? is a
          piercing of the heart. All those weary hours of searching, and
          seeking, and following are painfully wearing to the heart. You feel as
          if you would almost sooner know that you never would find it than be
          in that doubtful state of mind. That suspense when it is ended
          naturally brings with it a sweet liberty of joy. Moreover, you know
          that the joy over penitents is so unselfish that you who have been
          kept by the grace of God for many years do not grieve that there
          should be more joy over a repenting sinner than over you. No, you say
          to yourself, "There is good cause. I am myself among those who are
          glad." You remember that good men made great rejoicing over you when
          you first came to Jesus; and you heartily unite with them in welcoming
          newcomers. You will not act the elder brother, and say, I will not
          share the joy of my Father. Not a bit of it; but you will enter
          heartily into the music and dancing, and count it your heaven to see
          souls saved from hell. I feel a sudden flush and flood of delight when
          I meet with a poor creature who once lay at hell's dark door, but is
          now brought to the gate of heaven. Do not you?
        </p>
        <p>
          The one thing I want to leave with you is how our gracious Lord seems
          to give himself up to his own redeemed. How entirely and perfectly
          every thought of his heart, every action of his power, goes toward the
          needy, guilty, lost soul. He spends his all to bring back his
          banished. Poor souls who believe in him have his whole strength
          engaged on their behalf. Blessed be his name! Now let all our hearts
          go forth in love toward him, who gave all his heart to work our
          redemption. Let us love him. We cannot love him as he loved us as to
          measure; but let us do so in like manner. Let us love him with all our
          heart and soul. Let us feel as if we saw nothing, knew nothing, loved
          nothing save Jesus crucified. As we filled all his heart let him fill
          all our hearts!
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, poor sinner, here to-day, will you not yield to the Good Shepherd?
          will you not stand still as he draws near? Will you not submit to his
          mighty grace? Know that your rescue from sin and death must be of him,
          and of him alone. Breathe a prayer to him, -- "Come, Lord, I wait for
          thy salvation! Save me, for I trust in thee." If thou dost thus pray,
          thou hast the mark upon thee of Christ's sheep, for he saith, "My
          sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me." Come to
          him, for he comes to you. Look to him for he looks to you.
