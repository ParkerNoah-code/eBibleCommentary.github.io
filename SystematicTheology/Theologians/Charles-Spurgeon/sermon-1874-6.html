        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1189)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, August 23rd, 1874, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>|And he arose, and came to his father.| -- Luke 15:20.</p>
        <p>
          THIS SENTENCE EXPRESSES the true turning point in the prodigal's life
          story. Many other matters led up to it, and before he came to it there
          was much in him that was very hopeful; but this was the point itself,
          and had he never reached it he would have remained a prodigal, but
          would never have been the prodigal restored, and his life would have
          been a warning rather than an instruction to us. |He arose, and came
          to his father.| Speaking, as I do, in extreme weakness, I have no
          words to spare; and while my voice holds out I shall speak straight to
          the point, and I pray the Lord to make every syllable practical and
          powerful by his Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. We shall begin by noticing that HERE WAS ACTION -- |He arose, and
          came to his father.| He had already been in a state of thoughtfulness;
          he had come to himself, but now he was to go further, and come to his
          father. He had considered the past, and weighed it up, and seen the
          hollowness of all the world's pleasures; he had seen his condition in
          reference to his father, and his prospects if he remained in the
          far-off country; he had thought upon what he ought to do, and what
          would be the probable result of such a course; but now he passed
          beyond the dreaminess of thought into matter-of-fact acting and doing.
          How long will it be, dear hearers, before you will do the same? We are
          glad to have you thoughtful; we hope that a great point is gained when
          you are led to consider your ways, to ponder your condition, and to
          look earnestly into the future, for thoughtlessness is the ruin of
          many a traveler to eternity, and by its means the unwary fall into the
          deep pit of carnal security and perish therein. But some of you have
          been among the |thoughtful| quite long enough; it is time you passed
          into a more practical stage. It is high time that you came to action;
          it would have been better if you had acted already; for, in the matter
          of reconciliation to God, first thoughts are best. When a man's life
          hangs on a thread, and hell is just before him, his path is clear, and
          a second thought is superfluous. The first impulse to escape from
          danger and lay hold on Christ is that which you would be wise to
          follow. Some of you whom I now address have been thinking, and
          thinking, and thinking, till I fear that you will think yourselves
          into perdition. May you, by divine grace, be turned from thinking to
          believing, or else your thoughts will become the undying worm of your
          torment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prodigal had also passed beyond mere regret. He was deeply grieved
          that he had left his father's house, he lamented his lavish
          expenditure upon wantonness and rebelling, he mourned that the son of
          such a father should be degraded into a swineherd in a foreign land;
          but he now proceeded from regret to repentance, and bestirred himself
          to escape from the condition over which he mourned. What is the use of
          regret if we continue in sin? By all means pull up the sluices of your
          grief if the floods will turn the wheel of action, but you may as well
          reserve your tears, if they mean no more than idle sentimentalism.
          What avails it for a man to say he repents of his misconduct if he
          still perseveres in it? We are glad when sinners regret their sin and
          mourn the condition into which sin has brought them, but if they go no
          further, their regrets will only prepare them for eternal remorse. Had
          the prodigal become inactive through despondency, or stolid through
          sullen grief, he must have perished, far away from his father's home,
          as it is to be feared many will whose sorrow for sin leads them into a
          proud unbelief and wilful despair of God's love; but he was wise, for
          he shook off the drowsiness of his despondency, and, with resolute
          determination, |arose and came to his father.| Oh, when will you sad
          ones be wise enough to do the same? When will your thinking and your
          sorrowing give place to practical obedience to the gospel?
        </p>
        <p>
          The prodigal also pressed beyond mere resolving. That is a sweet verse
          which says, |I will arise,| but that is far better which says, |And he
          arose.| Resolves are good, like blossoms, but actions are better, for
          they are the fruits. We are glad to hear from you the resolution, |I
          will turn to God,| but holy angels in heaven do not rejoice over
          resolutions, they reserve their music for sinners who actually repent.
          Many of you like the son in the parable have said, |I go, sir,| but
          you have not gone. You are as ready at forgetting as you are at
          resolving. Every earnest sermon, every death in your family, every
          funeral knell for a neighbor, every pricking of conscience, every
          touch of sickness, sets you a resolving to amend, but your promissory
          notes are never honored, your repentance ends in words. Your goodness
          is as the dew, which at early dawn hangs each blade of grass with
          gems, but leaves the fields all parched and dry when the sun's burning
          heat is poured upon the pasture. You mock your friends, and trifle
          with your own souls. You have often in this house said, |Let me reach
          my chamber and I will fall upon my knees,| but on the way home you
          have forgotten what manner of men you were, and sin has confirmed its
          tottering throne. Have you not dallied long enough? Have you not lied
          unto God sufficiently? Should you not now give over resolving and
          proceed to the solemn business of your souls like men of common sense?
          You are in a sinking vessel, and the life-boat is near, but your mere
          resolve to enter it will not prevent your going down with the sinking
          craft; as sure as you are a living man, you will drown unless you take
          the actual leap for life.
        </p>
        <p>
          |He arose and came to his father.| Now, observe that this action of
          the prodigal was immediate, and without further parley. He did not go
          back to the citizen of that country and say, |Will you raise my wages?
          If not, I must leave.| Had he parleyed he had been lost; but he gave
          his old master no notice, he concerned his indentures by running away.
          I would that sinners here would break their league with death, and
          violate their covenant with hell, by escaping for their lives to
          Jesus, who receives all such runaways. We want neither leave nor
          licence for quitting the service of sin and Satan, neither is it a
          subject which demands a month's consideration: in this matter
          instantaneous action is the surest wisdom. Lot did not stop to consult
          the king of Sodom as to whether he might quit his dominions, neither
          did he consult the parish officers as to the propriety of speedily
          deserting his home; but with the angel's hand pressing them, he and
          his fled from the city. Nay, one fled not; she looked and lingered,
          and that lingering cost her her life! That pillar of salt is the
          eloquent monitor to us to avoid delays when we are bidden to flee for
          our lives. Sinner, dost thou wish to be a pillar of salt? Wilt thou
          halt between two opinions, until God's anger shall doom thee to final
          impenitence? Wilt thou trifle with mercy till justice smite thee? Up,
          man, and while thy day of grace continues, fly thou into the arms of
          love.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text implies that the prodigal aroused himself, and put forth all
          his energies. It is said, |he arose;| the word suggests that he had
          till then been asleep upon the bed of sloth, or the couch of
          presumption. If like Samson in Delilah's lap, he had been supine,
          inactive, and unstrung, but now, startled from his lethargy, he lifts
          up his eyes, he girds up his loins, he shakes off the spell which had
          enthralled him, he puts forth every power, he arouses his whole
          nature, and he spares no exertion until he returns to his father.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men are not saved between sleeping and waking. |The kingdom of heaven
          suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.| Grace does not
          stupefy us, it but arouses us. Surely, sirs, it is worth while making
          an awful effort to escape from eternal wrath. It is worth while
          summoning up every faculty and power and emotion and passion of your
          being, and saying to yourself, |I cannot be lost; I will not be lost:
          I am resolved that I will find mercy through Jesus Christ.| The worst
          of it is, O sinners, ye are so sluggish, so indifferent, so ready to
          let things happen as they may. Sin has bewitched and benumbed you. You
          sleep as on beds of down and forget that you are in danger of hell
          fire. You cry, |A little more rest, and a little more slumber, and a
          little more folding of the arms to sleep,| and so you sleep on, though
          your damnation slumbereth not. Would to God you could be awakened. It
          is not in the power of my voice to arouse you; but may the Lord
          Himself alarm you, for never were men more in danger. Let but your
          breath fail, or your blood pause, and you are lost for ever. Frailer
          than a cobweb is that life on which your eternal destiny depends. If
          you were wise you would not give sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to
          your eyelids, till you had found your God and been forgiven. Oh, when
          will you come to a real action? How long will it be ere you believe in
          Jesus? How long will you snort between the jaws of hell? How long dare
          you provoke the living God?
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, HERE WAS A SOUL COMING INTO ACTUAL CONTACT WITH GOD, --
          |He arose and came to his father.| It would have been of no avail for
          him to have arisen if he had not come to his father. This is what the
          sinner has to do, and what the Spirit enables him to do: namely, to
          come straight away to his God. But, alas! very commonly, when men
          begin to be anxious, they go round about and hasten to a friend to
          tell him about it, or they even resort to a deceitful priest, and seek
          help from him. They fly to a saint or a virgin, and ask these to be
          mediators for then, instead of accepting the only Mediator Jesus
          Christ, and going to God at once by him. They fly to outward forms and
          ceremonies, or they turn to their Bibles, their prayers, their
          repentances, or their sermon-hearings; in fact, to anything rather
          than their God. But the prodigal knew better; he went to his father,
          and it will be a grand day for you, O sinner, when you do the same. Go
          straight away to your God in Christ Jesus. |Come here,| says the
          priest. Pass that fellow by. Get away to your Father. Reject an angel
          from heaven if he would detain you from the Lord. Go personally,
          directly, and at once to God in Christ Jesus. But surely I must
          perform some ceremony first? Not so did the prodigal, he arose and
          went at once to his father. Sinner, you must come to God, and Jesus is
          the way. Go to him then, tell him you have done wrong, confess your
          sins to him, and yield yourself to him. Cry, |Father, I have sinned:
          forgive me, for Jesus' sake.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas! there are many anxious souls who do not go to others, but they
          look to themselves. They sit down and cry, |I want to repent; I want
          to feel my need; I want to be humble.| O man, get up! What are you at?
          Leave yourself and go to your Father. |Oh, but I have so little hope;
          my faith is very weak, and I am full of fears.| What matters your
          hopes or your fears while you are away from your Father? Your
          salvation does not lie within yourself, but in the Lord's good will to
          you. You will never be at peace till, leaving all your doubts and your
          hopes, you come to your God and rest in his bosom. |Oh, but I want to
          conquer my propensities to sin, I want to master my strong
          temptations.| I know what it is you want. You want the best robe
          without your Father's giving it you, and shoes on your feet of your
          own procuring; you do not like going in a beggar's suit and receiving
          all from the Lord's loving hand; but this pride of yours must be given
          up, and you must get away to God, or perish for ever. You must forget
          yourself, or only remember yourself so as to feel that you are bad
          throughout, and no more worthy to be called God's son. Give yourself
          up as a sinking vessel that is not worth pumping, but must be left to
          go down, and get you into the life-boat of free grace. Think of God
          your Father -- of him, I say, and of his dear Son, the one Mediator
          and Redeemer of the sons of men. There is your hope -- to fly away
          from self and to reach your Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do I hear you say, |Well, I shall continue in the means of grace, and
          I hope there to find my God.| I tell you, if you do that, and refuse
          to go to God, the means of grace will be the means of damnation to
          you. |I must wait at the pool,| says one. Then I solemnly warn you
          that you will lie there and die; for Jesus does not command you to lie
          there, his bidding is, |Take up thy bed, and walk.| |Believe in the
          Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.| You have to go unto your
          Father, and not to the pool of Bethesda, or any other pool of
          ordinances or means of grace. |But I mean to pray,| says one. What
          would you pray for? Can you expect the Lord to hear you while you will
          not hear him? You will pray best with your head in your Father's
          bosom, but the prayers of an unyielding, disobedient, unbelieving
          heart are mockeries. Prayers themselves will ruin you if they are made
          a substitute for Doing at once to God. Suppose the prodigal had sat
          down at the swine trough and said, |I will pray here,| what would it
          have availed him? or suppose he had wept there, what good would have
          come of it? Praying and weeping were good enough when he had come to
          his father, but they could not have been substituted for it. Sinner,
          your business is with God. Hasten to him at once. You have nothing to
          do with yourself, or your own doings, or what others can do for you,
          the turning point of salvation is, |he arose and came to his father.|
          There must be a real, living, earnest, contact of your poor guilty
          soul with God, a recognition that there is a God, and that God can be
          spoken to, and an actual speech of your soul to him, through Jesus
          Christ, for it is only God in Christ Jesus that is accessible at all.
          Going thus to God, we tell him that we are all wrong, and walls to be
          set right; we tell him we wish to be reconciled to him, and are
          ashamed that we should have sinned against him; we then put our trust
          in his Son, and we are saved. O soul, go to God: it matters not though
          the prayer you come with may be a very broken prayer, or even if it
          has mistakes in it, as the prodigal's prayer had when he said, |Make
          me as one of thy hired servants;| the language of the prayer will not
          signify so long as you really approach to God. |Him that cometh to
          me,| says Jesus, |I will in no wise cast out;| and Jesus ever liveth
          to make intercessions for them that come to God through him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, then, is the great Protestant doctrine. The Romish doctrine says
          you must go round by the back door, and half-a-dozen of the Lord's
          servants must knock for you, and even then you may never be heard; but
          the grand old Protestant doctrine is, come to God yourself; come with
          no other mediator than Jesus Christ; come just as you are without
          merits and good works; trust in Jesus and your sins will be forgiven
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is my second point: there was action, and that action was
          contact with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now, thirdly, IN THAT ACTION THERE WAS AN ENTIRE YIELDING UP OF
          HIMSELF. In the prodigal's case, his proud independence and self-will
          were gone. In other days he demanded his portion, and resolved to
          spend it as he pleased, but now he is willing to be as much under rule
          as a hired servant, he has had enough of being his own master, and is
          weary of the distance from God which self-will always creates. He
          longs to get into a child's true place, namely, that of dependence and
          loving submission. The great mischief of all was his distance from his
          father, and he now feels it to be so. His great thought is to remove
          that distance by humbly returning, for then he feels that all other
          ills will come to an end. He yields up his cherished freedom, his
          boasted independence, his liberty to think and do and say whatever he
          chose, and he longs to come under loving rule and wise guidance.
          Sinner, are you ready for this? If so, come and welcome; your father
          longs to press you to his bosom!
        </p>
        <p>
          He gave up all idea of self-justification, for he said, |I have
          sinned.| Before he would have said, |I have a right to do as I like
          with my own; who is to dictate how I shall spend my own money. If I do
          sow a few wild oats, every young man does the same. I have been very
          generous, if nothing else, nobody can call me greedy. I am no
          hypocrite. Look at your canting Methodists, how they deceive people!
          There's nothing of that in me, I'll warrant you; I am an outspoken man
          of the world; and after all, a good deal better in disposition than my
          elder brother, fine fellow though he pretends to be.| But now the
          prodigal boasts no longer. Not a syllable of self-praise falls from
          his lips; he mournfully confesses, |I have sinned against heaven and
          before thee.| Sinner, if you would be saved you also must come down
          from your high places, and acknowledge your iniquity. Confess that you
          have done wrong, and do not try to extenuate your offense; do not
          offer apologies and make your case better than it is, but humbly plead
          guilty and leave your soul in Jesus' hands. Of two things, to sin or
          to deny the sin, probably to deny the sin is the worse of the two, and
          shows a blacker heart. Acknowledge your fault, man, and tell your
          heavenly Father that if it were not for his mercy you would have been
          in hell, and that as it is you richly deserve to be there even now.
          Make your case rather blacker than it is if you can, this I say
          because I know you cannot do any such thing. When a man is in the
          hospital it cannot be of any service to him to pretend to be better
          than he is; he will not receive any more medical attention on that
          account, but rather the other way, for the worse his case the more
          likely is the physician to give him special notice. Oh, sinner, lay
          bare before God thy sores, thy putrifying sores of sin, the horrid
          ulcers of thy deep depravity, and cry, |O Lord, have mercy upon me?
          |This is the way of wisdom. Have done with pride and
          self-righteousness, and make thy appeal to the undeserved pity of the
          Lord, and thou will speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe that the prodigal yielded up himself so thoroughly that he
          owned his father's love to him to be an aggravation of his guilt: so I
          take it he means when he says, |Father, I have sinned.| It adds an
          emphasis to the |I have sinned| when it follows after the word
          |father.| |Thou good God, I have broken thy good laws; thou loving,
          tender, merciful God, I have done wrong wantonly and wickedly against
          thee. Thou hast been a very loving Father to me, and I have been a
          most ungenerous and shameless traitor to thee, rebelling without
          cause. I confess this frankly and humbly, and with many tears. Ah!
          hadst thou been a tyrant I might have gathered some apology from thy
          severity, but thou hast been a Father, and this makes it worse that I
          should sin against thee.| It is sweet to hear such a confession as
          this poured out into the Father's bosom.
        </p>
        <p>
          The penitent also yielded up all his supposed rights and claims upon
          his father, saying, |I am not worthy to be called thy son.| He might
          have said, |I have sinned, but still I am thy child,| and most of us
          would have thought it a very justifiable argument; but he does not say
          so, he is too humble for that, he owns, |I am no more worthy to be
          called thy son.| A sinner is really broken down when he acknowledges
          that if God would have no mercy on him, but cast him away for forever,
          it would be no more than justice.
        </p>
        <p>|Should saddled vengeance seize my breath,</p>
        <p>I must pronounce thee just in death;</p>
        <p>And, if my soul were sent to hell,</p>
        <p>Thy righteous law approves it well.|</p>
        <p>
          That soul is not far from peace which has ceased arguing and submits
          to the sentence. Oh, sinner, I urge thee, if thou wouldst find speedy
          rest, go and throw thyself at the foot of the cross where God meets
          such as thou art, and say, |Lord, here I am; do what thou wilt with
          me. Never a word of excuse will I offer, nor one single plea by way of
          extenuation. I am a mass of guilt and misery, but pity me, oh, pity
          me! No rights or claims have I; I have forfeited the rights of
          creatureship by becoming a rebel against thee. I am lost and utterly
          undone before the bar of thy justice. From that justice I flee and
          hide myself in the wounds of thy Son. According to the multitude of
          thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions!|
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again, here was such a yielding up of himself to his father that
          no terms or conditions are mentioned or implied. He begs to be
          received, but a servant's place is good enough for him; amongst the
          scullions of the kitchen he is content to take his place, so long as
          he may be forgiven. He does not ask for a little liberty to sin, or
          stipulate for a little self-righteousness wherein he may boast; he
          gives all up. He is willing to be anything or nothing, just as his
          father pleases, so that he may but be numbered with his household. No
          weapons of rebellion are in his hands now. No secret opposition to his
          father's rule lingers in his soul, he is completely subdued, and lies
          at his father's feet. Our Lord never crushed a soul yet that lay
          prostrate at his feet, and he never will. He will stoop down and say,
          |Rise, my child; rise, for I have forgiven thee. Go and sin no more. I
          have loved thee with an everlasting love.| Come and let us return unto
          the Lord, for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and
          he will bind us up. He will not break the bruised reed, nor quench the
          smoking flax.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Notice further, and fourthly, that IN THIS ACT THERE WAS A MEASURE
          OF FAITH IN HIS FATHER -- a measure, I say, meaning thereby not much
          faith, but some. A little faith saves the soul. There was faith in his
          father's power. He said, |In my father's house there is bread enough
          and to spare.| Sinner, dost thou not believe that God is able to save
          thee; that through Jesus Christ he is able to supply thy soul's needs.
          Canst thou not get as far as this, |Lord, if thou wilt thou canst make
          me clean.| The prodigal had also some faith in his father's readiness
          to pardon; for if he had not so hoped he would never have returned to
          his father at all: if he had been sure that his father would never
          smile upon him he would never have returned to him. Sinner, do believe
          that God is merciful, for so he is. Believe, through Jesus Christ,
          that he willeth not the death of the sinner, but had rather that he
          should turn to him and live; for as surely as God this is truth, and
          do not thou believe a lie concerning thy God. The Lord is not hard or
          harsh, but he rejoices to pardon great transgressions. The prodigal
          also believed in his fathers readiness to bless him. He felt sure that
          his father would go as far as propriety would permit, for he said, |I
          am not worthy to be called thy son, but make me at least thy servant.|
          In this also he admitted that his father was so good, that even to be
          his servant would be a great matter. He was contented even to get the
          lowest place, so long as he might be under the shade of so good a
          protector.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah, poor sinner, dost thou not believe that God will have mercy on
          thee if he can do so consistently with his justice? If thou believest
          that, I have good news to tell thee. Jesus Christ, his Son, has
          offered such an atonement, that God can be just, and yet the justifier
          of him that believeth, he has mercy upon the vilest, and justifieth
          the ungodly, and accepteth the very chief of sinners through his dear
          Son. Oh, soul, have faith in the atonement. The atonement made by the
          personal sacrifice of the Son of God must be infinitely precious;
          believe thou that there is efficacy enough in it for thee. It is thy
          safety to fly to that atonement and cling to the Cross of Christ, and
          thou wilt honor God by so doing; is the only way in which thou canst
          honor him. Thou canst honor him by believing that he can save thee,
          even thee. The truest faith is that which believes in the mercy of God
          in the teeth of conscious unworthiness. The penitent in the parable
          went to his father too unworthy to be called his son, and yet he said,
          |My father.| Faith has a way of seeing the blackness of sin, and yet
          believing that God can make the soul as white as snow. It is not faith
          that says, |I am a little sinner, and therefore God can forgive me;|
          but that is faith which cries, |I am a great sinner, an accursed and
          condemned sinner, and yet, for all that, God's infinite mercy can
          forgive me, and the blood of Christ can make me clean.| Believe in the
          teeth of thy feelings, and in spite of thy conscience; believe in God,
          though everything within thee seems to say, |He cannot save thee; he
          will not save thee.| Believe in God, sinner, over the tops of mountain
          sins. Do as John Bunyan says he did, for he was so afraid of his sins
          and of the punishment thereof, that he could not but run into God's
          arms, and he said, |Though he had held a drawn sword in his hands, I
          would have run on the very point of it, rather than have kept away
          from him.| So do thou, poor sinner. Believe thy God. Believe in
          nothing else, but trust thy God, and thou wilt get the blessing. It is
          wonderful the power of faith over God, it binds his justice and
          constrains his grace. I do not know how to illustrate it better than
          by a little story. When I walked down my garden some time ago I found
          a dog amusing himself among the flowers. I knew that he was not a good
          gardener, and no dog of mine, so I threw a stick at him and bade him
          begone. After I had done so, he conquered me, and made me ashamed of
          having spoken roughly to him, for he picked up my stick, and, wagging
          his tail right pleasantly, he brought the stick to me, and dropped it
          at my feet. Do you think I could strike him or drive him away after
          that? No, I patted him and called him good names. The dog had
          conquered the man. And if you, poor sinner, dog as you are, can have
          confidence enough in God to come to him just as you are, it is not in
          his heart to spurn you. There is an omnipotence in simple faith which
          will conquer even the divine Being himself. Only do but trust him as
          he reveals himself in Jesus, and you shall find salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. I have not time or strength to dwell longer here, and so I must
          notice, fifthly, that THIS ACT OF COMING INTO CONTACT WITH GOD IS
          PERFORMED BY THE SINNER JUST AS HE IS. I do not know how wretched the
          prodigal's appearance may have been, but I will be bound to say he had
          grown none the sweeter by having fed swine, nor do I suppose his
          garments had been very sumptuously embroidered by gathering husks for
          then from the trees. Yet, just as he was, he came. Surely he might
          have spent an hour profitably in cleansing his flesh and his clothes.
          But no, he said, |I will arise,| and no sooner said than done! he did
          arise, and he came to his father. Every moment that a sinner stops
          away from God in order to get better he is but adding to his sin, for
          the radical sin of all is his being away from God and the longer he
          stays in it the more he sins. The attempt to perform good works apart
          from God is like the effort of a thief to set his stolen goods in
          order, his sole duty is to return them at once. The very same pride
          which leads men away from God may be seen in their self-conceited
          notion that they can improve themselves while still they refuse to
          return to him. The essence of their fault is that they are far off
          from God, and whatever they do, so long as that distance remains,
          nothing is effectually done. I say the radical of the whole matter is
          distance from God, and therefore the commencement of setting matters
          right lies in arising and returning to him from whom they have
          departed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prodigal was bound to go home just as he was, for there was
          nothing that he could do. He was reduced to such extremities that he
          could not purchase a fresh piece of cloth to mend his garments, nor a
          farthing's worth of soap with which to cleanse his flesh; and it is a
          great mercy when a man is so spiritually reduced that he cannot do
          anything but go to his God as a beggar, when he is so bankrupt that he
          cannot pay a farthing in the pound, when he is so lost that he cannot
          even repent or believe apart from God, but feels that he is for ever
          undone unless the Lord shall interpose. It is our wisdom to go to God
          for everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, there was nothing needed from the prodigal but to return to
          his father. When a child who has done wrong comes back, the more its
          face is blurred with tears the better. When a beggar ask for charity,
          the more his clothes are in rags the better. Are not ram and sores the
          very livery of beggars? I once gave a man a pair of shoes because he
          said he was in need of them; but after he had put them on and gone a
          little way I overtook him in a gateway taking them off in order to go
          barefooted again. I think they were patent leather, and what should a
          beggar do in such attire? He was changing them for |old shoes and
          clouted,| those were suitable to his business. A sinner is never so
          well arrayed for pleading as when he comes in rags. At his worst, the
          sinner, for making an appeal to mercy, is at his best. And so,
          sinners, there is no need for you to linger; come just as you are.
          |But must we not wait for the Holy Spirit? |Ah, beloved, he who is
          willing to arise and go to his Father has the Holy Spirit. It is the
          Holy Spirit who moves us to return to God, and it is spirit of the
          flesh or of the devil that would bid us wait.
        </p>
        <p>
          How now, sinners? Some of you are sitting in those pews, where are
          you? I cannot find you out, but my Master can, he has made this sermon
          on purpose for you. |Well, but I would like to get home and pray.|
          Pray where you are, in the pew. |But I cannot speak out aloud.| You
          may if you like, I won't stop you. |But I should not like.| Well,
          don't, then. God can hear you without a sound, though I wish sometimes
          we did hear people cry out, |What must I do to be saved? |I would
          gladly hear the prayer, |God be merciful to me a sinner.| But if men
          cannot hear you, the Lord can hear the cries of their hearts. Now,
          just sit still a minute, and say, |My God I must come to thee. Thou
          art in Jesus Christ, and in him thou has already come a great way to
          meet me. My soul wants thee; take me now and make me what I ought to
          be. Forgive me, and accept me.| It is the turning-point of a man's
          life when that is done, wherever it is, whether in a workshop, or in a
          saw-pit, in a church, or in a tabernacle; it does not matter where.
          There is the point -- the getting to God in Christ, giving all up, and
          by faith resting in the mercy of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. The last point of all is this -- THAT ACT WROUGHT THE GREATEST
          CONCEIVABLE CHANGE IN THE MAN. He was a new man after that. Harlots,
          winebibbers, you have lost your old companion now! He has gone to his
          leather, and his Father's company and yours will never agree. A man's
          return to his God means his leaving the chambers of vice and the
          tables of riot. You may depend upon it whenever you hear of a
          professing Christian living in uncleanness, he has not been living
          anywhere near his God. He may have talked a great deal about it, but
          God and unchastity never agree; if you have friendship with God you
          will have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, too, the penitent has done with all degrading works to support
          himself. You will not find him feeding swine any more, or making a
          swine of himself either by trusting in priests or sacraments. He will
          not confess to a priest again, or pay a penny to get his mother out of
          purgatory; he is not such a fool as that any more. He has been to his
          God on his own account, and he does not want any of these shavelings
          to go to God for him. He has got away from that bondage. No more
          pig-feeding; no more superstition for him! |Why,| says he, |I have
          access with boldness to the mercy-seat, and what have I to do with the
          priests of Rome?|
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a change in him in all ways. Now he has come to his father
          his pride is broken down. He no longer glories in that which he calls
          his own; all his glory is in his father's free pardoning love. He
          never boasts of what he has, for he owns that he has nothing but what
          his father gives him; and though he is far better off than ever he was
          in his spendthrift days, yet he is as unassuming as a little child. He
          is a gentleman-commoner upon the bounty of his God, and lives from day
          to day by a royal grant from the table of the King of kings. Pride is
          gone, but content fills its room. He would have been contented to be
          one of the servants of the house, much more satisfied is he to be a
          child. He loves his father with a new love; he cannot even mention his
          name without saying, |And he forgave me, he forgave me freely, he
          forgave me all, and he said, |Bring forth the best robe and put it on
          him; put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet.| From the day of
          his restoration the prodigal is bound to his Father's home, and
          reckons it to be one of his greatest blessings that it is written in
          the covenant of grace, |I will put my fear in their hearts, that they
          shall not depart from me.|
        </p>
        <p>
          This morning I believe that God in his mercy means to call many
          sinners to himself. I am often very much surprised to find how the
          Lord guides my word according to the persons before me. Last Sunday
          there came here a young son of a gentleman, a foreigner, from a
          distant land, under considerable impressions as to the truth of the
          Christian religion. His father is a follower of one of the ancient
          religions of the East, and this young gentleman naturally felt it a
          great difficulty that he would probably make his father angry if he
          became a Christian. Judge, then, how closely the message of last
          Sabbath came home to him, when the text was, |What if thy father
          answer thee roughly? |He came to tell me that he thanked God for that
          message, and he hoped to bear up under the trial, should persecution
          arise. I feel that I am with equal plainness speaking to some of you.
          I know I am. You are saying, |May I now go to God joist as I am, and
          through Jesus Christ yield myself up; and will he forgive me? |Dear
          brother, or dear sister, wherever you may be, try it. That is the best
          thing to do; try it; and, if the angels do not set the bells in heaven
          ringing, God has altered from what he was last week, for I know he
          received poor sinners then, and he will receive them now. The worst
          thing I dread about you is, lest you should say, |I will think of it.|
          Don't think of it. Do it! Concerning this no more thinking is needed;
          but to do it. Get away to God. Is it not according to nature that the
          creature should he at peace with its Creator? Is it not according to
          your conscience? Is there not something within you which cries, |Go to
          God in Christ Jesus.| In the case of that poor prodigal, the famine
          said to him, |Go home!| Bread was dear, meat was scarce, he was
          hungry, and every pang of want said, |Go home! Go home!| When he went
          to his old friend the citizen, and he asked him for help, his scowling
          looks said, |Why don't you go home?| There is a time with sinners when
          even their old companions seem to say, |We do not want you. You are
          too miserable and melancholy. Why don't you go home?| They sent him to
          feed swine, and the very hogs grunted, |Go home?| When he picked up
          those carob husks and tried to eat them, they crackled, |Go home.| He
          looked upon his rags, and they gaped at him, |Go home.| His hungry
          belly and his faintness cried |Go home.| Then he thought of his
          father's face, and how kindly it had looked at him, and it seemed to
          say, |Come home!| He remembered the bread enough and to spare, and
          every morsel seemed to say, |Come home! |He pictured the servants
          sitting down to dinner and feasting to the full, and every one of them
          seemed be look right away over the wilderness to him and to say, |Come
          home! Thy father feeds us well. Come home! |Everything said, |Come
          home! |Only the devil whispered, |Never go back. Fight it out! Better
          starve than yield! Die game! |But then he had got away from the devil
          this once, for he had come to himself, and he said, |No; I will arise
          and go to my father.| Oh that you would be equally wise. Sinner, what
          is the use of being damned for the sake of a little pride. Yield thee,
          man! Down with thy pride! You will not find it so hard to submit if
          you remember that dear Father who loved us and gave himself for us in
          the person of his own dear Son. You will find it sweet to yield to
          such a friend. And when you get your head in his bosom, and feel his
          warm kisses on your cheek, you will soon feel that it is sweet to weep
          for sin -- sweet to confess your wrong doing, and sweeter still to
          hear him say, |I have blotted out thy sins like a cloud, and like a
          thick cloud thy transgressions.| |Though your sins be as scarlet, they
          shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall
          be as wool.|
        </p>
        <p>
          God Almighty grant this may be the case with hundreds of you this
          morning. He shall have all the glory of it, but my heart shall be very
          glad, for I feel nothing of the spirit of the elder brother within me,
          but the greatest conceivable joy at the thought of making merry with
          you by-and-by, when you come to own my Lord and Master, and we sit
          together at the sacramental feast, rejoicing in his love. God bless
          you, for his sake. Amen.
