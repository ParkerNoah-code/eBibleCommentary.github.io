        <p>A Sermon</p>

        <p>
          |Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me;
          because I live, ye shall live also.| -- John 14:19.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS WAS, and is, the mark of the true believer, that he see Jesus.
          When Jesus was here among men, the world saw him in a certain sense,
          but yet in truth it did not see him at all. The world's eye saw the
          outside of Christ -- the flesh of the man Christ, but the true Christ
          the ungodly eye could not discern. They could not perceive those
          wonderful attributes of character, those delightful graces and charms,
          which made up the true spiritual Christ. They saw but the husk, and
          not the kernel; they saw the quartz of the golden nugget, but not the
          pure gold which that quartz contained. They saw but the external man;
          the real, spiritual Christ they could not see. But unto as many as God
          had chosen, Christ manifested himself as he did not unto the world.
          There were some to whom he said, |The world seeth me not, but ye see
          me.| Some there were whose eyes were anointed with the heavenly
          eye-salve, so that they saw in the |the man Christ Jesus,| the God,
          the glorious Saviour, the King of kings, the Wonderful, the
          Counsellor, the mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of
          Peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          The blind world said of him that he was a root out of a dry ground,
          and when they saw him there was no beauty in him that they should
          desire him; he was despised and rejected of men. But these men saw him
          as God over all blessed for ever, descending to tabernacle among men,
          and to take upon himself man's imperfect nature, that so he might
          redeem him from all iniquity and save him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, to this hour, this is the mark of the true Christian: this is to
          be of the elect: this is the very badge and symbol of the faithful --
          they see Jesus. They look beyond the clouds. Other men see the cloud
          and the darkness, and they wist not what it is; but these men with
          more than eagle eye pierce through the clouds of mere sensual
          impressions, and they see the glory that was always his, even the
          glory of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.
          Beloved, have you ever seen Jesus with the eye of faith? Have you ever
          perceived the glory of his person, and the beauty of his character?
          Have you so perceived Jesus as to trust in him? Have you been so
          enamoured of him as to have yielded yourselves to be his servants for
          ever? Do you take up his cross? Do you avow yourselves to be his
          followers, come what may? If so, then are ye saved; but if ye see not
          Christ with your spirit, neither do ye know him, nor shall ye enjoy a
          portion with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blessed be God, there is this to be said, that he who has once seen
          Christ shall always see him. The eye may sometimes gather dimness, but
          the light shall yet return. Where Christ hath opened a blind eye,
          blindness comes not back again. He take the cataract totally away. He
          does not give a transient gleam of spiritual sight, and then permit
          the soul to go back into the darkness of its grave; but the sight
          which he gives is the sight of things eternal, a sight which shall
          strengthen and grow until at the last, when death shall take away
          every barrier which parts us from the unseen world, we shall know even
          as we are know, and see even as we are seen. To see Jesus! 'Tis heaven
          begun! And heaven consummated is but to see Jesus, no longer through a
          glass darkly, but face to face -- still it is to see Jesus, to behold
          the King in his beauty. This, I say, is the sum and substance of life
          eternal, and it is true life here below.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now our Lord, speaking ot those who had seen him, seen him truly
          and in spiritual recognition, talks to them concerning life. Sometimes
          it is ours to speak to you of death, not necessarily with gloom, for
          it is to the Christian illuminated with rays of heavenly light; but
          here and now we desire to speak of life, the best and divinest life;
          we will forget the raven with its dusky wing, and see only the tender,
          gentle dove, bearing for each one of us the olive-branch of peace and
          victory.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall speak of life -- life of the highest possible degree: not the
          life which gladdens our eyes in the sunlight when we behold the
          flowers of the field opening their cups: this is vegetable life. Nor
          the life of the young lambs as they frisk, and caper, and dance for
          very gladness in the spring sunbeams. This is but animal life. Nor
          even the life that enables men to think and speak upon common themes
          of interest, and perform the ordinary duties of their different
          calling: this is but mental and social life. We reach to something
          higher still -- spiritual life, life in Christ Jesus; a life twice
          created; a life which is grafted, and is an advance upon the first
          life which we have when we are born, surpassing far the life of the
          flesh, because that shall by-and-bye expire; but this is a life which
          springs from incorruptible seed, and which liveth and abideth for
          ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text, in talking to us about life, gives us, first the assurance
          that Jesus lives; it the promises us that his people shall live; and
          it clearly states that there is a link of connection between the two
          things -- that because Jesus lives, his people shall live also. First,
          then: --
        </p>
        <p>I. JESUS LIVES.</p>
        <p>
          He always lived. There never was a time when he was not. |Before the
          hills were brought forth I was there,| saith he. The eternal Wisdom of
          God is from everlasting. |In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
          was God, and the Word was with God. The same was in the beginning with
          God.| The life, however, which we think is intended in the text, is
          not his divine life, his life as Deity, but his life as man, his life
          as Mediator between God and man. In that life he lives. We needed not
          to be assured of his divine life: but seeing that, as a Mediator he
          died, it was necessary to assure us that as a Mediator he descended
          into the tomb; it is well for us to be assured that as a Mediator he
          rose again from his grave, and now lives at the right hand of the
          Father, no more to bleed and die.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus Christ at this time lives in his proper manhood. He lives as to
          his soul: his human soul is as it was on earth. He lives as to his
          human body. He is a man before the throne; and I have no doubt that he
          wears the symbol, of course, mightily glorified, of his sufferings.
        </p>
        <p>|Looks like a Lamb that had been slain.</p>
        <p>And wears his priesthood still.|</p>
        <p>
          That very Christ, who did once as a babe lie upon his mother's breast,
          and who afterwards trod the waves of Gennesaret: who, after his
          resurrection, ate apiece of broiled fish and of honeycomb -- that very
          Christ is now before the eternal throne. In very soul and body the man
          Christ Jesus is there. He lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          He lives a real life. We are so very apt to mystify and becloud
          everything, and to suppose that Christ lives by his influence only, or
          lives by his Spirit. Brethren, he lives, the very man that died, as
          surely as he bled upon the tree, and in his ownproper person, from
          five actual wounds poured out the warm life-torrents of his heart, so
          surely does he actually live at this present moment in the midst of
          unnumbered hearts that sound his praise -- the delightful object of
          the vision of the myriads of spirits who continually adore him. He
          actually lives; he really and truly lives, as he lived here below.
        </p>
        <p>
          He lives, also, actively -- not in some wondrous sleep of quiet and
          sacred repose. He is as busy now as he was when here. He proposed to
          himself when he went away a certain work. |I go to prepare a place for
          you,| said he. He is preparing that place for us still. He intercedes,
          also, daily for his people. Oh! if your faith is strong enough, even
          now you can see him distinctly standing before the throne of God,
          pleading his glorious merits. I think I see him now as clearly as ever
          the Jews saw Aaron when he stood with his breast-plate on before the
          mercy-seat, for remember, the Jew never did see Aaron at all there,
          for the curtain was dropped, and Aaron was within the veil, and
          therefore, the Jew could only see him in his fancy. But I say I see
          him as clearly as that, for I see my Lord, not by fancy, but by faith.
          There, where the veil is rent, so that he is not hidden from my soul's
          gaze. I see him with my name and yours upon his breast, pleading
          before God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why, gaze awhile and you may think you see him now. Just as the Jew
          saw Aaron, waving the censer, standing between the living and the
          dead, and staying the plague, even so is Christ standing at this hour
          between the living and the dead, and so moving the whole Deity to
          spare the guilty yet a little longer, whilst he makes intercession for
          them that they may live. And then comes his higher intercession for
          them that they may live. And then comes his higher intercession for
          his elect, of whom he says, |I pray for them; I pray not for the
          world.| He lives, then, an actual life, of which you and I reap the
          daily fruits. Not a life of slumber and stillness, but an active, busy
          life, by which he continually dispenses gifts to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this reason it is well to remind you, that, therefore, Jesus can
          only lives as a man in one place. When we speak of Christ being found
          in every assembly of his people, we understand that of his presence in
          his Godhead and by his Holy Spirit, who rules on earth in this
          dispensation of the Spirit. But the man Christ can be but in one
          place, and he is now at the right hand of the Majesty on high. It is
          absurd, it is horrible both to faith and to reason, to say the
          Christ's body is eaten, and that his blood is drunk in tens of
          thousands of places wherever priests choose to offer what they call
          |the mass.| A |mass| of profanity, indeed, it is! Our Lord Jesus
          Christ, as to his real, positive, corporeal presence, is not here. As
          to his flesh and his blood, he is not, and cannot be, here. He will be
          here one day, when he shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the
          trump of the archangel and the voice of God, but in his real person,
          he is now where his saints are -- before the throne, whence by-and-bye
          he will descend. Meanwhile, his spiritual presence is our joy and our
          gladness, but his corporeal presence -- a doctrine which our faith
          grasps and lays hold of -- his corporeal presence is before the throne
          of God, and there he lives in proper flesh and blood as the Son of
          Man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren and sisters, listen to a brief sketch of the biography of
          Christ's life in glory. When the holy women and godly men wrapped him
          in spices, and laid him in the tomb, Jesus was dead. There for parts
          of three days and nights he tarried. He saw no corruption, but yet he
          was in the place of corruption. No worm could assail that holy thing
          which no sin had tainted, and yet he laid in the place where death
          seemed sovereign. A while he slept, and the Church mourned, but
          blessed was the day when, at the first rosy dawn of the light, the
          Saviour rose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then could he say, |I live.| His body, instinct with life, rose from
          its slumber, and began at once to put off the grave-clothes. He
          unwound the winding-sheets and the fine white linen, and laid them
          carefully down, and left them there, for you and me, that we might
          have our bed well sheeted when we come to lie in it at the last.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the napkin, he unwound it, and laid it by itself, as though
          that were for us who are living, to wipe our eyes when our dear ones
          are taken away, since we have no cause to sorrow as they do who have
          no hope. And when this was done, an angel rolled away the stone, and
          forth came the Saviour -- glorious, no doubt, but so much like other
          men that Mary |supposed him to have been the gardener,| so that there
          could have been no very supernatural slendour surrounding his person.
          He revealed himself to many of his disciples -- sometimes to as many
          as five hundred at once. He ate with them; he drank with them; he was
          a man among men with them, till, when forty days had passed, he
          gathered them all at Olivet, the mountain from which he had so often
          addressed them, and took his final leave. While he was blessing them,
          his hands outstretched in benediction, a cloud received him out of
          their sight. And since then he hath sat down at the right hand of God,
          expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. He is tarrying there
          yet a little while longer. When the fulness of time shall come -- if I
          may go on with his biography -- he will come again. |This same Jesus,|
          said the angels, |which is taken up from you heaven, shall so come in
          a like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.| He will, therefore,
          come in proper person a second time, without a sin offering, unto
          salvation. Then will he gather his saints together who have made a
          covenant with him by sacrifice. Then shall they reign with him. Then
          shall the earth be covered with his glory. All nations shall bow
          before him, and all people shall call him blessed. And then shall come
          the end, when he shall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father,
          and God shall be all in all. But Christ shall still live, for he hath
          received a priesthood after the order of Melchizedek, without
          beginning of days, or end of years -- a priest for ever. When suns and
          moons shall grow dim with age, and the round world shall all dissolve,
          like the morning hoar-frost, and time shall be rolled up like a
          vesture, and all the ages shall have been trodden out like sparks
          beneath the foot of the Eternal God, then shall Jesus Christ live on
          still, world without end. Thus have we spoken concerning Christ as
          living. But now, in the next place: --
        </p>
        <p>II.LIFE IS PROMISED TO CHRIST'S PEOPLE.</p>
        <p>
          This does not mean their natural existence. That they have received
          from Adam, and, through their sin, it has become a curse to them,
          rather than a blessing. Should they remain unpardoned, the fact of
          continued existence will become to them the dreadful of calamities,
          since it must be an existence in God's holy abhorrence of sin for
          ever; driven from every glimpse or hope of forgiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The life which comes to us through Christ is of this sort -- I trust
          you know it in your own hearts -- it is life spiritual, given to us in
          regeneration. When the Holy Spirit quickens a dead soul, that dead
          soul then receives the life of Christ. No man is alive unto God
          spiritually, except through Christ. Because Christ lives, we live.
          When a dead soul gets into living contact with the living Saviour by
          the power of the Spirit, then it is that spiritual life begins. The
          very first evidence of spiritual life is trusting in Jesus, which
          shows that s the first symptom is alliance to Christ, the cause of the
          life must be somewhere here, namely, union with Christ. One of the
          very first outward signs is prayer -- prayer to Christ, and that,
          again, rises from the fact that Christ gives us of his life, and then
          that life goes back again to him. Brethren, if you seek the life of
          other souls, and desire to see them brought to God, preach Christ to
          them. Do you not see, |Because I live, ye shall live|? Then no sinner
          ever will live spiritually apart from Christ. Though you and I cannot
          quicken them, yet we can preach the gospel to them, and faith cometh
          by hearing, and where faith is, there life is. It is no use trying to
          raise the dead by preaching the law to them. That is only covering
          them up fairly with a lie in their right hand; but preach of dying
          love and of rising power, to tell of pardons bought with blood, and to
          declare that Christ died a substitute for sinners -- this is the
          hopeful way of bringing life to the dead. IT is by such
          instrumentality that souls are brought to life eternal. Because Christ
          is alive, his elect in due time receive spiritual life by the power of
          the Holy Spirit, and, although once they were dead in sin, they begin
          to live unto righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, this spiritual life is preserved in us by Christ still
          living. |Because I continue to live, ye shall continue to live also.|
          The text clearly means that: it bears that paraphrase. Oh! dear
          friends! when we once get spiritual life into us, what a thousand
          enemies there are who try to put it out! Many and many a time has it
          seemed to go hard with my soul as to whether I really had a spark of
          life within my spirit. Temptation after temptation have I endured
          until it appeared as if I must yield my hold on Christ and give up my
          hope. There has been conflict upon conflict, and struggle upon
          struggle, until at last the enemy has got his foot upon the neck, and
          my whole being has trembled, and had it not been for Christ's promise,
          |Because I live, ye shall live also,| it might have gone harder with
          me, and I might have despaired, and given up all hope, and laid down
          to die. The assurance, then, that the spiritual life of the Christian
          must be maintained because Christ lives, was the only power to get me
          the victory. Let it teach us, then, this practical lesson. Whenever
          our spiritual life is very weak, and we want it to grow stronger, let
          us get to the living Christ for the supply of his strength. When you
          feel you are ready to die spiritually, go to the Saviour for revived
          life. The text is like a hand that points us to the storehouse. You
          who are in the desert, there is a secret spring under your feet, and
          you know not where it is; this is the mysterious finger which points
          you to the spot. Contemplate Christ; believe in Christ; draw
          yourselves by faith nearer and nearer to the Lord Jesus Christ, and so
          shall your life receive a divine impetus which it has not known for
          many a day. |Because I live, ye shall live also.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And further, brethren, we get from Christ an educated life. Any man
          may be spiritually alive, and yet he may not know much about the
          higher life. There is in spiritual life a scale of degree. One man is
          just alive unto God; another man may bee vigorous; another may be
          rapturously consecrated. I hope you and I will anxiously desire to get
          the highest form of spiritual life that is known. We do not wish to
          beggars in the kingdom of Christ, but, if we can, to take our place in
          the House of Peers, to be princes through Jesus Christ. We need not be
          poor; Christ is willing to enrich us. We are not straitened in him; we
          are straitened in ourselves. Now, Christ gives the promise, |Because I
          live,| saith he, |the highest life, far above all principalities and
          powers, ye shall live also this higher life with me.| You may have it;
          you may obtain it, but brethren, if you want to get it, never go to
          Moses for it; never go to yourselves for it. Do not seek to school
          yourselves by rules, and regulations, and resolutions, or by a morbid
          asceticism, such as some men delight in; but go the living Saviour,
          and in the living liberty which you will enjoy in communion with him ,
          your soul will take unto itself wings, and mount into a clearer
          atmosphere: your spirit will be braced to a higher degree of robust
          devotion: you will draw nearer to heaven, because you have got nearer
          to Christ, who is the Lord of heaven. |Because I live, ye shall have
          life: ye shall have that life continued, and ye shall have that life
          yet more abundantly: I am come, not only that ye may have life, but
          more abundantly.| There are your Master's words; plead them before
          your Master's throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, brethren, we will go a little further. We will suppose that
          you are well acquainted with these forms of life, and now there comes
          a jerk, as it were. You are travelling along the iron road of th
          railway, and there comes a sudden jerk, and you stop. What is it? It
          is the thought of death. Well, but Jesus tells us here that that is of
          no consequence. It is an item in the great world of life that to you
          who are in him is scarcely worth consideration, because the text
          over-rides that, and swallows it up, as it is written |death is
          swallowed up in victory|: it is made as though it did not exist.
          |Because I live, ye shall live also.| Your continued life of
          happiness, of holiness, of spirituality, of consecration, and of
          obedience -- which, indeed is your only life worth having -- is
          guaranteed to you in the text. Death cannot interfere with it, not
          even by the space of a single second -- nay,. I tell you not even by
          the space of the ticking of a clock. What, a Christian die? |Because I
          live, ye shall live also,| is never suspended. There is not time for
          it to be suspended in. Do you know what death really is? Does it take
          long to die? I have heard of men who have been said to be weeks in
          dying. Not so; they were weeks living; the dying occupied no space;
          that was done at once, and immediately. And so with the believer. To
          him death is so slight a jerk that he still keeps on upon the same
          line. He still lives, only there is this difference, that it is as
          though the railway had hitherto been running through a tunnel, and he
          now comes out of it into the open plain. His life below was the train
          in the tunnel, but when he dies, as we call it, there is a jerk, and
          then it comes right out of the tunnel into the fair, open, champaign
          country of heaven, where all is clear and bright, where all the birds
          are singing, and the darkness is over, and the mist and fogs are gone,
          and his soul is for ever blessed. |Because I live a life that cannot
          be suspended,| Christ seems to say, |ye shall live also.| At the
          bottom of every man's heart there is, I suppose, a fear of ceasing to
          be. Some infidels seem to find comfort in the thought of being
          annihilated, but that thought is, perhaps, the most abhorrent that
          ever crossed the human mind. There is a something which makes us hope
          we are, and shrink with loathing from the idea of being annihilated.
          Now, at that point comes in our text, and it says, |What! Annihilated!
          You who believe in Jesus cannot be: you shall live also, live with
          that higher life which you have received -- a life of beauty, a life
          of excellence, of holiness, and of God-likeness: that new life
          implanted within you shall never be suspended.| Nay, never by the
          space of a single tick, for |Because I live, ye shall live also.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, brethren, our text is such a wide on that we have a hold of
          the fact that we are to continue to live as to our spirits and our
          souls. The text beneath its sheltering wings, like a hen gathering her
          brood, gathers many precious truths, and the next one is that this
          very body of ours is to live, too. It must take its time for that. It
          must abide in the earth, whereon it has dwelt. It is so decreed that
          there it should lie, unless Christ should come before that time. But
          concerning this very body, there is no decree of annihilation. It will
          smoulder away. It may be taken up by the spade of the careless sexton,
          and scattered to the winds of heaven may all the atoms of the body be.
          But there is a life-germ within it which no human power can destroy,
          and over which the divine eye perpetually watches; and when that
          mysterious and long-expects sound of the angelic trump shall ring o'er
          land and sea, through heaven and earth, and the graves shall all be
          opened, then shall my soul find my body yet again -- fashioned after a
          more beautiful form; more fit for the spirit than aforetime; more
          elastic; altogether free from weakness; no longer such as shall be
          subject to pain, to sickness, to accident, to decay, to ultimate
          corruption; but a spiritual body, raised in power, in glory, and in
          immortality; not raised in the likeness of the first Adam in the
          garden, but in the likeness of the second Adam in the everlasting
          Paradise of God. Courage, my eyes, courage! Ye shall be closed for a
          while, but ye shall not be so for ever, for ye, even ye, shall strike
          the strings of those celestial harps that pour forth his praise.
          Courage, all ye members of my body, which have been sanctified to be
          members of Christ, and made to be parts of the Holy Spirit's temple!
          Ye shall all take your part in the grand triumphal entry of Christ,
          when he shall descend to take possession of his kingdom. |Though worms
          destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God, whom I shall behold
          for myself, and not another.| So go to thy bed in the earth, poor
          body, and sleep there awhile. Bathe thyself like her who bathed
          herself in spices to make herself ready for the King, so go and get
          thyself prepared to meet thy Lord. Put off thy word-day dress, and put
          on thy Sabbath garments, thy bridal array, and then shalt thou come to
          the King and see him in his beauty, and crown him with the crown
          wherewith his mother crowned him in the days of his espousals. Yea,
          because he lives in the body which he bore, his body shall live again,
          also.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so, beloved, the text amounts to this, that in body and soul, the
          Christian shall be immortal, like his Master. When our reign on earth
          -- whether it shall last a thousand years, or a thousand ages -- (we
          know not what the Word of God intends) -- but when that glorified
          state on earth, which I do most assuredly believe in, shall be over,
          and it shall be said: --
        </p>
        <p>|Now Jehovah's banner's furled,</p>
        <p>Sheathed his sword because 'tis done|;</p>
        <p>
          when the drama of the mediatorial reign shall all be closed, and we
          shall dwell under the immediate sovereignty of God once again, then,
          beloved, every believer shall be with Christ, eternally glorified, for
          here stand the irrevocable decree and the divine mandate of creation's
          Lord, who is also the redeeming Lamb, |Because I live, ye shall live
          also.| Reel, ye pillars of earth! Be shaken, ye arches of the starry
          heavens! Pass away, O Time, and you ye rolling worlds, dissolve into
          your native nothingness! But the believer must live on, because Jesus
          lives, and until the Lord's Christ can bow his head, till he who hath
          immortality can expire, till God himself can cease to be, no soul that
          believed in Jesus can lose the life incorruptible which God's own
          Spirit hath put within it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to sing, brethren, rather than to talk with you. These are
          words and thoughts fit for some ancient bard, or for the spirit of
          some inspired prophet sent from heaven. I do but lisp where even
          seraphs might find their loudest songs fail in the them. Let your
          hearts mount! Let your souls exult! Let your spirits be glad! Do you
        </p>
        <p>|Long for evening to undress,</p>
        <p>That you may rest with God,|</p>
        <p>
          and enter into his heaven? Long for the evening of death, when your
          toil shall be over, and the hour of your bliss shall have come. I
          shall have no time, I fear, for the third and last point, and,
          therefore, must only give a few hints of what I would have said.
        </p>
        <p>III. THIS LIFE IS LINKED WITH CHRIST'S LIFE.</p>
        <p>
          Immortal, all glorious, promised to true believers, it is bound up
          with the life of our immortal Lord. Why is this? First, because Christ
          leads a justified life. I scarcely know how to express my meaning. You
          understand that so long as Jesus was here he lay under the charge of
          our sins. Whilst he was in the world, his Father had made to meet upon
          him the iniquity of us all. But when he died, his death discharged all
          the liabilities of his elect. The handwriting of ordinances that was
          against us was then taken away. When he went to Calvary as our Surety,
          the sins of all his people were his debts: he had taken them upon
          himself. But when he rose from the dead in the garden that first
          Easter morning he had no debts of ours: he had no longer any
          substitutional engagement or liability. All the debts which he had
          taken upon himself as our Redeemer he had fully and completely
          discharged. No officer can arrest a man for debt who has none, and
          Christ now lives, therefore, as a justified person. And,. brethren, no
          officer of justice can arrest any of the people for whom Christ paid
          their debts. How, then, shall death have any dominion over those whose
          debts are all discharged? How shall they be laid in prison for whom
          Christ was laid in prison? How shall they suffer death, which is the
          penalty of sin, for whom Christ has already suffered all the penalties
          which just ice could have demanded? Because he lives the life of one
          who has discharged the debts of his people, they must, in justice,
          live.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, Christ lives a representative life. He is no longer Christ
          for himself. As the Member of Parliament represents a town, so Jesus
          Christ represents all the people who are in him, and as long as he
          lives they live. He is their Covenant Head. As long as Adam stands,
          his race shall stand; when Adam falls, the human race falls. While,
          therefore, Christ lives, the Christly ones, who are in him, live
          through his representation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next place, Christ lives a perfect life. Perhaps you do no see
          how this is a link between his living and your living, but it is,
          because we are a part of Christ. According to the Word of Scripture,
          every believer is a member of Christ's body. Now, a man who lives
          perfectly has not lost his finger, of his arm, or his hand. A man may
          be alive with many of his limbs taken away, but you can scarcely call
          him a perfect-living man. But I cannot imagine a maimed Christ. I have
          never been able to conceive in my soul, of Christ lacking any of his
          members. Such a thing was never seen on earth. The barbarous cruelty
          of the Jews could not effect that, and, by the Providence of God,
          Pilate's officers were not permitted to cause such a thing. |Not a
          bone of him shall be broken,| was the ancient prophecy. They brake the
          legs of the first and second thief, but when they came to the
          matchless Lord they saw he was already dead, so they brake not his
          legs. Even in his earthly body, which was the type of his spiritual
          body, he must suffer no maiming injury. Therefore, my brethren,
          because Christ lives as a perfect Christ, everyone that is one with
          him must live also.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, fourthly, Christ lives a blessed life -- a life of perfect
          blessedness, and, therefore, we must live also. |Why?| say you. Why,
          look you: there is a mother here. She is alive: she is in good health,
          but she is not perfectly happy, for she is a Rachel weeping for her
          children, and will not be comforted, because they are not. Time will
          heal her wounds, it is true: for the most affectionate heart cannot be
          always mourning; but our Lord Jesus Christ in that infinitely
          affectionate heart of his would not only mourn over one of his
          children if lost, but he would mourn for ever over it. I cannot
          conceive of Christ being happy and losing one of his dear children. I
          cannot conceive Christ to be personally blessed, and yet on of the
          members of his own person cast into the |outer darkness.| Because he
          lives in perfect happiness, I conceive that all who are dear to him
          will be round about him. It shall not be said that he lost one of
          them, nor shall one of the family be missing, but: --
        </p>
        <p>|All the chosen seed</p>
        <p>Shall meet around the throne,</p>
        <p>To bless the conduct of his grace,</p>
        <p>And make his wonders known.|</p>
        <p>
          And, lastly, Christ leads a triumphant life, and, therefore, ye shall
          live also. You say again, |How is that?| Why, brethren, the triumph of
          Christ concerns us. This is the triumph of Christ, |Of all those whom
          thou hast given me, I have lost none| Now, suppose there to be heard a
          whisper from the infernal pit, |aha! Aha! Thou liest! There is one
          here whom the Father gave thee, but who thou didst lose| -- why,
          Christ would never be able to speak again by way of triumph! He could
          never boast any more. Then might he put down his crown. If it were but
          to happen in that one case, at any rate, the enemy would have got the
          advantage over him, and he would hot have been the Conqueror all along
          the line. But, glory be to God! he who trod the winepress with none
          for his assistant, came forth out of the crimson conflict, having
          smitten all his foes, and won a complete victory. There shall not be
          in the whole campaign a single point over which Satan shall be able to
          boast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ has brought many sons to glory as the Captain of their
          salvation, and never yet has he failed, and he never shall in any
          point, neither the least nor the greatest, neither the strongest nor
          the weakest. This is essential, dear friends. It is essential to the
          acclamations of heaven, that every soul that believes in Jesus should
          live for ever. It is essential to the everlasting harmony and to the
          joy of Christ throughout Eternity, that all who trust in him should be
          preserved and kept safe, even until the end. Therefore, says the text,
          |Because I live, ye shall live also.|
        </p>
        <p>
          So I leave this truth with you, only praying that those who have no
          part in this matter may seek Christ at this very time, and be led by
          the Spirit to cry mightily to him, and his promise is, |They that seek
          me early shall find me.| Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call
          ye upon him whilst he is near.|
        </p>
        <p>God bless you, for Christ's sake. Amen.<br /></p>
