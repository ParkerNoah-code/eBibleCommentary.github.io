        <p>The Infidel's Sermon to the Pirates.</p>
        <p>
          native of Sweden who had imbibed infidel views, had occasion to go
          from one port to another in the Baltic Sea. When he came to the place
          whence he expected to sail, the vessel was gone. On inquiring, he
          found a fishing boat going the same way, in which he embarked. After
          being for some time out to sea, the men observing that he had several
          trunks and chests on board, concluded he must be very rich, and
          therefore agreed among themselves to throw him overboard. This he
          heard them express, which gave him great uneasiness. However, he took
          occasion to open one of his trunks, which contained some books.
          Observing this, they remarked among themselves that it was not worth
          while to throw him into the sea, as they did not want any books, which
          they supposed were all the trunks contained. They asked him if he were
          a priest. Hardly knowing what reply to make them, he told them he was;
          and at this they seemed much pleased, and said they would have a
          sermon on the next day, as it was the Sabbath. This increased the
          anxiety and distress of his mind, for he knew himself to be as
          incapable of such an undertaking as it was possible for any one to be,
          as he knew very little of the Scriptures; neither did he believe in
          the inspiration of the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          At great length they came to a small rocky island, perhaps a quarter
          of a mile in circumference, where was a company of pirates, who had
          chosen this little sequestered spot to deposit their treasures. He was
          taken to a cave, and introduced to an old woman, to whom they remarked
          that they were to have a sermon preached the next day. She said she
          was very glad of it, for she had not heard the Word of God for a great
          while. His was a trying case, for preach he must; still he knew
          nothing about preaching. If he refused, or undertook to preach and did
          not please, he expected it would be his death. With these thoughts he
          passed a sleepless night; and in the morning his mind was not settled
          upon anything. To call upon God, whom he believed to be inaccessible,
          was altogether vain. He could devise no way whereby he might be saved.
          He walked to and fro, still shut up in darkness striving to collect
          something to say to them, but could not think of even a single
          sentence.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the appointed time for the service arrived, he entered the cave,
          where he found the men assembled. There was a seat prepared for him,
          and a table with a Bible on it. They sat for the space of half an hour
          in profound silence; and even then the anguish of his soul was as
          great as human nature was capable of enduring. At length these words
          came to his mind: "Verily, there is a reward for the righteous:
          verily, there is a God that judgeth in the earth." He arose and
          delivered them; then others words presented themselves, and so on,
          till his understanding became opened, and his heart enlarged in a
          manner astonishing to himself. He spoke upon subject suited to their
          condition; the reward of the righteous, the judgments of the wicked,
          the necessity of repentance, and the importance of a change of life.
          The matchless love of God to the children of men had such a powerful
          effect upon the minds of these wretched beings, that they were melted
          into tears. Nor was he less astonished at the unbounded goodness of
          Almighty God, in thus interposing to save his spiritual as well as his
          natural life; and well might he exclaim, "This is the Lord's doing and
          marvellous in our eyes." Under a deep sense of God's goodness, his
          heart became filled with thankfulness, which it was out of his power
          to express. What a marvellous change was thus suddenly brought about
          by Divine interposition! He who a little while before disbelieved in
          communion with God and the soul, became as humble as a little child;
          and they who were so lately meditating on his death, now were filled
          with love and goodwill towards each other, particularly towards him;
          manifesting affectionate kindness, and willing to render him all the
          assistance in their power.

          The next morning they fitted out one of their vessels, and conveyed
          him whither he desired. From that time he became a changed man; from
          being a slave to the influence of infidelity, he was brought to be a
          sincere believer in the power and efficacy of the truth as it is in
          Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          [How marvellous the providence of God, and the sovereignty of his
          grace! Who is he that has stepped beyond the range of Almighty love?
          or has sinned too much to be forgiven? Reader! are you an infidel?
          What would you do in a similar situation? What other doctrine than
          that of Scripture would benefit pirates? Certainly not your own. What
          would you like to teach your own children? Certainly not your own
          sentiments. You feel that you would not wish to hear your own
          offspring blaspheming God. Moreover, forgive us, if we declare our
          opinion that thou knowest that there is a God, though with thy lips
          thou deniest him. Think, we beseech thee, of thy Maker, and of his
          Son, the Saviour; and may Eternal love bring even thee to the
          Redeemer. -- C. H. S.]

        <p>No.3 -- The Actress.</p>
        <p>
          n actress in one of the English provincial or country theatres, was,
          one day, passing through the streets of the town in which she then
          resided, when her attention was attracted by the sound of voices,
          which she heard in a poor cottage before her. Curiosity prompted her
          to look in at an open door, when she saw a few poor people sitting
          together, one of whom, at the moment of her observation, was giving
          out the following hymn, which the others joined in singing: --
        </p>
        <p>"Depth of mercy! can there be</p>
        <p>Mercy still reserved for me?"</p>
        <p>
          The tune was sweet and simple, but she heeded it not. The words had
          riveted her attention, and she stood motionless, until she was invited
          to enter by the woman of the house, who had observed her standing at
          the door. She complied, and remained during a prayer which was offered
          up by one of the little company; and uncouth as the expressions might
          seem in her ears, they carried with them a conviction of sincerity on
          the part of the person then employed. She quitted the cottage, but the
          words of the hymn followed her; she could not banish them from her
          mind, and at last she resolved to procure the book which contained the
          hymn. The more she read it, the more decided her serious impressions
          became. She attended the ministry of the Gospel, read her hitherto
          neglected and despised Bible, and bowed herself in humility and
          contrition of heart before him whose mercy she felt she needed, whose
          sacrifices are those of a broken heart and a contrite spirit, and who
          has declared that therewith he is well pleased.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her profession she determined at once, and for ever, to renounce; and
          for some little time excused herself from appearing on the stage,
          without, however, disclosing her change of sentiments, or making known
          her resolution finally to leave it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The manager of the theatre called upon her one morning, and requested
          her to sustain the principal character in a new play which was to be
          performed the next week for his benefit. She had frequently performed
          this character to general admiration; but she now, however, told him
          her resolution never to appear as an actress again, at the same time
          giving her reasons. At first he attempted to overcome her scruples by
          ridicule, but this was unavailing; he then represented the loss he
          should incur by her refusal, and concluded his arguments by promising,
          that if to oblige him she would act on this occasion, it should be the
          last request of the kind he would ever make. Unable to resist his
          solicitations, she promised to appear, and on the appointed evening
          went to the theatre. The character she assumed required her, on her
          first entrance, to sing a song; and when the curtain was drawn up, the
          orchestra immediately began the accompaniment; but she stood as if
          lost in thought and as one forgetting all around her, and her own
          situation. The music ceased, but she did not sing; and supposing her
          to be overcome by embarrassment, the band again commenced. A second
          time they paused for her to begin, and still she did not open her
          lips. A third time the air was played, and then, with clasped hands,
          and eyes suffused with tears, she sang, not the words of the song, but
          --
        </p>
        <p>"Depth of mercy! can there be</p>
        <p>Mercy still reserved for me!"</p>
        <p>
          It is almost needless to add, that the performance was suddenly ended;
          many ridiculed, though, some were induced from that memorable night to
          "consider their ways," and to reflect on the wonderful power of that
          religion which could so influence the heart and change the life of one
          hitherto so vain, and so evidently pursuing the road which leadeth to
          destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be satisfactory to the reader to know, that the change in
          Miss ________ was as permanent as it was singular; she walked
          consistently with her profession of religion for many years, and at
          length became the wife of a minister of the Gospel of our Lord Jesus
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          [Perhaps, dear reader, you are a great transgressor, then you fear
          there is no forgiveness for you; let this remove your fears. You may
          be the vilest creature out of hell, and yet grace can make you as pure
          as the angels in heaven. God would be just should he damn you, but he
          can be just and yet save you. Do you feel that the Lord has a right
          over you to do as he pleases? Do you feel that you have no claim upon
          him? Then, rejoice, for Jesus Christ has borne your guilt, and carried
          your sorrows, and you shall assuredly be saved. You are a sinner in
          the true sense of that word, then remember Jesus came to save sinners,
          and you among the rest, if you know yourself to be a sinner. -- C. H.
          S.]
        </p>
        <p>"Lo, th' incarnate God ascended,</p>
        <p>Pleads the merit of his blood:</p>
        <p>Venture on him, venture wholly,</p>
        <p>Let no other trust intrude;</p>
        <p>None but Jesus</p>
        <p>Can do helpless sinners good."<br /></p>
