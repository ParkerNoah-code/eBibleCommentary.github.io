<p align="center">PSALM 145 <br/>
 </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">This is one of the <i>alphabetical psalms</i>, composed 
    with much art, and, doubtless, so arranged that the memory might be aided. 
    The Holy Spirit condescends to use even the more artificial methods of the 
    poet, to secure attention, and impress the heart.</p>
<p align="justify">TITLE. David's Psalm of Praise. It is David's, David's 
    very own, David's favorite. It is David's Praise just as another (Psalm 86) 
    is David's Prayer. It is altogether praise, and praise pitched in a high 
    key. David had blessed God many a time in other psalms, but this he regarded 
    as his peculiar, his <i>crown jewel of praise</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">Certainly David's praise is the best of praise, for it is 
    that of a man of experience, of sincerity, of calm deliberation, and of 
    intense warmth of the heart. It is not for any one of us to render David's 
    praise, for David only could do that, but we may take David's psalm as a 
    model, and aim at making our own personal adoration as much, like it as 
    possible: we shall be long before we equal our model. Let each Christian 
    reader present his own praise unto the Lord, and call it by his own name. 
    What a wealth of varied praise will thus be presented through Christ Jesus!</p>
<p align="justify">DIVISION. The psalm does not fall into any marked 
    divisions, but is one and indivisible. Our other translators have mapped out 
    this song with considerable discernment. It is or a perfect arrangement, but 
    it will suit our convenience in exposition. David praises God:<br/>
    for his fame or glory (verses 1-7),<br/>
    for his goodness (verses 8-10), <br/>
    for his kingdom (verses 11-13), <br/>
    for his providence (verses 14-16), <br/>
    for his saving mercy (verses 17-21).<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. I will extol you, my God, O king. </p></b>David as 
    God's king, adores God as his king. It is well when the Lord's royalty 
    arouses our loyalty, and our spirit is moved to magnify his majesty. The 
    Psalmist has extolled his Lord many a time before, he is doing so still, and 
    he will do so in the future: praise is for all tenses. 
<p align="justify">When we cannot express all our praise just now, it is 
    wise to register our resolution to continue in the blessed work, and write 
    it down as a bond, "I <i>will </i>extol you." </p>
<p align="justify">See how David testifies his devotion and adherence to his 
    God by the pronoun "my", how he owns his allegiance by the title "king", and 
    how he goes on to declare his determination to make much of him in his song.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And I will bless your name forever and ever.</p></b> David 
    determined that his praise should rise to blessing, should intelligently 
    spend itself upon the name or character of God, and should be continued 
    world without end. He uses the word "bless" not merely for variation of 
    sound, but also for the deepening and sweetening of the sense. 
<i>
<p align="justify">To bless God is to praise him with a personal affection 
    for him</p></i>, and a wishing well to him: this is a growingly easy exercise as 
    we advance in experience and grow in grace. David declares that he will 
    offer every form of praise, through every form of existence. His notion of 
    duration is a full one, "forever" has no end, but when he adds another 
    "ever" to it he forbids all idea of a close. <i>Our praise of God shall be 
    as eternal as the God we praise.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. Every day will I bless you. </p></b>Whatever the 
    character of the day, or of my circumstances and conditions during that day, 
    I will continue to glorify God. 
<p align="justify">We should see abundant cause in each day for rendering 
    special blessing unto the Lord. All before the day, all in the day, all 
    following the day should constrain us to magnify our God every day, all the 
    year round.</p>
<p align="justify">Our love to God is not a matter of holy days: every day 
    is alike holy to holy men. David here comes closer to God than when he said, 
    "I will bless <i>your name</i>": it is now, "I will bless <i>you</i>." </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">This is the center and kernel of true devotion: we do not 
    only admire the Lord's words and works, but himself.</p></i> Without realizing 
    the personality of God, praise is well near impossible; you cannot extol an 
    abstraction. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And I will praise your name forever and ever.</p></b> He said 
    he would bless that name, and now he vows to praise it; he will extol the 
    Lord in every sense and way. Eternal worship shall not be without its 
    variations; it will never become monotonous. <i>Heavenly music is not 
    harping upon one string, but all strings shall be tuned to one praise</i>.
    
<p align="justify">Observe the personal pronouns here: four times he says "<i>I</i> 
    will": praise is not to be discharged by proxy—there must be your very self 
    in it, or there is nothing in it.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised.</p></b> 
    Worship should be somewhat like its object—great praise for a great God. 
    There is no part of Jehovah's greatness which is not worthy of great praise. 
    In some beings greatness is but vastness of evil—in him it is magnificence 
    of goodness. Praise may be said to be great when the song contains great 
    matter, when the hearts producing it are intensely fervent, and when large 
    numbers unite in the grand acclaim. No chorus is too loud, no orchestra too 
    large, no psalm too lofty for the lauding of the Lord Almighty.
<p align="justify">"And his greatness is unsearchable.<br/>
    Still his worth your praise exceeds,<br/>
    Excellent are all his deeds."</p>
<p align="justify">Song should be founded upon search; hymns composed 
    without thought are of no worth, and tunes upon which no pains have been 
    spent are beneath the dignity of divine adoration. Yet when we meditate 
    most, and search most studiously—we shall still find ourselves surrounded 
    with unknowable wonders, which will baffle all attempts to sing them 
    worthily. </p>
<p align="justify">The best adoration of the Unsearchable is to own him to 
    be so, and close the eyes in reverence before the excessive light of his 
    glory. Not all the minds of all the centuries shall suffice to search out 
    the unsearchable riches of God. He is past finding out; and, therefore, his 
    deserved praise is still above and beyond all that we can render to him.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. One generation shall praise your works to 
    another.</p></b> There shall be a tradition of praise: men shall pass on the 
    service, they shall make it a point to instruct their descendants in this 
    hallowed exercise. We look back upon the experience of our fathers, and sing 
    of it; even thus shall our sons learn praise from the Lord's works among 
    ourselves.
<p align="justify">Let us see to it that we praise God before our children, 
    and never make them think that his service is an unhappy one. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And shall declare your mighty acts.</p></b> The generations 
    shall herein unite: together they shall make up an extraordinary history. 
    Each generation shall contribute its chapter, and all the generations 
    together shall compose a volume of matchless character.
<p align="justify">David began with "I", but he has in this verse soon 
    reached to an inconceivable multitude, comprehending all the myriads of our 
    race of every age.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The praise of the Lord enlarges the heart, and as it 
    grows upon us our minds grow with it.</p></i> God's works of goodness and acts 
    of power make up a subject which all the eras of human story can never 
    exhaust. A heart full of praise seems to live in all the centuries in 
    delightful companionship with all the good. We are not afraid that the 
    incense will ever cease to burn upon the altars of Jehovah: the priests die, 
    but the adoration lives on. All glory be unto him who remains the same Lord 
    throughout all generations.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. I will speak of the glorious honor of your 
    majesty.</p></b> Tis fit that a king should speak of the majesty of the King of 
    kings. David cannot give over the worship of God into the hands of others, 
    even though all generations should undertake to perpetuate it. He must have 
    his own individual share in it, and so he says, "<i>I</i> will speak." What 
    a speaker! for he no sooner begins than he heaps up words of honor, "the 
    glorious honor of your majesty", or "the beauty of the honor of your 
    majesty." His language labors to express his meaning; he multiplies the 
    terms by which he would extol Jehovah, his King. 
<p align="justify">Everything which has to do with the Great King is 
    majestic, honorable, glorious. His least is greater than man's greatest, his 
    lowest is higher than man's highest. There is nothing about the infinite 
    Lord which is unworthy of his royalty; and, on the other hand, nothing is 
    lacking to the splendor of his reign: his majesty is honorable, and his 
    honor is glorious. He is altogether wonderful. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And of your wondrous works.</p></b> All the works of God 
    among men are Godlike, but certain of them are specially calculated to 
    create surprise. Many works of power, of justice, of wisdom, are wonderful. 
    His work of grace is wondrous above all. This specially, and all the rest 
    proportionately, should be spoken of by holy men, by experienced men, and by 
    men who have the ability to speak with power. These things must not be 
    permitted to pass away in silence; if others do not remember them, 
    representative men like David must make a point of conversing upon them in 
    private, and speaking of them in public. Let it be the delight of each one 
    of us according to our position to speak lovingly of our Lord.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. And men shall speak of the might of your 
    terrible works.</p></b> If unobservant of other matters these acts of judgment 
    shall seize their attention and impress their minds so that they must talk 
    about them. Did not men in our Savior's day speak of the falling tower of 
    Siloam and the slaughtered Galileans? Are there not rumors of wars, when 
    there are not even whispers of other things? Horrible news is sure to 
    spread: under mercies men may be dumb, but concerning miseries they raise a 
    great outcry. The force of dread is a power which loosens the tongue of the 
    multitude: they are sure to talk of that which makes the ear to tingle and 
    the hair to stand upright. While they are thus occupied with "fearsome 
    facts", such as the drowning of a world, the destruction of the cities of 
    the plain, the plagues of Egypt, the destruction at the Red Sea, and so 
    forth—David would look at these affairs in another light, and sing another 
    tune.
<b>
<p align="justify">And I will declare your greatness.</p></b> Those acts which 
    were terrible deeds to most men were mighty deeds, or greatnesses to our 
    holy poet: these he would publish like a herald, who mentions the titles and 
    honors of his royal master. <i>It is the occupation of every true believer 
    to rehearse the great doings of his great God. </i>We are not to leave this 
    to the common converse of the crowd, but we are personally to make a 
    declaration of what we have seen and known. 
<p align="justify">We are even bound in deep solemnity of manner to warn men 
    of the Lord's greatness in his terrible acts of justice: thus will they be 
    admonished to abstain from provoking him. </p>
<p align="justify">To fulfill this duty we are already bound by solemn 
    obligations, and we shall do well to bind ourselves further by resolutions, 
    "I will—God helping me, I will."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. They shall abundantly utter the memory of your 
    great goodness.</p></b> They shall pour forth grateful memories even as springs 
    gush with water, plenteously, spontaneously, constantly, joyously. The 
    Lord's redeemed people having been filled with his great goodness, shall 
    retain the happy recollection of it, and shall be moved often and often to 
    utter those recollections. Not content with a scanty mention of such amazing 
    love, they shall go on to an abundant utterance of such abundant favor. It 
    shall be their delight to speak with one another of God's dealings with 
    them, and to compare notes of their experiences. 
<p align="justify">God has done nothing stintedly; all his goodness is <i>
    great </i>goodness, all worthy to be remembered, all suggestive of holy 
    discourse. Upon this subject there is no scarcity of matter, and when the 
    heart is right there is no need to stop from lack of facts to tell. Oh, that 
    there were more of these memories and utterances, for <i>it is not fit that 
    the goodness of the living God should be buried in the cemetery of silence, 
    in the grave of ingratitude.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And shall sing of your righteousness. </p></b>They shall say 
    and then sing. And what is the theme which impels them to leave the pulpit 
    for the orchestra? What do they sing of? They sing of that righteousness 
    which is the sinner's terror, which even godly men mention with deep 
    solemnity. Righteousness received by gospel light is in reality the secret 
    foundation of the believer's hope. God's covenant of grace is our strong 
    consolation, because he who made it is righteous, and will not run back from 
    it. Since Jesus died as our substitute, righteousness requires and secures 
    the salvation of all the redeemed. This attribute is our best friend, and 
    therefore we sing of it. 
<p align="justify">Modern thinkers would gladly expunge the idea of 
    righteousness from their notion of God; but converted men would not. <i>It 
    is a sign of growth in grace when we rejoice in the justice, rectitude, and 
    holiness of our God. </i>Even a rebel may rejoice in mercy, which he looks 
    upon as laxity; but a loyal rejoices when he learns that God is so just that 
    not even to save his own people, would he consent to violate the 
    righteousness of his moral government. Few men will shout for joy at the 
    righteousness of Jehovah, but those who do so are his chosen, in whom his 
    soul delights.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. The Lord is gracious.</p></b> Was it not in some 
    such terms that the Lord revealed himself to Moses? Is not this Jehovah's 
    glory? To all living men his aspect: he is gracious, or full of goodness and 
    generosity. He treats creatures with kindness, his subjects with 
    consideration, and his saints favor. His words and ways, his promises and 
    his gifts, his plans and his purposes all manifest his grace, or free favor. 
    There is nothing suspicious, diced, morose, tyrannical, or unapproachable in 
    Jehovah—he is condescending and kind.
<b>
<p align="justify">And full of compassion. </p></b>To the suffering, the weak, 
    the despondent, he is full of pity. He feels for them, he feels with them 
    heartily, and in a practical manner. Of this pitifulness he is full, so the 
    compassionates freely, constantly, deeply, divinely, and effectually. In 
    fullness in a sense not known among men, and this fullness is all fragrant 
    sympathy for human misery. If the Lord is full of compassion there is no in 
    him for forgetfulness or harshness, and none should suspect him. What an 
    ocean of compassion there must be since the Infinite God is full of 
    compassion.
<b>
<p align="justify">Slow to anger</p></b>. Even those who refuse his grace yet 
    share in his long-suffering. When men do not repent, but, on the contrary, 
    go from bad to worse—God is averse to let his wrath flame forth against 
    them. Greatly patient and anxious that the sinner may live, he still 
    forbears. "Love is patient and is kind", and God is love. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And of great mercy.</p></b> This is his attitude towards the 
    guilty. When men at last repent, they find pardon awaiting them. Great is 
    their sin, and great is God's mercy. They need great help, and they have it 
    though they deserve it not; for he is good to the greatly guilty.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. The LORD is good to all. </p></b>No one, not even 
    his fiercest enemy, can deny this; for the falsehood would be too barefaced, 
    since the very existence of the lips which slander him, is a proof that it 
    is slander. He allows his enemies to live, he even supplies them with food, 
    and smooths their way with many comforts; for them the <i>sun </i>shines as 
    brightly as if they were saints, and the rain waters their fields as 
    plentifully as if they were perfect men. Is not this goodness to all?
<p align="justify">In our own land the gospel sounds in the ears of all who 
    care to listen; and the Scriptures are within reach of the poorest child. It 
    would be a wanton wresting of Scripture to limit this expression to the 
    elect, as some have tried to do; we rejoice in electing love, but none the 
    less we welcome the glorious truth, "Jehovah is good to all."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And his tender mercies are over all his works.</p></b> Not 
    "his new covenant works", as one read it the other day who was wise above 
    that which is written, yes, contrary to that which is written. Kindness is a 
    law of God's universe: the world was planned for happiness; even now that 
    sin has so sadly marred God's handiwork, and introduced elements which were 
    not from the beginning, the Lord has so arranged matters that the fall is 
    broken, the curse is met by an antidote, and the inevitable pain is softened 
    with mitigations. Even in this sin-stricken world, under its disordered 
    economy, there are abundant traces of a hand skillful to soothe distress and 
    heal disease. 
<i>
<p align="justify">That which makes life bearable is the tenderness of the 
    great Father</p></i>. This is seen in the creation of an insect, as well as in 
    the ruling of nations. The Creator is never rough, the Provider is never 
    forgetful, the Ruler is never cruel. Nothing is done to create disease, no 
    organs are arranged to promote misery; the incoming of sickness and pain is 
    not according to the original design, but a result of our disordered sinful 
    state. Man's body as it left the Maker's hand was neither framed for 
    disease, decay, nor death, neither was the purpose of it discomfort and 
    anguish. Far otherwise, it was framed for joyful activity, and a peaceful 
    enjoyment of God. Jehovah has in great consideration laid up in the world 
    cures for our ailments, and helps for our feebleness; and if many of these 
    have been long in their discovery, it is because it was more for man's 
    benefit to find them out himself, than to have them labeled and placed in 
    order before his eyes. 
<p align="justify">We may be sure of this, that Jehovah has never taken 
    delight in the ills of his creatures, but has sought their good, and laid 
    himself out to alleviate the distresses into which they have guiltily 
    plunged themselves. </p>
<p align="justify">The duty of kindness to animals may logically be argued 
    from this verse. Should not the children of God be like their Father in 
    kindness?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. All your works shall praise you, O LORD. </p></b>
    There is a something about every creature which redounds to the honor of 
    God. <i>The skill, kindness, and power manifested in the formation of each 
    living thing </i>is in itself to the praise of God, and when observed by an 
    intelligent mind the Lord is honored thereby. Some works praise him by their 
    being, and others by their well-being; some by their mere existence, and 
    others by their hearty volition. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And your saints shall bless you. </p></b>These holy ones come 
    nearer, and render sweeter adoration. They wish well to God; they would make 
    him more blessed, if such a thing were possible; they desire blessings upon 
    his cause and his children, and invoke success upon his work and warfare. <i>
    None but blessed men will bless the Lord.</i> Only saints or holy ones will 
    bless the thrice holy God. If we praise Jehovah because of his works <i>
    around </i>us, we must go on to bless him for his works <i>within </i>us. 
    Let the two "shalls" of this verse be fulfilled, especially the latter one.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. They shall speak of the glory of your kingdom.</p></b> 
    Excellent themes for saintly minds. Those who bless God from their hearts 
    rejoice to see him enthroned, glorified, and magnified in power. No subject 
    is more profitable for humility, obedience, hope, and joy than that of the 
    reigning power of the Lord our God. His works praise him, but they cannot 
    crown him. This remains for holy hands and hearts. It is their high pleasure 
    to tell of the glory of his kingdom in its justice, kindness, eternity, and 
    so forth. 
<p align="justify">Kingdoms of earth are glorious for riches, for extent of 
    territory, for victories, for liberty, for commerce, and other matters; but 
    in all true glories the kingdom of Jehovah excels them. Time, eternity, and 
    all space are filled with the glories of God—on these we love to speak. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And talk of your power.</p></b> This power supports the 
    kingdom and displays the glory, and we are sure to talk of it when the glory 
    of the divine kingdom is under discussion. God's power to create or to 
    destroy, to bless or to punish, to strengthen or to crush—is matter for 
    frequent rehearsal. All power comes from God. Apart from him the laws of 
    nature would be inoperative. His power is the one source of 
    force—mechanical, vital, mental, spiritual. Beyond the power of God which 
    has been put forth, infinite force lies latent in himself. Who can calculate 
    the reserve forces of the Infinite? How, then, can his kingdom fail? 
<p align="justify">We hear talk of the five great powers, but what are they 
    to the One Great Power? The Lord is "the blessed and only Potentate." Let us 
    accustom ourselves to think more deeply and speak more largely of this power 
    which ever makes for righteousness and works for mercy.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. To make known to the sons of men his mighty 
    acts.</p></b> These glorious deeds ought to be known to all mankind; but yet few 
    reckon such knowledge to be an essential part of education. As the State 
    cannot teach these holy histories, the people of God must take care to do it 
    themselves. The work must be done for every age, for men have short memories 
    in reference to their God, and the doings of his power. They inscribe the 
    deeds of their heroes upon brass, but the glorious acts of Jehovah are 
    written upon the sand, and the tide of time washes them from present memory; 
    therefore we must repeat the lesson, and yet again repeat it. 
<p align="justify">The saints are the religious instructors of the race; 
    they ought to be not only the historians of the past, but the bards of the 
    present, whose duty it is to keep the sons of men in memory of the great 
    deeds which the Lord did in the days of their fathers and in the old time 
    before them. </p>
<p align="justify">Note the contrast between the great deeds of God and the 
    puny sons of Adam, who have even degenerated from their father, though he 
    was as nothing compared with his Maker.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And the glorious majesty of his kingdom. </p></b>What a grand 
    subject! Yet this we are to make known; the publication of it is left to us 
    who bless the Lord. "The glory of the majesty of his reign." What a theme! 
    Jehovah's reign as sovereign Lord of all, his majesty in that dominion, and 
    the glory of that majesty! The threefold subject baffles the most willing 
    mind. How shall we make this known to the sons of men? Let us first labor to 
    know it ourselves, and then let us make it a frequent subject of discourse, 
    so shall men know it from us, the Holy Spirit attending our word.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.</p></b> His 
    meditation has brought him near to God, and God near to him. He speaks to 
    him in adoration, changing the pronoun from "his" to "your." He sees the 
    great King, and prostrates himself before him.
<p align="justify">It is well when our devotion opens the gate of Heaven, 
    and enters within the portal, to speak with God face to face, as a man 
    speaks with his friend.</p>
<p align="justify">The point upon which the Psalmist's mind rests is the 
    eternity of the divine throne, "your reign is a reign of all eternities." <i>
    The Lord's kingdom is without beginning, without break, without bound, and 
    without end. </i>He never abdicates his throne, neither does he call in a 
    second to share his empire. None can overthrow his power, or break away from 
    his rule. Neither this age, nor the age to come, nor ages of ages shall 
    cause his sovereignty to fail. Herein is rest for faith. "The Lord sits King 
    forever."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And your dominion endures throughout all generations.</p></b> 
    Men come and go like shadows on the wall, but God reigns eternally. We 
    distinguish kings as they succeed each other by calling them first and 
    second; but this King is Jehovah, the First and the Last. Adam in his 
    generation knew his Creator to be King, and the last of his race shall know 
    the same. All hail, Great God! You are ever Lord of lords!
<p align="justify">These three verses are a reverent hymn concerning "the 
    kingdom of God". They will be best appreciated by those who are in that 
    kingdom in the fullest sense, and are most truly loyal to the Lord. It is, 
    according to these verses, a kingdom of <i>glory </i>and <i>power</i>; a 
    kingdom of <i>light </i>which men are to know, and of <i>might </i>which men 
    are to feel; it is full of <i>majesty </i>and <i>eternity</i>; it is the 
    blessing of every generation. We are to speak of it, talk of it, and make it 
    known, and then we are to acknowledge it in the homage directed distinctly 
    to the Lord himself—as in verse 13. </p>
<p align="justify">In these three verses Jehovah is adored for his gracious 
    providence towards men and all other creatures; this fitly follows the 
    proclamation of his royalty, for we here see how he rules his kingdom, and 
    provides for his subjects.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14. The Lord upholds all that fall.</p></b> Read this 
    verse in connection with the preceding, and admire the unexpected contrast: 
    he who reigns in glorious majesty—yet condescends to lift up and hold up 
    those who are apt to fall. The form of the verb shows that he is always 
    doing this; he is Jehovah upholding. His choice of the fallen, and the 
    falling, as the subjects of his gracious help is specially to be noted. 
<p align="justify">The fallen of our race, especially fallen women, are 
    shunned by us, and it is peculiar tenderness on the Lord's part that such he 
    looks upon, even those who are at once the chief of sinners and the least 
    regarded of mankind. </p>
<p align="justify">The falling ones among us are too apt to be pushed down 
    by the strong: their timidity and dependence make them the victims of the 
    proud and domineering. To them also the Lord gives his upholding help. The 
    Lord loves to reverse things—he puts down the lofty, and lifts up the lowly.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And raises up all those that are bowed down.</p></b> Another 
    deed of condescension. Many are despondent, and cannot lift up their heads 
    in courage, or their hearts with comfort; but these he cheers. Some are bent 
    with their daily load, and these he strengthens. 
<p align="justify">Jesus loosed a daughter of Abraham whom Satan had so 
    bound that she was bowed down, and could by no means lift up herself. In 
    this he proved himself to be the true Son of the Highest. Think of the 
    Infinite bowing to lift up the bowed, and stooping to be leaned upon by 
    those who are ready to fall. The two "alls" should not be overlooked—the 
    Lord has a kindly heart towards the whole company of the afflicted.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 15. The eyes of all wait upon you.</p></b> They have 
    learned to look to you: it has become their nature to turn to you for all 
    they need. As children look to a father for all they need, so do the 
    creatures look to God, the all-sufficient Provider. It were well if all men 
    had the <i>eye of faith</i>, and if all waited therewith upon the Lord. And 
    you give them their meat in due season. They wait, and God gives. The 
    thought of this brings God so near to our poet-prophet. Is it to be wondered 
    at when the Lord is feeding the hungry all around us—giving food to all 
    creatures, and to ourselves among them? Like a flock of sheep the creatures 
    stand around the Lord as their great Shepherd; all eyes are on his hand 
    expecting to receive their food; nor are they disappointed, for when the 
    hour comes, suitable provender is ready for each creature. 
<p align="justify">Observe the punctuality of the Lord in giving food at 
    meal time—in the season when it is due. This he does for all, and each 
    living thing has its own season, so that the Lord of Heaven is feeding his 
    great flock both by day and by night, during every moment of time.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 16. You open your hand, and satisfy the desire of 
    every living thing.</p></b> You alone provide, O Jehovah! You do it liberally, 
    with open hand. You do it easily, as if it were only to open your hand. You 
    do this at once as promptly as if all supplies were ready to hand. Living 
    things have needs, and these create desires; the living God has suitable 
    supplies at hand, and these he gives until inward satisfaction is produced, 
    and the creature sighs no longer. 
<p align="justify">In spiritual things, when God has raised a desire, he 
    always gratifies it; hence the longing is prophetic of the blessing. In no 
    case is the desire of the living thing excited to produce distress, but in 
    order that it may seek and find satisfaction. </p>
<p align="justify">These verses refer to <i>natural providence</i>; but they 
    may equally well apply to the <i>stores of grace</i>, since the same God is 
    king in both spheres. If we will but wait upon the Lord for pardon, 
    renewing, or whatever else we need—we shall not wait in vain. <i>The hand of 
    grace is never closed while the sinner lives. </i>In these verses we behold 
    our God in the realm of his free-grace dealing well with his believing 
    people.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 17. The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy 
    in all his works. </p></b>His <i>ways </i>and <i>works </i>are both worthy to be 
    praised. Jehovah cannot be unjust or impure. Let his doings be what they 
    may, they are in every case righteous and holy. This is the confession of 
    the godly who follow his ways, and of the gracious who study his works. 
    Whatever God is or does, must be right. In the salvation of his people he is 
    as righteous and holy as in any other of his ways and works. He has not 
    manifested mercy at the expense of justice, but the rather he has magnified 
    his righteousness by the death of his Son.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 19. He will fulfill the desire of those who fear 
    him.</p></b> That is, those who reverence his name and his law. Inasmuch as they 
    have respect unto his will, he will have respect unto their will. They shall 
    have their way, for they have his way in their hearts.<i> A holy heart only 
    desires what a holy God can give</i>, and so its desire is filled full out 
    of the fullness of the Lord. 
<b>
<p align="justify">He also will hear their cry, and will save them.</p></b> 
    Divinely practical shall his nearness be, for he will work their 
    deliverance. He will listen to their piteous cry, and then will send 
    salvation from every ill. This he will do himself personally; he will not 
    trust them to angels or saints.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 20. The Lord preserves all those who love him.</p></b> 
    They keep him in their love, and he keeps them by his love. See how these 
    favored ones have advanced from <i>fearing </i>the Lord and <i>crying </i>to 
    him, even to <i>loving </i>him, and in that love they are secure from all 
    danger. 
<p align="justify">Mark the number of "alls" in these later verses of the 
    Psalm. In each of these <i>God is all in all</i>. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">But all the wicked will he destroy.</p></b> Wickedness is an 
    offence to all holy beings, and therefore those who are determined to 
    continue in it must be weeded out. As good sanitary laws remove all 
    creatures of pest and plague, so does the moral government of God mark every 
    evil thing for destruction; it cannot be tolerated in the presence of a 
    perfectly holy God. 
<p align="justify">What ruins wicked men frequently become in this life! 
    What <i>monuments of wrath </i>will they be in the world to come! Like 
    Nineveh and Babylon, and other destroyed places, they shall only exist to 
    declare how thoroughly God fulfills his righteous threatenings.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 21. My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD.</p></b> 
    Whatever others may do, I will not be silent in the praise of the Lord. 
    Whatever others may speak upon, my topic is fixed once for all: I will speak 
    the praise of Jehovah. I <i>am </i>doing it, and I <i>will </i>do it as long 
    as I breathe.
<b>
<p align="justify">And let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever.
    </p></b>Praise is no monopoly for one, even though he is a David; others are 
    debtors, let them also be songsters. All men of every race, condition, or 
    generation should unite to glorify God. No man need think that he will be 
    rejected when he comes with his personal note of praise; all are permitted, 
    invited, and exhorted to magnify the Lord. 
<p align="justify">Especially should his <i>holiness </i>be adored: this is 
    the crown, and in a certain sense the sum, of all his attributes. <i>Only 
    holy hearts will praise the holy name, or character of the Lord</i>. Oh, 
    that all flesh were sanctified, then would the sanctity of God be the 
    delight of all. </p>
<p align="justify">Once let the song begin and there will be no end to it. 
    It shall go on forever and a day, as the old folks used to say. If there 
    were two forevers, or twenty forevers, they ought all to be spent in the 
    praises of the ever-living, ever-blessing, ever-blessed JEHOVAH. </p>
<p align="justify">Blessed be the Lord forever for having revealed to us his 
    name, and blessed be that name as he has revealed it; yes, blessed be he 
    above all that we can know, or think, or say. <i>Our hearts revel in the 
    delight of praising him.</i> Our mouth, our mind, our lip, our life shall be 
    our Lord's throughout this mortal existence, and when time shall be no more.</p>
