        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.2663)</p>
        <p>Intended for Reading on Lord's-Day, February 25th, 1900,</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington,</p>
        <p>On Lord's-day Evening, February 29th, 1880.</p>
        <p>"One born out of due time." -- 1 Corinthians 15:8.</p>
        <p>
          PAUL THUS DESCRIBES himself. It was necessary that Paul, as an
          apostle, should have seen the Lord. He was not converted at the time
          of Christ's ascension; yet he was made an apostle, for the Lord Jesus
          appeared to him in the way, as he was going to Damascus, to persecute
          the saints of God. When he looked upon himself as thus put in, as it
          were, at the end of the apostles, he spoke of himself in the most
          depreciating terms, calling himself "one born out of due time."
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who are acquainted with the Greek tongue know what a despicable
          term Paul here applied to himself, -- as though he was scarcely a man
          at all, -- at any rate, as the very last of the family, "born out of
          due time;" and not only the last, but also the very least, for he
          says, "I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called
          an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God." Scholars will
          know why I cannot exactly explain the word which Paul uses, but rather
          keep to the rendering of our translation, which, although it may not
          have the force and full meaning of the Greek expression, is perhaps
          none the less useful for public reading: "One born out of due time."
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul thought very humbly of himself; he reckoned himself less than
          nothing, put himself down at the very lowest estimate, and mentioned
          that he was brought to Christ, and made an apostle, when the time for
          such a work was apparently over. Out of date altogether, beyond the
          period, when it might have been thought that another apostle would, be
          called of God, there was he found as "one born out of due time."
        </p>
        <p>
          My subject to-night is, first, the singular time of Paul's spiritual
          birth. There are many of God's true: children who, like the apostle,
          were "born out; of due time." When It have expatiated upon that fact,
          I shall speak of the sure evidences of his spiritual birth, and show
          you that, although "born out, of due, time," he was born, and there
          were sure evidences of his spiritual birth, which evidences, I trust,
          may be seen in many of us also.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, let us think of THE SINGULAR TIME OF PAUL'S SPIRITUAL
          BIRTH.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are still some whey like the apostle, are born to God "out of
          due time." They are truly born again, regenerated, converted, at a
          most unlikely season. There have been multitudes brought to Christ,
          under earnest sermons, when the appeals of faithful men have thrilled
          the congregation, and the truth has been effectually carried home to
          the hearts of many of the hearers. But there have also been times when
          God's ministers have waxed faint, when the sermon has appeared to be
          destitute of all force, when nobody has seemed to have felt, the power
          of the discourse, and, apparently, the truth has fallen quite flat;
          yet, on many such occasions, there have been some sinners converted to
          God when we should hardly have thought it to be possible. Mr. Tennant,
          a famous American minister of Whitefield's time, one of the most
          earnest and seraphic men who ever proclaimed the gospel of Jesus
          Christ, had a hearer, who remained unmoved under many a score of his
          most faithful sermons. Others were saved, but not this man; he seemed
          unmoved and immovable; but it came to pass, on a certain Sabbath, that
          a very unusual thing happened. Mr. Tennant had prepared his sermon
          with great, care, it was what we are wont to call a laborious
          discourse, into which he had put all the thought and all the pains
          possible; but he had not been preaching long before his memory
          completely failed him, his mind refused to work, and, after
          floundering about for a while, he was obliged to sit down in great
          confusion, and say that, he could not preach to the people that day.
          The man I have mentioned, who had never before been impressed under
          Mr. Tennant's ministry, was that day called by sovereign grace, as
          "one born out of due time," for he was led to see that there was a
          spiritual and supernatural force which had usually helped the pastor
          to preach, and that, when this divine influence was withdrawn, he was
          as weak as other men, and could not speak with power: as he had been
          accustomed to do. This truth, somehow or other, -- for human minds are
          strangely constituted, and things, which have no effect upon certain
          people, very greatly affect others who are present, at the same time;
          -- this truth, I say, induced the man to think; thinking, he was led
          to believe in God, and to trust in the Lord Jesus Christ for the
          salvation of his soul. He was, without doubt, one "born out of due
          time."
        </p>
        <p>
          I would like to break down, as Mr. Tennant did, if some of you would
          be born to God by that means; I would rather be dumb, and win a soul
          for Jesus, than speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and yet,
          men's hearts should not be impressed by the truth I proclaimed. How
          often I have found that, when I have gone, home, and sighed, and
          cried, and groaned over a discourse in which I felt no liberty, but
          thought it was an utter failure, it has afterwards been proved that,
          here one, and there another, have, come forward blessing and praising
          God for that very testimony, which seemed to me so faulty and feeble,
          but which the Spirit of the Lord has savingly impressed upon them. So,
          still, there are some who, in this way, are "born out of due time,"
          through the, Holy Spirit's use even of the preacher's weaknees and
          apparent failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another illustration may be taken from the opposite side of the same
          truth. Some are converted when they seem themselves to be in a state
          of mind in which they are the most unlikely to be impressible. I
          remember being in Dr. John Campbell's house, one day, when he told me
          that a minister was preaching at Whitefield's old Tabernacle in
          Moorfields, one evening, when there were present, under very strange
          circumstances, two young men who had fallen into dissipated habits,
          and who had made an appointment with each other for the commission of
          some gross sin that very night, had they committed what they had
          planned, it may be that they would have plunged themselves into a
          career of vice from which they might never have been extricated. They
          were passing by the Moorfields Tabernacle, which some of you remember,
          and as they wanted to know the time at which they were to meet for
          this unholy purpose, one of them said to the other, "Go in, and see
          the time; there is sure to be a clock in there." But the clock was not
          fixed as it is here, at the back of the preacher, but the other way;
          so the young man had to go some little distance further in than he
          intended, in order to see the clock. If I remember rightly, the
          preacher that night was Matthew Wilks, and he was just uttering some
          quaint remark, something that arrested the young man's attention, and
          held him fast in the aisle. His companion waited, outside for a time,
          but it was cold, so he thought he had better go in, and look at the
          clock himself, and fetch his friend out. He went in; the arrows of the
          Lord pierced the heart of both of them, and the second of those young
          men was John Williams, the famous missionary, and at last the martyr
          of Erromanga. Thus, they also were "born out of due time." You would
          not have thought it possible that those men should become, as they
          did, preachers of the gospel, when they were, at that very time,
          desperately set on the commission of a great sin against God, and
          their hearts were wholly given up to the pleasures and follies of this
          world; but so it happened, and our Lord still knows how to stop men as
          he stopped Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus. He, is the man who
          says that he was "born out of due time;" and he is a wonderful
          instance of this method of divine interposition. He has in his
          possession, the letters from the high priest which will enable him to
          bind the saints, the carry them off to Jerusalem; he is riding towards
          Damascus, the is within sight of the, city when, in the very midst of
          his high-handed course of persecution, the Lord Jesus Christ himself
          intervenes, and smites him down to the ground. Presently, he rises to
          pray, and, in his three days' blindness and fasting, to seek the Lord,
          and then to find him, to the salvation of his soul and the joy of his
          spirit, and thus to become an apostle of that very Savior whom, in his
          ignorance, he had been persecuting. After such a triumph of divine
          grace, let us never despair of any sinner, however far he may have
          gone, into, sin. You know how Paul, writing to Timothy, said of
          himself, "For this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus
          Christ might show forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which
          should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting." The God who
          blessed the broken sermon of Mr. Tennant can bless our imperfect work
          in the pulpit, the Sunday-school, or anywhere else; and the God who
          saved such men as John Williams and his companion, when they least
          thought of such a thing happening, can also save some who have strayed
          in here to-night, little dreaming what designs of love God has toward
          them in bringing them at this time under the sound of the Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          I consider, next, that a convert may be described as one "born out of
          due time" when he is brought to Christ after some great revival or
          notable religious movement has come to an end. There are some of you
          who attended the recent special services conducted here by Messrs.
          Fullerton and Smith. What power there was in those hallowed
          gatherings! Some of your neighbors wept under conviction of sin; but
          you did not. Some of them came to Christ, and are now rejoicing in
          him; but you did not come to him. You were not even impressed during
          the meetings, though, possibly, you wished to be; or it may he that
          you began with a desire after better things, but you ended in
          indifference. And now the special services are all over, and the good
          men who came amongst us to preach and sing the gospel are gone, and
          you have been saying to yourselves, "The harvest is past, the summer
          is ended, and we are not saved." Ah! but our Lord has a blessed way of
          picking up the stragglers behind the army. When the main body has
          marched on, with sound of trumpet, praising God, there are a few left
          behind; and the Lord Jesus sometimes comes, and picks them up. I do
          earnestly pray that some of you may be thus picked up by him just now,
          so that you may be able to say, "We were not born for God when many
          others were; like Saul of Tarsus, we were 'born out of due time;' but,
          blessed be God, we were born again by the effectual working of his
          Spirit, we were brought to Christ, to the praise of the glory of his
          grace, and now we also have become children of God by faith in Jesus
          Christ." Pray that it may be, so dear friends. O you Christian people,
          bow your hearts before God, and ask that it may be so] Perhaps the
          very fact that those services are over, and that a gracious
          opportunity has gone, may be impressed upon the minds of some who were
          present during the meetings, but who were; not converted, and they may
          now seek the Savior, and find him to their everlasting salvation and
          happiness.

          The Lord can bless strange methods to the awakening of the, ungodly.
          When Puritanism seemed to be trodden under foot, in the reign of James
          I., and the king issued the Book of Sports, and gave commandment that
          every clergyman was to read from the pulpit, on Sunday, that, it was
          the royal will and pleasure that the young people should play at
          football, cricket, and other games and pastimes on the Lord's-day
          afternoon, godly ministers, who really loved the Lord, did not know
          what to do. One of them thought, perhaps, it would be well to do as
          the king ordered, and to say something beside, so, when the Sunday
          came for reading the Book of Sports to the people, he said, "I am
          commanded by the king and the authorities to read to you the following
          document; but it grieves my heart and conscience to have to read it. I
          know it is wicked, and wrong, and shameful, and abominable to
          desecrate the Sabbath as you are invited to do, and I wonder what will
          become of my country when even from the church itself Sabbath-breaking
          is recommended." So, the good man spoke, to the relief of his own
          conscience, and in hope of arousing the consciences of others. It
          happened that there was in the congregation, that day, a young man who
          had always been a ringleader in the Sabbath sports; he was no sooner
          out of church, in the morning, than he was on the village green, fast
          and furious in all the amusements of the time; but, when he heard that
          Book of Sports read, he said to himself, "well, I acted in that way on
          my own account, and it, was wrong enough for me to do so; but now I
          say with the minister, "What is to become of all the country if
          everybody is to be as bad as I have been? What will happen to the
          nation if this kind of thing is to go on?" The thought struck him so
          forcibly that he became first a serious character, and then a true
          seeker after God, and afterwards a genuine believer in the Lord Jesus
          Christ. So it came: to pass that, when the devil thought he was going
          to have everything his own way, that very day, this young man was born
          to God, -- truly, "born out of due time."
        </p>
        <p>
          I recollect reading a very striking saying of Mr. Bunyan's. He said he
          had good reason to believe that, in the generation after him, there
          would be many more saints than in the one of which he formed a part,
          and his belief was based upon the fact that, wherever he went, he
          found that there were so many great sinners that he hoped they would
          be converted, and become eminent servants of the Lord Jesus Christ.
          Well, there was a blessed truth at the back of that hope of his; for,
          very often, where sin has abounded, grace does much more abound; and
          when the Word of God seems to grow scarce, and the candle of the
          gospel burns but dimly, we may pray and expect that even then, some
          may be "born out of due time" to the praise of the glory of that grace
          which saves as it wills, and often selects the very chief of sinners
          to be the subjects of it's almighty power.
        </p>
        <p>
          There have been some dear friends, who may be said to have been "born
          out of due time," for they have been converted to God after it seemed
          impossible that they ever should be. I recollect, well reading of one
          who imbibed sceptical notions, and became exceedingly furious against
          the preaching of the Word. One day, in Edinburgh, he heard it said
          that, a certain eminent minister of the gospel intended, if he met,
          him, to speak with him about his soul; whereupon the man uttered some
          very strong expressions, and, amongst other wicked things, he said, "I
          shall never be converted unless I lose my senses:" All who were
          acquainted with him, and who knew how desperately he was set against
          the gospel, thought that his was indeed a hopeless case; but, in the
          infinite mercy of God, it turned out to be quite the opposite. He
          began to suffer from great incoherence of thought, his mind gradually
          wandered, when he was trying to speak, he often spoke utter nonsense.
          He became unfit for business, and had to be put into the custody of
          someone who watched him as his keeper. Reason was not actually gone,
          but it was reeling upon its throne; and while he was in that sad
          state, the case of Nebuchadnezzar came to his mind, and he wondered
          whether God had given him up, altogether, on account of what he had
          said, -- that he would never be converted while he was in his senses.
          He turned his mind, all shipwrecked and battered as it, was, towards
          God and out of the depths of his half-bewildered spirit, he cried unto
          the Lord as Nebuchadnezzar did, and his mind returned to him, and he
          became a humble, gentle, holy believer in the Lord Jesus Christ. Do
          you not think, dear friends, that he also was "one born out of due
          time"? The time of salvation seemed utterly past so far as he was
          concerned. He had made a covenant with death, and a league with hell;
          he had cast off those ordinary beliefs which many men hold even though
          they do not obey them; yet, notwithstanding all that, the surprising
          grace of God dealt with him after its own sovereign manner, and laid
          him low, that it might bring him up again. I do not pray that such a
          thing may happen to anybody here; but I do pray that God may bring you
          to Christ somehow, and anyhow; and if, in order to attain that end,
          you have to be driven to the very gates of hell, -- so long as you do
          not actually pass through them, -- I will rejoice if, afterwards, you
          are led to flee to Christ for refuge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another instance of "one born out of due time" occurs in the case of
          one converted after the spiritual father is dead. We sometimes see
          posthumous children, that is, those who are born after the father is
          deceased; and there is generally much sorrow mingled with the thought
          of such births, for the poor widow's heart is doubly troubled by the
          extra care needed for the little stranger who arrives after the
          bread-winner of the family is taken away. But if a man is the means of
          bringing another to Christ after he himself is dead, there need be no
          sorrow about that matter. There have been many, many instances in
          which earnest Christian people have sought the conversion of their
          relatives or friends; they have prayed for them, and wept over them,
          and pleaded with them, but all their efforts have been unsuccessful;
          yet, after their death, the memory of their holy zeal has touched the
          conscience, of the one who would not yield before, and brought him to
          Christ. I wish, dear friends, that your godly mother, who is in
          heaven, and who died leaving her son unsaved, might seem to come to
          you just now. I ask for no apparition, but that she may be consciously
          present to your mind, and that her dying words may ring in your ear,
          for perhaps the remembrance of what she said may be blessed to you
          even now. When I am taken away, I can but wish that any true and
          faithful word that I have spoken may still continue to speak to, you
          from my grave. When good Mr. Payson died, he begged that his people
          might come and see him, if they wished, before he was interred; and
          those who did so read these words on his bosom, "Remember the word
          which I have spoken unto you being yet present with you." It was thus
          his desire, you see, that he should have posthumous spiritual
          children, that they should be born to God even though they should seem
          to be "born out of due time." Ah! you wives, who have been praying for
          your husbands these many years, never give them up, because they may
          be brought to Christ when you yourselves will be in heaven. Mothers
          and fathers, never cease pleading for your children, for they, too,
          may be brought to Jesus when you are among the angels. Up in one of
          the northern counties of England, there was a woman, a believer in the
          Lord Jesus Christ, whose prayer went up continually for her husband;
          but he never entered the house of God, and despised her for doing so.
          She was accustomed to go to her usual place of worship alone, so far
          as any human companions were concerned, yet she was not quite alone,
          for there was a dog that always went with her. This dog curled himself
          up under the seat, and lay quite still during the service, and then
          walked home with his mistress. The first Sunday after she was dead,
          the poor dog went off to the meeting-house as usual, and curled
          himself up in his old place. He did the, same the next Sunday, and the
          husband, noticing the dog start out so regularly, was struck by its
          action, and wondered where the dog went now that his mistress was
          gone; so he thought he would go and see. The dog went before him to
          his, mistress's old seat, and curled himself up; the man went in after
          the dog, and sat down in his wife's place, and God helped the
          minister, that day, to show him that his good works and
          self-righteousness in which he had always trusted, would not be
          sufficient for his salvation, and he preached to him the full
          salvation of Christ Jesus, and the man believed and lived. Was not he
          also "born out of due time," for his wife's prayers for him were a all
          over, and she was gone? Yet was he brought to Christ.

          The subject is one upon which I might enlarge indefinitely, but I
          would rather have you to supply further instances of similar blessing,
          by urging you to persevere in prayer, you who are seeking the
          salvation of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some have been "born out of due time" because they have been converted
          to God in extreme old age. I should like to encourage any very aged
          person who is here, and still unsaved, and to drive away altogether
          the notion that it is too late to seek the Lord. It never is too late
          so long as life lasts, and there is the power to repent of sin and to
          turn to the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>"While the lamp holds out to burn,</p>
        <p>The vilest sinner may return."</p>
        <p>
          I will not quote cases, but I have a vivid recollection of a good many
          persons who have been saved at the age of seventy or eighty. We have
          had persons, past both of those periods, baptized upon profession of
          their newly-found faith. The world's proverb says, "It is never too
          late to mend:" 'but Christ would tell you, if he were here in bodily
          presence, that it is never too late for him to mend you, or rather,
          for him to make you anew, for that is the work he undertakes to do. It
          is never too late for him to stretch out his pierced hand, and help
          the man, who is tottering on his staff, to become a babe in Christ.
          Yet, surely when very old men are born again, they seem to be "born
          out of due time."
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of you have not yet come of old age, yet, if God should save you
          to-night, you would be as those who are "born out of due time,"
          because you are on the very brink of the grave. Consumption has laid
          its cruel hand upon you, and pulled down all your strength. In all
          probability, you will not be long in this world. You have come out
          to-night, but you are half-afraid that you have done wrong in coming
          in the state you are in, with that terrible cough that you have; yet
          you have not found the Savior. O my dear young friend, wherever you
          may be, it is a sad, sad thing to be carrying about with you your
          death-warrant, as you certainly are doing, and yet to have no warrant
          to believe that, when you die, it will be well with you! Oh, I pray
          you, do not let Satan tempt you with the idea that, now, when sickness
          is upon you, there is no hope for you! Come to Jesus, however
          consumptive you look. Come to Jesus, young man, with that chest that
          scarcely allows you to breathe. Come unto him, for he will not cast
          you away. I remember one, whom I met at Mentone, who had gone there in
          the hope of lengthening his life; but that was quite out of the
          question, for he was too far gone when he came. He, had two sisters,
          who were sent for to come to him, for it was certain that he could not
          live long. He himself was under deep concern of soul, earnestly
          seeking the Lord, but he could not find him. Day after day, week after
          week, he had been getting worse and worse, and showing all the signs
          of his approaching departure; but he could not find peace with God. At
          last, his sisters came from England. They arrived just in time. They
          found him very anxious about his soul; that night, they spoke with him
          of Jesus, and in the morning, early, when they woke, they went to him
          and he was sitting up in bed, all pale and ghostlike, he said,
          "Sisters, Christ has forgiven me;" and he fell back on his pillow, and
          he was gone home. There was an end of his suffering and weakness here
          below; but the consolation of that last word to them, and of the joy
          that, beamed from his poor eyes, was enough to make them gladly commit
          his body to the tomb. "Sisters, Christ has forgiven me." Ah! he was
          indeed "born out of due time, "born between the very jaws of death;
          but death's jaws could not close upon him till he had received
          forgiveness from his Savior. I beseech any of you, who are in a
          similar condition to his, do not put off seeking the Lord, but, hasten
          to find him even now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, there are some who are "born out of due time" because they
          are born all of a sudden. They suddenly come to Christ; they suddenly
          find peace; they are suddenly saved. I wish that might happen to some
          here tonight. There is no need of any set period for this
          all-important matter; time, is no element in the case. God can work
          conviction and conversion in a single instant. You know that,
          sometimes, you see a flash of lightning, and then you wait severed
          seconds before you hear the thunder; but when a storm is right,
          overhead, the flash and the slap are simultaneous, and down comes the
          pouring rain at the same time. And, in like manner, the Lord knows how
          to send flash of conviction, and, at the same instant, to make his
          deep voice of mercy to be heard, in the soul, and to send the
          waterfloods of grace upon the spirit there and then. Why should, he
          not, do so to-night for any of you who need these blessings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I will tell you the special reason why I chose this text; that is
          because this is the 29th of February, and it is a Sunday. There is a
          large number of you who never saw a 29th of February on Sunday before,
          and there is a larger number still who will never see the 29th of
          February on a Sunday again. I suppose it will be eight-and-twenty
          years before that will occur again. So, this is a Sunday thrown in, as
          it were; it is an odd kind of day, an extra day in the calendar. If
          you ask our friends of the Greek Church, the Russians, they will tell
          you that there is not such a day at all, for they keep to the old
          system of reckoning time. This plan of putting in an odd day, every
          four years, to make our days square with the sun, is a very good and
          proper one; still, it is a kind of a day thrown in; and it seemed to
          me that, if the Lord would convert some souls on this odd day in this
          leap year, it would make the, 29th of February, that came on a Sunday,
          to be specially memorable. You will not forget it if it is the day of
          your conversion; you will say to your children, it may be,
          eight-and-twenty years hence, if you are alive, "Ah! I recollect when
          the 29th of February last came on a Sunday, and that was the day when
          I sought and found the Lord. Mr. Spurgeon said that I was like the
          apostle Paul, 'one born out of due time,' and so I was; yet I was born
          in due time, I know, according to the covenant of grace." Oh that the
          Lord, of his infinite mercy, having given us this special day, would
          now give us a special blessing, and bring many to himself this leap
          year! Oh, that all of you, who are still unsaved, would make a leap
          right, out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of his dear
          Son, his Holy Spirit enabling you so to do by a simple act of faith in
          Jesus Christ! And you Christian people, pray for a special and unusual
          blessing, a 29th of February blessing. Ask God to give it to us, in
          his infinite mercy, that many and many a soul may be "born out of due
          time" this very night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who shall it be? And where shall the work of repentance begin? Does
          not somebody over there say, "Lord, let it be me"? There is said to,
          be a special opportunity of making proposals in leap year; but I can
          tell you, if you make a proposal to come to Christ, that he has long
          ago set his heart on you. You would never have thought of proposing to
          him if he had not first of all ordained to bring you to himself. If
          you come to him, he will receive you; and oh! in his great mercy, may
          the Holy Spirit incline you to come to him this 29th of February float
          fails upon a Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now I have only two or three minutes left for the second part of
          my subject, -- THE SURE EVIDENCES OF PAUL'S SPIRITUAL BIRTH.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though Paul was in spiritual sense, "born out of due time," he was
          truly born again; and those persons, who have been converted at
          singular times, and; under strange circumstances, have been really
          converted. How do we know that Paul was born again, and that he was
          called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          I answer, first, because he had seen the Lord. After mentioning those
          who saw the risen Christ, he says, "Last of all he was seen of me
          also, as of one born out of due time." The first, evidence that he was
          an apostle was that he had actually beheld the Lord. Now, in a
          spiritual sense, one of the marks of a true believer is that he has
          seen the Lord. My dear friend, if you have looked to Christ for
          forgiveness, oven though you have only looked to him to-night, and
          this is an odd night -- the 29th of February, yet, if you have by
          faith seen Jesus on the cross, and truly trusted him, you are as much
          saved as the man is who believed in Christ fifty years ago. Looking to
          Jesus is the evidence that we are born again; and happy is everyone
          who can truthfully say, concerning Christ." He was seen of me also."
        </p>
        <p>"I saw one hanging on a tree,</p>
        <p>In agonies and blood."</p>
        <p>
          I looked to him; he looked on me; and we were one for ever. I trusted
          to him, and therefore I am saved. If you can say that from your heart
          and the Holy Spirit bears witness that what you say is true,, you.
          need, not raise any question about your new birth. If thou art
          trusting in Jesus, it is well with thy soul in time and to eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next evidence of his spiritual birth, which Paul gave, was that he
          confessed his sin. Read the verse following our text: "For I am the
          least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle,
          because I persecuted the church of God." See how he confessed his sin
          and forsook it. He that covereth his sins shall not prosper; but whoso
          confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy." Are you, dear friend;
          willing now to confess your sin? Do you turn from it with loathing. Do
          you desire, henceforth, to be delivered entirely from it? Well, then,
          your repentance is another sure evidence that you are born again. If
          you have seen Jesus taking your sin upon himself, and suffering its
          dread penalty; if you have confessed your sin, and by faith laid it
          upon him as your Sacrifice and Substitute, you are born again, though
          you may, have been, in a certain sense, "born out of due time."
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we are sure that Paul was really born again because he was
          thoroughly converted. Never was there a greater change in any man than
          there was in him; he never went back to his former life, and he had no
          hankering to return to it. With him, old things had passed away, and
          all things had become new; he was, indeed, a new creature in Christ
          Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am sure he was converted, also, because he praised the grace of God.
          Read the 10th verse: "By the grace of God I am what I am." Even when
          he truthfully says, "I labored more abundantly than they all;" he
          humbly adds, "yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me." It
          its a sure sign of conversion when a man knows that he is saved by
          grace alone, and does not, attribute it to his own merit, or his own
          work, but praises and adores the sovereign mercy and grace of God.
          Have you that evidence, dear friend? Then are you born aright, even
          though "born out of due time."
        </p>
        <p>
          And, lastly, Paul proved that he was a true citizen of the New
          Jerusalem because he became, of all men, most zealous for Christ,
          zealous for the gospel, zealous for the winning of souls, he seemed to
          try to, do all he could to undo the mischief he had wrought in the
          days of his unregeneracy, and to, work with both his hands and all his
          heart to establish and extend the kingdom which once he tried to
          overthrow. O God, by thy great mercy, cause another Paul to be born in
          this house of prayer to-night! Thou canst do it; wilt thou not bring
          to thyself, by the power of the Eternal Spirit, some wild,
          threatening, blustering, blaspheming hater of Christ, lay him at the
          dear feet. Of the Crucified, and cause him to look up and live? Pray
          for this, dear Christian people. Pray for it to-night, when you reach
          your homes as well as now; and then we shall haw special reason to
          recollect this 29th of February. Possibly, someone, who will in days
          to come stand on this very spot preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ,
          will say to you, "Do you remember the 29th of February, 1880? Do you
          recollect the text, 'One born out of due time'?" I trust that some of
          you will be here to hear him say, "I recollect it better than any of
          you do, for that was the night when I was born to God, glory be to his
          holy name!" Now pray for it with all your hearts, for our Lord Jesus
          Christ's sake. Amen.
        </p>
        <p>John 3:1-18.</p>
        <p>
          If you were sent for to visit a dying man, and you wished to select a
          chapter which would set the truth before him very briefly and very
          clearly, you could not make a better choice than this 3rd chapter of
          the Gospel according to John. So, as we are all dying men and women,
          let us read it with that same desire, and may the Holy Spirit apply it
          to our hearts as we read it
        </p>
        <p>
          Verses 1, 2. There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a
          ruler of the Jews: the same came to Jesus by night, --
        </p>
        <p>
          That was better than not coming at all. "Better late than never."
          Better come to Christ in the dark than not come to him at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. And said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from
          God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be
          with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was good reasoning on the part of Nicodemus. If he did not at
          first go as far as he afterwards did, it argued well for him that he
          went as far as he could. O thou who art troubled with unbelief,
          believe as much as thou canst; and then cry, "Lord, I believe, help
          thou mine unbelief; and, especially, help me to get rid of it."
          Confess to Christ what thou dost believe, and he will add more to thy
          belief.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
          Except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom, of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          He cannot understand what it is; he cannot know anything about it; he
          cannot see it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4, 5. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old?
          can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?
          Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born
          of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the "water" mentioned here relates to baptism, -- which I greatly
          question, -- then, certainly, it shows the way of entrance for a
          believer, publicly, into the kingdom of God. But if it relates to the
          purifying power of the Spirit of God, -- as I believe it does, -- then
          it teaches us that no man enters into the kingdom of God, and becomes
          a partaker of its privileges, -- which is something more than merely
          seeing it, -- except the Spirit of God shall be to him as water
          purifying him from sin. This is the reason why a man cannot enter into
          the spiritual kingdom until he is born again, born from above.
        </p>
        <p>6. That which is born of the flesh is flesh;</p>
        <p>And "flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God."</p>
        <p>6. And that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</p>
        <p>
          And only the new creature, which is thus born, can, by any
          possibility, understand or enter into the possession of the spiritual
          things which belong to the kingdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          7, 8. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The
          wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but
          canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one
          that is born of the Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Holy Spirit is mysterious, like the wind, and so is the creature
          that is "born of the Spirit." The spiritual man often cannot
          understand himself, he is so mysterious a being; -- how then shall he
          be able fully to comprehend how that wondrous new life is created
          within him? All we know is that he is a new creation, as much the work
          of eternal power as our first creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          9, 10. Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
          if Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and
          knowest not these things?
        </p>
        <p>
          "These things" that lie at the very root of everything. "Art thou a
          Rabbi and dost thou not know this?" Alas, good Master, there are still
          many Rabbis who do not understand this; many, who have taken the
          highest degree the University can give them, yet do not know in their
          own souls what it is to be born again!
        </p>
        <p>
          11. Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and
          testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spiritual men declare that there are spiritual things. They know them,
          and have seen them; and they have a right to be believed, for they are
          not liars. They are honest men, and speak what they do know; yet,
          often, their witness is not received. They need not be surprised at
          this, for it was the same with their Master.
        </p>
        <p>
          12. If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall
          ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?
        </p>
        <p>
          If these elementary truths about the new birth stagger you, what is
          the use of my going on to anything higher? You would not understand

          13. And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from
          heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.

          He alone knows the secrets of God who has been with God, who has come
          from God, and who is still with God.

          14-18. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so
          must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever, believeth in him
          should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world,
          that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
          should not perish, but have ever -- lasting life. For God sent not his
          Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through
          him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he
          that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed
          in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          God give us, even now, deliverance from condemnation through faith in
          his dear Son, and prevent our being condemned through our unbelief,
          for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.

          *Although 1900 is not observed as a Leap Year, the last Sabbath in
          February is the nearest corresponding date to the Leap Year Sunday in
          1880, when the accompanying discourse was delivered. It is therefore
          issued for reading on that day with the earnest prayer that it may be
          as profitable to those who read it as it was to those who were
          privileged to hear it.<br />
