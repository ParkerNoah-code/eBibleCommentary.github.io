        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1892)</p>
        <p>Suggested by the death of CHARLES STANFORD, D.D.,</p>
        <p>Minister of Denmark Place Chapel, Camberwell,</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, March 21st, 1886, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me
          where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me:
          for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world." -- John
          17:24.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE PRAYER OF THE SAVIOR rises as it proceeds. He asked for his people
          that they might be preserved from the world, then that they might be
          sanctified, and then that they might be made manifestly one; and now
          he reaches his crowning point -- that they may be with him where he
          is, and behold his glory. It is well when in prayer the spirit takes
          to itself wings. The prayer that swings to and fro like a door upon
          its hinges may admit to fellowship; but that prayer is more after the
          divine pattern which, like a ladder, rises round by round, until it
          loses itself in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          This last step of our Lord's prayer is not only above all the rest,
          but it is a longer step than any of the others. He here ascends, not
          from one blessing which may be enjoyed on earth, to another of higher
          degree; but he mounts right away from all that is of this present
          state into that which is reserved for the eternal future. He quits the
          highest peaks of grace, and at a single stride his prayer sets its
          foot in glory: "that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me
          where I am."
        </p>
        <p>
          There is this to be noticed also concerning this divine prayer, that
          not only does it rise as to its subject, but it even ascends as to the
          place which the Intercessor appears to occupy. Has it not been so with
          yourselves in prayer at times, that you have hardly known where you
          were? You might have cried with Paul, "Whether in the body or out of
          the body, I cannot tell." Do not these words of our Lord Jesus remind
          you of this? Was he not carried away by the fervor of his devotion?
          Where was he when he uttered the words of our text? If I follow the
          language I might conclude that our Lord was already in heaven. He
          says, "rather, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with
          me where I am; that they may behold my glory." Does he not mean that
          they should be in heaven with him? Of course he does; yet he was not
          in heaven; he was still in the midst of his apostles, in the body upon
          earth; and he had yet Gethsemane and Golgotha before him ere he could
          enter his glory. He had prayed himself into such an exaltation of
          feeling that his prayer was in heaven, and he himself was there in
          spirit. What a hint this gives to us! How readily may we quit the
          field of battle and the place of agony, and rise into such fellowship
          with God, that we may think and speak, and act, as if we were already
          in possession of our eternal joy! By the ardor of prayer and the
          confidence of faith we may be caught up into Paradise, and there utter
          words which are beyond the latitude of earth, and are dated "from the
          Delectable Mountains."
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is this all; for still the prayer rises, not only as to its matter
          and place, but in a very singular way it also takes to itself a higher
          style. Before, our Lord had asked and pleaded; but now he uses a
          firmer word: he says, "Father, I will." I would not force that word so
          as to make it bear an imperious or commanding meaning, for the Savior
          speaketh not so to the Father: but still it has a more elevated tone
          about it than asking. Our Lord here useth the royal manner rather than
          the tone of his humiliation. He speaketh like unto the Son of God; he
          addresses the great Father as one who counteth it not robbery to be
          equal with him, but exercises the prerogative of his Eternal Sonship.
          He saith, "I will." This is a tone which belongs not to us except in a
          very modified degree, but it teaches us a lesson. It is well in
          prayer, when the Holy Spirit helpeth us, not only to groan out of the
          dust as suppliant sinners, but to seek unto our Father in the spirit
          of adoption with the confidence of children, and then with the promise
          of God in our hand we may with consecrated bravery lay hold upon the
          covenant angel, and cry, "I will not let thee go, except thou bless
          me." Importunity is a humble approach to this divine "I will." The
          will consecrated, educated, and sanctified, may and must reveal itself
          in our more spiritual petitions, just as, with equal correctness, it
          hides away when the pleading is for temporal things, and whispers,
          "Not as I will, but as thou wilt." The Lord pours upon his pleading
          servants at times a kind of inspiration by which they rise into power
          in prayer, and have their will of the Lord. Is it not written,
          "Delight thyself in the Lord; and he shall give thee the desires of
          thine heart?" We come at last to feel that the desires of our heart
          are inspired of his Spirit, and then that we have the petitions which
          we have asked of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          There ought to be much for our edification in a text like this, which
          in subject, place, and style rises to such an elevation. It is the
          apex of this wonderful pyramid of prayer; the last round of the ladder
          of light. O Spirit of the Lord, instruct us while we behold it!
        </p>
        <p>
          I have taken this text because it has taken hold on me. Our beloved
          brother, Charles Stanford, has just been taken from us. I seem to be
          standing as one of a company of disciples, and my brethren are melting
          away. My brethren, my comrades, my delights, are leaving me for the
          better land. We have enjoyed holy and happy fellowship in days of
          peace, and we have stood shoulder to shoulder in the battle of the
          Lord; but we are melting away. One has gone; another has gone; before
          we look round another will have departed. We see them for a moment,
          and they vanish from our gaze. It is true they do not rise into the
          air like the Divine Master from Olivet; yet do they rise, I am
          persuaded of that: only the poor body descends, and that descent is
          for a very little while. They rise, to be for ever with the Lord. The
          grief is to us who are left behind. What a gap is left where stood
          Hugh Stowell Brown! Who is to fill it? What a gap is left where stood
          Charles Stanford! Who is to fill it? Who among us will go next? We
          stand like men amazed. Some of us stood next in the rank with those
          who have been taken. Why this constant thinning of our ranks while the
          warfare is so stern? Why this removal of the very best when we so much
          need the noblest examples? I am bowed down, and could best express
          myself in a flood of tears as I survey the line of graves so newly
          digged; but I restrain myself from so carnal a mode of regarding the
          matter, and look upon it in a clearer light. The Master is gathering
          the ripest of his fruit, and well doth he deserve them. His own dear
          hand is putting his apples of gold into his baskets of silver; and as
          we see that it is the Lord, we are bewildered no longer. His word, as
          it comes before us in the text, calms and quiets our spirits. It dries
          our tears, and calls us to rejoicing as we hear our heavenly
          Bridegroom praying, "Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast
          given me, be with me where I am." We understand why the dearest and
          best are going. We see in whose hand is held the magnet which attracts
          them to the skies. One by one they must depart from this lowland
          country, to dwell above, in the palace of the King, for Jesus is
          drawing them to himself. Our dear babes go home because "he gathereth
          the lambs with his arm and carrieth them in his bosom;" and our ripe
          saints go home because the Beloved is come into his garden to gather
          lilies. These words of our Lord Jesus explain the continual
          home-going; they are the answer to the riddle which we call death. I
          am going to talk of how our honored brethren are not, because God
          taketh them; and I shall be happy if my words shall prepare us to
          exercise a holy readiness to see the grand request of our Redeemer
          fulfilled, even though it cost us many a sorrowful parting.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Let us begin as our text begins, and thus the first thought about
          the continual gathering to the house above will be THE HOME-WORD --
          the rallying word: "Father." Observe, our Lord had said, "Holy
          Father," and toward the close of the prayer he said, "O righteous
          Father;" but in commencing this particular petition he uses the word
          "Father" by itself alone: this relationship is in itself so dear that
          it agrees best with the loftiest petition. I like to think of that
          name "Father," as used in this connection. Is it not the center of
          living unity? If there is to be a family gathering and reunion, where
          should it be but in the father's house? Who is at the head of the
          table but the father? All the interests of the children unite in the
          parent, and he feels for them all.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the great Father the Lord Jesus himself came forth. We do not
          understand the doctrine of the eternal filiation -- we adore the
          mystery into which we may not pry. But we know that as our Lord Jesus
          is God-and-man Mediator, he came forth from the Father; and unto the
          Father's will he submitted himself in so doing. As for us, we come
          distinctly of that Father, it is he that made us, and not we
          ourselves; and, better and brighter fact still, of his own will begat
          he us by the word of truth. We were born a second time from heaven,
          and from our Heavenly Father our spiritual life is derived.
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole of this sermon through, I want to show you that it is right
          that we should part with our brethren and joyfully permit of their
          going home; and surely I may at once ask you -- What can be more right
          than that children should go home to their father? From him they came,
          to him they owe their life; should they not always tend towards him,
          and should not this be the goal of their being, that they should at
          last dwell in his presence? To go away from the Father and to live
          apart from him is the sorrow of our fallen nature as it plays the
          prodigal; but the coming back to the Father is restoration to life, to
          peace, to happiness. Yes, all our hopeful steps are towards the
          Father. We are saved when by believing in the name of Jesus we receive
          power to become the sons of God. Our sanctification lies in the bosom
          of our adoption. Because Jesus comes from the Father and leads us back
          to the Father, therefore is there a heaven for us. Wherefore, whenever
          we think of heaven let us chiefly think of the Father; for it is in
          our Father's house that there are many mansions, and it is to the
          Father that our Lord has gone, that he may prepare a place for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          "FATHER!" why, it is a bell that rings us home. He who hath the spirit
          of adoption feels that the Father draws him home, and he would fain
          run after him. How intensely did Jesus turn to the Father! He cannot
          speak of the glory wherein he is to be without coupling his Father
          with it. Brethren, it is in the Father that we live and move and have
          our being. Is there any spiritual life in the world which does not
          continually proceed from the life of the great Father? Is it not by
          the continual outcoming of the Holy Ghost from the Father that we
          remain spiritual men? And as from him we live, so for him we live, if
          we live aright. We wish so to act as to glorify God in everything.
          Even our salvation should not be an ultimate end with any one of us;
          we should desire to glorify God by our salvation. We look upon the
          doctrines that we preach, and the precepts which we obey, as means to
          the glory of God, even the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the consummation which the First-born looks for, and to which
          all of us who are like him are aspiring also, namely, that God may be
          all in all: that the great Father may be had in honor, and may be
          worshipped in every place. Since, then, we are from him, and of him,
          and to him, and for him, this word "Father" calls us to gather at his
          feet. Shall any one of us lament the process? No; we dare not complain
          that our choicest brethren are taken up to gladden the great Father's
          house. Our brother is gone; but we ask, "Where is he gone?" and when
          the answer comes, "He is gone to the Father," all notion of complaint
          is over. To whom else should he go? When the great First-born went
          away from us, he told his sorrowing followers that he was going to
          their Father and his Father; and that answer was enough. So, when our
          friend, or our child, or our wife, or our brother is gone, it is
          enough that he is with the Father. To call them back does not occur to
          us; but rather we each one desire to follow after them.
        </p>
        <p>"Father, I long, I faint to see</p>
        <p>The place of thine abode;</p>
        <p>I'd leave thine earthly courts and flee</p>
        <p>Up to thy seat, my God."</p>
        <p>
          A child may be happy at school, but he longs for the holidays. Is it
          merely to escape his lessons? Ah, no! Ask him, and he will tell you,
          "I want to go home to see my father." The same is equally true, and
          possibly more so, if we include the feminine form of parentage. What a
          home-cry is that of "mother!" The sight of that dear face has been
          longed and hungered for by many a child when far away. Mother or
          father, which you will; they are blended in the great Fatherhood of
          God. Let it but be said that any one has gone to his father, and no
          further question is asked as to the right of his going thither. To the
          father belongs the first possession of the child; should he not have
          his own child at home? The Savior wipes our tears away with a
          handkerchief which is marked in the corner with this word -- "Father."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, I want your thoughts upon THE HOME IMPETUS. The force
          which draws us home lies in the word, "I will." Jesus Christ, our most
          true God, veiled in human form, bows his knee and prays, and throws
          his divine energy into the prayer for the bringing home of his
          redeemed. This one irresistible, everlastingly almighty prayer carries
          everything before it. "Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast
          given me, be with me where I am," is the centripetal energy which is
          drawing all the family of God towards its one home.
        </p>
        <p>
          How shall the chosen get home to the Father? Chariots are provided.
          Here are the chariots of fire and horses of fire in this prayer. "I
          will," saith Jesus, "that they be with me;" and with him they must be.
          There are difficulties in the way -- long nights and darkness lie
          between, and hills of guilt, and forests of trouble, and bands of
          fierce temptations; yet the pilgrims shall surely reach their
          journey's end, for the Lord's "I will" shall be a wall of fire round
          about them. In this petition I see both sword and shield for the
          church militant. Here I see the eagles' wings on which they shall be
          upborne till they enter within the golden gates. Jesus saith, "I
          will;" and who is he that shall hinder the home-coming of the chosen?
          As well hope to arrest the marches of the stars of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examine the energy of this "I will" for a moment, and you will see,
          first, that it hath the force of an intercessory prayer. It is a gem
          from that wonderful breastplate of jewels which our great High-priest
          wore upon his breast when he offered his fullest intercession. I
          cannot imagine our Lord's interceding in vain. If he asks that we may
          be with him where he is, he must assuredly have his request. It is
          written, that "he was heard in that he feared." When with strong
          crying and tears he poured out his soul unto death, his Father granted
          the requests of his heart. I do not wonder it should be so; how could
          the best Beloved fail of that which he sought in intercession from his
          Father God! Mark, then, that the force of irresistible intercession is
          drawing every blood-bought soul into the place where Jesus is. You
          cannot hold your dying babe; for Jesus asks for it to be with him.
          Will you come into competition with your Lord? Surely you will not.
          You cannot hold your aged father, nor detain your beloved mother,
          beyond the time appointed; for the intercession of Christ has such a
          force about it that they must ascend even as sparks must seek the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          More than intercession is found in the expression "I will." It
          suggests the idea of a testamentary bequest and appointment. The Lord
          Jesus is making his last will and testament, and he writes, "Father, I
          will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me." No man who
          makes his will likes to have it frustrated. Our Savior's testament
          will assuredly be carried out in every jot and tittle; and, if for no
          other reason, yet certainly for this cause, that though he died, and
          thus made his will valid, yet he lives again to be his own executor,
          and to carry out his will. When I read in our Lord's testament the
          words, "Father, I will that they be with me," I ask, "Who is to hold
          them back?" They must in due time be with him, for the will of the
          ever blessed Savior must be carried out: there can be no standing
          against a force of that kind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is this all: the words read to me, not only like intercession and
          testamentary decree, but there is a strong expression of desire,
          resolve, and purpose. Jesus desires it, and saith, "I will." It is a
          deliberate desire -- a forcible, distinct, resolute, determined
          purpose. The will of God is supreme law. It needeth not that he should
          speak; he doth but will or purpose, and the thing is done. Now read my
          text: "I will that they be with me;" the Son of God wills it. How are
          the saints to be hindered from what the Lord wills? They must rise
          from their beds of dust and silent clay; -- they must rise to be with
          Jesus where he is, for Jesus wills it. By your anxious care you may
          seek to detain them; you may sit about their bed and nurse them both
          night and day, but they must quit these dark abodes when Jesus gives
          the signal. You may clutch them with affectionate eagerness, and even
          cry in despair, "They shall not go, we cannot bear to part with them;"
          but go they must when Jesus calls. Take back your naughty hands, which
          would detain them, for naughty they are if you would rob your Savior.
          Would you cross his will? Would you set at naught his testament? You
          could not if you would; you would not if you could. Rather be inclined
          to go with them than think to resist the heavenly attraction which
          upraises them. If Jesus saith, "I will," then it is yours to say, "Not
          as I will, but as thou wilt. They were never so much mine as they are
          thine. I never had so much right to them as thou hast who hast bought
          them. They never so truly could be at home with me as they will be at
          home with thee in thine own bosom; so my will dissolves itself into
          thy will, and I say with steadfast resignation, 'Let them go.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          Brothers and sisters, you perceive the forces which are bearing away
          our beloved ones. I see tender hands reaching after us this morning;
          they are invisible to sense, but palpable to faith. Cords of love are
          being cast about the chosen, and they are being drawn out secretly
          from their fellows. Would you break those bands asunder, and cast
          those cords from us? I beseech you, think not so; but let that pierced
          hand which bought the beloved ones seek out its own purchase and bring
          them home. Should not Jesus have his own? Do we not bow our knee and
          pray for Jesus, "Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven?"
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But now I want to conduct you farther into the text. We have had
          the home-word and the home-bringing impetus, and now let us carefully
          note THE HOME CHARACTER. "Father, I will that they also, whom thou
          hast given me, be with me where I am." The description is -- "They
          also, whom thou hast given me." The Greek is somewhat difficult to
          translate. The translators of the Revised Version were, no doubt,
          excellent Greek scholars, and if they had known a little more English,
          they might have come a little nearer to a perfect translation, but
          they do not always appear to think the common English reader to be
          worthy of their consideration. This is their translation in the
          present instance: -- "Father, that which thou hast given me, I will
          that, where I am they also may be with me." This, to speak plainly,
          sounds very like nonsense. It is the translation which a boy would
          present to his tutor at school, but it is of small use to the general
          reader. It is literal, no doubt; but literalisms are often another
          proof that the letter killeth. Translators into the English tongue
          might have contrived to have given us words with a meaning in them. I
          merely quote the version to show you that there is here a something in
          the singular as well as persons in the plural. "Father, I will
          concerning that which thou hast given me, that they may be with me
          where I am." Our Lord looked upon those whom the Father gave him as
          one -- one body, one church, one bride: he willed that as a whole the
          church should be with him where he is. Then he looked again and saw
          each of the many individuals of whom the one church is composed, and
          he prayed that each, that all of these, might be with him and behold
          his glory. Jesus never so prays for the whole church as to forget a
          single member; neither does he so pray for the members individually as
          to overlook the corporate capacity of the whole. Sweet thought! Jesus
          wills to have the whole of what he bought with his precious blood with
          him in heaven; he will not lose any part. He did not die for a part of
          a church, nor will he be satisfied unless the entire flock which he
          has purchased shall be gathered around him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But while the Lord looks at those whom his Father gave him as one
          body, he looks upon you and me, and each believer here, as a part of
          that great unity, and his prayer is that all of us may be with him. I
          believe that he prays as much for the least as for the greatest, as
          much for Benjamin as for Judah, as much for the despondent as for
          those who are fully assured. The prayer is one of great breadth and
          comprehensiveness, but yet it is not the prayer which those who
          believe in Universalism would put into his mouth. He does not pray
          that those who die unbelievers may be with him where he is, neither
          does he will that souls in hell should one day come out of it and be
          with him in glory. There is no trace of that doctrine in holy writ:
          those who teach such fables draw their inspiration from some other
          source. The new purgatory, in which so many have come to believe, is
          unknown to Holy Scripture. No, our Lord's prayer is distinctly for
          those whom the Father gave him -- for every one of these, but for no
          others. His "I will" concerns them only.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel right glad that there is no sort of personal character
          mentioned here, but only -- "Those whom thou hast given me." It seems
          as if the Lord in his last moments was not so much looking at the
          fruit of grace as at grace itself; he did not so much note either the
          perfections or the imperfections of his people, but only the fact that
          they were his by the eternal gift of the Father. They belonged to the
          Father -- "thine they were." The Father gave them to Jesus -- "thou
          gavest them me." The Father gave them as a love token and a means of
          his Son's glorification -- "Thine they were and thou gavest them me;"
          and now our Lord pleads that because they were the Father's gift to
          him he should have them with him. Does anybody raise a cavil as to
          Christ's right to have those with him who were his Father's, whom his
          Father gave him, and whom he himself actually took into his own
          possession? No, they ought to be with him, since they are his in so
          divine a manner. If I possess a love-token that some dear one has
          given me I may rightly desire to have it with me. Nobody can have such
          a right to your wedding-ring, good sister, as you have yourself, and
          are not Christ's saints, as it were, a signet upon his finger, a token
          which his Father gave him of his good pleasure in him? Should they not
          be with Jesus where he is, since they are his crown jewels and his
          glory? We in our creature love lift up our hands, and cry, "My Lord,
          my Master, let me have this dear one with me a little longer. I need
          the companionship of one so sweet, or life will be misery to me." But
          if Jesus looks us in the face, and says, "Is thy right better than
          mine?" we draw back at once. He has a greater part in his saints than
          we can have. O Jesus, thy Father gave them to thee of old; they are
          his reward for the travail of thy soul; and far be it from us to deny
          thee. Though blinded by our tears, we can yet see the rights of Jesus,
          and we loyally admit them. We cry concerning our best beloved, "The
          Lord hath taken away, and blessed be the name of the Lord." Does not
          the text sweetly comfort us in the talking away of one and another,
          since it shows how they belong to Christ?
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And now, advancing another step, Christ reveals to us something
          concerning THE HOME COMPANIONSHIP in the glory land. Those who are
          taken away, where are they gone? The text saith, "I will that they
          also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am; that they may
          behold my glory."
        </p>
        <p>
          By this language we are impressed with the nearness of the saints to
          Christ in glory -- "that they may be with me." Think for a moment:
          when our Lord used these words, and John took them down, the disciples
          were with him. They had left the supper-table where they had feasted
          together. The Master had said, "Arise, let us go hence;" and it was in
          the very midst of them that the Lord Jesus offered this choice prayer.
          Learn, then, that in heaven the saints will be nearer to Christ than
          the apostles were when they sat at the table with him, or heard him
          pray. That was a nearness which might consist only in place, and their
          minds might still be, as they often were, far away from him: but up in
          heaven we shall be one with him in sympathy, in spirit, in conscious
          fellowship. We shall be with Jesus in the closest, clearest, and most
          complete sense. No fellowship on earth can reach to the plenitude of
          the communion which we shall enjoy above. "With him" -- "for ever with
          the Lord" -- this is heaven. Who would wish to detain from such
          companionship those whom we love?
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet do not drop the thought of place, lest you refine away the essence
          of the prayer. Let us see the spiritual clearly, but let us not, on
          that account, make the sense less real, less matter of fact. To the
          prayer that his saints may be with him our Lord added the words, "May
          be with me where I am." Our bodies will rise from the dust, and they
          must occupy a place: that place will be where Jesus is. Even spirits
          must be somewhere, and that somewhere with us is to be where Jesus is.
          We are to be, not metaphorically and fancifully, but really, truly,
          literally with Jesus. We shall enjoy an intense nearness to him in
          that blessed place which the Father has prepared for him, and which he
          is preparing for us. There is a place where Jesus is revealed in all
          the splendor of his majesty, amid angels and glorified spirits; and
          those whom our Lord's will has taken away from us have not gone into
          banishment in a mysterious land, neither are they shut up in a house
          of detention till there is a general jail delivery, but they are with
          Christ in Paradise. They serve him, and they see his face. Who would
          be so cruel as to keep a saint from such a fair country? I would
          desire all good for my children, my relatives, my friends; and what
          good is better than to be where Jesus is? Are you not glad to hear of
          the promotion of those you love? Will you quarrel with God because
          some of your dearest ones are promoted to the skies? The thought of
          their amazing bliss greatly moderates our natural grief. We weep for
          ourselves, but as we remember their companionship with the Altogether
          Lovely One a smile blends with our tears.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice the occupation of those who are with Jesus: "That they may
          behold my glory." I do not wonder that Jesus wants his dear ones to be
          with him for this purpose, since love always pines for a partner in
          its joys. When I have been abroad, and have been specially charmed
          with glorious scenery, I have a hundred times felt myself saying,
          almost involuntarily, "How I wish that my dear wife could be here! I
          should enjoy this a hundred times as much if she could but see it!" It
          is an instinct of affection to seek fellowship in joy. The Lord Jesus
          is truly human, and he feels this unselfish desire of every loving
          human heart, and therefore says, "Father, I will that they also, whom
          thou hast given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my
          glory." Our Lord graciously permits his disciples to have fellowship
          with him in his sufferings, and hence he is all the more desirous that
          they should participate in his glory. He knows that nothing will be a
          greater joy to them than to see him exalted; therefore he would give
          them this highest form of delight. Was not Joseph delighted when he
          said to his brethren, "Ye shall tell my father of all my glory in
          Egypt;" and still more so when he could actually show his father how
          great was his power, how exalted was his rank. It is joy to Jesus to
          let us behold his joy, and it will be glory to us to behold his glory.
          Should not the redeemed ascend to such blessed delights? Would you
          hinder them?
        </p>
        <p>
          How unselfish it is on our Lord's part to think himself not fully
          glorified till we behold his glory! How unselfish he will make us
          also, since it will be our glory to see his glory! He does not say
          that he is going to take us home, that we may be in glory, but that we
          may behold his glory. His glory is better to us than any personal
          glory: all things are more ours by being his. Glory apart from him
          were no glory. Beloved, even as our Lord seems to lose himself in his
          people, his people hide themselves away in him. It is his glory to
          glorify them; it is their glory to glorify him; and it will be the
          glory of glories for them to be glorified together. Who would not go
          to this heaven? Who would keep a brother out of it an hour?
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe the fellowship which exists in the glory land. Read the verse:
          "That they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me." What a
          blending of persons! Where did our Lord's glory come from? "Thou
          gavest it me," says Jesus. Hence it is the Father's glory passed over
          to the Son. Yet Jesus calls it "my glory," for it is truly his own.
          The saints are to behold this, and it will be their glory to see it.
          Here we have the Father, and the Elder Brother, and the many brethren,
          and a wonderful communism of interests and possessions. It is ever so
          in a loving family. There we draw no hard and fast lines of meum and
          tuum. "All thine are mine, and mine are thine." We ask not whose is
          this? or whose is that? when we are at home. If you were to go into a
          stranger's house, you would not think of taking this or that; but as
          your father's own son you make yourself at home, and no one enquires,
          "What doest thou?" Bridegroom and bride do not quarrel about property
          whether it be his or hers. Laws have been made lately to settle
          different estates for those who are one: this is well enough when love
          is gone, but true conjugal love laughs at all that can make separate
          that which God hath joined together. The wife says, "That is mine."
          "No" saith the caviller, "it is your husband's." Her answer is, "and
          therefore it is mine." In that blessed union into which divine love
          has admitted us Christ is ours, and we are Christ's; his Father is our
          Father, we are one with him, he is one with the Father: and hence all
          things are ours, and the Father himself loveth us. All this will not
          only be true in heaven, but it will there be realized and acted on. So
          when the Lord brings his people home, we shall be one with him, and he
          one with the Father, and we also in him one with the Father, so that
          we shall then find boundless glory in beholding the glory of our Lord
          and God. My text has baffled me. I am beaten back by its blaze of
          light. Forgive me. I had a thought, but I cannot express it. The fire
          of my text burns with such fervent heat that it threatens to consume
          me if I draw nearer to it. Easily could I step into heaven -- so I
          feel at this moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. I must end by speaking of THE HOME ATMOSPHERE. None of us can wish
          our departed friends back from their thrones. Since they have gone to
          be where Jesus is, and to enter so fully into the most blissful
          fellowship with him and the Father, we would not have them return even
          for an instant to this poor country. We only wish that our turn for
          migration may come soon. We would not be too long divided from our
          fellows. If some of the birds have gone to the sunny land, let us
          plume our wings to follow them. There will be only a little interval
          between our parting and our everlasting meeting. Look at the many who
          died before we came into the world. Some of them have been in heaven
          together now for thousands of years. To them it must seem that they
          were only divided by a moment's interval; their continents of
          fellowship have made the channel of death seem but a streak of sea.
          Soon we shall take the same view of things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Breathe the home atmosphere. Jesus tells us that the atmosphere of his
          home is love: "Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world."
          Brethren, can you follow me in a great flight? Can you stretch broader
          wings than the condor ever knew, and fly back into the unbeginning
          eternity? There was a day before all days, when there was no day but
          the Ancient of Days. There was a time before all time, when God only
          was: the uncreated, the only-existent One. The Divine Three, Father,
          Son, and Spirit, lived in blessed consort with each other, delighting
          in each other. Oh the intensity of the divine love of the Father to
          the Son! There was no world, no sun, no moon, no stars, no universe,
          but God alone; and the whole of God's omnipotence flowed forth in a
          stream of love to the Son, while the Son's whole being remained
          eternally one with the Father by a mysterious essential union. How
          came all this which we now see and hear? Why this creation? this fall
          of Adam? this redemption? this church? this heaven? How came it all
          about? It needed not to have been, but the Father's love made him
          resolve to show forth the glory of his Son. The mysterious volume
          which has been gradually unfolded before us has only this one design
          -- the Father would make known his love to the Son, and make the Son's
          glories to appear before the eyes of those whom the Father gave him.
          This Fall and this Redemption, and the story as a whole, so far as the
          divine purpose is concerned, are the fruit of the Father's love to the
          Son, and his delight in glorifying the Son. Those myriads, those
          white-robed myriads, harping to music infinitely deep, what mean they
          all? They are the Father's delight in the Son. That he might be
          glorified for ever, he permitted that he should bear a human body, and
          should suffer, bleed, and die, so that there might come out of him, as
          a harvest cometh from a dying and buried corn of wheat, all the
          countless hosts of elect souls, ordained for ever to a felicity
          exceeding bounds. These are the bride of the Lamb, the body of Christ,
          the fullness of him that filleth all in all. Their destiny is so high
          that no language can fully describe it. God only knows the love of
          God, and all that it has prepared for those who are the objects of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Love wraps up the whole in its cloth of gold. Love is both the source
          and the channel, and the end of the divine acting. Because the Father
          loved the Son he gave us to him, and ordained that we should be with
          him. His love to us is love to the Son. "Not for your sakes do I this,
          O House of Israel; be ashamed and be confounded." Because of the
          boundless, ineffable, infinite love of the great Father toward his
          Son, therefore hath he ordained this whole system of salvation and
          redemption, that Jesus in the church of his redeemed might
          everlastingly be glorified. Let our saintly ones go home, beloved, if
          that is the design of their going. Since all comes of divine love, and
          all sets forth divine love, let them go to him who loves them -- let
          divine love fulfill its purpose of bringing many sons unto glory.
          Since the Father once made our Lord perfect by his sufferings, let him
          now be made perfectly glorious by the coming up of his redeemed from
          the purifying bath of his atonement I see them rise like sheep from
          the washing, all of them gathering with delight at the feet of that
          great Shepherd of the sheep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, I am lost in the subject now. I breathe that heavenly air.
          Love surrounds all, and conquers grief. I will not cause the
          temperature to fall by uttering any other words but this -- Hold your
          friends lovingly, but be ready to yield them to Jesus. Detain them not
          from him to whom they belong. When they are sick, fast and pray; but
          when they are departed, do much as David did, who washed his face, and
          ate, and drank. You cannot bring them back again; you will go to them,
          they cannot return to you. Comfort yourselves with the double thought
          of their joy in Christ and Christ's joy in them; add the triple
          thought of the Father's joy in Christ and in them. Let us watch the
          Master's call. Let us not dread the question -- who next, and who
          next? Let none of us start back as though we hoped to linger longer
          than others. Let us even desire to see our names in the celestial
          conscription. Let us be willing to be dealt with just as our Lord
          pleases. Let no doubt intervene; let no gloom encompass us. Dying is
          but going home; indeed, there is no dying for the saints. Charles
          Stanford is gone! Thus was his death told to me -- "He drew up his
          feet and smiled." Thus will you and I depart. He had borne his
          testimony in the light, even when blind. He had cheered us all, though
          he was the greatest sufferer of us all; and now the film has gone from
          the eyes, and the anguish is gone from the heart, and he is with
          Jesus. He smiled. What a sight was that which caused that smile! I
          have seen many faces of dear departed ones lit up with splendor. Of
          many I could feel sure that they had seen a vision of angels. Traces
          of a reflected glory hung about their countenances. O brethren, we
          shall soon know more of heaven than all the divines can tell us. Let
          us go home now to our own dwellings; but let us pledge ourselves that
          we will meet again. But where shall we appoint the trysting place? It
          would be idle to appoint any spot of earth, for this assembly will
          never come together again in this world. We will meet with Jesus,
          where he is, where we shall behold his glory. Some of you cannot do
          this. Turn from your evil ways. Turn to the right, where stands that
          cross, and keep straight on, and you will come to Jesus in glory.
          Blessed be the name of the Lord! Amen.
