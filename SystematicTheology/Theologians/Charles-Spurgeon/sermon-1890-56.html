          Addæus said to him: Because thou hast thus believed, I lay my hand
          upon thee in the name of Him in whom thou hast thus believed. And at
          the very moment that he laid his hand upon him he was healed of the
          plague of the disease which he had for a long time. And Abgar was
          astonished and marvelled, because, like as he had heard about Jesus,
          how He wrought and healed, so Addæus also, without any medicine
          whatever, was healing in the name of Jesus. And Abdu also, son of
          Abdu, had the gout in his feet; and he also presented his feet to him,
          and he laid his hand upon them, and healed him, and he had the gout no
          more. And in all the city also he wrought great cures, and showed
          forth wonderful mighty-works in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abgar said to him: Now that every man knoweth that by the power of
          Jesus Christ thou doest these miracles, and lo! we are astonished at
          thy deeds, I therefore entreat of thee to relate to us the story about
          the coming of Christ, in what manner it was, and about His glorious
          power, and about the miracles which we have heard that He did, which
          thou hast thyself seen, together with thy fellow-disciples.
        </p>
        <p>
          Addæus said: I will not hold my peace from declaring this; since for
          this very purpose was I sent hither, that I might speak to and teach
          every one who is willing to believe, even as thou. Assemble me
          tomorrow all the city, and I will sow in it the word of life by the
          preaching which I will address to you -- about the coming of Christ,
          in what manner it was; and about Him that sent Him, why and how He
          sent Him; and about His power and His wonderful works; and about the
          glorious mysteries of His coming, which He spake of in the world; and
          about the unerring truth of His preaching; and how and for what cause
          He abused Himself, and humbled His exalted Godhead by the manhood
          which He took, and was crucified, and descended to the place of the
          dead, and broke through the enclosure which had never been broken
          through before, and gave life to the dead by being slain Himself, and
          descended alone, and ascended with many to His glorious Father, with
          whom He had been from eternity in one exalted Godhead.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Abgar commanded them to give to Addæus silver and gold. Addæus
          said to him: How can we receive that which is not ours. For, lo! that
          which was ours have we forsaken, as we were commanded by our Lord;
          because without purses and without scrips, bearing the cross upon our
          shoulders, were we commanded to preach His Gospel in the whole
          creation, of whose crucifixion, which was for our sakes, for the
          redemption of all men, the whole creation was sensible and suffered
          pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he related before Abgar the king, and before his princes and his
          nobles, and before Augustin, Abgar's mother, and before Shalmath, the
          daughter of Meherdath, Abgar's wife, the signs of our Lord, and His
          wonders, and the glorious mighty-works which He did, and His divine
          exploits, and His ascension to His Father; and how they had received
          power and authority at the same time that He was received up -- by
          which same power it was that he had healed Abgar, and Abdu son of
          Abdu, the second person of his kingdom; and how He informed them that
          He would reveal Himself at the end of the ages and at the consummation
          of all created things; also of the resuscitation and resurrection
          which is to come for all men, and the separation which will be made
          between the sheep and the goats, and between the faithful and those
          who believe not.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he said to them: Because the gate of life is strait and the way of
          truth narrow, therefore are the believers of the truth few, and
          through unbelief is Satan's gratification. Therefore are the liars
          many who lead astray those that see. For, were it not that there is a
          good end awaiting believing men, our Lord would not have descended
          from heaven, and come to be born, and to endure the suffering of
          death. Yet He did come, and us did He send ...of the faith which we
          preach, that God was crucified for all men.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, if there be those who are not willing to agree with these our
          words, let them draw near to us and disclose to us what is in their
          mind, that, like as in the case of a disease, we may apply to their
          thoughts healing medicine for the cure of their ailments. For, though
          ye were not present at the time of Christ's suffering, yet from the
          sun which was darkened, and which ye saw, learn ye and understand
          concerning the great convulsion which took place at that time, when He
          was crucified whose Gospel has winged its way through all the earth by
          the signs which His disciples my fellows do in all the earth: yea,
          those who were Hebrews, and knew only the language of the Hebrews, in
          which they were born, lo! at this day are speaking in all languages,
          in order that those who are afar off may hear and believe, even as
          those who are near. For He it is that confounded the tongues of the
          presumptuous in this region who were before us; and He it is that
          teaches at this day the faith of truth and verity by us, humble and
          despicable men from Galilee of Palestine. For I also whom ye see am
          from Paneas, from the place where the river Jordan issues forth, and I
          was chosen, together with my fellows, to be a preacher.
        </p>
        <p>
          For, according as my Lord commanded me, lo! I preach and publish the
          Gospel, and lo! His money do I cast upon the table before you, and the
          seed of His word do I sow in the ears of all men; and such as are
          willing to receive it, theirs is the good recompense of the confession
          of Christ; but those who are not persuaded, the dust of my feet do I
          shake off against them, as He commanded me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Repent therefore, my beloved, of evil ways and of abominable deeds,
          and turn yourselves towards Him with a good and honest will, as He
          hath turned Himself towards you with the favour of His rich mercies;
          and be ye not as the generations of former times that have passed
          away, which, because they hardened their heart against the fear of
          God, received punishment openly, that they themselves might be
          chastised, and that those who come after them may tremble and be
          afraid. For the purpose of our Lord's coming into the world assuredly
          was, that He might teach us and show us that at the consummation of
          the creation there will be a resuscitation of all men, and that at
          that time their course of conduct will be portrayed in their persons,
          and their bodies will be volumes for the writings of justice; nor will
          any one be there who is unacquainted with books, because every one
          will read that which is written in His own book.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ye that have eyes, forasmuch as ye do not perceive, are yourselves
          also become like those who see not and hear not; and in vain do your
          ineffectual voices strain themselves to deaf ears. Whilst they are not
          to be blamed for not hearing, because they are by nature deaf and
          dumb, yet the blame which is justly incurred falls upon you, because
          ye are not willing to perceive -- not even that which ye see. For the
          dark cloud of error which overspreads your minds suffers you not to
          obtain the heavenly light, which is the understanding of knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flee, then, from things made and created, as I said to you, which are
          only called gods in name, whilst they are not gods in their nature;
          and draw near to this Being, who in His nature is God from everlasting
          and from eternity, and is not something made, like your idols, nor is
          He a creature and a work of art, like those images in which ye glory.
          Because, although this Being put on a body, yet is He God with His
          Father. For the works of creation, which trembled when He was slain
          and were dismayed at His suffering of death, -- these bear witness
          that He is Himself God the Creator. For it was not on account of a man
          that the earth trembled, but on account of Him who established the
          earth upon the waters; nor was it on account of a man that the sun
          grew dark in the heavens, but on account of Him who made the great
          lights; nor was it for a man that the just and righteous were restored
          to life again, but for Him who had granted power over death from the
          beginning; nor was it for a man that the veil of the temple of the
          Jews was rent from the top to the bottom, but for Him who said to
          them, "Lo, your house is left desolate." For, lo! unless those who
          crucified Him had known that He was the Son of God, they would not
          have had to proclaim the desolation of their city, nor would they have
          brought down Woe! upon themselves. For, even if they had wished to
          make light of this confession, the fearful convulsions which took
          place at that time would not have suffered them to do so. For lo! some
          even of the children of the crucifiers are become at this day
          preachers and evangelists, along with my fellow-apostles, in all the
          land of Palestine, and among the Samaritans, and in all the country of
          the Philistines. The idols also of paganism are despised, and the
          cross of Christ is honoured, and all nations and creatures confess God
          who became man.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, therefore, while Jesus our Lord was on earth ye would have
          believed in Him that He is the Son of God, and before ye had heard the
          word of His preaching would have confessed Him that He is God; now
          that He is ascended to His Father, and ye have seen the signs and the
          wonders which are done in His name, and have heard with your own ears
          the word of His Gospel, let no one of you doubt in his mind -- so that
          the promise of His blessing which He sent to you may be fulfilled
          towards you: Blessed are ye that have believed in me, not having seen
          me; and, because ye have so believed in me, the town in which ye dwell
          shall be blessed, and the enemy shall not prevail against it for ever.
          Turn not away, therefore, from his faith: for, lo! ye have heard and
          seen what things bear witness to His faith -- showing that He is the
          adorable Son, and is the glorious God, and is the victorious King, and
          is the mighty Power; and through faith in Him a man is able to acquire
          the eyes of a true mind, and to understand that, whosoever worshippeth
          creatures, the wrath of justice will overtake him.
        </p>
        <p>
          For in everything which we speak before you, according as we have
          received of the gift of our Lord, so speak we and teach and declare
          it, that ye may secure your salvation and not destroy your spirits
          through the error of paganism: because the heavenly light has arisen
          on the creation, and He it is who chose the fathers of former times,
          and the righteous men, and the prophets, and spoke with them in the
          revelation of the Holy Spirit. For He is Himself the God of the Jews
          who crucified Him; and to Him it is that the erring pagans offer
          worship, even while they know it not: because there is no other God in
          heaven and on earth; and lo! confession ascendeth up to Him from the
          four quarters of the creation. Lo! therefore, your ears have heard
          that which was not heard by you; and lo! further, your eyes have seen
          that which was never seen by you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be not, therefore, gainsayers of that which ye have seen and heard.
          Put away from you the rebellious mind of your fathers, and free
          yourselves from the yoke of sin, which hath dominion over you in
          libations and in sacrifices offered before carved images; and be ye
          concerned for your endangered salvation, and for the unavailing
          support on which ye lean; and get you a new mind, that worships the
          Maker and not the things which are made -- a mind in which is
          portrayed the image of verity and of truth, of the Father, and of the
          Son, and of the Holy Spirit; believing and being baptized in the
          triple and glorious names. For this is our teaching and our preaching.
          For the belief of the truth of Christ does not consist of many things.
          And those of you as are willing to be obedient to Christ are aware
          that I have many times repeated my words before you, in order that ye
          might learn and understand what ye hear.
        </p>
        <p>
          And we ourselves shall rejoice in this, like the husbandman who
          rejoices in the field which is blessed; God also will be glorified by
          your repentance towards Him. While ye are saved hereby, we also, who
          give you this counsel, shall not be despoiled of the blessed reward of
          this work. And, because I am assured that ye are a land blessed
          according to the will of the Lord Christ, therefore, instead of the
          dust of our feet which we were commanded to shake off against the town
          that would not receive our words, I have shaken off to-day at the door
          of your ears the sayings of my lips, in which are portrayed the coming
          of Christ which has already been, and also that which is yet to be;
          and the resurrection, and the resuscitation of all men, and the
          separation which is to be made between the faithful and the
          unbelieving; and the sore punishment which is reserved for those who
          know not God, and the blessed promise of future joy which they shall
          receive who have believed in Christ and worshipped Him and His exalted
          Father, and have confessed Him and His divine Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now it is meet for us that I conclude my present discourse; and
          let those who have accepted the word of Christ remain with us, and
          those also who are willing to join with us in prayer; and afterwards
          let them go to their homes.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Addæus the apostle was rejoiced to see that a great number of the
          population of the city stayed with him; and they were but few who did
          not remain at that time, while even those few not many days after
          accepted his words and believed in the Gospel set forth in the
          preaching of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when Addæus the apostle had spoken these things before all the
          town of Edessa, and King Abgar saw that all the city rejoiced in his
          teaching, men and women alike, and heard them saying to him, "True and
          faithful is Christ who sent thee to us" -- he himself also rejoiced
          greatly at this, giving praise to God; because, like as he had heard
          from Hanan, his Tabularius, about Christ, so had he seen the wonderful
          mighty-works which Addæus the apostle did in the name of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Abgar the king also said to him: According as I sent to Christ in
          my letter to Him, and according as He also sent to me, so have I also
          received from thine own self this day; so will I believe all the days
          of my life, and in the selfsame things will I continue and make my
          boast, because I know also that there is no other power in whose name
          these signs and wonders are done but the power of Christ whom thou
          preachest in verity and in truth. And henceforth Him will I worship --
          I and my son Maanu, and Augustin, and Shalmath the queen. And now,
          wherever thou desirest, build a church, a place of meeting for those
          who have believed and shall believe in thy words; and, according to
          the command given thee by thy Lord, minister thou at the seasons with
          confidence; to those also who shall be with thee as teachers of this
          Gospel I am prepared to give large donations, in order that they may
          not have any other work beside the ministry; and whatsoever is
          required by thee for the expenses of the building I myself will give
          thee without any restriction, whilst thy word shall be authoritative
          and sovereign in this town; moreover, without the intervention of any
          other person do thou come into my presence as one in authority, into
          the palace of my royal majesty.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when Abgar was gone down to his royal palace he rejoiced, he and
          his princes with him, Abdu son of Abdu, and Garmai, and Shemashgram,
          and Abubai, and Meherdath, together with the others their companions,
          at all that their eyes had seen and their ears also had heard; and in
          the gladness of their heart they too began to praise God for having
          turned their mind towards Him, renouncing the paganism in which they
          had lived, and confessing the Gospel of Christ. And when Addæus had
          built a church they proceeded to offer in it vows and oblations, they
          and the people of the city; and there they continued to present their
          praises all the days of their life.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Avida and Barcalba, who were chief men and rulers, and wore the
          royal headband, drew near to Addæus, and asked him about the matter of
          Christ, requesting that he would tell them how He, though He was God,
          appeared to them as a man: And how, said they, were ye able to look
          upon Him? And he proceeded to satisfy them all about this, about all
          that their eyes had seen and about whatsoever their ears had heard
          from him. Moreover, everything that the prophets had spoken concerning
          Him he repeated before them, and they received his words gladly and
          with faith, and there was not a man that withstood him; for the
          glorious deeds which he did suffered not any man to withstand him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shavida, moreover, and Ebednebu, chiefs of the priests of this town,
          together with Piroz and Dilsu their companions, when they had seen the
          signs which he did, ran and threw down the altars on which they were
          accustomed to sacrifice before Nebu and Bel, their gods, except the
          great altar which was in the middle of the town; and they cried out
          and said: Verily this is the disciple of that eminent and glorious
          Master, concerning whom we have heard all that He did in the country
          of Palestine. And all those who believed in Christ did Addæus receive,
          and baptized them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
          the Holy Spirit. And those who used to worship stones and stocks sat
          at his feet, recovered from the madness of paganism wherewith they had
          been afflicted. Jews also, traders in fine raiment, who were familiar
          with the law and the prophets -- they too were persuaded, and became
          disciples, and confessed Christ that He is the Son of the living God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But neither did King Abgar nor yet the Apostle Addæus compel any man
          by force to believe in Christ, because without the force of man the
          force of the signs compelled many to believe in Him. And with
          affection did they receive His doctrine -- all this country of
          Mesopotamia, and all the regions round about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aggæus, moreover, who made the silks and headbands of the king, and
          Palut, and Barshelama, and Barsamya, together with the others their
          companions, clave to Addæus the apostle; and he received them, and
          associated them with him in the ministry, their business being to read
          in the Old Testament and the New, and in the prophets, and in the Acts
          of the Apostles, and to meditate upon them daily; strictly charging
          them to let their bodies be pure and their persons holy, as is
          becoming in men who stand before the altar of God. "And be ye," said
          he, "far removed from false swearing and from wicked homicide, and
          from dishonest testimony, which is connected with adultery; and from
          magic arts, for which there is no mercy, and from sooth-saying, and
          divination, and fortune-tellers; and from fate and nativities, of
          which the deluded Chaldeans make their boast; and from the stars, and
          the signs of the Zodiac, in which the foolish put their trust. And put
          far from you unjust partiality, and bribes, and presents, through
          which the innocent are pronounced guilty. And along with this
          ministry, to which ye have been called, see that ye have no other work
          besides: for the Lord is the work of your ministry all the days of
          your life. And be ye diligent to give the seal of baptism. And be not
          fond of the gains of this world. And hear ye a cause with justice and
          with truth. And be ye not a stumbling-block to the blind, lest through
          you should be blasphemed the name of Him who opened the eyes of the
          blind, according as we have seen. Let all, therefore, who see you
          perceive that ye yourselves are in harmony with whatsoever ye preach
          and teach."
        </p>
        <p>
          And they ministered with him in the church which Addæus had built at
          the word and command of Abgar the king, being furnished with supplies
          by the king and his nobles, partly for the house of God, and partly
          for the supply of the poor. Moreover, much people day by day assembled
          and came to the prayers of the service, and to the reading of the Old
          Testament, and the New of the Diatessaron. They also believed in the
          restoration of the dead, and buried their departed in the hope of
          resuscitation. The festivals of the Church they also observed in their
          seasons, and were assiduous every day in the vigils of the Church. And
          they made visits of almsgiving, to the sick and to those that were
          whole, according to the instruction of Addæus to them. In the
          environs, too, of the city churches were built, and many received from
          him ordination to the priesthood. So that even people of the East, in
          the guise of merchants, passed over into the territory of the Romans,
          that they might see the signs which Addæus did. And such as became
          disciples received from him ordination to the priesthood, and in their
          own country of the Assyrians they instructed the people of their
          nation, and erected houses of prayer there in secret, by reason of the
          danger from those who worshipped fire and paid reverence to water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, Narses, the king of the Assyrians, when he heard of those
          same things which Addæus the apostle had done, sent a message to Abgar
          the king: Either despatch to me the man who doeth these signs before
          thee, that I may see him and hear his word, or send me an account of
          all that thou hast seen him do in thy own town. And Abgar wrote to
          Narses, and related to him the whole story of the deeds of Addæus from
          the beginning to the end; and he left nothing which he did not write
          to him. And, when Narses heard those things which were written to him,
          he was astonished and amazed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abgar the king, moreover, because he was not able to pass over into
          the territory of the Romans, and go to Palestine and slay the Jews for
          having crucified Christ, wrote a letter and sent it to Tiberius Cæsar,
          writing in it thus: --
        </p>
        <p>
          King Abgar to our Lord Tiberius Cæsar: Although I know that nothing is
          hidden from thy Majesty, I write to inform thy dread and mighty
          Sovereignty that the Jews who are under thy dominion and dwell in the
          country of Palestine have assembled themselves together and crucified
          Christ, without any fault worthy of death, after He had done before
          them signs and wonders, and had shown them powerful mighty-works, so
          that He even raised the dead to life for them; and at the time that
          they crucified Him the sun became darkened and the earth also quaked,
          and all created things trembled and quaked, and, as if of themselves,
          at this deed the whole creation and the inhabitants of the creation
          shrank away. And now thy Majesty knoweth what it is meet for thee to
          command concerning the people of the Jews who have done these things.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Tiberius Cæsar wrote and sent to King Abgar; and thus did he write
          to him: --
        </p>
        <p>
          The letter of thy Fidelity towards me I have received, and it hath
          been read before me. Concerning what the Jews have dared to do in the
          matter of the cross, Pilate the governor also has written and informed
          Aulbinus my proconsul concerning these selfsame things of which thou
          hast written to me. But, because a war with the people of Spain, who
          have rebelled against me, is on foot at this time, on this account I
          have not been able to avenge this matter; but I am prepared, when I
          shall have leisure, to issue a command according to law against the
          Jews, who act not according to law. And on this account, as regards
          Pilate also, who was appointed by me governor there -- I have sent
          another in his stead, and dismissed him in disgrace, because he
          departed from the law, and did the will of the Jews, and for the
          gratification of the Jews crucified Christ, who, according to what I
          hear concerning Him, instead of suffering the cross of death, deserved
          to be honoured and worshipped by them: and more especially because
          with their own eyes they saw everything that He did. Yet thou, in
          accordance with thy fidelity towards me, and the faithful covenant
          entered into by thyself and by thy fathers, hast done well in writing
          to me thus.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Abgar the king received Aristides, who had been sent by Tiberius
          Cæsar to him; and in reply he sent him back with presents of honour
          suitable for him who had sent him to him. And from Edessa he went to
          Thicuntha, where Claudius, the second from the emperor, was; and from
          thence, again, he went to Artica, where Tiberius Cæsar was: Caius,
          moreover, was guarding the regions round about Cæsar. And Aristides
          himself also related before Tiberius concerning the mighty-works which
          Addæus had done before Abgar the king. And when he had leisure from
          the war he sent and put to death some of the chief men of the Jews who
          were in Palestine. And, when Abgar the king heard of this, he rejoiced
          greatly that the Jews had received punishment, as it was right.
        </p>
        <p>
          And some years after Addæus the apostle had built the church in
          Edessa, and had furnished it with everything that was suitable for it,
          and had made disciples of a great number of the population of the
          city, he further built churches in the villages also -- both those
          which were at a distance and those which were near, and finished and
          adorned them, and appointed in them deacons and elders, and instructed
          in them those who should read the Scriptures, and taught the
          ordinances and the ministry without and within.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all these things he fell ill of the sickness of which he
          departed from this world. And he called for Aggæus before the whole
          assembly of the church, and bade him draw near, and made him Guide and
          Ruler in his stead. And Palut, who was a deacon, he made elder; and
          Abshelama, who was a scribe, he made deacon. And, the nobles and chief
          men being assembled, and standing near him -- Barcalba son of Zati,
          and Maryhab son of Barshemash, and Senac son of Avida, and Piroz son
          of Patric, together with the rest of their companions -- Addæus the
          apostle said to them: --
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ye know and are witness, all of you who hear me, that, according to
          all that I have preached to you and taught you and ye have heard from
          me, even so have I behaved myself in the midst of you, and ye have
          seen it in deeds also: because our Lord thus charged us, that,
          whatsoever we preach in words before the people, we should practise it
          in deeds before all men. And, according to the ordinances and laws
          which were appointed by the disciples in Jerusalem, and by which my
          fellow-apostles also guided their conduct, so also do ye -- turn not
          aside from them, nor diminish aught from them: even as I also am
          guided by them amongst you, and have not turned aside from them to the
          right hand or to the left, lest I should become estranged from the
          promised salvation which is reserved for such as are guided by them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Give heed, therefore, to this ministry which ye hold, and with fear
          and trembling continue in it, and minister every day. Minister not in
          it with neglectful habits, but with the discreetness of faith; and let
          not the praises of Christ cease out of your mouth, nor let weariness
          of prayer at the stated times come upon you. Give heed to the verity
          which ye hold, and to the teaching of the truth which ye have
          received, and to the inheritance of salvation which I commit to you:
          because before the tribunal of Christ will ye have to give an account
          of it, when He maketh reckoning with the shepherds and overseers, and
          when He taketh His money from the traders with the addition of the
          gains. For He is the Son of a King, and goeth to receive a kingdom and
          return; and He will come and make a resuscitation to life for all men,
          and then will He sit upon the throne of His righteousness, and judge
          the dead and the living, as He said to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Let not the secret eye of your minds be closed by pride, lest your
          stumbling-blocks be many in the way in which there are no
          stumbling-blocks, but a hateful wandering in its paths. Seek ye those
          that are lost, and direct those that go astray, and rejoice in those
          that are found; bind up the bruised, and watch over the fatlings:
          because at your hands will the sheep of Christ be required. Look ye
          not for the honour that passeth away: for the shepherd that looketh to
          receive honour from his flock -- sadly, sadly stands his flock with
          respect to him. Let your concern be great for the young lambs, whose
          angels behold the face of the Father who is unseen. And be ye not
          stones of stumbling before the blind, but clearers of the way and the
          paths in a rugged country, among the Jews the crucifiers, and the
          deluded pagans: for with these two parties have ye to fight, in order
          that ye may show the truth of the faith which ye hold; and, though ye
          be silent, your modest and decorous appearance will fight for you
          against those who hate truth and love falsehood.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Buffet not the poor in the presence of the rich: for scourge grievous
          enough for them is their poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Be not beguiled by the hateful devices of Satan, lest ye be stripped
          naked of the faith which ye have put on." ..."And with the Jews, the
          crucifiers, we will have no fellowship. And this inheritance which we
          have received from thee we will not let go, but in that will we depart
          out of this world; and on the day of our Lord, before the
          judgment-seat of His righteousness, there will He restore to us this
          inheritance, even as thou hast told us."
        </p>
        <p>
          And, when these things had been spoken, Abgar the king rose up, he and
          his chief men and his nobles, and he went to his palace, all of them
          being distressed for him because he was dying. And he sent to him
          noble and excellent apparel, that he might be buried in it. And, when
          Addæus saw it, he sent to him, saying: In my lifetime I have not taken
          anything from thee, nor will I now at my death take anything from
          thee, nor will I frustrate the word of Christ which He spake to us:
          Accept not anything from any man, and possess not anything in this
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          And three days more after these things had been spoken by Addæus the
          apostle, and he had heard and received the testimony concerning the
          teaching set forth in their preaching from those engaged with him in
          the ministry, in the presence of all the nobles he departed out of
          this world. And that day was the fifth of the week, and the fourteenth
          of the month Iyar, nearly answering to May. And the whole city was in
          great mourning and bitter anguish for him. Nor was it the Christians
          only that were distressed for him, but the Jews also, and the pagans,
          who were in this same town. But Abgar the king was distressed for him
          more than any one, he and the princes of his kingdom. And in the
          sadness of his soul he despised and laid aside the magnificence of his
          kingly state on that day, and with tears mingled with moans he
          bewailed him with all men. And all the people of the city that saw him
          were amazed to see how greatly he suffered on his account. And with
          great and surpassing pomp he bore him, and buried him like one of the
          princes when he dies; and he laid him in a grand sepulchre adorned
          with sculpture wrought by the fingers -- that in which were laid those
          of the house of Ariu, the ancestors of Abgar the king: there he laid
          him sorrowfully, with sadness and great distress. And all the people
          of the church went there from time to time and prayed fervently; and
          they kept up the remembrance of his departure from year to year,
          according to the command and direction which had been received by them
          from Addæus the apostle, and according to the word of Aggæus, who
          himself became Guide and Ruler, and the successor of his seat after
          him, by the ordination to the priesthood which he had received from
          him in the presence of all men.
        </p>
        <p>
          He too, with the same ordination which he had received from him, made
          Priests and Guides in the whole of this country of Mesopotamia. For
          they also, in like manner as Addæus the apostle, held fast his word,
          and listened to and received it, as good and faithful successors of
          the apostle of the adorable Christ. But silver and gold he took not
          from any man, nor did the gifts of the princes come near him: for,
          instead of receiving gold and silver, he himself enriched the Church
          of Christ with the souls of believers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, as regards the entire state of the men and the women, they
          were chaste and circumspect, and holy and pure: for they lived like
          anchorites and chastely, without spot -- in circumspect watchfulness
          touching the ministry, in their sympathy toward the poor, in their
          visitations to the sick: for their footsteps were fraught with praise
          from those who saw them, and their conduct was arrayed in commendation
          from strangers -- so that even the priests of the house of Nebu and
          Bel divided the honour with them at all times, by reason of their
          dignified aspect, their truthful words, their frankness of speech
          arising from their noble nature, which was neither subservient through
          covetousness nor in bondage under the fear of blame. For there was no
          one who saw them that did not run to meet them, that he might salute
          them respectfully, because the very sight of them shed peace upon the
          beholden: for just like a net were their words of gentleness spread
          over the contumacious, and they entered within the fold of truth and
          verity. For there was no man who saw them that was ashamed of them,
          because they did nothing that was not accordant with rectitude and
          propriety. And in consequence of these things their bearing was
          fearless as they published their teaching to all men. For, whatsoever
          they said to others and enjoined on them, they themselves exhibited in
          practice in their own persons; and the hearers, who saw that their
          actions went along with their words, without much persuasion became
          their disciples, and confessed the King Christ, praising God for
          having turned them towards Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And some years after the death of Abgar the king, there arose one of
          his contumacious sons, who was not favourable to peace; and he sent
          word to Aggæus, as he was sitting in the church: Make me a headband of
          gold, such as thou usedst to make for my fathers in former times.
          Aggæus sent to him: I will not give up the ministry of Christ, which
          was committed to me by the disciple of Christ, and make a headband of
          wickedness. And, when he saw that he did not comply, he sent and brake
          his legs as he was sitting in the church expounding. And as he was
          dying he adjured Palut and Abshelama: In this house, for whose truth's
          sake, lo! I am dying, lay me and bury me. And, even as he had adjured
          them, so did they lay him -- inside the middle door of the church,
          between the men and the women. And there was great and bitter mourning
          in all the church, and in all the city -- over and above the anguish
          and the mourning which there had been within the church, such as had
          been the mourning when Addæus the apostle himself died.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, in consequence of his dying suddenly and quickly at the breaking
          of his legs, he was not able to lay his hand upon Palut. Palut went to
          Antioch, and received ordination to the priesthood from Serapion
          bishop of Antioch; by which Serapion himself also ordination had been
          received from Zephyrinus bishop of the city of Rome, in the succession
          of the ordination to the priesthood from Simon Cephas, who had
          received it from our Lord, and was bishop there in Rome twenty-five
          years in the days of the Cæsar who reigned there thirteen years.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          And, according to the custom which exists in the kingdom of Abgar the
          king, and in all kingdoms, that whatsoever the king commands and
          whatsoever is spoken in his presence is committed to writing and
          deposited among the records,
