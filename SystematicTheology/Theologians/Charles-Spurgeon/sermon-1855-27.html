        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.28)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, June 3, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing;
          and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be
          showers of blessing." -- Ezekiel 34:26.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE chapter (Ezek.34) that I read at the commencement of the service
          is a prophetical one; and, I take it, it has relation, not to the
          condition of the Jews during the captivity and their subsequent
          happiness when they should return to their land, but to a state into
          which they should they should fall after they had been restored to
          their country under Nehemiah and Ezra, and in which state they still
          continue to the present day. The prophet tells us that the shepherds
          then, instead of feeding the flock, fed themselves; they trod the
          grass, instead of allowing the sheep to eat it, and they fouled the
          waters with their feet. That is an exact description of the state of
          Judea after the captivity; for then there arose the Scribes and
          Pharisees, who took the key of knowledge, and would not enter
          themselves, nor allow others to enter; who laid heavy burdens on men's
          shoulders, and would not touch them with one of their fingers; who
          made religion to consist entirely in sacrifices and ceremonies, and
          imposed such a burden on the people, that they cried out, "What a
          weariness it is!" That same evil has continued with the poor Jews to
          the present day; and should you read the nonsense of the Talmud and
          the Gemara, and see the burdens they laid upon them you would say,
          "Verily they have idle shepherds;" they give the sheep no food; they
          trouble them with fanciful superstitions and silly views, and instead
          of telling them that the Messiah is already come, they delude them
          with the idea that there is a Messiah yet to come, who shall restore
          Judea, and raise it to its glory. The Lord pronounces a curse upon
          these Pharisees and Rabbis, these who "thrust with side and with
          shoulder," those evil shepherds who will not suffer the sheep to lie
          down, neither will feed them with good pasture. But, after having
          described this state, he prophesies better times for the poor Jew. The
          day is coming when the careless shepherds shall be as naught; when the
          power of the Rabbis shall cease, when the traditions of the Mishna and
          the Talmud shall be cast aside. The hour is approaching, when the
          tribes shall go up to their own country; when Judea, so long a howling
          wilderness, shall once more blossom like the rose; when, if the temple
          itself be not restored, yet on Zion's hill shall be raised some
          Christian building, where the chants of solemn praise shall be heard
          as erst of old the Psalms of David were sung in the tabernacle. Not
          long shall it be ere they shall come -- shall come from distant lands
          wher'er they rest or roam; and she who has been the offscouring of all
          things, whose name has been a proverb and a byword, shall become the
          glory of all lands. Dejected Zion shall raise her head, shaking
          herself from dust, and darkness, and the dead. Then shall the Lord
          feed his people, and make them and the places round about his hill a
          blessing. I think we do not attach sufficient importance to the
          restoration of the Jews. We do not think enough of it. But certainly,
          if there is anything promised in the Bible, it is this. I imagine that
          you cannot read the Bible without seeing clearly that there is to be
          an actual restoration of the children of Israel. "Thither they shall
          go up; they shall come with weeping unto Zion, and with supplications
          unto Jerusalem." May that happy day soon come! For when the Jews are
          restored, then the fulness of the Gentiles shall be gathered in; and
          as soon as they return, then Jesus will come upon Mount Zion to reign
          with his ancients gloriously, and the halcyon days of the Millennium
          shall then dawn; we shall then know every man to be a brother and a
          friend; Christ shall rule, with universal sway.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, then, is the meaning of the text; that God would make Jerusalem
          and the places round about his hill a blessing. I shall not, however,
          use it so this morning, but I shall use it in a more confined sense --
          or, perhaps, in a more enlarged sense -- as it applies to the church
          of Jesus Christ, and to this particular church with which you and I
          stand connected. "I will make them and the places round about my hill
          a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season;
          there shall be showers of blessing."
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two things here spoken of. First, Christ's church is to be a
          blessing; secondly, Christ's church is to be blessed. These two things
          you will find in the different sentences of the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, CHRIST'S CHURCH IS TO BE A BLESSING. "I will make them and
          the places round about my hill a blessing." The object of God, in
          choosing a people before all worlds, was not only to save that people,
          but through them to confer essential benefits upon the whole human
          race. When he chose Abraham, he did not elect him simply to be God's
          friend, and the recipient of peculiar privileges; but he chose him to
          make him, as it were, the conservator of truth. He was to be the ark
          in which the truth should be hidden. He was to be the keeper of the
          covenant in behalf of the whole world; and when God chooses any men by
          his sovereign, electing grace, and makes them Christ's, he does it not
          only for their own sake, that they may be saved, but for the world's
          sake. For, know ye not that "ye are the light of the world;" -- "A
          city set upon a hill, which cannot be hid?" "Ye are the salt of the
          earth;" and when God makes you salt, it is not only that ye may have
          salt in yourselves, but that like salt ye may preserve the whole mass.
          If he makes you leaven, it is that, like the little leaven, you may
          leaven the whole lump. Salvation is not a selfish thing; God does not
          give it for us to keep to ourselves, but that we may thereby be made
          the means of blessing to others; and the great day shall declare that
          there is not a man living on the surface of the earth but has received
          a blessing in some way or other through God's gift of the gospel. The
          very keeping of the wicked in life, and granting of the reprieve, was
          purchased with the death of Jesus; and through his sufferings and
          death, the temporal blessings which both we and they enjoy are
          bestowed on us. The gospel was sent that it might first bless those
          that embrace it, and then expand, so as to make them a blessing to the
          whole human race.
        </p>
        <p>
          In thus speaking of the church as a blessing, we shall notice three
          things. First, here is divinity -- "I will make them a blessing;"
          secondly, here is personality of religion -- "I will make them a
          blessing;" and thirdly, here is the development of religion" -- "and
          the places round about my hill."
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, with regard to this blessing which God will cause his church
          to be, here is divinity. It is God the everlasting Jehovah speaking:
          he says, "I will make them a blessing." None of us can bless others
          unless God has first blessed us. We need divine workmanship. "I will
          make them a blessing by helping them, and by constraining them." God
          makes his people a blessing by helping them. What can we do without
          God's help? I stand and preach to thousands, or it may be hundreds;
          what have I done, unless a greater than man has been in the pulpit
          with me? I work in the Sabbath Schools; what can I do, unless the
          Master is there, teaching the children with me? We want God's aid in
          every position; and once give us that assistance, and there is no
          telling with how little labor we may become a blessing. Ah! a few
          words sometimes will be more of a blessing than a whole sermon. You
          take some little prattler on your knee; and some few words that you
          say to him he remembers, and makes use of in after tears. I knew a
          gray-headed old man, who was in the habit of doing this. He once took
          a boy to a certain tree, and said, "Now, John, you kneel down at that
          tree, and I will kneel down with you." He knelt down and prayed, and
          asked God to convert him and save his soul. "Now," said he, "perhaps
          you will come to this tree again; and if you are not converted, you
          will remember that I asked under this tree that God would save your
          soul." That young man went away, and forgot the old man's prayer; but
          it chanced as God would have it that he walked down that field again,
          and saw a tree. It seemed as if the old man's name was cut in the
          bark. He recollected what he prayed for, and that the prayer was not
          fulfilled; but he dare not pass the tree without kneeling down to pray
          himself; and there was his spiritual birthplace. The simplest
          observation of the Christian shall be made a blessing, if God help
          him. "His leaf also shall not wither" -- the simplest word he speaks
          shall be treasured up; "and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper."
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is constraint here. "I will make them a blessing." I will
          give them to be a blessing; I will constrain them to be a blessing. I
          can say myself, that I never did anything which was a blessing to my
          fellow-creatures, without feeling compelled to do it. I thought of
          going to a Sabbath School to teach. On a certain day, some one called
          -- asked me -- begged me -- prayed me to take his class. I could not
          refuse to go; and there I was held, hand and foot, by the
          superintendent, and was compelled to go on. I was asked to address the
          children; I thought I could not, but no one else was there to do it,
          so I stood up and stumbled out a few words. And I recollect the first
          occasion on which I attempted to preach to the people -- I am sure I
          had no wish to do it -- but there was no one else in the place, and
          the congregation must go away without a single word of warning or
          address. How could I suffer it? I felt forced to address them. And so
          it has been with whatever I have laid my hand to. I have always felt a
          kind of impulse which I could not resist; but, moreover, felt placed
          by Providence in such a position, that I had no wish to avoid the
          duty, and if I had desired it, could not have helped myself. And so it
          is with God's people. If they will go through their lives, wherever
          they have been made a blessing, they will find that God seems to have
          thrust them into the vineyard. Such-and-such a man was once rich. What
          good was he in the world? He did but loll in his carriage; he did but
          little good, and was of little service to his fellow-creatures. Says
          God, "I will make him a blessing;" so he strips away his riches, and
          brings him into low circumstances. He is then brought into association
          with the poor, and his superior education and intellect make him a
          blessing to them. God makes him a blessing. Another man was naturally
          very timid; he would not pray at the prayer-meeting, he would hardly
          like to join the church; soon he gets into a position in which he
          cannot help himself. "I will make him a blessing." And as sure as ever
          you are a servant of God, he will make you a blessing. He will have
          none of his gold in the lump; he will hammer it out, and make it a
          blessing. I verily believe there are some in my congregation to whom
          God has given power to preach his name; they do not know it, perhaps,
          but God will make it known by-and-by. I would have every man look and
          see, whether God is making him do a certain thing; and when once he
          feels the impulse, let him by no means ever check it. I am somewhat of
          a believer in the doctrine of the Quakers, as to the impulses of the
          Spirit, and I fear lest I should check one of them. If a thought
          crosses my mind, "Go to such a person's house," I always like to do
          it, because I do not know but what it may be from the Spirit. I
          understand this verse to mean something like that. "I will make them a
          blessing." I will force them to do good. If I cannot make a sweet
          scent come from them in any other way, I will pound them in the mortar
          of affliction. If they have seed, and the seed cannot be scattered in
          any other way, I will send a rough wind to blow the downy seed
          everywhere. "I will make them a blessing." If you have never been made
          a blessing to any one, depend upon it you are not a child of God; for
          Jehovah says, "I will make them a blessing."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But notice, next, the personality of the blessing. "I will make
          them a blessing." "I will make each member of the church a blessing."
          Many people come up to the house of prayer, where the church
          assembles; and you say, "Well, what are you doing at such-and-such a
          place where you attend?" "Well, we are doing so-and-so." "How do you
          spell we?" "It is a plain monosyllable," say you. "Yes, but do you put
          I in we?'" "No." There are a great many people who could easily spell
          "we" without an I in it; for though they say, "We have been doing
          so-and-so," they do not say, "How much have I done? Did I do anything
          in it? Yes; this chapel has been enlarged; what did I subscribe?
          Twopence!" Of course it is done. Those who paid the money have done
          it. "We preach the gospel." Do we, indeed? "Yes, we sit in our pew and
          listen a little, and do not pray for a blessing. We have got such a
          large Sunday School." Did you ever teach in it? "We have got a very
          good working society." Did you ever go to work in it? That is not the
          way so spell "we." It is, "I will make them a blessing." When
          Jerusalem was built, every man began nearest his own house. That is
          where you must begin to build or do something. Do not let us tell a
          lie about it. If we do not have some share in the building, if we
          neither handle the trowel nor the spear, let us not talk about our
          church; for the text says, "I will make them a blessing," every one of
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But, sir, what can I do? I am nothing but a father at home; I am so
          full of business, I can only see my children a little." But in your
          business, do you ever have any servants? "No; I am a servant myself."
          You have fellow-servants? "No; I work alone." Do you work alone, then,
          and live alone, like a monk in a cell? I don't believe that. But you
          have fellow-servants at work; cannot you say a word to their
          conscience? "I don't like to intrude religion into business." Quite
          right, too; so say I; when I am at business, let it be business; when
          you are at religion, let it be religion. But do you never have an
          opportunity? Why, you cannot go into an omnibus, or a railway
          carriage, but what you can say something for Jesus Christ. I have
          found it so, and I don't believe I am different from other people.
          Cannot do anything? Cannot you put a tract in your hat, and drop it
          where you go? Cannot you speak a word to a child? Where does this man
          come from, that cannot do anything? There is a spider on the wall; but
          he taketh hold on kings' palaces, and spinneth his web to rid the
          world of noxious flies. There is a nettle in the corner of the
          churchyard; but the physician tells me it has its virtues. There is a
          tiny star in the sky; but that is noted in the chart, and the mariner
          looks at it. There is an insect under water; but it builds a rock. God
          made all these things for something; but here is a man that God made,
          and gave him nothing at all to do! I do not believe it. God never
          makes useless things; he has no superfluous workmanship. I care not
          what you are; you have somewhat to do. And oh! may God show you what
          it is, and then make you do it, by the wondrous compulsion of his
          providence and his grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But we have to notice, in the third place, the development of
          gospel blessing. " I will make them a blessing;" but it does not end
          there. "And the places round about my hill." Religion is an expansive
          thing. When it begins in the heart, at first it is like a tiny grain
          of mustard seed; but it gradually increases, and becomes a great tree,
          so that the birds of the air lodge in the branches thereof. A man
          cannot be religious to himself. "No man liveth to himself, and no man
          dieth to himself." You have heard a score of times, that if you do but
          drop a pebble in a brook, it causes a small ring at first, then
          another outside of that, and then another, and then another, till the
          influence of the pebble is perceptible over the entire bosom of the
          water. So it is when God makes his people a blessing. "I will make a
          minister a blessing to one or two; I will then make him a blessing to
          a hundred; I will then make him a blessing to thousands; and then I
          will make those thousands a blessing. I will make each one
          individually a blessing, and when I have done that, I will make all
          the places round about a blessing." "I will make them a blessing." I
          hope we shall never be satisfied, as members of Park Street, until we
          are a blessing, not only to ourselves, but to all the places round
          about our hill. What are the places round about our hill? I think they
          are, first, our agencies; secondly, our neighborhood; thirdly, the
          churches adjacent to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, there are our agencies. There is our Sabbath School; how near
          that is to our hill. I speak a great deal about this, because I want
          it to be brought into notice. I intend to preach a practical sermon
          this morning, to move some of you to come and teach in the Sabbath
          School; for there we require some suitable men, to "come up to the
          help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty."
          Therefore I mention the Sabbath School as a place very near to the
          hill; it ought to be just at the very foot of it; yea, it ought to be
          so near the hill that very many may pass from it to the church. Then
          there is our Visiting and Christian Instruction Society, which we have
          for the visiting of this neighborhood. I trust that has been made a
          blessing. God has sent among us a man who labors zealously and
          earnestly in visiting the sick. I have, as the superintendent of my
          beloved brother, the missionary, a regular account of his labors; his
          report has most highly gratified me, and I am able to bear testimony
          to the fact, that he is very sufficiently laboring around us. I want
          that society to have all you sympathy and strength. I consider him as
          a Joshua, with whom you are to go forth by hundreds to those who live
          in the neighborhood. Do you know what dark places there are? Walk down
          a street a little to the right. See the shops open on a Sunday. Some,
          thank God, that used to open them, now come and worship with us. We
          shall have more yet; for "the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness
          thereof," and why should not we have it? My brethren, as you visit the
          sick, or distribute tracts from door to door, make this your prayer --
          that his society, being one of the places round about our hill, may be
          made a blessing! Let me not forget any agency connected with this
          church. There are several more which are places round about our hill;
          and the Lord has just put it into my heart to fashion other societies,
          which shall be made a blessing to this hill, and in a little while you
          shall hear thereof. We have several brethren in this congregation to
          whom God has given a mouth of utterance; these are about to form
          themselves into a society for proclaiming the Word of God. Where God
          has so blessed his church, and made us to be so noted and named
          amongst the people, why should we not keep on? We have been brought up
          to a great pitch of fervency and love; now is the time for doing
          something. While the iron is hot, why not strike and fashion it? I
          believe we have the materials, not only for making a church here that
          shall be the glory of the Baptist Churches in London, but for making
          churches everywhere throughout the metropolis; and we have more
          schemes on hand, which, matured by sober judgment, and backed by
          prudence, shall yet make this metropolis more honored that it has been
          by the sound of the pure gospel and the proclamation of the pure Word
          of God. May God make all our agencies -- the places round about our
          hill -- a blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          But next, there is the neighborhood. I am paralyzed sometimes, when I
          think that we are of so little service to the neighborhood, though
          this is a green oasis in the midst of a great spiritual desert. Just
          at the back of us we could find you hundreds of Roman Catholics and
          men of the very worst character; and it is sad to think that we cannot
          make this place a blessing to them. It is made a great blessing to
          you, my hearers, but you do not come from this district; you come from
          anywhere and nowhere, some of you, I suppose. People say, "There is
          something doing in that chapel; look at the crowd; but we cannot get
          in!" This one thing I ask -- never come here to gratify your
          curiosity. You that are members of other congregations, just consider
          it you duty to stay at home. There are many stray sheep about. I would
          rather have them than you. Keep your own place. I do not want to rob
          other minister. Do not come here from charity. We are much obliged to
          you for your kindly intentions; but we would rather have your room
          than your company, if ye are members of other churches. We want
          sinners to come -- sinners of every sort; but do not let us have that
          sort of men whose ears are everlastingly itching for some new
          preacher; who are saying, "I want something else, I want something
          else." Oh! do, I beseech you, for God's sake, be of some good; and if
          you are running about from one place to another, you can never expect
          to be. Do ye know what is said of rolling stones? Ah! ye have heard of
          that. They "gather no moss." Now, don't be rolling stones, but keep at
          home. God, however, so help us, as to make us a blessing to the
          neighborhood! I long to see something done for the people around. We
          must open our arms to them; we must go out into the open air to them;
          we must and will preach God's gospel to them. Let, then, the people
          around listen to the word of the gospel; and may it be said, "That
          place is the cathedral of Southwark!" So it is now. Out of it goes a
          blessing; God is pouring out a blessing upon it.
        </p>
        <p>
          What else do we mean by the places round about our hill? We mean, the
          churches adjacent. I cannot but rejoice in the prosperity of many
          churches around us; but as our beloved brother, Mr. Sherman, said,
          last Thursday morning, "It is not invidious to say, that there are
          very few churches that are in a prosperous state, and that, taking the
          churches at large, they are in a deplorable condition. It is only here
          and there," said he, "that God is pouring out his Spirit; but most of
          the churches are lying, like barges at Blackfriar's Bridge when the
          tide is down -- right in the mud; and all the king's horses and all
          the king's men cannot pull them off, till the tide comes and sets them
          afloat." Who can tell, then, what good may be done by this church? If
          there is a light in this candlestick, let others come and light their
          candles by it. If there is a flame here, let the flame spread, until
          all the neighboring churches shall be lit up with the glory. Then,
          indeed, shall we be made the rejoicing of the earth; for there is
          never a revival in one spot, but it shall affect others. Who shall
          tell, then, where it shall end?
        </p>
        <p>"Fly abroad, thou mighty gospel;</p>
        <p>Win and conquer, never cease."</p>
        <p>
          And it never will cease, when God once makes the places round about
          his hill a blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second point is, that God's people are not only to be a
          blessing, but THEY ARE TO BE BLESSED. For read the second part of the
          verse. "And I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there
          shall be showers of blessing." It is somewhat singular, as a
          prognostication of the showers of blessings we hope to receive here,
          that God sent us showers on the first day of opening. If I were a
          believer in omens, I should pray, that as it rained the first day, so
          may it rain every day since. When it stops, may the chapel be shut up;
          for we only want it open so long as showers of grace continue to
          descend.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, here is sovereign mercy. Listen to these words; "I will give
          them the shower in its season." Is it not sovereign, divine mercy; for
          who can say, "I will give them showers," except God? Can the false
          prophet who walks amongst the benighted Hottentots? He says he is a
          rain-maker, and can give them showers; but can he do it? Is there an
          imperial monarch, or the most learned man on earth, who can say, "I
          will give them the showers in their season?" No; there is only one
          fist wherein all the clouds are held; there in only one hand in which
          all the channels of the mighty ocean above the firmament are
          contained; there is only one voice that can speak to the clouds, and
          bid them beget the rain. "Out of whose womb came the ice? and the
          hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?" "Who sendeth down the
          rain upon the earth? who scattereth the showers upon the green herb?
          Do not I, the Lord?" Who else could do it? Is not rain in God's power?
          and who could send it, except him? We know that Catholics pretend that
          they can get grace without getting it form God directly; for they
          believe that God puts all his grace into the pope, and then that runs
          down into smaller pipes, called cardinals and bishops, through which
          it runs into the priests; and, by turning the tap with a shilling, you
          can get as much grace as you like. But it is not so with God's grace.
          He says, "I will give them showers." Grace is the gift of God, and is
          not to be created by man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice, next, it is needed grace. "I will give them showers." What
          would the ground do without showers? You may break the clods, you may
          sow your seeds; but what can you do without the rain? Ah! you may
          prepare your barn, and sharpen your sickles; but your sickles will be
          rusted before you have any wheat, unless there are showers. They are
          needed. So is the divine blessing.
        </p>
        <p>"In vain Apollos sow the seed,</p>
        <p>And Paul may plant in vain;</p>
        <p>
          In vain you come here, in vain you labor, in vain you give you money.
        </p>
        <p>"Till God the plenteous shower bestows,</p>
        <p>And sends salvation down."</p>
        <p>
          Then, next, it is plenteous grace. "I will send them showers." It does
          not say, "I will send them drops," but "I will send them showers." "It
          seldom rains but it pours." So it is with grace. If God gives a
          blessing, he usually gives it in such a measure that there is not room
          enough to receive it. Where are we going to hold God's blessing that
          we have obtained already? I told the people on Thursday that God had
          promised us, that if we brought the tithes into the storehouse, he
          would send us such a blessing that we would not have room to hold it.
          We have tried it, and the promise has been fulfilled, as it always
          will be as long as we rely upon it. Plenteous grace! Ah! we shall want
          plenteous grace, my friends; plenteous grace to keep us humble,
          plenteous grace to make us prayerful, plenteous grace to make us holy,
          plenteous grace to make us zealous, plenteous grace to make us
          truthful, plenteous grace to preserve us through this life, and at
          last to land us in heaven. We cannot do without showers of grace. How
          many are there here that have been dry in a shower of grace? Why,
          there is a shower of grace here; but how is it that it does not fall
          on some of the people? It is because they put up the umbrella of their
          prejudice; and though they sit here, even as God's people sit, even
          when it rains, they have such a prejudice of God's Word, they do not
          want to hear it, they do not want to love it, and it runs off again.
          Nevertheless, the showers are there; and we will thank god for them
          where they do fall.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, it is seasonable grace. "I will give them the shower in its
          season." There is nothing like seasonable grace. There are fruits, you
          know, that are best in their season, and they are not good at any
          other time; and there are graces that are good in their season, but we
          do not always require them. A person vexes and irritates me; I want
          grace just at that moment to be patient; I have not got it, and I get
          angry; ten minutes after I am ever so patient; but I have not had
          grace in its season. The promise is, "I will give them the shower in
          its season." Ah! poor waiting soul, what is thy season this morning?
          Is it the season of drought? Then that is the season for showers. Is
          it a season of great heaviness and black clouds? Then that is the
          season for showers. What is your season this morning, business man?
          Lost money all the week, have you? Now is the season to ask for
          showers. It is night-time; now the dew falls. The dew does not fall in
          the day -- it falls in the night; the night of affliction, trial, and
          trouble. There stands the promise; only go and plead it. "I will give
          them the shower in its season."
        </p>
        <p>
          We have one thought more, and then we have done. Here is a varied
          blessing. "I will give thee showers of blessing." The word is in the
          plural. All kinds of blessings God will send. The rain is all of one
          kind when it comes; but grace is not all of one kind, or it does not
          produce the same effect. When God sends rain upon the church, he
          "sends showers of blessing." There are some ministers who think, that
          if there is a shower on their church, God will send a shower of work.
          Yes, but if he does, he will send a shower of comfort. Others think
          that God will send a shower of gospel truth. Yes, but if he sends
          that, he will send a shower of gospel holiness. For all God's
          blessings go together. They are like the sweet sister graces that
          danced hand in hand. God sends showers of blessings. If he gives
          comforting grace, he will also give converting grace; if he makes the
          trumpet blow for the bankrupt sinner, he will also make it sound a
          shout of joy for the sinner that is pardoned and forgiven. He will
          send "showers of blessing."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, then, there is a promise in that Bible. We have tried to explain
          and enlarge upon it. What shall we do with it?
        </p>
        <p>"In that book there hidden lies</p>
        <p>A pearl of price unknown."</p>
        <p>
          Well, we have examined this rich promise; we as a church are looking
          at it; we are saying, "Is that ours?" I think most of the members will
          say, "It is; for God has poured out upon us showers of blessing in
          their season." Well, then, if the promise is ours, the precept is
          ours, as much as the promise. Ought we not to ask God to continue to
          make us a blessing? Some say I did so-and-so when I was a young man;
          but supposing you are fifty, you are not an old man now. Is there not
          something you can do? It is all very well to talk about what you have
          done; but what are you doing now? I know what it is with some of you;
          you shined brightly once, but your candle has not been snuffed lately,
          and so it does not shine so well. May God take away some of the
          worldly cares, and snuff the candles a little! You know there were
          snuffers and snuffer-trays provided in the temple for all the candles,
          but no extinguishers; and if there should be a poor candle here this
          morning, with a terrific snuff, that has not given a light for a long
          while, you will have no extinguisher from me, but I hope you will
          always have a snuffing. I thought the first time when I came to the
          lamps this morning it would be to snuff them. That has been the
          intention of my sermon -- to snuff you a little -- to set you to work
          for Jesus Christ. O Zion, shake thyself from the dust! O Christian,
          raise thyself from thy slumbers! Warrior, put on thy armor! Soldier,
          grasp thy sword! The captain sounds the alarm of war. O sluggard! why
          sleepest thou? O heir of heaven, has not Jesus done so much for thee,
          that thou shouldst live to him? O beloved brethren, purchased with
          redeeming mercies, girt about with loving-kindness and with
          tenderness,
        </p>
        <p>"Now for a shout of sacred joy."</p>
        <p>
          and after that, to the battle! The little seed has grown to this; who
          knoweth what it shall be? Only let us together strive, without
          variance. Let us labor for Jesus. Never did men have so fair an
          opportunity, for the last hundred years. "There is a tide that, taken
          at the flood, leads on to fortune." Shall you take it at the flood?
          Over the bar, at the harbor's mouth! O ship of heaven, let thy sails
          be out; let not thy canvas be furled; and the wind will blow us across
          the seas of difficulty that lie before us. O! that the latter day
          might have its dawning even in this despised habitation! O my God!
          from this place cause the first wave to spring, which shall move
          another, and then another, till the last great wave shall sweep over
          the sands of time, and dash against the rocks of eternity, echoing as
          it falls, "Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! the Lord God Omnipotent
          reigneth!"
