        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.398)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, June the 30th, 1861 by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by
          the word of God, which liveth and abideth for over. For all flesh is
          as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass
          withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: but the word of the
          Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is
          preached unto you." -- 1 Peter 1:23-25.
        </p>
        <p>
          PETER HAD earnestly exhorted the scattered saints to love each other
          "with a pure heart fervently," and he wised fetches his argument, not
          from the law, nor from nature, nor from philosophy, but from that high
          and divine nature which God hath implanted in his people. Love each
          other with a pure heart fervently, for ye have been born again, not
          with corruptible seed, but with incorruptible. I might compare Peter
          to some judicious tutor of the princes of the blood, who labors to
          beget and foster a kingly spirit in the king's sons. From their
          position and descent he brings argument for a dignified behavior: "Do
          not act foolishly, it would be unseemly in a king; speak not so,
          ribald language would be unbecoming to a prince; indulge not in these
          vanities, such folk would be degrading to the illustrious of the
          earth." So looking upon God's people, as being heirs of glory, princes
          of the blood royal, descendants of the King of kings, earth's true and
          only real aristocracy, Peter saith to them, "See that ye love one
          another, because of your noble birth, being born of incorruptible
          seed; because of your pedigree, being descended from God, the Creator
          of all things; and because of your immortal destiny, for you shall
          never pass away, though the glory of flesh shall fade, and even its
          very existence shall cease. I think it would be well, my brethren, if
          in a spirit of humility, you and I recognized the free dignity of our
          regenerated nature, and lived up to it. Oh! what is a Christian? If
          you compare him with a king, he adds priestly sanctity to royal
          dignity. The king's royalty often lieth only in his crown, but with a
          Christian it is infused into his very nature. Compare him with a
          senator, with a mighty warrior, or a master of wisdom, and he far
          excelleth them all. He is of another race than those who are only born
          of woman. He is as much above his fellows through his new birth, as
          man is above the beast that perisheth. As humanity towers in dignity
          high above the grovelling brute, so doth the regenerate man o'ertop
          the best of human once-born mortals. Surely he ought to bear himself,
          and act as one who is not of the multitude, one who has been chosen
          out of the world, distinguished by sovereign grace, written among "the
          peculiar people," and who therefore cannot grovel as others grovel,
          nor own think as others think. Let the dignity of your nature, and the
          brightness of your prospects, O believers in Christ, make you cleave
          to holiness, and hate the very appearance of evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the text there are three points which, I think, will well repay our
          very serious attention. The apostle evidently speaks of two lives, the
          one, the life which is natural, born, matured, and perfected only by
          the flesh; the other, the life which is spiritual, born of the spirit,
          in antagonism with the flesh, surviving it and triumphantly rising to
          celestial glory. Now, in speaking of these two lives, the apostle
          brings out, first of all, a comparison and a contrast between the two
          births, for each life hath its own birth. Then he brings out a
          contrast between the manifest existence of the two lives; and then
          lastly, between the glory of the two lives, for each life hath its
          glory, but the glory of the spiritual life far excelleth the glory of
          the natural.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, the apostle Peter draws A COMPARISON AND CONTRAST
          BETWEEN THE TWO BIRTHS WHICH ARE THE DOORWAYS OF THE TWO LIVES.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we have said that every life is prefaced by rib birth. It is so
          naturally -- we are born; it is so spiritually -- we are born again.
          Except a man be born he cannot enter into the kingdom of nature;
          except a man be born again he cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.
          Birth is the lowly gateway by which we enter into life, and the lofty
          portal by which we are admitted into the kingdom of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now there is a comparison between the two births; in both there is a
          solemn mystery. I have read, I have even heard sermons, in which the
          minister seemed to me rather to play the part of a physician than of a
          divine, exposing and explaining the mysteries of our natural birth,
          across which both God in nature and the good man in delicacy must ever
          throw a veil. It is a hallowed thing to be born, as surely as it is a
          solemnity to die. Birthdays and deathdays are days of awe. Birth is
          very frequently used in Scripture as one of the most graphic pictures
          of solemn mystery. Into this, no man may idly pry, and Science
          herself, when she has dared to look within the veil, has turned back
          awestricken, from those "lower parts of the earth" in which David
          declares us to be "curiously wrought." Greater still is the mystery of
          the new birth. That we are born again we know, but how, we cannot
          tell. How the Spirit of God openeth upon the mind, how it is that he
          renews the faculties and imparts fresh desires by which those
          faculties shout be guided, how it is that he enlightens the
          understanding, subdues the will, purifies the intellect, reverses the
          desire, lifts up the hope, and puts the fear in its right channel, we
          cannot tell, we must leave this among the secret things which belong
          unto God. The Holy Ghost worketh, but the manner of his operation is
          not to be comprehended. "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou
          hearest the sound thereof, but thou canst not tell whence it cometh
          nor whither it goeth, so is every one that is born of the Spirit." Oh!
          my hearers, have you felt this mystery? Explain it you cannot, nor can
          I, nor ought we to attempt an explanation, for where God is silent it
          is perhaps profanity, and certainly impertinence for us to speak. The
          two births then are alike in their solemn mystery.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, then, we know this much of our natural birth, that in birth there
          is a life created. Yonder infant is beginning his being, another
          creature has lifted up its feeble cry to heaven, another mortal has
          come to tread this theater of action, to breathe, to live, to die. And
          so in the new birth, there is an absolute creation, we are made new
          creatures in Christ Jesus, there is another spirit born to pray, to
          believe in Christ to love him here, and to rejoice in him hereafter.
          As no one doubts but that birth is the manifestation of a creation, so
          let no one doubt but that regeneration is the manifestation of a
          creation of God, as divine, as much beyond the power of man, as the
          creation of the human mind itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we know also that in birth there is not only a life created, but a
          life communicated. Each child hath its parent. The very flowers trace
          themselves back to a parental seed. We spring, not from our own loins,
          we are not self-created, there is a life communicated. We have links
          between the son and the father, and back till we come to father Adam.
          So in regeneration there is a life, not merely created, but
          communicated, even the very life of God, who hath begotten us again
          unto a lively hope. As truly as the father lives in the child, so
          truly doth the every life and nature of God live in every Swiss born
          heir of heaven. We are as certainly partakers of the divine nature by
          the new birth as we were partakers of the human nature by the old
          birth: so far the comparison holds good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Equally certain is it, that in the natural and in the spiritual birth
          there is life entailed. There are certain propensities which we
          inherit, from which this side the grave we shall not be free. Our
          temperament brave or gay, our passions slow or hasty, our propensities
          sensual or aspiring, our faculties contracted or expansive are to a
          great measure an entailed inheritance as much linked to our future
          portion as are wings to an eagle or a shed to a snail. No doubt much
          of our history is born within us, and the infant hath within himself
          germ of his future actions. If I may so speak, there are those
          qualities, that composition and disposition of nature which will
          naturally, if circumstances assist, work out in full development
          certain results. So is it with us when we are born again: a heavenly
          nature is entailed upon us. We cannot but be holy; the new nature
          cannot but serve God, it must, it will pant to be neater to Christ,
          and more like him. It hath aspirations which time cannot satisfy,
          desires which earth cannot surfeit, longings which heaven itself alone
          can gratify. There is a life entailed upon us in the moment when we
          pass from death unto life in the solemn mystery of regeneration.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the old birth, and in the new birth also, a life is also brought
          forth which is complete in all its parts and only needs to be
          developed. Yon infant in the oracle shall never have another limb, or
          another eye. Its limb hardens, it grows, it gathers strength, its
          brain also enlarges its sphere, but the faculties are there already,
          they are not implanted afterward. Verily, so is it in the new-born
          child of God. Faith love, hope, and every grace are there the moment
          he believes in Christ. They grow tis true, but they were all there in
          the instant of regeneration. The babe in grace who is just now born to
          God, hath every part of the spiritual man, it only needs to grow till
          he becomes a perfect man in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus far, you perceive, that the two births have a very close
          resemblance to one another. I pray you, now that I have introduced the
          subject, do not turn from it till you have thought of the reality of
          the new birth, as you must of the reality of the first. You were not
          here if you had not been born, you shall never he in heaven unless you
          are born again, you had not been able to-day to hear, or think, or
          see, if you had not been born. You are not to-day able to pray or to
          believe in Christ, unless you are born again. The enjoyments of this
          world you could never have known, if it had not been for birth, the
          saved delight of God you do not know to-day, and you never shall know
          unless you be born again. Do not look upon regeneration as though it
          were a fancy or a fiction. I do assure you, my hearers, it is as real
          as is the natural birth; for spiritual is not the same as fanciful,
          but the spiritual is as real as even nature itself. To be born again
          is as much a matter of fact to be realised, to be discerned, and to be
          discovered, as to be born for the first time into this vale of tears.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now comes the contrast -- "being born not of corruptible seed, but
          of incorruptible." Herein lieth the contrast between the two. That
          child which has just experienced the first birth has been made
          partaker of corruptible seed. The depravity of his parent lieth
          sleeping within him. Could he speak, he might say so. David did, --
          "Behold, I was born in sin and shaped in iniquity." He receiveth the
          evil virus which was first infused into us by the fall. Not so,
          however, is it when we are born again. No sin is then sown within us.
          This sin of the old flesh remains but there is no sin in the newborn
          nature, it cannot sin because it is born of God himself; it is as
          impossible for that new nature to sin as for the Deity itself to be
          defiled. It is a part of the divine nature -- a spark struck off from
          the rental orb of light and life, and dead or dark it cannot be,
          because it would be contrary to its nature to be either the one or the
          other. Oh, what a difference! In the first birth -- born to sin, in
          the next -- born to holiness; in the first -- partakers of corruption,
          in the next -- heirs of incorruption in the first -- depravity, in the
          second -- perfection. What broader contrast could there be! What
          should make us more thoroughly long for this new birth than the
          glorious fact that we are by its means consciously lifted up from the
          ruins of the fall, and made perfect in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the birth of the flesh too, what dread uncertainties attend it!
          What shall become of yonder child? It may live to curse the day in
          which it was born, as did the poor troubled patriarch of old. What
          sorrow may drive its ploughshares along its yet unwrinkled brow? Ah!
          child, thou shalt be gray-headed one day, but ere that comes thou
          shalt have felt a thousand storms beating about thine heart and head.
          Little dost thou know thy destiny, but assuredly thou shalt be of few
          days and full of trouble. Not so in the regeneration, we shall never
          rue the day in which we are born again, never look back upon that with
          sorrow, but always with ecstasy and delight, for we are ushered then,
          not into the hovel of humanity, but into the palace of Deity. We are
          not then born into a valley of tears, but into an inheritance in the
          Canaan of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          That child too, so fondly the object of its mother's love may one day
          vex or break its parent's heart. Are not children doubtful mercies?
          Bring they not with them sad forebodings of what they yet may be? Alas
          for the pretty prattlers who have grown up to be convicted criminals!
          But blessed be God, they who are sons of God shalt never break their
          father's heart. Their new nature shall be worthy of Him that gave it
          existence. They shall live to honor him, they shall die to be
          perfectly like him, and shall rise to glorify him for ever. We have
          sometimes said that God her a very naughty family, but surely the
          naughtiness is in the old Adam nature, and not in Jehovah's gracious
          work. There is no naughtiness in the new creature. In that new
          creature there is no taint of sin. God's child as descended from his
          loins, can never sin. The new nature which God hath put into it doth
          never wander, death never transgress. It were not the new nature if it
          did, it were not God's offspring, if it all, for that which cometh of
          God is like Him, holy, pure, and undefiled, separate from sin. In this
          indeed lieth a strange difference. We know not to what that first
          nature tendeth, who can tell what bitterness it shall bring forth? But
          we know whither the new nature tendeth, for it ripeneth towards the
          perfect image of Him that created us in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps without my endeavoring to enlarge further you could yourselves
          muse upon this theme. It remains but for me upon this first head to
          return with earnestness to that point upon which I fear the greatest
          difficulty lies -- the realisation of this birth -- for we repeat it,
          we are speaking of a fact and not a dream, a reality and not metaphor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some tell you that the child is regenerated when the drops fall from
          priestly fingers. My brethren, a more fond and foul delusion was never
          perpetrated upon earth. Rome itself did never discourse upon a wilder
          error than this. Dream not of it. O think not that it is so. "Except a
          man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God." The Lord himself
          addresses this sentence not to an infant but to a fullgrown man.
          Nicodemus -- one who was circumcised according to the Jewish law, but
          who yet, though he had received the seal of that covenant, needed as a
          man to be born again. We all without exception must know this change.
          Your life may have been moral, but it will not suffice. The most
          moralised human nature can never attain to the divine nature. You may
          cleanse and purge the fruit of the first birth, but still the
          inevitable decree demands the second birth for all. If from your youth
          up you have been so trained that you have scarcely known the vices of
          the people; so tended, hedged in, and kept from contamination with
          sin, that you have not known temptation, yet you must be born again,
          and this birth, I repeat it, must be as much a, fact, as true, as
          real, and as sure as was that first birth in which you were ushered
          into this world. What do you know of this, my hearer? What do you know
          of this? It is a thing you cannot perform for yourself. You cannot
          regenerate yourself any more than you could cause yourself to be born.
          It is a matter out of the range of human power it is supernatural, it
          is divine. Have you partaken of it? Do not merely look back to some
          hour in which you felt mysterious feelings. No, but judge by the
          fruits. Have your fears and hopes changed places? Do you love the
          things you once hated, and hate the things you once loved? Are old
          things passed away? Have all things become new? Christian brethren, I
          put the query to you as well as to the rest. It is so easy to be
          deceived here. We shall find it no trifle to be born again. It is a
          solemn, it is a momentous matter. Let us not take it for granted
          because we have given up drunkenness that we are therefore converted,
          because we do not swear, because now we attend a place of worship.
          There is more wanted than this. Do not think you are saved because you
          have some good feelings, some good thoughts. There is more required
          than this -- ye must be born again. And oh, Christian parents, train
          up your children in the fear of God, but do not be content with your
          training -- they must be born again. And Christian husbands, and
          Christian wives, be not satisfied with merely praying that your
          partner's characters may become moral and honest; ask that something
          may be done for them which they cannot do for themselves. And you,
          philanthropists, who think that building new cottages, using fresh
          plans for drainage, teaching the poor economy, will be the means of
          emparadising the world; I pray you go further than such schemes as
          these. You must change the heart. It is but little use to alter the
          outward till you have renewed the inward. It is not the bark of the
          tree that is wrong so much as the sap. It is not the skin -- it is the
          blood -- nay, deeper than the blood -- the very essence of the nature
          must be altered. The man must be as much made anew as if he never had
          an existence. Nay, a greater miracle than this, these most be two
          miracles combined -- the old things must pass away, and new things
          must be cleated by the Holy Ghost. I tremble while I speak upon this
          theme, lest I, your minister, should know in theory but not in
          experience a mystery so sublime as this. What shall we do but together
          offer a prayer like this -- "O God, if we be not regenerate let us
          know the worst of our state, and if we be, let us never cease to plead
          and pray for others till they too shall be renewed by the Holy Ghost."
          That which is born of the flesh is flesh; its best endeavors go no
          higher than flesh, and the flesh cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
          That which is born of the Spirit alone is spirit, and only the Spirit
          can enter into spiritual things, inherit the spiritual portion which
          God has provided for his people. I have thus passed through the
          somewhat delicate and extremely difficult task of bringing out the
          apostle's meaning -- the comparison between the two births, which are
          the door-steps of the two lives.

          II. I now come to the second point -- THE MANIFEST DIFFERENCE OF THE
          TWO LIVES RESULTING FROM THE TWO BIRTHS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, look around you. To what shall we compare this immense
          assembly? As I look upon the many colors, and the varied faces, even
          if it were not in the text, I am certain that a meadow thickly
          besprinkled with flowers would rise up before my imagination. Look at
          the mass of people gathered together, and doth it not remind you of
          the field in its full summer glory, when the king-cups, daisies,
          cloves, and grass blooms, are sunning themselves in countless
          varieties of beauty? Ay, but not only in the poet's eye is there a
          resemblance, but in the mind of God, and in the experience of man.
          "All flesh is grass;" all that is born of the first birth, if we
          compare it to grass in poetry, may be compared to it also in fact,
          from the frailty and shortness of its existence. We passed the meadows
          but a month ago, and they were moved in verdant billows by the breeze
          like waves of ocean when they are softly stirred with the evening
          gale. We looked upon the whole scene, and it was exceeding fair. We
          passed it yesterday and the mower's scythe had cut asunder beauty from
          its roots, and there it lay in heaps ready to be gathered when fully
          dry. The grass is cut down so soon, but if it stood, it would wither,
          and handfuls of dust would take the place of the green and coloured
          leaves, for doth not the grass wither and the flowers thereof fall
          avidly? Such is mortal life. We are not living, brethren, we are
          dying. We begin to breathe, and we make the number of our breaths the
          less. Our pulse is "beating funeral marches to the tomb." The sand
          runs down from the upper bulb of the glass, and it is emptying fast.
          Death is written upon every brow. Man, know that thou art mortal, for
          thou all art born of woman. Thy first birth gave thee life and death
          together. Thou dost only breathe awhile to keep thee from the jaws of
          the grave, when that breath is spent, into the dust of death thou
          tallest there and then. Everything, especially during the last few
          weeks, has taught us the frailty of human life. The senator who guided
          the affairs of nations and beheld the rise of a free kingdom, lived
          not to see it fully organized, but expired with many a weighty secret
          unspoken. The judge who has sentenced many, receives his own sentence
          at the last. From this earth, since last we met together, master-minds
          have been taken away, and even the monarch on his throne has owned the
          monarchy of Death. How many of the masses too have fallen, and have
          been carried to their long home! There have been funerals, some of
          them funerals of honored men who perished doing their Master's will in
          saving human life, and alas, there have been unhonoured burials of
          others who did the will of Satan, and have inherited the flame. There
          have been deaths abundant on the right hand and on the left, and well
          have Peter's words been proved -- "All flesh is grass, and all the
          glory thereof is as the flower of the field; the grass withereth, and
          the flower thereof falleth away."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, brethren, let us look at the other side of the question. The
          second birth gave us a nature too -- Will that also die? Is it like
          grass, and its glory like the flower of the field? No, most certainly
          not. The first nature dies because the seed was corruptible. But the
          second nature was not created by corruptible seed, but with
          incorruptible, even the Word of God into which God has infused his own
          life, so that it quickens us by the Spirit. That incorruptible word
          produces an incorruptible life. The child of God in his new nature
          never dies. He can never see death. Christ, who is in him, is the
          immortality and the life. "He that liveth and believeth in Christ
          shall never die." And yet again, "Though he were dead yet shall he
          live." When we are born again, we receive a nature which is
          indestructible by accident, which is not to be consumed by fire,
          drowned by riveter, weakened by old age, or smitten down by blast of
          pestilence; a nature invulnerable to poison; a nature which shall not
          be destroyed by the sword; a nature which can never die till the God
          that gave it should himself expire and Deity die out. Think of this,
          my brethren, and surely you will find reason to rejoice. But perhaps,
          you ask me, why it is the new nature can never die? I am sure the text
          teaches it never can. "But not of corruptible seed, but of
          incorruptible, even of the Word of God which liveth and abideth for
          ever." If that does not teach that the spiritual nature which is given
          us by the new birth never dies, it does not teach anything at all; and
          if it does teach that, where goes Arminian doctrine of falling from
          grace; where go your Arminian fears of perishing after all? But let me
          show you why it is that this nature never dies. First, from the fact
          of its nature. It is in itself incorruptible. Every like produces in
          like. Man, dying man, produces dying man; God, eternal God, produces
          everlasting nature when he begets again unto a lively hope, by the
          resurrection of Christ from the dead. "As is the earthy, such are they
          also that are earthy:" the earthy dies, we who are earthy die too. "As
          is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly," the heavenly
          never dies, and if we are born as the heavenly, the heavenly nature
          dieth neither. "The first Adam was made a living soul." We are made
          living souls too, but that soul at last is separated from the body.
          "The second Adam is made a quickening spirit," and that spirit is not
          only alive but quickening. Do you not perceive it? -- the first was a
          quickened soul -- quickened, receiving life full a season; the second
          is a quickening spirit, giving out life, rather than receiving it;
          like that angel whom some poet pictures, who perpetually shot forth
          sparklers of fire, having within himself an undying flame, the
          fountain of perpetual floods of light and heat. So is it with the new
          nature within us, it is not merely a quickened thing which may die,
          but a quickening thing which cannot die, being Snide like unto Christ
          the quickening Spirit. But then, more than this, the new nature cannot
          die, because the Holy Spirit perpetually supplies it with life. "He
          giveth more grace" -- grace upon grace. You know the apostle puts it
          thus: "If when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death
          of his Son, much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life."
          Is not the Holy Spirit the divine agent by whom the life of Christ is
          infused into us? Now, the life-floods which the Holy Spirit sends into
          us, co-work with the immortality of the new-born spirit, and so doubly
          preserve the eternity of our bliss. But then, again, we are in vital
          union with Christ, and to suppose that the new nature could die out,
          were to imagine that a member of Christ would die, that a finger, a
          hand, an arm, could rot from the person of Jesus, that he could be
          maimed and divided. Doth not the apostle say, "Is Christ divided?" And
          was it not written, "Not a bone of him shall be broken?" and how were
          this true, if we were broken from him, or rolled from his body? My
          brethren, we receive the divine sap through Christ the stem that
          divine sap keeps us alive but more the very fact that we are joined to
          Christ preserves our life, "Because I live ye shall live also." The
          new life cannot die, because God is pledged to keep it alive. "I give
          unto my sheep eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall
          any pluck them out of my hand." "My Father which gave them me is
          greater than all, and none shall pluck them out of my Father's hand."
          And yet again, "The water which I shall give him shall be in him a
          well of water, springing up unto everlasting life." And yet again, "He
          that believeth in me shall never hunger and never thirst." And so
          might we repeat multitudes of passages where the divine promise
          engages omnipotence and divine wisdom, to preserve the new life. So
          then, let us gather these all up in one. As a man born of the flesh, I
          shall die, as a new man born of the Spirit, I shall never die. Thou. O
          flesh, the offspring of flesh thou shalt see corruption. Thou, O
          spirit, new-created spirit, offspring of the Lord corruption thou
          shalt never see. With our glorious Covenant Head we may exclaim "Thou
          wilt not leave my soul in hell, nor wilt thou suffer thine holy one to
          see corruption." I shall die, yet never die. My life shall flee, yet
          never flee. I shall pass away, and yet abide; I shall be carried to
          the tomb, and yet, soaring upward, the tomb can ne'er contain the
          quickened Spirit. Oh, children of God, I know not any subject that
          ought more thoroughly to lift you out of yourselves than this. Now let
          the divine nature live in you; come, put down the animal for a moment,
          put down the mere mental faculty; let the living spark blaze up; come,
          let the divine element, the newborn nature that God has given to you,
          let that now speak, and let its voice be praise; let it look up and
          let it breathe its own atmosphere, the heaven of God, in which it
          shall shortly rejoice. O God, our Father, help us to walk not after
          the flesh, but after the Spirit, seeing that we have by thine own self
          been quickened to an immortal life.
        </p>

          III. I now come to the last, and perhaps the most interesting point of
          all. THE GLORY OF THE TWO NATURES IS CONTRASTED. Every nature has its
          glory. Brethren, look at the field again. There is not only the grass
          but there is the flower which is the glory of the field. Sometimes
          many coloured hues begem the pastures with beauty. Now, the painted
          flower is the glory of the verdant field. It conies up later than the
          grass, and it dies sooner, for the grass is up a long while before the
          flower blooms, and when the flower is dead, the stalk of the grass
          still retains vitality. It is precisely so with us. Our nature has its
          glory, but that glory does not arrive for years. The babe has not yet
          the glory of full manhood, and when that glory does come, it dies
          before our nature dies, for "they that look out of the windows are
          darkened, the grinders cease because they are few." The man loses his
          glory and becomes a tottering imbecile before life becomes extinct.
          The flower comes up last and dies first, our glory comes last and dies
          first, too. O flesh! O flesh! what contempt is passed upon thee! Thy
          very existence is frail and feeble, but thy glory more frail and
          feeble still. It grows but late and then it dies, alas how soon! But
          what is the glory of the flesh? Give me your attention for a moment
          while I tell you briefly. In some, the glory of the flesh is BEAUTY.
          Their face is fair to look upon, and as the handiwork of the Great
          Worker, it should be admired. When a person becometh vain of it,
          beauty becomes shame; but to have well-proportioned features is,
          doubtless, no mean endowment. There is a glory in the beauty of the
          flesh, but how late it is developed, and how soon it fades! How soon
          do the cheeks become hollow! how frequently does the complexion grow
          sallow, and the bright eyes are dimmed, and the comely visage is
          marred! A part, too, of the glory of the flesh is physical strength.
          To be a strong man, to have the bones well set and the muscles well
          braced, -- to have good muscular vigor is no small thing. Many men
          take delight in the legs of a man, and in the strength of his arm.
          Well, as God made him, he is a wonderful creature, and twere wrong for
          us not to admire the masterpiece of God. But how late does muscular
          strength arrive! There are the days of infancy, and there are the days
          of youth, when as yet the strong man is but feeble; and then, when he
          has had his little hey-day of strength, how doth the stalwart frame
          begin to rock and reel! and the rotting teeth and the whitened hair
          show that death has begun to claim the heriot clay, and will soon take
          possession of it for himself "The glory thereof falleth away." To
          others, the glory of the flesh lies rather in the mind. They have
          eloquence, they can so speak as to enchant the ears of the multitude.
          The bees of eloquence have made their hives between the lips of the
          orator, and honey distils with every word. Yes, but how late is this a
          coming! How many years before the child speaks articulately, and
          before the young man is able to deliver himself with courage! And
          then, how soon it goes! -- till, mumbling from between his toothless
          jaws, the poor man would speak the words of wisdom, but the lips of
          age deny him utterance. Or, let the glory be wisdom. There is a man
          whose glory is his masterly power over others. He can foresee and look
          further than other men, he can match craft by craft: he is so wise
          that his fellows put confidence in him. This is the glory of the
          flesh; how late is it in coming! -- from the puking child, what a
          distance up to the wise man! And then how soon it is gone! How often,
          while yet the man himself in his flesh is in vigor has the mind strewn
          symptoms of decay! Well, take what ye will to be the glory of the
          flesh, I will still pronounce over it "Vanity of vanities, all is
          vanity." If the flesh be frail, the glory of the flesh is frailer
          still, if the grass wither, certainly the flower of the grass
          withereth before it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But is this true of the new nature? Brethren, is this true of that
          which was implanted at the second birth? I have just shown you, I
          think, that the existence of the new nature is eternal, because it was
          not born of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible. I have tried to
          show that it can never perish and can never die. But your unbelief
          suggests, "Perhaps its glory may." No, its glory never can. And what
          is the glory of the new-born nature? Why, its glory first of all is
          beauty. But what is its beauty? It is to be like the Lord Jesus. We
          are, when we shall see him as he is, to be like him. But that beauty
          shall never fade, eternity itself shall not hollow the cheeks of this
          seraphic comeliness, nor dim the brilliant eye of this celestial
          radiance. We shall be like Christ, but the likeness shall ne'er be
          marred by time, nor consumed by decay. I said just now that the glory
          of the flesh consisted sometimes in its strength, so does the glory of
          the Spirit consist in its vigor, but then it is a force that never
          shall be expended. The strength of the new-born nature is the Holy
          Ghost himself, and while Deity remains omnipotent, our new nature
          shall go on increasing in vigor till we come first to the stature of
          perfect men in Christ Jesus, and next come to be glorified men
          standing before his throne. The flower of the new nature you cannot
          see much of yet, you see through a glass darkly. That flower of glory
          consists perhaps, too, in eloquence. "Eloquence," say you, "how can
          that be?" I said the glory of the old nature might be eloquence, so
          with the new, but this is the eloquence -- "Abba Father." This is an
          eloquence you can use now. It is one which when you cannot speak a
          word which might move an audience, shall still remain upon your tongue
          to move the courts of heaven. You shall be able to say, "Abba Father,"
          in the very pangs of death, and waking from your beds of dust and
          silent clay, more eloquent still you shall cry, "Hallelujah," you
          shall join the eternal chorus, swell the divine symphony of cherubim
          and seraphim, and through eternity your glory shall never part awry.
          And then, if wisdom be glory, your wisdom, the wisdom which you
          inherit in the new nature, which is none other than Christ's who is
          made of God unto us, wisdom shall never fade, in fact it shall grow,
          for there you shall know even as you are known. While here you see
          through a glass darkly, there you shall see face to face. You sip the
          brook to-day, you shall bathe in the ocean tomorrow; you see afar off
          now, you shall lie in the arms of wisdom by-and-bye; for the glory of
          the Spirit never dies, but throughout eternity expanding, enlarging,
          blazing, gloryfying itself through God, it shall go on never, never to
          fail. Brethren, whatever it may be which you are expecting as the
          glory of your new nature, you have not yet an idea of what it will be.
          "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, the things which God hath prepared
          for them that love him." But though he hath revealed them unto us by
          his Spirit, yet, I fear we have not fully learned them. However, we
          will say of this glory, whatever it may be, it is incorruptible,
          undefiled, and it fadeth not away. The only question we have to ask,
          and with that we wish, is -- are we born again? Brethren, it is
          impossible for you to possess the existence of the new life without
          the new birth, and the glory of the new birth you cannot know without
          the new heart. I say -- are you born again? Do not stand up and say,
          "I am a Churchman, I was baptized and confirmed." That you may be, and
          yet not be born again. Do not say, "I am a Baptist, I have professed
          my faith and was immersed." That you may be, and not be born again Do
          not any, "I am of Christian parents." That you may be, and yet be an
          heir of wrath, even as others. Are you born again be Oh! souls, may
          God the Holy Ghost reveal Christ to you, and when you come to see
          Christ with the tearful eyes of a penitential faith, then be it known
          unto you that you are born again and that you have passed from death
          unto life, "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, he that
          believeth not shall be damned." God help you to believe!
