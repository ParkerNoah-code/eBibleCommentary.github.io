<p align="justify">TITLE. <b>A Song and Psalm for the Sons of Korah</b>. A 
    song for joyfulness and a Psalm for reverence. Alas! every song is not a 
    Psalm, for poets are not all Heaven born, and every Psalm is not a song, for 
    in coming before God we have to utter mournful confessions as well as 
    exulting praises. The Sons of Korah were happy in having so large a 
    selection of songs; the worship where such a variety of music was used could 
    not become monotonous, but must have given widest scope for all the sacred 
    passions of gracious souls.</p>
<p align="justify">SUBJECT AND DIVISION. It would be vain to attribute this 
    song to any one event of Jewish history. Its author and date are unknown. It 
    records the withdrawal of certain confederate kings from Jerusalem, their 
    courage failing them before striking a blow. The mention of the ships of 
    Tarshish may allow us to conjecture that the Psalm was written in connection 
    with the overthrow of Ammon, Moab, and Edom in the reign of Jehoshaphat. If 
    the reader will turn to 2 Chronicles 20, and note especially 2 Chronicles 
    20:19,25,36, he will probably accept the suggestion. </p>
<p align="justify">Verses 1-3, are in honor of the Lord and the city 
    dedicated to his worship. </p>
<p align="justify">From Verses 4-8 the song records the confusion of Zion's 
    foes, ascribing all the praise to God.</p>
<p align="justify">Verses 9-11 extolling Zion, and avowing Jehovah to be her 
    God for evermore.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. Great is the Lord.</p></b> How great Jehovah is, 
    essentially none can conceive; but we can all see that he is great in the 
    deliverance of his people, great in their esteem who are delivered, and 
    great in the hearts of those enemies whom he scatters by their own fears.
<p align="justify">Instead of the mad cry of Ephesus, "Great is Diana," we 
    bear the reasonable, demonstrable, self-evident testimony, "Great is 
    Jehovah." There is none great in the church but the Lord. Jesus is "the 
    great Shepherd," he is "a Savior, and a great one," our great God and 
    Savior, our great High Priest; his Father has divided him a portion with the 
    great, and his name shall be great unto the ends of the earth. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And greatly to be praised.</p></b> <i>According to his nature 
    should his worship be; it cannot be too constant, too laudatory, too 
    earnest, too reverential, too sublime.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">In the city of our God.</p></b> He is great there, and should 
    be greatly praised there. If all the world beside renounced Jehovah's 
    worship, the chosen people in his favored city should continue to adore him, 
    for in their midst and on their behalf his glorious power has been so 
    manifestly revealed. In the church the Lord is to be extolled though all the 
    nations rage against him. 
<p align="justify">Jerusalem was the peculiar abode of the God of Israel, 
    the seat of the theocratic government, and the center of prescribed 
    worship—even thus is the church the place of divine manifestation. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">In the mountain of his holiness.</p></b> Where his holy 
    temple, his holy priests, and his holy sacrifices might continually be seen.
    <i>Zion </i>was a mount, and as it was the most renowned part of the city, 
    it is mentioned as a synonym for the city itself. Just so, the <i>church </i>
    of God is a mount for elevation and for conspicuousness, and it should be 
    adorned with holiness, her sons being partakers of the holiness of God. Only 
    by holy men can the Lord be fittingly praised, and they should be 
    incessantly occupied with his worship.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. Beautiful for situation. </p></b>Jerusalem was so 
    naturally, she was styled <i>the Queen of the East</i>. Just so, the church 
    is so spiritually, being placed near God's heart, within the mountain of his 
    power, upon the hills of his faithfulness, in the center of providential 
    operations. 
<p align="justify">The <i>elevation </i>of the church is her beauty. The 
    more she is above the world the fairer she is. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion. </p></b>Jerusalem 
    was the world's star; whatever light lingered on earth was borrowed from the 
    oracles preserved by Israel. An ardent Israelite would esteem the holy city 
    as the eye of the nations, the most precious pearl of all lands. Certainly 
    the church of God, though despised by men, is the true joy and hope of the 
    world. 
<b>
<p align="justify">On the sides of the north, the city of the great King.</p></b> 
    Either meaning that Jerusalem was in the northern extremity of Judah, or it 
    may denote that part of the city that lay to the north of Mount Zion. It was 
    the glory of Jerusalem to be God's city, the place of his regal dwelling, 
    and it is the joy of the church that God is in her midst. 
<p align="justify">The great God is the great King of the church, and for 
    her sake he rules all the nations. The people among whom the Lord deigns to 
    dwell are privileged above all others; the lines have fallen unto them in 
    pleasant places, and they have a goodly heritage. We who dwell in Great 
    Britain in the sides of the north, have this for our chief glory, that the 
    Lord is known in our land, and the abode of his love is among us.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. God is known in her palaces for a refuge. </p></b>We 
    worship no unknown God. We know him as our refuge in distress, we delight in 
    him as such, and run to him in every time of need. We know nothing else as 
    our refuge. Though we are made kings, and our houses are palaces—yet we have 
    no confidence in ourselves, but trust in the Lord Protector, whose well 
    known power is our bulwark.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. The kings were assembled, they passed by 
    together. </p></b>They came and they went. No sooner together than scattered. 
    They came one way, and fled twenty ways. Boastful the gathering hosts with 
    their royal leaders, despairing the fugitive bands with their astonished 
    captains. They came like foam on the angry sea—and like foam they melted 
    away. This was so remarkable that the psalmist puts in a note of 
    exclamation, <b>Lo!</b> What! have they so suddenly fled! Even thus shall 
    the haters of the church vanish from the field. Papists, Ritualists, Arians, 
    Sceptics—they shall each have their day, and shall pass on to the limbo of 
    forgetfulness.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. They saw it, and so they marveled. </p></b>They 
    came, they saw, but they did not conquer. There was no conquering for them. 
    No sooner did they perceive that the Lord was in the Holy City, than they 
    took to their heels. Before the Lord came to blows with them, they were 
    faint hearted, and beat a retreat. 
<b>
<p align="justify">They were troubled and hastened away.</p></b> The troublers 
    were troubled. Their haste in coming, was nothing compared to their hurry in 
    going. Panic seized them, horses were not fleet enough; they would have 
    borrowed the wings of the wind. They fled ignominiously, like children in a 
    fright. 
<p align="justify">Glory be to God, it shall be even thus with the foes of 
    his church. When the Lord comes to our help, our enemies shall be as 
    nothing. Could they foresee their ignominious defeat, they would not advance 
    to the attack.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. Fear took hold upon them there. </p></b>They were in
    <i>Giant Despair's </i>grip. Where they hoped to triumph—there they quivered 
    with dismay. They did not take the city—but fear took hold on them. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And pain, as of a woman in travail.</p></b> They were as much 
    overcome as a woman whose fright causes premature delivery; or, as full of 
    pain as a poor mother in her pangs—a strong expression, commonly employed by 
    Orientals to set forth the extremity of anguish. When the Lord arises for 
    the help of his church, the proudest of his foes shall be as trembling 
    women, and their dismay shall be but the beginning of eternal defeat.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. You break the ships of Tarshish with an east 
    wind.</p></b> As easily as vessels are driven to shipwreck—does God overturn the 
    most powerful adversaries; or it may mean the strength of some nations lies 
    in their ships, whose wooden walls are soon broken; but our strength is in 
    our God, and therefore, it fails not.
<p align="justify">Or there may be another meaning, though you are our 
    defense—yet you take vengeance on our inventions, and while you do preserve 
    us—yet our ships, our comforts, our earthly ambitions, are taken from us 
    that we may look alone to you. </p>
<p align="justify">God is seen at sea, but he is equally present on land. 
    Speculative heresies, pretending to bring us wealth from afar, are 
    constantly assailing the church, but the breath of the Lord soon drives them 
    to destruction. The church too often relies on the wisdom of men, and these 
    human helps are soon shipwrecked; yet the church itself is safe beneath the 
    care of her God and King.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of 
    the Lord Almighty, in the city of our God.</p></b> Our father's stories are 
    reproduced before our very eyes. We <i>heard </i>the promise, and we have <i>
    seen </i>the fulfillment. The records of Zion, wonderful as they are, are 
    proved to be truthful, because present facts are in perfect harmony 
    therewith. 
<p align="justify">Note how the Lord is first spoken of as <i>Lord Almighty</i>, 
    a name of power and sovereignty—and then as <i>our God</i>, a name of 
    covenant relation and condescension. No wonder that since the Lord bears 
    both titles, we find him dealing with us after the precedents of his 
    loving-kindness, and the faithfulness of his promises. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">God will establish it forever.</p></b> The true church can 
    never be disestablished. That which kings establish can last for time only; 
    that which God establishes endures to all eternity. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Selah</p></b>. Here is a fit place to pause, viewing the <i>
    past </i>with admiration, and the <i>future </i>with confidence.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. We have thought.</p></b> Holy men are thoughtful 
    men; they do not allow God's wonders to pass before their eyes and melt into 
    forgetfulness, but they meditate deeply upon them. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Of your loving-kindness, O God.</p></b> What a delightful 
    subject! Devout minds never tire of so divine a theme. It is well to think 
    of past loving-kindness in times of trial—and equally profitable to remember 
    it in seasons of prosperity. <i>Grateful memories sweeten sorrows and sober 
    joys</i>. 
<b>
<p align="justify">In the midst of your temple.</p></b> Fit place for so devout 
    a meditation. <i>Where God is most seen, he is best loved</i>. The assembled 
    saints constitute a living temple, and our deepest musings when so gathered 
    together should have regard to the loving-kindness of the Lord, exhibited in 
    the varied experiences of each of the living stones. Memories of mercy 
    should be associated with continuance of praise. Nearby the table of show 
    bread commemorating his bounty—should stand the altar of incense denoting 
    our praise.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. According to your name, O God, so is your 
    praise unto the ends of the earth.</p></b> Great fame is due to his great name. 
    The glory of Jehovah's exploits overleaps the boundaries of earth; angels 
    behold with wonder, and from every star delighted intelligences proclaim his 
    fame beyond the ends of the earth. 
<p align="justify">What if men are silent—yet the woods, and seas, and 
    mountains, with all their countless tribes, and all the unseen spirits that 
    walk them, are full of the divine praise. As in a shell we listen to the 
    murmurs of the sea, so in the convolutions of creation we hear the praises 
    of God. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Your right hand is full of righteousness.</p></b> Your 
    scepter and your sword, your government and your vengeance—are altogether 
    just. Your hand is never empty, but full of energy, of bounty, and of 
    equity. Neither saint nor sinner shall find the Lord to be an empty-handed 
    God; he will in both cases deal out righteousness to the full: to the one, 
    through Jesus, he will be just to forgive—to the other, he will be just to 
    condemn.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. Let Mount Zion rejoice. </p></b>As the first of the 
    cities of Judah, and the main object of the enemies' attack—let her lead the 
    song. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Let the daughters of Judah be glad</p></b>, let the smaller 
    towns join the chorus, for they join in the common victory. Let the women, 
    who fare worst in the havoc of war, be among the gladdest of the glad, now 
    that the spoilers have fled.
<p align="justify">All the church, and each individual member, should 
    rejoice in the Lord, and magnify his name. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Because of your judgments.</p></b> The righteous acts of the 
    Lord are legitimate subjects for joyful praise. However it may appear on 
    earth—yet <i>in Heaven the eternal ruin of the wicked will be the theme of 
    adoring song</i>. Revelation 19:1,3, "Alleluia; salvation, and glory, and 
    honor, and power, unto the Lord our God. For true and righteous are his 
    judgments; for he has judged the great whore which did corrupt the earth 
    with her fornication, and has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. 
    And again they said, Alleluia, and her smoke rose up forever and ever!"
<p align="justify">God's justice which to our poor optics now seems severe, 
    will then be perceived to be perfectly consistent with God's name of love, 
    and to be one of the brightest jewels of his crown!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. Walk about Zion; go around her, even as Israel 
    marched around Jericho. </p></b>With leisurely and careful inspection survey 
    her. And go round about her. Encircle her again and again with loving 
    strolls. 
<p align="justify">We cannot too frequently or too deeply consider the 
    origin, privileges, history, security, and glory of the church. Some 
    subjects deserve but a passing thought; but this is worthy of the most 
    patient consideration.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Count the towers thereof.</p></b> See if any of them have 
    crumbled, or have been demolished. Is the church of God what she was in 
    doctrine, in strength and in beauty? Her foes counted her towers in envy 
    first, and then in terror—let us count them with sacred exultation. 
<p align="justify">The city of Lucerne, encircled by its ancient walls, 
    adorned with a succession of towers, is a visible illustration of this 
    figure; and as we have gone around it, and paused at each picturesque tower, 
    we have realized the loving lingering inspection which the metaphor implies.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. Mark well her bulwarks.</p></b> Consider most 
    attentively how strong are her ramparts, how safely her inhabitants are 
    entrenched behind successive lines of defense. 
<p align="justify">The security of the people of God is not a doctrine to be 
    kept in the background—it may be safely taught, and frequently pondered. 
    Only to base hearts will that glorious truth prove harmful; the sons of 
    perdition make a stumbling stone even of the Lord Jesus himself—it is little 
    wonder that they pervert the truth of God concerning the final perseverance 
    of the saints. </p>
<p align="justify">We are not to turn away from inspecting Zion's ramparts, 
    because idlers skulk behind them. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Consider her palaces.</p></b> Examine with care the fair 
    dwellings of the city. Let the royal promises which afford quiet resting 
    places for believers be attentively inspected. See how sound are the 
    defenses, and how fair are the pleasure-gardens of "that ancient city," of 
    which you are citizens. 
<p align="justify">A man should be best acquainted with his own home; and 
    the church is our dear and blessed abode. Would to God professors were more 
    considerate of the condition of the church; so far from counting the towers, 
    some of them scarcely know what or where they are; they are too busy 
    counting their money, and considering their ledgers. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">That you may tell it to the generation following.</p></b> An 
    excellent reason for studious observation. We have received, and we must 
    transmit. We must be students, that we may be teachers. The debt we owe to 
    the past, we must endeavor to repay by handing down the truth to the future.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14. For this God is our God forever and ever.</p></b> A 
    good reason for preserving a record of all that he has wrought. Israel will 
    not change her God so as to wish to forget, nor will the Lord change so as 
    to make the past mere history. He will be the covenant God of his people 
    world without end. 
<p align="justify">There is no other God—we wish for no other, we would have 
    no other even if there were. </p>
<p align="justify">There are some who are so ready to comfort the wicked, 
    that for the sake of ending their punishment they weaken the force of 
    language, and make <i>forever and ever </i>mean <i>but a time</i>; 
    nevertheless, despite their interpretations we exult in the hope of an 
    eternity of bliss, and to us "everlasting," and "forever and ever" mean what 
    they say. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">He will be our guide even unto death.</p></b> Throughout 
    life, and to our dying couch, he will graciously conduct us—and even after 
    death he will lead us to the living fountains of waters. We look to him for 
    resurrection and eternal life. 
<p align="justify">This consolation is clearly derivable from what has gone 
    before; hitherto our foes have been scattered, and our bulwarks have defied 
    attack, for God has been in our midst, therefore all possible assaults in 
    the future shall be equally futile.</p>
<p align="justify">"The church has all her foes defied<br/>
    And laughed to scorn their rage;<br/>
    Even thus for yes she shall abide<br/>
    Secure from age to age."</p>
<p align="justify">Farewell, fear. Come hither, gratitude and faith, and 
    sing right joyously.</p>
