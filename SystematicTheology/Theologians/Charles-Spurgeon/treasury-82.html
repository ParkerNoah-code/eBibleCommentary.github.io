              TITLE AND SUBJECT. A Psalm of Asaph. A Psalm of complaint such as
              Jeremiah might have written amid the ruins of the beloved city. It
              evidently treats of times of invasion, oppression, and national
              overthrow. Asaph was a patriotic poet, and was never more at home
              than when he rehearsed the history of his nation. Would to God
              that we had national poets whose song should be of the Lord.

                It is an awful thing when wicked men are found in the church and

              After devouring and defiling, they have come to destroying, and
              have done their work with a cruel completeness. Jerusalem, the
              beloved city, the joy of the nation, the abode of her God, was
              totally wrecked. Alas! alas! for Israel! It is sad to see the foe
              in our own house—but worse to meet him in the house of God; they
              strike hardest who smite at our religion. The psalmist piles up
              the agony; he was a suppliant, and he knew how to bring out the
              strong points of his case.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              We ought to order our case before the Lord with as much care as if
              our success depended on our pleading. Men in earthly courts use
              all their powers to obtain their ends, and so also should we state
              our case with earnestness, and bring forth our strong arguments.

                Verse 2. "The dead bodies of your servants have they given to be

                the beasts of the earth."

            <p align="justify">
              The enemy cared not to bury the dead, and there was not a
              sufficient number of Israel left alive to perform the funeral
              rites; therefore, the precious relics of the departed were left to
              be devoured of vultures and torn by wolves. Beasts on which man
              could not feed, fed on him. The flesh of the Lord's servants
              became food for carrion crows and hungry dogs.<i>
                Dire are the calamities of war—yet have they happened to God's
                saints and servants.</i

              This might well move the heart of the poet, and he did well to
              appeal to the heart of God by reciting the grievous evil. Such
              might have been the lamentation of an early Christian as he
              thought of the amphitheater and all its deeds of blood. Note in
              the two verses how the plea is made to turn upon God's property in
              the temple and the people: we read "your inheritance," "your
              temple," "your servants," and "your saints." Surely the Lord will
              defend his own, and will not allow rampant adversaries to despoil
              them.

              none to bury the dead of your family, O Lord? Can none be found to
              grant a shovelful of earth with which to cover up the poor bodies

              argues that those who suffer more than ordinary calamities must
              have been extraordinary sinners. Neighbors especially are often
              the reverse of neighborly; the nearer they dwell the less they

              deplorable one. Asaph was an excellent advocate, for he gave a
              telling description of calamities which were under his own eyes,

              Sins accumulate against nations. Generations lay up stores of
              transgressions to be visited upon their successors; hence this
              urgent prayer. In Josiah's days the most earnest repentance was
              not able to avert the doom which former long years of idolatry had
              sealed against Judah. Every man has reason to ask for an act of
              oblivion for his past sins, and every nation should make this a

              See, too, how she pleads her own distress, and not her goodness,

              old sins—but have mercy upon us, and that soon; for we are come to
              great misery." This supplication befits a sinner's life. We have

              but, there is One who can keep our soul alive, ay, and bring it up
              again from the depths of despair. A lamb shall live between the
              lion's jaws if the Lord wills it. Even in the charnel house, life
              shall vanquish death if God be near.

              They denied your existence, mocked your power, insulted your
              worship, and destroyed your house; up, therefore, O Lord, and make
              them feel to the full that you are not to be mocked with impunity.
              Pour into their laps good store of shame because they dared insult
              the God of Israel. Recompense them fully, until they have received
              the perfect number of punishments. It will be so.<i>

              The gratitude of the church is lasting as well as deep. On her
              tablets are memorials of great deliverances, and, as long as she
              shall exist, her sons will rehearse them with delight. We have a
              history which will survive all other records, and it is bright in
              every line with the glory of the Lord. From the direst calamities
              God's glory springs, and the dark days of his people become the
              prelude to unusual displays of the Lord's love and power.
