        <p>(Marriage lawful, p.39.)</p>
        <p>
          St. Peter was a married apostle, and the traditions of his wife which
          connect her married life with Rome itself render it most surprising
          that those who claim to be St. Peter's successors should denounce the
          marriage of the clergy as if it were crime. The touching story,
          borrowed from Clement of Alexandria, is related by Eusebius. "And will
          they," says Clement, "reject even the apostles? Peter and Philip,
          indeed, had children; Philip also gave his daughters in marriage to
          husbands; and Paul does not demur, in a certain Epistle, to mention
          his own wife, whom he did not take about with him, in order to
          expedite his ministry the better." Of St. Peter and his wife, Eusebius
          subjoins, "Such was the marriage of these blessed ones, and such was
          their perfect affection."

          The Easterns to this day perpetuate the marriage of the clergy, and
          enjoin it; but unmarried men only are chosen to be bishops. Even Rome
          relaxes her discipline for the Uniats, and hundreds of her priesthood,
          therefore, live in honourable marriage. Thousands live in secret
          marriage, but their wives are dishonoured as "concubines." It was not
          till the eleventh century that the celibate was enforced. In England
          it was never successfully imposed; and, though the "priest's leman"
          was not called his wife (to the disgrace of the whole system), she was
          yet honoured (see Chaucer), and often carried herself too proudly.

          The enormous evils of an enforced celibacy need not here be remarked
          upon. The history of Sacerdotal Celibacy, by Henry C. Lea of
          Philadelphia, is compendious, and can be readily procured by all who
          wish to understand what it is that this treatise of Tertullian's
          orthodoxy may best be used to teach; viz., that we must not be wiser
          than God, even in our zeal for His service.<br />
