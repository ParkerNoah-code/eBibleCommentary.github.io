        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.969)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, January 8th, 1871, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give
          you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and
          lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is
          easy, and my burden is light." -- Matthew 11:28-30.
        </p>
        <p>
          WE have oft repeated those memorable words, and they have brought us
          much comfort; but it is possible that we may never have looked deeply
          into them, so as to have seen the fulness of their meaning. The works
          of man will seldom bear close inspection. You shall take a needle
          which is highly polished, which appears to be without the slightest
          inequality upon its surface, and you shall put it under a microscope,
          and it will look like a rough bar of iron; but you shall select what
          you will from nature, the bark or the leaf of a tree, or the wing or
          the foot of an insect, and you shall discover no flaw, magnify it as
          much as you will, and gaze upon it as long as you please. So take the
          words of man. The first time you hear them they will strike you; you
          may hear them again and still admire their sentiment, but you shall
          soon weary of their repetition, and call them hackneyed and
          over-estimated. The words of Jesus are not so, they never lose their
          dew, they never become threadbare. You may ring the changes upon his
          words, and never exhaust their music: you may consider them by day and
          by night, but familiarity shall not breed contempt. You shall beat
          them in the mortar of contemplation, with the pestle of criticism, and
          their perfume shall but become the more apparent. Dissect,
          investigate, and weigh the Master's teaching word by word, and each
          syllable will repay you. When loitering upon the Island of Liddo, off
          Venice, and listening to the sound of the city's bells, I thought the
          music charming as it floated across the lagune; but when I returned to
          the city, and sat down in the centre of the music, in the very midst
          of all the bells, the sweetness changed to a horrible clash, the
          charming sounds were transformed into a maddening din; not the
          slightest melody could I detect in any one bell, while harmony in the
          whole company of noisemakers was out of the question. Distance had
          lent enchantment to the sound. The words of poets and eloquent writers
          may, as a whole, and heard from afar, sound charmingly enough; but how
          few of them bear a near and minute investigation! Their belfry rings
          passably, but one would soon weary of each separate bell. It is never
          so with the divine words of Jesus. You hear them ringing from afar and
          they are sweetness itself. When as a sinner, you roamed at midnight
          like a traveller lost on the wilds, how sweetly did they call you
          home! But now you have reached the house of mercy, you sit and listen
          to each distinct note of love's perfect peal, and wonderingly feel
          that even angelic harps cannot excel it.

          We will, this morning, if we can, conduct you into the inner chambers
          of out text, place its words under the microscope, and peer into the
          recesses of each sentence. We only wish our microscope were of a
          greater magnifying power, and our ability to expound the text more
          complete; for there are mines of instruction here. Superficially read,
          this royal promise has cheered and encouraged tens of thousands, but
          there is a wealth in it which the diligent digger and miner shall
          alone discover. Its shallows are cool and refreshing for the lambs,
          but in its depths are pearls for which we hope to dive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our first head, this morning, is rest: "Come unto me, all ye that
          labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." The second head
          is rest: "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and
          lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Let us begin at the beginning with the first REST, and here we will
          make divisions only for the sake of bringing out the sense more
          clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Observe the person invited to receive this first rest: "Come unto
          me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden." The word "all" first
          demands attention: "All ye that labor." There was need for the
          insertion of that wide word. Had not the Saviour said a little before,
          "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast
          hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to
          babes?" Some one who had been listening to the Saviour, might have
          said, "The Father, then, has determined to whom he will reveal the
          Christ; there is a number chosen, according to the Father's good
          pleasure, to whom the gospel is revealed; while from another company
          it is hidden!" The too hasty inference, which it seems natural for man
          to draw from the doctrine is, "Then there is no invitation for me;
          there is no hope for me; I need not listen to the gospel's warnings
          and invitations." So the Saviour, as if to answer that discouraging
          notion, words his invitation thus, "Come unto me, all ye that labor
          and are heavy laden." Let it not be supposed that election excludes
          any of you from the invitation of mercy; all of you who labor, are
          bidden to come. Whatever the great doctrine of predestination may
          involve, rest assured that it by no means narrows or diminishes the
          extent of gospel invitations. The good news is to be preached to
          "every creature" under heaven, and in this particular passage it is
          addressed to all the laboring and heavy laden.
        </p>
        <p>
          The description of the person invited is very full. It describes him
          both actively and passively. "All ye that labor" -- there is the
          activity of men bearing the yoke, and ready to labor after salvation;
          "heavy laden" -- there is the passive form of their religious
          condition, they sustain a burden, and are pressed down, and sorely
          wearied by the load they bear. There are to be found many who are
          actively engaged in seeking salvation; they believe that if they obey
          the precepts of the law they will be saved, and they are endeavoring
          to the utmost to do them; they have been told that the performance of
          certain rites and ceremonies will also save them, they are performing
          those with great care; the yoke is on their shoulders, and they are
          laboring diligently. Some are laboring in prayer, some are laboring in
          sacraments, others in self-denials and mortifications, but as a class
          they are awakened to feel the need of salvation, and they are
          intensely laboring to save themselves. It is to these the Saviour
          addresses his loving admonition: in effect he tells them, "This is not
          the way to rest, your self-imposed labors will end in disappointment;
          cease your wearisome exertions, and believe in me, for I will at once
          give you rest -- the rest which my labors have earned for believers."
          Very speedily those who are active in self-righteously working for
          salvation fall into the passive state, and become burdened; their
          labor of itself becomes a burden to them. Besides the burden of their
          self-righteous labor, there comes upon them the awful, tremendous,
          crushing burden of past sin, and a sense of the wrath of God which is
          due to that sin. A soul which has to bear the load of its own sin, and
          the load of divine wrath, is indeed heavily laden. Atlas with the
          world upon his back had a light load compared with a sinner upon whom
          mountains of sin and wrath are piled. Such persons frequently are
          burdened, in addition, by fears and apprehensions; some of them
          correct, others of them baseless, but anyhow the burden daily grows.
          Their active labors do not diminish their passive sufferings. The
          acute anguish of their souls will often be increased in proportion as
          their endeavors are increased; and while they hope at first that if
          they labor industriously they will gradually diminish the mass of
          their sin, it happens that their labor adds to their weariness beneath
          its pressure; they feel a weight of disappointment, because their
          labor has not brought them rest; and a burden of despair, because they
          fear that deliverance will never come. Now these are the persons whom
          the Saviour calls to himself -- those who are actively seeking
          salvation, those who are passively bearing the weight of sin and of
          divine wrath.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is implied, too, that these are undeserving of rest, for it is
          said, "Come unto me, and I will give you rest." A gift is not of merit
          but of grace; wages and reward are for those who earn, but a gift is a
          matter of charity. O you who feel your unworthiness this morning, who
          have been seeking salvation earnestly, and suffering the weight of
          sin, Jesus will freely give to you what you cannot earn or purchase,
          he will give it as an act of his own free, rich, sovereign mercy; and
          he is prepared, if you come to him, to give it to you now, for so has
          he promised, "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and
          I will give you rest."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Notice next, the precept here laid down: "Come." It is not "Learn,"
          it is not "Take my yoke" -- that is in the next verse, and is intended
          for the next stage of experience-but in the beginning the word of the
          Lord is, "Come unto me," "Come." A simple word, but very full of
          meaning. To come is to leave one thing and to advance to another.
          Come, then, ye laboring and heavy laden, leave your legal labors,
          leave your self-reliant efforts, leave your sins, leave your
          presumptions, leave all in which you hitherto have trusted, and come
          to Jesus, that is, think of, advance towards, rely upon the Saviour.
          Let your contemplations think of him who bore the load of human sin
          upon the cross of Calvary, where he was made sin for us. Let your
          minds consider him who from his cross hurled the enormous mass of his
          people's transgressions into a bottomless sepulchre, where it was
          buried forever. Think of Jesus, the divinely-appointed substitute and
          sacrifice for guilty man. Then, seeing that he is God's own Son, let
          faith follow your contemplation; rely upon him, trust in him as having
          suffered in your stead, look to him for the payment of the debt which
          is due from you to the wrath of God. This is to come to Jesus.
          Repentance and faith make up this "Come" -- the repentance which
          leaves that place where you now stand, the faith which comes into
          reliance upon Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, that the command to "Come" is put in the present tense, and
          in the Greek it is intensely present. It might be rendered something
          like this: "Hither to me all ye that labor and are heavy laden!" It is
          a "Come" which means not "Come to-morrow or next year," but "Now, at
          once." Advance, ye slaves, flee from your task-master now! Weary ones
          recline on the promise now, and take your rest! Come now! By an act of
          instantaneous faith which will bring instantaneous peace, come and
          rely upon Jesus, and he will now give you rest. Rest shall at once
          follow the exercise of faith. Perform the act of faith now. O may the
          eternal Spirit lead some laboring heavy laden soul to come to Jesus,
          and to come at this precise moment!
        </p>
        <p>
          It is "Come unto me." Notice that. The Christ in his personality is to
          be trusted in. Not "Come to John, and hear him say, "Repent, for the
          kingdom of heaven is at hand,'" for no rest is there. John commands a
          preparation for the rest, but he has no rest to give to the soul. Come
          not to the Pharisees, who will instruct you in tradition, and in the
          jots and tittles of the law; but go past these to Jesus, the man, the
          God, the mediator, the Redeemer, the propitiation for human guilt. If
          you want rest come to Christ in Gethsemane, to Christ on Calvary, to
          Christ risen, to Christ ascended. If you want rest, O weary souls, ye
          can find it nowhere until ye come and lay your burdens down at his
          dear pierced feet, and find life in looking alone to him. There is the
          precept then. Observe it is nothing but that one word, "Come." It is
          not "Do;" it is not even "Learn." It is not, "Take up my yoke," that
          will follow after, but must never be forced out of its proper place.
          To obtain the first rest, the rest which is a matter of gift -- all
          that is asked of you is that you come to have it. Now, the least thing
          that charity itself can ask when it gives away its alms, is that men
          come for it. Come ye needy, come and welcome; come and take the rest
          ye need. Jesus saith to you, "Come and take what I freely give."
          Without money come, without merit come, without preparation come. It
          is just, come, come now; come as you are, come with your burden, come
          with your yoke, though the yoke be the yoke of the devil, and the
          burden be the burden of sin, yet come as you are, and the promise
          shall be fulfilled to you, "I will give you rest."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Notice next the promise spoken, "I will give you rest." "I will
          give." It is a rest that is a gift; not a rest found in our experience
          by degrees, but given at once. As I shall have to show you, the next
          verse speaks of the rest that is found, wrought out, and discovered;
          but this is a rest given. We come to Jesus; we put out the empty hand
          of faith, and rest is given us at once most freely. We possess it at
          once, and it is ours forever. It is a present rest, rest now; not rest
          after death; not rest after a time of probation and growth and
          advancement; but it is rest given when we come to Jesus, given there
          and then. And it is perfect rest too; for it is not said, nor is it
          implied, that the rest is incomplete. We do not read, "I will give you
          partial rest," but "rest," as much as if there were no other form of
          it. It is perfect and complete in itself. In the blood and
          righteousness of Jesus our peace is perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall not stay except to ask you now, brethren and sisters, whether
          you know the meaning of this given rest. Have you come to Jesus and
          has he given you perfect and present rest? If so, I know your eye will
          catch joyously those two little words, "And I," and I would bid you
          lovingly remember the promiser who speaks. Jesus promises and Jesus
          performs. Did not all your rest, when first your sin was forgiven,
          come from him? The load was gone, but who took it? The yoke was
          removed, but who lifted it from off the shoulder? Do you not give to
          Jesus, this day, the glory of all your rest from the burden of guilt?
          Do you not praise his name with all your souls? Yes, I know you do.
          And you know how that rest came to you. It was by his substitution and
          your faith in that substitution. Your sin was not pardoned by a
          violation of divine justice; justice was satisfied in Jesus; he gave
          you rest. The fact that he has made full atonement is the rest of your
          spirit this morning. I know that deep down in your consciences, the
          calm which blesses you springs from a belief in your Lord's vicarious
          sacrifice. He bore the unrest that you might have the rest, and you
          receive rest this day as a free gift from him. You have done now with
          servile toils and hopeless burdens, you have entered into rest through
          believing; but all the rest and deliverance still comes to you as a
          gift from his dear hands, who purchased with a price this blessing for
          your souls. I earnestly wish that many who have never felt that rest,
          would come and have it; it is all they have to do to obtain it -- to
          come for it; just where they now are, if God enables them to exercise
          a simple act of faith in Jesus, he will give them rest from all their
          past sins, from all their efforts to save themselves, a rest which
          shall be to his glory and to their joy.
        </p>
        <p>II. We must now advance to our second head -- REST.</p>
        <p>
          It looks rather strange that after having received rest, the next
          verse should begin: "Take my yoke upon you." "Ah! I had been set free
          from laboring, am I to be a laborer again?" Yes, yes, take my yoke and
          begin. "And my burden is light." "Burden? Why, I was heavy laden just
          now, am I to carry another burden?" Yes. A yoke -- actively and a
          burden -- passively, I am to bear both of these. "But I found rest by
          getting rid of my yoke and my burden!" And you are to find a further
          rest by wearing a new yoke, and bearing a new burden. Your yoke
          galled, but Christ's yoke is easy; your burden was heavy, but Christ's
          burden is light. Before we enter into this matter more fully, let us
          illustrate it. How certain it is that a yoke is essential to produce
          rest, and without it rest is unknown! Spain found rest by getting rid
          of that wretched monarch Isabella; an iron yoke was her dominion upon
          the nation's neck, crushing every aspiration after progress by an
          intolerable tyranny. Up rose the nation, shook off its yoke, and threw
          aside its burden, and it had rest in a certain sense, rest from evil.
          But Spain has not fully rested yet, and it seems that she will never
          find permanent rest till she has voluntarily taken up another yoke,
          and found for herself another burden. In a word, she must have a
          strong, settled, recognized government, and then only will her
          distractions cease. This is just a picture of the human soul. It is
          under the dominion of Satan, it wears his awful yoke, and works for
          him; it bears his accursed burden, and groans under it; Jesus sets it
          free -- but has it, therefore, a perfect rest? Yes, a rest from, but
          not a rest in. What is wanted now is a new government; the soul must
          have a sovereign, a ruling principle, a master-motive; and when Jesus
          has taken that position, rest is come. This further rest is what is
          spoken of in the second verse. Let me give you another symbol. A
          little stream flowed through a manufacturing town; an unhappy little
          stream it was, for it was forced to turn huge wheels and heavy
          machinery, and it wound its miserable way through factories where it
          was dyed black and blue, until it became a foul and filthy ditch, and
          loathed itself. It felt the tyranny which polluted its very existence.
          Now, there came a deliverer who looked upon the streamlet and said, "I
          will set thee free and give thee rest." So he stopped up the
          water-course, and said, "abide in thy place, thou shalt no more flow
          where thou art enslaved and defiled." In a very few days the brooklet
          found that it had but exchanged one evil for another. Its waters were
          stagnating, they were gathering into a great pool, and desiring to
          find a channel. It was in its very nature to flow on, and it foamed
          and swelled, and pressed against the dam which stayed it. Every hour
          it grew more inwardly restless, it threatened to break the barrier,
          and it made all who saw its angry looks tremble for the mischief it
          would do ere long. It never found rest until it was permitted to
          pursue an active course along a channel which had been prepared for it
          among the meadows and the corn fields. Then, when it watered the
          plains and made glad the villages, it was a happy streamlet, perfectly
          at rest. So our souls are made for activity, and when we are set free
          from the activities of our self-righteousness and the slavery of our
          sin we must do something, and we shall never rest until we find that
          something to do. Hence in the text you will be pleased to see that
          there is something said about a yoke, which is the ensign of working,
          and something about a burden, which is the emblem of enduring. It is
          in man's mortal nature that he must do or endure, or else his spirit
          will stagnate and be far from rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. We will consider this second rest, and notice that it is rest after
          rest. "I will give you rest" comes before "Ye shall find rest." It is
          the rest of a man who is already at rest, the repose of a man who has
          received a given rest, and now discovers the found rest. It is the
          rest of a learner -- "Learn of me, and ye shall find rest." It is not
          so much the rest of one who was aforetime laboring and heavy laden, as
          of one who is to-day learning at the Saviour's feet. It is the rest of
          a seeker evidently, for finding usually implies a search. Having been
          pardoned and saved, the saved man in the course of his experience
          discovers more and more reason for peace; he is learning, and seeking,
          and he finds. The rest is evidently lighted upon, however, as a thing
          unknown, which becomes the subject of discovery. The man had a rest
          from his burden; now he finds a rest, in Christ, which exceeds what he
          asked or even thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have looked at this rest after rest as being a treasure concealed in
          a precious box. The Lord Jesus gives to his people a priceless casket,
          called the gift of rest; it is set with brilliants and inlaid with
          gems, and the substance thereof is of wrought gold; whosoever
          possesses it feels and knows that his warfare is accomplished and his
          sin is pardoned. After awhile the happy owner begins to examine his
          treasure. It is all his own, but he has not yet seen it all, for one
          day he detects a secret drawer, he touches a hidden spring, and lo!
          Before him lies a priceless Koh-i-noor surpassing all the rest. It had
          been given him it is certain, but he had not seen it at first, and
          therefore he finds it. Jesus Christ gives us in the gift of himself
          all the rest we can ever enjoy, even heaven's rest lies in him; but
          after we have received him we have to learn his value, and find out by
          the teaching of his Spirit the fulness of the rest which he bestows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I say to you who are saved, you who have looked to Jesus Christ,
          whether you looked this morning or twenty years ago, have you found
          out all that there is in the gift which Christ has given you? Have you
          found out the secret drawer yet? He has given you rest, but have you
          found the innermost rest which he works in your hearts? It is yours,
          for it is included in the one gift; but it is not yours enjoyed,
          understood, and triumphed in as yet unless you have found it, for the
          rest here meant is a rest after rest, a spiritual, experienced rest,
          which comes only to those who find it by experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Further observe that the rest in this second part of our text is a
          rest in service. It is coupled with a yoke, for activity -- "Take my
          yoke;" it is connected with a burden, for endurance -- "My burden is
          light." He who is a Christian will not find rest in being idle. There
          is no unrest greater than that of the sluggard. If you would rest take
          Christ's yoke, be actively engaged in his service. As the bullock has
          the yoke put upon its neck and then begins to draw, so have the yoke
          of Christ put on your neck and commence to obey him. The rest of
          heaven is not the rest of sleep; they serve him day and night in his
          temple. They are always resting, and yet, in another sense, they rest
          not day nor night. Holy activity in heaven is perfect rest. True rest
          to the mind of the child of God is rest on the wing, rest in motion,
          rest in service, not rest with the yoke off, but with the yoke on. We
          are to enter upon this service voluntarily; we are to take his yoke
          upon us voluntarily. You observe, it does not say, "Bear my yoke when
          it is laid upon you, but take it." Do not need to be told by the
          minister, "My dear brother, such-and-such a work you are bound to do,"
          but take up the yoke of your own accord. Do not merely submit to be
          the Lord's servant, but seek his service. Ask, "What can I do?" Be
          desirous to do it' voluntarily, cheerfully, do all that lieth in you
          for the extension of his kingdom who has given you rest, and you shall
          find that the rest of your soul shall lie in your doing all you can
          for Jesus. Every active Christian will tell you he is never happier
          than when he has much to do; and, on the whole, if he communes with
          Jesus, never more at rest than when he has least leisure. Look not for
          your rest in the mere enjoyments and excitements of religion, but find
          your rest in wearing a yoke which you love, and which, for that
          reason, is easy to your neck.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, my dear brother, you must also be willing to bear Christ's
          burden. Now the burden of Christ is his cross, which every Christian
          must take up. Expect to be reproached, expect to meet with some degree
          of the scandal of the cross, for the offence of it never ceases.
          Persecution and reproach are a blessed burden; when your soul loves
          Jesus it is a light thing to suffer for him, and therefore never, by
          any cowardly retirement or refusal to profess your faith, evade your
          share of this honorable load. Woe unto those who say, "I will never be
          a martyr." No rest is sweeter than the martyr's rest. Woe unto those
          who say, "We will go to heaven by night along a secret road, and so
          avoid the shame of the cross." The rest of the Christian is found not
          in cowardice but in courage; it lies not in providing for ease but in
          the brave endurance of suffering for the truth. The restful spirit
          counts the reproach of Christ to be greater riches than all the
          treasures of Egypt; he falls in love with the cross, and counts the
          burden light, and so finds rest in service, and rest in suffering.
          Note that well.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The rest before us is rest through learning. Does a friend say, "I
          do not see how I am ever to get rest in working, and rest in
          suffering?" My dear brother, you never will except you go to school,
          and you must go to school to Christ. "Learn of me," saith he, "for I
          am meek and lowly in heart." Now, in order to learn of Christ it is
          implied that we lay aside all prejudices of the past. These things
          much prevent our finding peace. Have you any preconceived notions of
          what religion should be? Have you fashioned on your own anvil ideas of
          what the doctrines of the gospel ought to be? Throw them all away;
          learn of Jesus, and unlearn your own thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, when you are willing to learn, please to note what is to be
          learned. In order to get perfect rest of mind you have to learn of
          Jesus not only the doctrines which he teaches, but a great deal more
          than that. To go to school to be orthodox is a good enough thing, but
          the orthodoxy which brings rest is an orthodoxy of the spirit. Observe
          the text, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me." What? For I am
          wise and learned, and can teach you? No; you are to learn from his
          example to be "meek and lowly in heart," and in learning that you will
          "find rest unto your souls." To catch the spirit of Jesus is the road
          to rest. To believe what he teaches me is something, to acknowledge
          him as my religious leader and as my Lord is much, but to strive to be
          conformed to his character, not merely in its external developments
          but in its interior spirit, this is the grammar of rest. Learn to be
          like the meek and lowly-hearted One, and ye shall find rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          He tells us the two points in which we are to learn of him. First, he
          is meek, then he says he is lowly in heart. Take the work "meek"
          first. I think that refers to the yoke-bearing, the active labor. If I
          actively labor for Christ I can only find rest in the labor by
          possessing the meek spirit of my Lord; for if I go forth to labor for
          Christ without a meek spirit, I shall very soon find that there is no
          rest in it, for the yoke will gall my shoulder. Somebody will begin
          objecting that I do not perform my work according to his liking. If I
          am not meek I shall find my proud spirit rising at once, and shall be
          for defending myself; I shall be irritated, or I shall be discouraged
          and inclined to do no more, because I am not appreciated as I should
          be. A meek spirit is not apt to be angry, and does not soon take
          offence, therefore if others find fault, the meek spirit goes working
          on, and is not offended; it will not hear the sharp word, nor reply to
          the severe criticism. If the meek spirit be grieved by some cutting
          censure and suffers for a moment, it is always ready to forgive and
          blot out the past, and go on again. The meek spirit in working only
          seeks to do good to others; it denies itself; it never expected to be
          well treated; it did not aim at being honored; it never sought itself,
          but purposed only to do good to others. The meek spirit bowed its
          shoulder to the yoke, and expected to have to continue bowing in order
          to keep the yoke in the right place for labor. It did not look to be
          exalted by yoke-bearing; it is fully contented if it can exalt Christ
          and do good to his chosen ones. Remember how meek and lowly Jesus was
          in all his service, and how calmly, therefore, he bore with those who
          opposed him? The Samaritans would not receive him, and therefore John,
          who felt the yoke a little galling to his unaccustomed shoulder,
          cried, "Master, call fire from heaven." Poor John! But Christ bore the
          yoke of service so well because of his meek spirit that he would do
          nothing of the kind. If one village would not receive him he passed on
          to another, and so labored on. Your labor will become very easy if
          your spirits are very meek. It is the proud spirit that gets tired of
          doing good if it finds its labors not appreciated; but the brave, meek
          spirit, finds the yoke to be easy. "Consider him who endured such
          contradictions of sinners against himself lest ye be weary and faint
          in your minds." If ye learn his meekness his yoke will be pleasant to
          your shoulder, and you will never wish to have it removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, as to the passive part of our rest-lesson, note the text, "I am
          lowly in heart." We shall all have to bear something for the truth's
          sake so long as we are here. The reproach is a part of the gospel. The
          rod is a blessing of the covenant. The lowly heart finds the burden
          very light because it acquiesces in the divine will. The lowly heart
          says, "Not my will but thine be done; let God be glorified in me, it
          shall be all I ask. Rich, poor, sick, or in health, it is all the same
          to me. If God the great One has the glory, what matters where such a
          little one as I am may be placed?" The lowly spirit does not seek
          after great things for itself, it learns in whatsoever state it is
          therewith to be content. If it be poor, "Never mind," says the lowly
          one, "I never aspired to be rich; among the great ones of this earth I
          never desired to shine." If it be denied honor, the humble spirit
          says, "I never asked for earthly glory, I seek not mine own honor but
          his that sent me. Why should I be honored, a poor worm like me? If
          nobody speaks a good word of me, if I get Christ to say, "Well done,
          good and faithful servant," that is enough. And if the lowly-hearted
          have little wordly pleasure, he says, "This is not my place for
          pleasure, I deserve eternal pain, and if I do not have pleasures here
          I shall have them hereafter. I am well content to abide my time." Our
          blessed Lord was always of that lowly spirit. He did not strive, nor
          cry, nor cause his voice to be heard in the streets. The baubles of
          empire had no charm for him. Had fame offered to sound her trumpet for
          none but him he would have cared not one whit for the offer. The
          kingdoms of this world and the glory thereof were offered him, and he
          repelled the tempter. He was gentle, unobtrusive, self-denying; hence
          he treated his burden of poverty and shame as a light thing. "He
          endured the cross, despising the shame." If we once learn Christ's
          spirit we shall find rest unto our souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But we must pass on to notice, that it is very evident that the
          rest which we are to find is a rest which grows entirely out of our
          spirits being conformed to the spirit of Christ. "Learn of me, and ye
          shall find rest." It is then a spiritual rest altogether independent
          of circumstances. It is a vain idea of ours, to suppose that if our
          circumstances were altered we should be more at rest. My brother, if
          you cannot rest in poverty, neither would you in riches; if you cannot
          rest in the midst of persecution, neither would you in the midst of
          honor. It is the spirit within that gives the rest, that rest has
          little to do with any thing without. Men have sat on thrones and have
          found them uneasy places, while others on the rack have declared that
          they were at rest. The spirit is the spring of rest, as for the
          outward surroundings they are of small account. Let but your mind be
          like the mind of Christ, and you shall find rest unto your souls: a
          deep rest, a growing rest, a rest found out more and more, an abiding
          rest, not only which you have found, but which you shall go on to
          find. Justification gave you rest from the burden of sin,
          sanctification will give you rest from molesting cares; and in
          proportion as it becomes perfect, and you are like your Saviour, your
          rest shall become more like that of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          I desire one other thing to be called to your mind before I turn to
          the practical use of the text, and that is that here, as in the former
          rest, we are led to adore and admire the blessed person of our Lord.
          Observe the words, "For I." Oh! it all comes from him still, the
          second rest as much as the first, the casket and the treasure in the
          secret drawer. It all hinges there, "For I am." In describing the
          second rest there is more said concerning him than in the first. In
          the first part of our text it only says, "I will give you rest;" but
          in the second part his character is more fully explained -- "For I am
          meek and lowly in heart;" as if to show that as believers grow in
          grace, and enjoy more rest, they see more of Jesus and know more of
          him. All they know when sin is pardoned is that he gives it, perhaps
          they hardly know how; but afterwards when they come to rest in him in
          sweet fellowship, they know more of his personal attributes, and their
          rest for that very reason becomes more deep and perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come we now to the practical use of all this. Read the chapter before
          us and find the clue. First, my dear brethren, if you find rest to
          your souls you will not be moved by the judgment of men. The children
          in the market-place were the type of our Lord's generation, who railed
          both at John the Baptist and at our Lord. The generation which now is
          follows the same course, men are sure to cavil at our service. Never
          mind; take Christ's yoke on you, live to serve him; take Christ's
          burden, make it a point to bear all things for his sake, and you will
          not be affected either by praise or censure, for you will find rest to
          your souls in surrendering yourself to the Father's will. If you learn
          of Jesus you will have rest from the fear of men. I recollect, before
          I came to London, being at a prayer-meeting where a very quaint
          brother prayed for me that I might be delivered from the "bleating of
          the sheep." I understood it after awhile, he meant that I might live
          above the fear of man, that when such a person said "How much we have
          been edified today," I might not be puffed up; or if another said,
          "How dull the discourse was to-day," I might not be depressed. You
          will be delivered from "the bleating of the sheep" when you have the
          spirit of the Good Shepherd.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next you will be delivered from fretfulness at want of success. "Then
          began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were
          done, because they repented not." He had wrought his mighty works, and
          preached the gospel, and they did not repent. Was Jesus discouraged?
          Was he, as we sometimes are, ready to quit the work? No; his heart
          rested even then. If we come to Jesus, and take his yoke and burden,
          we too shall find rest, though Israel be not gathered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, too, our Lord denounced judgments upon those who repented not.
          He told them that those who had heard the gospel and rejected it would
          find it more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment
          than for them. There are some who quarrel with the judgments of God,
          and declare that they cannot bear to think of the condemnation of the
          impenitent. Is not this because they do not bear the burden of the
          Lord, but are self-willed? The saints are described in the book of
          Revelation as singing "Hallelujah" while the smoke of Babylon goeth up
          for ever and ever. We shall never receive with humble faith the
          judgment of God in its terror until we take Christ's yoke, and are
          lowly in heart. When we are like Jesus we shall not feel that the
          punishment is too much for the sin, but we shall sympathize with the
          justice of God, and say "Amen" to it. When the mind is lowly it never
          ventures to sit in judgment upon God, but rests in the conviction that
          the Judge of all must do right. It is not even anxious to make
          apologies and smooth down the fact, for it feels, it is not mine to
          justify him, he can justify himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, again, with regard to the divine sovereignty. Notice the rest of
          the Saviour's mind upon that matter: "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of
          heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and
          prudent." Learning of Jesus we too shall rest in reference to divine
          decrees; we shall rejoice in whatever the Lord determines;
          predestination will not cast a gloom over us, but we shall thank God
          for all he ordains.
        </p>
        <p>
          What a blessed rest! As we open it up, does not its compass and depth
          surprise you? How sweet to lie passive in his hands, reconciled to
          every mystery, content with every dispensation, honored by every
          service satisfied in God!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I do not know whether I am right, but it struck me, when
          considering this text from various points, that probably our Saviour
          meant to convey an idea of deeper fellowship than we have yet
          considered. Did not he mean this -- that he carried a yoke on his
          shoulder, which he calls, "my yoke?" When bullocks are yoked, there
          are generally two. I have watched them in Northern Italy, and noticed
          that when two are yoked together, and they are perfectly agreed, the
          yoke is always easy to both of them. If one were determined to lie
          down and the other to stand up, the yoke would be very uncomfortable;
          but when they are both of one mind you will see them look at each
          other with those large, lustrous, brown eyes of theirs so lovingly,
          and with a look they read each other's minds, so that when one wants
          to lie down, down they go, or when one wishes to go forward, forward
          they both go, keeping step. In this way the yoke is easy. Now I think
          the Saviour says to us, "I am bearing one end of the yoke on my
          shoulder; come, my disciple, place your neck under the other side of
          it, and then learn of me. Keep step with me, be as I am, do as I do. I
          am meek and lowly in heart; your heart must be like mine, and then we
          will work together in blessed fellowship, and you will find that
          working with me is a happy thing; for my yoke is easy to me, and will
          be to you. Come, then, true yoke-fellow, come and be yoked with me,
          take my yoke upon you, and learn of me." If that be the meaning of the
          text, and perhaps it is, it invites us to a fellowship most near and
          honorable. If it be not the meaning of the text, it is at any rate a
          position to be sought after, to be laborers together with Christ,
          bearing the same yoke. Such be our lot. Amen.
