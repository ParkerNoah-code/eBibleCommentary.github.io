        <p>Of the arraigned.</p>
        <p>
          A person arraigned ought to plead his cause before his judge; and an
          arraigned person may refuse to speak, if he choose so, before one who
          is not his own proper judge; and indulgence (induci√¶) should be
          granted to the arraigned as often as they appeal.<br />
