        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1908)</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;
          yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall
          abhor me." -- Job 9:30, 31.
        </p>
        <p>
          I FEEL certain that I am sent on a special errand at this time. Before
          my mind's eye I see a soul whose awful reflections are hurrying him to
          despair. He refuses counsel, and will not listen to direction, for
          dread has made him desperate. I would have a word in the ear of that
          worried and wearied one. See ye not the man? He has battled long
          against a dark temptation, but at last he is beaten. He feels that he
          can hold out no longer. He can scarcely take breath; the air grows hot
          and stifling around him, as he faces the question -- what next?
          Accustomed as I am to look down on these crowded aisles and up at
          these closely-packed galleries, I feel a strange curiosity as I gaze
          into the mass; for I know that there is one man among all of you to
          whom I have a private message. I carry despatches from the King of
          kings to one who is grievously troubled, and is become as a woman
          forsaken and despised. My Lord and Master described himself in parable
          as leaving the ninety-and-nine to seek for one lost sheep: I must now
          copy his example. You will not grudge me for this service, I am sure.
          I quit the throng that I may find the bewildered one, and bring him
          safe and sound to the fold.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turning to my text, let me say, that as one is startled by a shriek,
          or saddened by a groan, so these sharp utterances of Job astonish us
          at first, and then awake our pity. How much are we troubled with
          brotherly compassion as we read the words, -- "If I wash myself with
          snow water, and make my hands never so clean; yet shalt thou plunge me
          in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me!" The sense of
          misery couched in this passage baffles description. Yet this is but
          one of a series, in which sentence after sentence reveals a fresh
          chamber of horrors. The similitudes of grief are here piled up in
          heaps, with what an old author has spoken of as the "rhetoric of
          sorrow." Physical sufferings had produced a strain on Job's mind, and
          he sought relief by expressing his anguish. Like some solitary
          prisoner in the gloomy keep of an old castle, he graves on the walls
          pictures of the abject despondencies which haunt him. His afflictions
          are aggravated by vain efforts to alleviate them: he wounds his hand
          with the rough hammer and nail with which he is engraving his griefs.
          Of such tortures many of us have had a taste.
        </p>
        <p>
          From my experience, as a patient myself, smitten down with
          soul-sickness; and from my observation as a pastor, into whose ears
          the woes of awakened sinners are constantly poured, I have somewhat
          learned to understand the imagery of Job. The sufferer is in double
          straits. While he is tossed about by Satan, his friends are
          discharging their arrows at him, and the Almighty troubleth him. To
          help such a sufferer we must be careful to distinguish between the
          causes of his sorrow, and divide between his affliction itself and the
          further sorrows which he has brought upon himself by his unwise
          efforts to escape from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such, then, is the line of thought we will pursue. I shall make four
          divisions; three of them are to be found in the text, and the fourth
          will follow on, as an important consequence. First, we shall notice
          that a quickened soul becomes conscious of guilt; secondly, the soul
          that is quickened makes ineffectual attempts to rid itself of the
          stain of guilt; thirdly, to deter his people from self-righteousness
          it pleases God to plunge deeper into the mire those who attempt to
          cleanse themselves; the fourth point is, that only by severe training
          are men led to look alone to God for salvation, -- it needs
          omnipotence to teach us that salvation is of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. At the outset, then, we observe that QUICKENED SOULS ARE CONSCIOUS
          OF GUILT. They see it; they know it; they feel it; and they blush to
          find that they are without excuse for it. All men are sinners: to most
          men, however, sin appears to be a fashion or the times, a necessity of
          nature, a folly of youth, or an infirmity of age, which a slight
          apology will suffice to remove. You will scarcely meet with an
          Englishman who will not acknowledge that he is a sinner. Is it not the
          General Confession stereotyped in the book of Common Prayer? But it is
          one thing to call yourself a sinner, and quite another thing to feel
          it. I have heard of a lady who owned to her minister that she was a
          great sinner. He questioned her kindly as to which of the ten commands
          she had broken. Beginning with the first, he asked her, "Did you ever
          break this?" to which enquiry she indignantly answered, "No." In like
          manner he dealt with the second, and right through the whole ten. She
          professed in detail to have observed each one, and yet pretended to
          confess that she had broken them all. By such equivocations multitudes
          of men and women deceive themselves; and it is unhappily the custom of
          many a preacher to address his congregation as if they were all good
          people, and every one of them knew the Lord, from the least even to
          the greatest. This is pleasing to the flesh, and clattering to pride;
          but it is most pernicious. How many are being deceived by this want of
          marking a difference where a vital difference exists!
        </p>
        <p>
          Not till men are quickened by divine grace do they truly know that
          they are sinners. How is this? Some diseases are so insidious that the
          sufferers fancy that they are getting better, while in very truth they
          are hastening to the grave. After such manner does sin deceive the
          sons of men: they think they are saved when they are still unrenewed.
          How often have I seen a poor girl, whose pale face, sunken eyes,
          shadowy hand, and languid step have clearly betokened that she was on
          the brink of death, yet she mistook the flush of consumption for the
          ruddiness of health. Slowly she waned; but within a day of her
          departure she planned cheerful projects which proved that she looked
          for life. Consumption is not, however, so deceitful as sin. Where it
          has full power over the soul, "the heart is deceitful above all
          things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?" If sin were not so
          deceitful it would not be half so destructive as it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          How is this, you ask again? Few give themselves the trouble to think
          about these matters at all. Ours is an age in which men's thoughts are
          keen upon politics and merchandize, practical science and economic
          inventions, financial schemes and Home Rule, and I know not what
          beside; but sound doctrine and sincere piety are out of vogue. Few
          people trouble themselves to think about their souls' everlasting
          welfare. Men die at the same rate as of yore, but the mortality is
          reckoned by a percentage; and as for the life hereafter it is ignored.
          Friend, have you ever dedicated ten minutes of your time to a
          consideration of your destiny? Days to your ledger; hours to your
          amusements; years to your commercial engagements; would it not be wise
          to reserve some moments for your soul's outlook beyond the grave? You
          have made your last will and testament for the world that is fading
          away, but you have laid up no treasure for the world to come. Is this
          consistent with your usual prudence? I should have good hope for some
          of you if I could make you sit for one hour alone, and think of
          nothing but your souls, your God, and the final judgment. Alas! alas!
          as the horse rusheth to the battle, so men rush to the heated
          competition of the hour. They cannot be persuaded to consider. Poor
          mortals! They concern themselves about everything that does not
          concern them, but they persistently neglect everything that is needful
          to their eternal well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          How is this? we enquire once more. To natural ignorance we may
          attribute much of the ordinary indifference of men to their own
          sinfulness. They live in a benighted age. In vain you boast the
          enlightenment of this nineteenth century: the nineteenth century is
          not one whit more enlightened as to the depravity of human nature than
          the first century. Men are as ignorant of the plague of their own
          hearts to-day as they were when Paul addressed them. I know that
          almost every man you meet with talks as if he were qualified to set up
          for a doctor of divinity; but is not this the confidence of ignorance?
          "Vain man would be wise" -- or read it, if you please, "vain man is
          void of understanding -- though man be born like a wild ass's colt."
          Until God the Holy Ghost takes him in hand no spiritual light enters
          the man's soul. Preaching is an effective means of instructing the
          mind, arousing the conscience, and impressing the hearts of the
          people; and faithful preachers are scattered up and down the country
          within measurable reach of most of your homes. Why, then, is the
          doctrine of human sinfulness so little understood, and so seldom
          accepted as an undeniable fact? Many persons seem startled, and try to
          think that they misunderstand us when we say plainly that in the very
          best man in the world there is no virtue or grace that can be pleasing
          to God, unless he has been made a new creature in Christ Jesus. Let me
          put the truth before you as plainly as I can by speaking of your body
          in order to describe your soul. You probably imagine that your
          physical constitution is sound and healthy. I grant you all you ask on
          that score; yet you are but flesh and blood, like the rest of our
          mortal race, and therefore you are exposed to every disease which
          waylays your fellow creatures. Even so, your deceitful heart is
          capable of as desperate crimes as the vilest of sinners ever
          committed. The evil propensity lurks within, it needs only the
          contagion of society, or the temptation of Satan to bring it out. Does
          not this alarm you? It ought to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hardly a glimmer of the humbling truth of our natural depravity dawns
          on the dull apprehension of the worldly-wise, though souls taught from
          above know it and are appalled by it. In divers ways the discovery
          comes to those whom the Lord ordains to save. Sometimes a preacher
          sent of God lets in the dreadful light. Many men, like the false
          prophet Mokanna, hide their deformity. You may remember the story.
          Mokanna wore a silver veil upon his forehead: should he ever remove it
          the brightness of his countenance would blind the astonished world. In
          truth a foul disease had cankered his brow. God's faithful servants
          are sent to tear off these veils, and expose men to themselves. This
          duty demands courage. Men veil black villainy with self-flattery! Like
          Jezebel, they paint their eyebrows, and tire their heads, till they
          think themselves beautiful. It is ours, like Jehu, to cry, "Throw her
          down." What have they to do with peace who are the servants of sin?
          How dare they pretend to comeliness whose hearts are not right with
          God?
        </p>
        <p>
          How comes it to pass, then, that the best of saints on earth are prone
          to account themselves the chief of sinners? Their sincerity is
          unquestionable. This discovery is due to the Holy Spirit. He it is who
          convinces men of sin. By his mysterious but most blessed agency on the
          hearts of men, a sense of utter ruin is wrought in the chosen, and
          this prepares them to accept the full redemption provided by the
          sacrifice of the Redeemer. We cannot explain to you the mystery of the
          Spirit's operation. "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou
          hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and
          whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit." But
          this we do know -- the Holy Spirit withers all merely human hope and
          righteousness, and thus makes room for trust in the work of our Lord
          Jesus. Man by nature is blindly proud, and proudly blind. The moment
          the Spirit of God comes into a man, the scales fall from his eyes, and
          he sees himself in quite a different light. To each saved soul it
          seems a strange miracle. I have heard the story from simple lips full
          many a time. The new self talks of the old self with a kind of vacant
          wonderment. Yesterday our friend was on good terms with himself as a
          virtuous citizen, an honest trader, a sound churchman; in moral worth
          all that his neighbors could wish. To-day he is vile in his own sight:
          his hands are filthy, his heart is foul, his thoughts are loathsome.
          He perceives that he has been walking in a vain show, and therefore he
          writes himself down a hypocrite. No name too base by which to surname
          himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have I found you out, my friend? Wandering among the motley throng, I
          am in quest of a soul that seeks the mercy of the Lord. Am I not upon
          your track?
        </p>
        <p>
          Mayhap I am at this moment addressing a person who has been the
          subject of a mysterious gloom for which he sees no reason whatever. I
          am right happy to have found him, for I trust I have met with a
          recruit for the army of truth. But why, you may enquire, do I make
          such a remark? I will tell you in a moment. There is a vital
          connection between soul-distress and sound doctrine. Sovereign grace
          is dear to those who have groaned deeply because they see what
          grievous sinners they are. Witness Joseph Hart and John Newton, whose
          hymns you have often sung, or David Brainerd and Jonathan Edwards,
          whose biographies many of you have read. You seldom hear much of God's
          everlasting covenant in these modern times, for few men feel that
          thorough conviction of sin which comes directly from the teaching of
          the Holy Spirit. In the economy of redemption the effectual operation
          of the Spirit in enlightening the heart concerning its own sinfulness
          is sure evidence of the Father's personal love to his chosen people,
          and of the special atonement that the Son of God made for their
          transgressions.
        </p>
        <p>"Ne'er had ye felt the guilt of sin,</p>
        <p>Or sweets of pardoning love,</p>
        <p>Unless your worthless names had been</p>
        <p>Enrolled to life above."</p>
        <p>
          You may walk through a dark cellar without discerning by the eye that
          anything noisome is there concealed. Let the shutters be thrown open!
          Bid the light of day stream in! You soon perceive frogs upon the cold
          clammy pavement, filthy cobwebs hanging on the walls in long festoons,
          foul vermin creeping about everywhere. Startled, alarmed, horrified,
          who would not wish to flee away, and find a healthier atmosphere? The
          rays of the sun are, however, but a faint image of that light divine
          shed by the Holy Spirit, which penetrates the thickest shades of human
          folly and infatuation, and exposes the treachery of the inmost heart.
          Then the soul cries out in agony, "O wretched man that I am! who shall
          deliver me from the body of this death?" When brought to feel this, we
          think our doom is scaled, and everlasting destruction is close upon
          us. But it is not so. This is the way of hope. Through death to life
          every saved soul must pass. Ask us not to paint the sensations; nor
          blame us if we usually describe that experience which is most
          distinct. Sharp conviction, fainting heart, struggling hope, fear that
          haunts, terror that appalls, -- an awful fight of fiercely strange
          emotions! This is the extreme measure of the life-change. In milder
          form, with one decisive pang the true heart is born again. The Slough
          of Despond lies across every pilgrim's pathway. The years or hours it
          takes to wade through it must be left an open question. Sudden death
          is an occasional fact, but more frequently the saints are peacefully
          welcomed to the realms above; so in the church on earth, sudden
          conversions happen, but as a rule men pass gradually into the kingdom
          of God. Between the sensual and the spiritual there is a great gulf,
          and it must be passed. Of the wind or weather in which you make the
          passage it is not for me to speak: the voyage may be long or short;
          but in some sort the gulf must be traversed. Conviction of sin is of
          the first importance: it cannot be dispensed with.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will say, "Why?" Well, we might suggest many reasons. It will make
          mercy the more precious, it will excite horror of sin in the future --
          burnt children dread the fire, it will teach you patience, for no
          future trial will be so severe as this; and it will tend to keep you
          persevering in holiness. But be the reasons what they may, be you sure
          of this, that no soul is saved without being made conscious of its own
          sinfulness.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We pass on to notice that it often happens that AWAKENED SOULS USE
          MANY INEFFECTUAL MEANS TO OBTAIN CLEANSING. Job describes himself as
          washing in snow water, and making his hands never so clean. His
          expressions remind me of my own labor in vain. By how many experiments
          I tried to purify my own soul! Like all my fellows, I was always
          foiled in every attempt. See a squirrel in a cage; the poor thing is
          working away, trying to mount, yet he never rises one inch higher. In
          like case is the sinner who seeks to save himself by his own good
          works, or by any other means: he toils without result. It is
          astonishing what pains men will take in this useless drudgery. They
          prevent the dawn of day in their anxiety to attend matins or observe
          mass; they are austere in their fastings; they say prayers without
          stint and do penance to the full. We should be sorry to impugn their
          sincerity. With what exemplary zeal many in the Anglican Church go
          about to establish their own righteousness! They practice ceremonies,
          with a claim to catholicity which no Catholic will allow. Untiring is
          their diligence in one department or another of amateur office, they
          hope for a reward for doing what God never commanded. Without a
          Scriptural proof of being right in anything, they would fain be
          righteous overmuch in everything. The labor of the foolish in spinning
          a righteousness of their own, that is neither accredited by the divine
          law nor by the holy gospel is almost incredible: they would rather
          give their bodies to be buried and their goods to feed the poor, than
          submit to salvation by grace, though it is the only possible
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In seeking to obtain absolution of their sins, to establish a
          righteousness of their own, and to secure peace of mind, men tax their
          ingenuity to the utmost. Job talks of washing himself with snow water.
          The imagery is, no doubt, meant to be instructive. Why is snow water
          selected? The reason probably was, first, because it was hard to get.
          Far easier, generally, to procure water from the running brooks than
          from melted snow. Men set a high value on that which is difficult to
          procure. Whence comes it that the great majority of the so-called
          Christian world prefer worship conducted with gorgeous ritual and
          stately ceremonial? Is it not the rarity of the thing which creates a
          sense of value? Enter a Popish cathedral, and try, if you can, to
          understand the services. What are all these persons doing dressed in
          red and white, or those other persons in more sombre color?
          Manipulations, genuflexions, prostrations, waving of censers, and
          elevating of hosts -- an array of symbolism which it took ages to
          conglomerate. What is the value of it all, unless it lies in its
          complications and expenses? Our Protestant friends have their milder
          predilections. Organs and orchestras serve them for snow water. In
          measured accents let me speak of music. For psalms and spiritual songs
          you all know I have an ardent passion. My spirit wings its way to the
          very portals of heaven in the words and tunes of our hymns. But for
          your instrumental melodies I have no mind, when you substitute mere
          sound for heartfelt prayer and praise. The obvious simplicity of the
          gospel is the only outward voucher I know of for its inward sincerity.
          Praise is none the better because of the difficulty of the music; say
          rather that the more simple and congregational it is the better by
          far. Forms of worship which are expensive and difficult are greatly
          affected by many, as snow water was thought in Job's day to be a bath
          for kings; but, after all, it is an idle fashion, likely to mislead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, snow water enjoyed a reputation for purity. If you would have
          a natural filtered water gather the newly-fallen snow and melt it. The
          figure represents the religiousness which is of the most rigid kind --
          the cream of the cream. Specimens yet remain among us of piety more
          than possible to men, religiousness above the range of mortals; which
          piety is, however, not of God's grace, and consequently is a vain
          show. Though we should use the purest ceremonies, multiply the best of
          good works, and add thereto the costliest of gifts, yet we should be
          unable to make ourselves clean before God. You may wash yourself till
          you deny the existence of a spot, and yet you may be unclean. You may
          make rigid rules, and find much content in keeping them, and yet
          remain in nature's filthiness. With all your shrewdness you have but
          practiced a human device, and in refusing to trust in the Lord Jesus
          you have failed to observe a divine ordinance; and therefore you will
          fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again, this snow water is probably extolled because it descends
          from the clouds of heaven, instead of bubbling up from the clods of
          earth. Religiousness which can color itself with an appearance of the
          supernatural is very taking with many. Some folks are fond of
          apostolical succession; it professes to come from heaven. No doubt the
          notion originated in cloudland. Others are fascinated by Popery. His
          holiness the Pope is accounted to be a great cistern, full of grace,
          which is distilled in streams, and runs through capacious pipes called
          cardinals, and then through smaller tubes, styled bishops. At length
          by the still smaller pipes of the priests it comes to the people. No
          pretext was ever more paltry than this, and yet many are deceived by
          it. There is no peace in it for thoughtful minds. For such your snow
          water has no solace, because they see no connection between outward
          acts and the purifying of the heart.
        </p>
        <p>Not all the outward forms on earth,</p>
        <p>Nor rites that God has given,</p>
        <p>Nor will of man, nor blood, nor birth,</p>
        <p>Can raise a soul to heaven."</p>
        <p>
          If I "make my hands never so clean," is an expression peculiarly racy
          in the original. The Hebrew word has an allusion to soap or nitre.
          Such was the ordinary and obvious method any one would take to whiten
          his hands when they were grimy. Tradition tells that certain stains of
          blood cleave to the floor. The idea is that human blood, shed in
          murder, can never be scrubbed or scraped off the boards. Thus is it
          most certainly with the dye of sin. The blood of souls is in thy
          skirts, is the terrible language of Jeremiah (2:34). When ye think
          that baptism can begin, that confirmation can further, and that other
          sacraments can complete your purification, ye are mere dupes of your
          own folly. "Though I wash myself in snow water, and make myself never
          so clean; yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes
          shall abhor me." There it stands, it is the testimony of one man, but
          yet it is true; the Almighty attests it, and all human experience
          affirms it. These worthless experiments to cleanse yourselves would be
          ended once for all if you would have regard to the great truth of the
          gospel: "Without shedding of blood there is no remission." "The blood
          of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin." God alone can
          remove sin, and he does so by the blood of Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But AS SURE AS EVER QUICKENED BOWLS TRY TO GET PURITY IN THE
          WRONG WAY, GOD WILL THRUST THEM DOWN INTO THE DITCH. This is a
          terrible predicament. I find, on looking at the passage closely, that
          it means "head over ears in the ditch." It is not merely some filthy
          puddle in which a man treads till he is splashed all over, it is a
          slough of despond into which he sinks. His eyes, his ears, and his
          mouth, are filled with pollution; and his very clothes are so foul
          that he utterly abhors himself. Old Master Caryl, a rare expositor of
          the Book of Job, says that the original can only be equalled in
          English by the expression -- we would not touch such an one with a
          pair of tongs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often it happens with those who try to get better by their own good
          works, that their conscience is awakened by the effort, and they are
          more conscious of sin than ever. If a chosen man strives to save
          himself from his sins by his own righteousness the Lord permits him to
          see his own heart and he ceases from all glorying. The word here
          rendered "ditch" is elsewhere translated "corruption." So in the
          sixteenth Psalm: "Neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see
          corruption." Language cannot paint abasement, reproach, or ignominy in
          stronger terms. "THOU shalt plunge me in the ditch." Is it not as
          though God himself would undertake the business of causing his people
          to know that by their vain ablutions they were making themselves yet
          more vile in his eyes? We read, in the second chapter of Jeremiah, of
          God's remonstrance with Judah: "Though thou wash thee with nitre, and
          take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the
          Lord God. How canst thou say, I am not polluted?"
        </p>
        <p>
          May we not regard this as the discipline of our Heavenly Father's
          love, albeit when passing through the trial we do not perceive it to
          be so? Thus, in the apocalyptic epistle to the church at Laodicea,
          expostulation more severe or more tender it would be hard to
          imagine-"Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and
          have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and
          miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel thee to buy of me
          gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment
          that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do
          not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest
          see." Mark the gentle words, "I counsel thee," addressed to a people
          whose lukewarmness excited nausea! Then follows a sentence of
          encouragement so sweet and enchanting that it almost sounds like an
          apology for the fierceness of the former censure. "As many as I love,
          I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent." A revelation
          of wretched sinfulness ends in a declaration of love and a visit of
          grace; for the Lord goes on to say, "Behold, I stand at the door, and
          knock." Anyhow, the Lord will end the conceit which is the source of
          the lukewarmness: he cannot permit his chosen to remain in
          self-righteous pride; for that his soul hateth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps, my friend, the experience I am trying to describe will come
          to you through the preaching of the Word. This sermon may dishearten
          and distract you. Your hope was thriving like a plant. This sermon
          shrivels every leaf; and though, at the scent of water, the branch of
          self-righteousness will bud again, the next sermon you hear may wither
          even the stem of your confidence. If another sermon soon afterwards
          cuts it down to the very root, the ministry will be profitable to you;
          for the root of pride must be cut up. Believe me, this is mild
          treatment: I trust you may not be left to severer methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Frequently our great Lord leaves a poor wayward soul to eat the fruits
          of its own ways, and this is the severest form of plunging in the
          ditch. While striving after righteousness in a wrong way, the man
          stumbles into the very sin against which he struggled. The young man,
          of whom I am now thinking, resolved, by the help of God, that he would
          be different henceforth from what he ever had been. His vows kept pace
          with his devotions. He started them at early morn --
        </p>
        <p>"And felt, good, easy man, full surely</p>
        <p>His goodness was a-ripening."</p>
        <p>
          To the shop he went, as was his wont; but his thoughts were no longer
          set on earthly things: he stood, as he supposed, on heavenly ground.
          Because he had taken snow-water and had washed his hands, he began to
          think that he was singularly clean. Towards evening a temptation
          suddenly crossed his path. At first he resisted, but it proved a
          feeble fight. The argument of another young man, that it was policy to
          yield, availed to break the covenant he had made with his own
          conscience. So he was led astray to a place of amusement, where the
          light of God's countenance never shines. The wretchedness of his
          reflections on the morrow could not easily be told. He felt that his
          feet were fast in the miry clay, and his garments foully soiled. His
          empty conceit might not have been dislodged from its secret
          lurking-place in his depraved nature without some such perilous
          downfall.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mayhap, there sits out yonder a good sister who has grown familiar
          with spiritual straits. Did you ever happen to hear of Mary
          Huntington, wife of William Huntington, S.S., the famous Calvinistic
          preacher? When he prayed for her, which he did with much affection, he
          confessed before God -- "O Lord, I beseech thee, hear me on her
          behalf. Thou knowest how warmly attached she has ever been to MOSES,
          and what narrow and vain searches she has made in order to find out
          his grave, which thou, in infinite wisdom and mercy, hast thought fit
          to conceal." That prayer, which was published about a century ago, is
          worth preserving in your memory. For that "Mary," like many worthy
          housewives of these days, was rather fond of collecting the rags and
          relics of self. If it had been possible, she would have worn at least
          an apron of the linsey-woolsey of self-righteousness. The Lord will
          not have his handmaids thus arranged: they must be quit of self
          altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our lives through various scenes are drawn and vexed with petty
          provocations. Paltry annoyances are the bane of our peace. Some of
          you, dear sisters, spend your years and your thoughts in a narrow
          circle, and I deeply sympathize with you therein. Without a wish to be
          great, or to enlarge your coast, you intensely desire to be good. To
          do your duty to the best of your ability, is your aim, and therein you
          are worthy of all honor. The lot of many of you is to pass much of
          your time in loneliness; your temptations are therefore peculiar. For
          many a quiet hour you have been busy with domestic employments,
          distracted by no acute anxiety, but cheered by much quiet meditation.
          At such seasons you are apt to get on good terms with yourselves.
          Presently the shades of evening begin to fall. Evening! of which
          Cowper sweetly sings:
        </p>
        <p>"Come, evening, once again, season of peace,</p>
        <p>Return, sweet evening, and continue long!"</p>
        <p>
          You are prepared to welcome home the husband, brother, son, who will
          look for his repast, and seek his well-earned repose. Possibly, my
          sisters, this is your season of temptation. His rough word, his
          needless complaint, his vacant look, when you pine for sympathy puts
          you about. A sense of injustice stings you. It may be very natural,
          but all the same it is very fatal to your sense of superior goodness.
          What more treacherous than one's temper? In a sudden gust of passion,
          you utter words of anger. How gladly would you recall them! but they
          are registered. Down into the ditch of despondency you sink. For days
          to come you feel that you cannot forgive yourself. Your rich mantle of
          righteousness after this tumble in the ditch looks mean enough to
          provoke your own ridicule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus do we, in our different spheres, fly from this to that, and from
          that to the other. Some hope to cleanse away sin by a supreme effort
          of self-denial, or of miraculous faith. Men dream of being clean
          without the blood of Jesus, they even boast of it, and yet their sin
          remaineth. The eye of the judgment may be deceived till we half think
          we are clean; but no sooner does the scale grow thin, or the light
          grow strong, than the conscience perceives its error and learns the
          lesson that no human endeavor can wash out the accursed spot. Let us
          not play at purification, nor vainly hope to satisfy conscience with
          that which renders no satisfaction to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Persons of sensitive disposition, and sedentary habits, are prone to
          seek a righteousness of inward feeling. Let me describe these good
          folks to you. They aim at a righteousness that renounces every fault,
          and they cultivate such graces as are naturally lovely, watching from
          moment to moment their own feelings of joy or grief. Yet these be they
          who get to know, with the keenest anguish, the plague of their own
          hearts. How it happens is sufficiently clear. They try to live by
          their feelings and frames of mind; and what can be more deceitful than
          these sensations? Treacherous as the sea on which you sail so smoothly
          on sunny days, but which, at other times, wrecks your barque without
          mercy, your frames and feelings are not in the least to be depended
          on. One day you are all aglow, the flush of fervor is on your face,
          the next day you feel so dead and cold that prayer would freeze upon
          your lips. Your evidences are dark. You think you have none, and,
          seized with despondency, you lament that "there is no hope." Ah, me!
          the sin-sick soul, given to watch its own symptoms, is brought into
          perilous straits; trying one nostrum after another, sometimes feeling
          a little better, and anon feeling itself much worse. Oh, that it could
          turn from feeling to faith; and look steadily out of inward sensation
          to the work finished once for all by the Lord Jesus!
        </p>
        <p>
          Poor Job was smitten with sore boils from the sole of his foot to the
          crown of his head. No doubt he sent for the doctor -- though we are
          not actually told that he did so. It is likely enough that snow water
          was prescribed to him for a relief. His hands may not have seemed very
          sightly when he used it; there may, at least, have been some
          connection between his physician's prescription and his poetry, when
          he said, "If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so
          clean." Perfection in any one part of conduct would not secure
          cleanness for the rest. Washed hands would be a small matter if the
          boils remained over the rest of the body. This is another aspect of
          the same unsatisfactory expedient that I am wanting to point out to
          you. You are under bad treatment until you walk by faith in Jesus.
          Anything short of grace will prove a mere mockery of your malady. Asa,
          King of Judah, was diseased in his feet. He sought not to the Lord,
          but to the physicians. Asa never recovered; but the Lord restored Job
          to perfect, health. The gratuitous advice which the patriarch received
          in the time of his sore sickness was not worth his gratitude. Of his
          three friends, he said: "Ye are all physicians of no value." Then
          comes back the metaphor which I have repeated so often: "Yet shalt
          thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me."
          After all is said and done by the wisest of men the poor sinner is
          worse off than when they undertook his case. All is vanity till God
          comes in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us not forget that the man who thus described his own case "was
          perfect and upright, one that feared God and eschewed evil." Such a
          case is a puzzle to those who are not enlightened by the Holy Spirit.
          Although Job was renowned for righteousness in his generation, a gleam
          from God's countenance exposed the faultiness of his soul. Does this
          prove him to have been a hypocrite? By no means. His friends supposed
          him to be so, though they had no ground whatever for the suspicion: it
          was their rough way of solving a hard problem. If the patriarch's
          integrity had not been so firm, if his refinement had not been so
          tender, if his piety towards God had not been so invariably
          accompanied by his pity for his brother men; if, in a word, his
          character had not been so complete, his trial and his deliverance
          could not have exhibited the extraordinary lesson which has interested
          and instructed every succeeding generation. He appears before us at
          first in the vigor of health, in the height of prosperity, and in the
          charm of good repute. But oh, the vanity of man! At a touch of God's
          finger, his flesh develops a festering mass of corruption; at a glance
          of God's eye, which searched him through and through, the total
          depravity of human nature at its best estate becomes apparent. "He
          abhors himself in dust and ashes." What next? Utter ruin? Nay, friend,
          it is full redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. By such severe training THE AWAKENED ONE IS LED TO LOOK ALONE TO
          GOD FOR SALVATION, and to find the salvation he looks for. This is my
          last point, and I have no time left to enlarge upon it. What I want is
          that the truth may flash across your mind in a moment. There sits the
          man who is menaced with despair because every effort to extricate
          himself from the tangled web of his own strange experience has left
          him worse than before. Did I attempt to comfort him he would repel my
          kindest expressions. And why? He knows that it is God who condemns
          him. In a British court of justice, when the judge sums up against the
          prisoner, small cheer can he get from the honeyed words of his
          counsel. But hark -- "It is God that justifieth." Whom does he
          justify? The ungodly. He first condemns them in their own consciences;
          and then he justifies them according to his grace. If I receive the
          sentence of death in myself it is the earnest of deliverance in my
          Redeemer. My brother, has light beamed on your soul? I hope I have
          found you, and that the Lord has visited you with his salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want you to notice a simple fact which seems to me to have escaped
          your observation. When the Almighty justified Job he commended him,
          and pronounced a high encomium on his conduct. Whatever mistakes he
          made about himself or his circumstances, in one matter he was clear as
          a bell; He has spoken right of me, saith the Lord. (Job 42:7.) Eliphaz
          and his friends transgressed in this respect. Hearken unto me, ye that
          follow after righteousness, ye that seek it in yourselves, you are all
          on the wrong track. You begin below with the whole duty of man, and
          try to work upward: you are sure to fail. You should begin up yonder,
          with the righteousness of God; and then you could work downward to
          righteousness of daily life. God give you knowledge of salvation by
          grace, to the glory of his own name, and to your own sanctification,
          for Christ's sake! Amen.
