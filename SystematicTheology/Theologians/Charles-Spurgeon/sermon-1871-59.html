        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1026)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, December 24th, 1871, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good
          tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is
          born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the
          Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe
          wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger." -- Luke 2:10-12.
        </p>
        <p>
          WE HAVE NO superstitious regard for times and seasons. Certainly we do
          not believe in the present ecclesiastical arrangement called
          Christmas: first, because we do not believe in the mass at all, but
          abhor it, whether it be said or sung in Latin or in English; and,
          secondly, because we find no Scriptural warrant whatever for observing
          any day as the birthday of the Saviour; and, consequently, its
          observance is a superstition, because not of divine authority.
          Superstition has fixed most positively the day of our Saviour's birth,
          although there is no possibility of discovering when it occurred.
          Fabricius gives a catalogue of 136 different learned opinions upon the
          matter; and various divines invent weighty arguments for advocating a
          date in every month in the year. It was not till the middle of the
          third century that any part of the church celebrated the nativity of
          our Lord; and it was not till very long after the Western church had
          set the example, that the Eastern adopted it. Because the day is not
          known, therefore superstition has fixed it; while, since the day of
          the death of our Saviour might be determined with much certainty,
          therefore superstition shifts the date of its observance every year.
          Where is the method in the madness of the superstitious? Probably the
          fact is that the holy days were arranged to fit in with heathen
          festivals. We venture to assert, that if there be any day in the year,
          of which we may be pretty sure that it was not the day on which the
          Saviour was born, it is the twenty-fifth of December. Nevertheless
          since, the current of men's thoughts is led this way just now, and I
          see no evil in the current itself, I shall launch the bark of our
          discourse upon that stream, and make use of the fact, which I shall
          neither justify nor condemn, by endeavoring to lead your thoughts in
          the same direction. Since it is lawful, and even laudable, to meditate
          upon the incarnation of the Lord upon any day in the year, it cannot
          be in the power of other men's superstitions to render such a
          meditation improper for to-day. Regarding not the day, let us,
          nevertheless, give God thanks for the gift of his dear son.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our text we have before us the sermon of the first evangelist under
          the gospel dispensation. The preacher was an angel, and it was meet it
          should be so, for the grandest and last of all evangels will be
          proclaimed by an angel when he shall sound the trumpet of the
          resurrection, and the children of the regeneration shall rise into the
          fullness of their joy. The key-note of this angelic gospel is joy --
          "I bring unto you good tidings of great joy." Nature fears in the
          presence of God -- the shepherds were sore afraid. The law itself
          served to deepen this natural feeling of dismay; seeing men were
          sinful, and the law came into the world to reveal sin, its tendency
          was to make men fear and tremble under any and every divine
          revelation. The Jews unanimously believed that if any man beheld
          supernatural appearances, he would be sure to die, so that what nature
          dictated, the law and the general beliefs of those under it also
          abetted. But the first word of the gospel ended all this, for the
          angelic evangelist said, "Fear not, behold I bring you good tidings."
          Henceforth, it is to be no dreadful thing for man to approach his
          Maker; redeemed man is not to fear when God unveils the splendor of
          his majesty, since he appears no more a judge upon his throne of
          terror, but a Father unbending in sacred familiarity before his own
          beloved children.
        </p>
        <p>
          The joy which this first gospel preacher spoke of was no mean one, for
          he said, "I bring you good tidings" -- that alone were joy: and not
          good tidings of joy only, but "good tidings of great joy." Every word
          is emphatic, as if to show that the gospel is above all things
          intended to promote, and will most abundantly create the greatest
          possible joy in the human heart wherever it is received. Man is like a
          harp unstrung, and the music of his soul's living strings is
          discordant, his whole nature wails with sorrow; but the son of David,
          that mighty harper, has come to restore the harmony of humanity, and
          where his gracious fingers move among the strings, the touch of the
          fingers of an incarnate God brings forth music sweet as that of the
          spheres, and melody rich as a seraph's canticle. Would God that all
          men felt that divine hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          In trying to open up this angelic discourse this morning, we shall
          note three things: the joy which is spoken of; next, the persons to
          whom this joy comes; and then, thirdly, the sign, which is to us a
          sign as well as to these shepherds -- a sign of the birth and source
          of joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, THE JOY, which is mentioned in our text -- whence
          comes it, and what is it?
        </p>
        <p>
          We have already said it is a "great joy" -- "good tidings of great
          joy." Earth's joy is small, her mirth is trivial, but heaven has sent
          us joy immeasurable, fit for immortal minds. Inasmuch as no note of
          time is appended, and no intimation is given that the message will
          ever be reversed, we may say that it is a lasting joy, a joy which
          will ring all down the ages, the echoes of which shall be heard until
          the trumpet brings the resurrection; aye, and onward for ever and for
          ever. For when God sent forth the angel in his brightness to say, "I
          bring you good tidings of great joy, which be to all people," he did
          as much as say, "From this time forth it shall be joy to the sons of
          men; there shall be peace to the human race, and goodwill towards men
          for ever and for ever, as long as there is glory to God in the
          highest." O blessed thought! the Star of Bethlehem shall never set.
          Jesus, the fairest among ten thousand, the most lovely among the
          beautiful, is a joy for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this joy is expressly associated with the glory of God, by the
          Words, "Glory to God in the highest," we may be quite clear that it is
          a pure and holy joy. No other would an angel have proclaimed, and,
          indeed, no other joy is joy. The wine pressed from the grapes of Sodom
          may sparkle and foam, but it is bitterness in the end, and the dregs
          thereof are death; only that which comes from the clusters of Eschol
          is the true wine of the kingdom, making glad the heart of God and man.
          Holy joy is the joy of heaven, and that, be ye sure, is the very cream
          of joy. The joy of sin is a fire-fountain, having its source in the
          burning soil of hell, maddening and consuming those who drink its
          fire-water; of such delights we desire not to drink. It were to be
          worse than damned to be happy in sin, since it is the beginning of
          grace to be wretched in sin, and the consummation of grace to be
          wholly escaped from sin, and to shudder even at the thought of it. It
          is hell to live in sin and misery, it is a deep lower still when men
          could fashion a joy in sin. God save us from unholy peace and from
          unholy joy! The joy announced by the angel of the nativity is as pure
          as it is lasting, as holy as it is great. Let us then always believe
          concerning the Christian religion that it has its joy within itself,
          and holds its feasts within its own pure precincts, a feast whose
          viands all grow on holy ground. There are those who, to-morrow, will
          pretend to exhibit joy in the remembrance of our Saviour's birth, but
          they will not seek their pleasure in the Saviour: they will need many
          additions to the feast before they can be satisfied. Joy in Immanuel
          would be a poor sort of mirth to them. In this country, too often, if
          one were unaware of the name, one might believe the Christmas festival
          to be a feast of Bacchus, or of Ceres, certainly not a commemoration
          of the Divine birth. Yet is there cause enough for holy joy in the
          Lord himself, and reasons for ecstasy in his birth among men. It is to
          be feared that most men imagine that in Christ there is only
          seriousness and solemnity, and to them consequently weariness, gloom,
          and discontent; therefore, they look out of and beyond what Christ
          allows, to snatch from the tables of Satan the delicacies with which
          to adorn the banquet held in honor of a Saviour. Let it not be so
          among you. The joy which the gospel brings is not borrowed but blooms
          in its own garden. We may truly say in the language of one of our
          sweetest hymns --
        </p>
        <p>"I need not go abroad for joy,</p>
        <p>I have a feast at home,</p>
        <p>My sighs are turned into songs,</p>
        <p>My heart has ceased to roam.</p>
        <p>Down from above the Blessed Dove</p>
        <p>Has come into my breast,</p>
        <p>To witness his eternal love,</p>
        <p>And give my spirit rest."</p>
        <p>
          Let our joy be living water from those sacred wells which the Lord
          himself has digged; may his joy abide in us, that our joy may be full.
          Of Christ's joy we cannot have too much; no fear of running to excess
          when his love is the wine we drink. Oh to be plunged in this pure
          stream of spiritual delights!
        </p>
        <p>
          But why is it that the coming of Christ into the world is the occasion
          of joy? The answer is as follows: -- First, because it is evermore a
          joyous fact that God should be in alliance with man, especially when
          the alliance is so near that God should in very deed take our manhood
          into union with his godhead; so that God and man should constitute one
          divine, mysterious person. Sin had separated between God and man; but
          the incarnation bridges the separation: it is a prelude to the atoning
          sacrifice, but it is a prelude full of the richest hope. From
          henceforth, when God looks upon man, he will remember that his own Son
          is a man. From this day forth, when he beholds the sinner, if his
          wrath should burn, he will remember that his own Son, as man, stood in
          the sinner's place, and bore the sinner's doom. As in the case of war,
          the feud is ended when the opposing parties intermarry, so there is no
          more war between God and man, because God has taken man into intimate
          union with himself. Herein, then, there was cause for joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there was more than that, for the shepherds were aware that there
          had been promises made of old which had been the hope and comfort of
          believers in all ages, and these were now to be fulfilled. There was
          that ancient promise made on the threshold of Eden to the first
          sinners of our race, that the seed of the woman should bruise the
          serpent's head; another promise made to the Father of the faithful
          that in his seed should all the nations of the earth be blessed, and
          promises uttered by the mouths of prophets and of saints since the
          world began. Now, the announcement of the angel of the Lord to the
          shepherds was a declaration that the covenant was fulfilled, that now
          in the fullness oftime God would redeem his word, and the Messiah, who
          was to be Israel's glory and the world's hope; was now really come. Be
          glad ye heavens, and be joyful O earth, for the Lord hath done it, and
          in mercy hath he visited his people. The Lord hath not suffered his
          word to fail, but hath fulfilled unto his people his promises. The
          time to favor Zion, yea the set time, is come. Now that the scepter is
          departed from Judah, behold the Shiloh comes, the Messenger of the
          covenant suddenly appears in his temple!
        </p>
        <p>
          But the angel's song had in it yet fuller reason for joy; for our Lord
          who was born in Bethlehem came as a Saviour. "Unto you is born this
          day a Saviour." God had come to earth before, but not as a Saviour.
          Remember that terrible coming when there went three angels into Sodom
          at night-fall, for the Lord said, "I will go now and see whether it be
          altogether according to the cry thereof." He had come as a spy to
          witness human sin, and as an avenger to lift his hand to heaven, and
          bid the red fire descend and burn up the accursed cities of the plain.
          Horror to the world when God thus descends. If Sinai smokes when the
          law is proclaimed, the earth itself shall melt when the breaches of
          the law are punished. But now not as an angel of vengeance, but as a
          man in mercy God has come; not to spy out our sin, but to remove it;
          not to punish guilt, but to forgive it. The Lord might have come with
          thunderbolts in both his hands he might have come like Elias to call
          fire from heaven; but no, his hands are full of gifts of love, and his
          presence is the guarantee of grace. The babe born in the manger might
          have been another prophet of tears, or another son of thunder, but he
          was not so: he came in gentleness, his glory and his thunder alike
          laid aside.
        </p>
        <p>"Twas mercy filled the throne,</p>
        <p>And wrath stood silent by,</p>
        <p>When Christ on the kind errand came</p>
        <p>To sinners doomed to die."</p>
        <p>
          Rejoice, ye who feel that ye are lost; your Saviour comes to seek and
          save you. Be of good cheer ye who are in prison, for be comes to set
          you free. Ye who are famished and ready to die, rejoice that he has
          consecrated for you a Bethlehem, a house of bread, and he has come to
          be the bread of life to your souls. Rejoice, O sinners, everywhere for
          the restorer of the castaways, the Saviour of the fallen is born. Join
          in the joy, ye saints, for he is the preserver of the saved ones,
          delivering them from innumerable perils, and he is the sure prefecter
          of such as he preserves. Jesus is no partial Saviour, beginning a work
          and not concluding it; but, restoring and upholding, he also prefects
          and presents the saved ones without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing
          before his Father's throne. Rejoice aloud all ye people, let your
          hills and valleys ring with joy, for a Saviour who is mighty to save
          is born among you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor was this all the holy mirth, for the next word has also in it a
          fullness of joy: -- "a Saviour, who is Christ," or the Anointed. Our
          Lord was not an amateur Saviour who came down from heaven upon an
          unauthorized mission; but he was chosen, ordained, and anointed of
          God; he could truly say, "the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because
          the Lord hath anointed me." Here is great comfort for all such as need
          a Saviour; it is to them no mean consolation that God has himself
          authorized Christ to save. There can be no fear of a jar between the
          mediator and the judge, no peril of a nonacceptance of our Saviour's
          work; because God has commissioned Christ to do what he has done, and
          in saving sinners he is only executing his Fathers own will. Christ is
          here called "the anointed." All his people are anointed, and there
          were priests after the order of Aaron who were anointed, but he is the
          anointed, "anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows;" so
          plenteously anointed that, like the unction upon Aaron's head, the
          sacred anointing of the Head of the church distils in copious streams,
          till we who are like the skirts of his garments are made sweet with
          the rich perfume. He is "the anointed" in a threefold sense: as
          prophet to preach the gospel with power; as priest to offer sacrifice;
          as king to rule and reign. In each of these he is preeminent; he is
          such a teacher, priest, and ruler as was never seen before. In him was
          a rare conjunction of glorious offices, for never did prophet, priest,
          and king meet in one person before among the sons of men, nor shall it
          ever be so again. Triple is the anointing of him who is a priest after
          the order of Melchisedec, a prophet like unto Moses, and a king of
          whose dominion there is no end. In the name of Christ, the Holy Ghost
          is glorified, by being seen as anointing the incarnate God. Truly,
          dear brethren, if we did but understand all this, and receive it into
          our hearts, our souls would leap for joy on this Sabbath day, to think
          that there is born unto us a Saviour who is anointed of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          One more note, and this the loudest, let us sound it well and hear it
          well -- "which is Christ the Lord." Now the word Lord, or Kurios, here
          used is tantamount to Jehovah. We cannot doubt that, because it is the
          same word used twice in the ninth verse, and in the ninth verse none
          can question that it means Jehovah. Hear it, "And, lo, the angel of
          the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about
          them." And if this be not enough, read the 23rd verse, "As it is
          written in the law of the Lord, every male that openeth the womb shall
          be called holy to the Lord." Now the word Lord here assuredly refers
          to Jehovah, the one God, and so it must do here. Our Saviour is
          Christ, God, Jehovah. No testimony to his divinity could be plainer;
          it is indisputable. And what joy there is in this; for suppose an
          angel had been our Saviour, he would not have been able to bear the
          load of my sin or yours; or if anything less than God had been set up
          as the ground of our salvation, it might have been found too frail a
          foundation. But if he who undertakes to save is none other than the
          Infinite and the Almighty, then the load of our guilt can be carried
          upon such shoulders, the stupendous labor of our salvation can be
          achieved by such a worker, and that with ease: for all things are
          possible with God, and he is able to save to the uttermost them that
          come unto God by him. Ye sons of men perceive ye here the subject of
          your joy. The God who made you, and against whom you have offended,
          has come down from heaven and taken upon himself your nature that he
          might save you. He has come in the fullness of his glory and the
          infinity of his mercy that he might redeem you. Do you not welcome
          this news? What! will not your hearts be thankful for this? Does this
          matchless love awaken no gratitude? Were it not for this divine
          Saviour, your life here would have been wretchedness, and your future
          existence would have been endless woe. Oh, I pray you adore the
          incarnate God, and trust in him. Then will you bless the Lord for
          delivering you from the wrath to come, and as you lay hold of Jesus
          and find salvation in his name, you will tune your songs to his
          praise, and exult with sacred joy. So much concerning this joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Follow me while I briefly speak of THE PEOPLE to whom this joy
          comes. Observe how the angel begins, "Behold, I bring you good tidings
          of great joy, for unto you is born this day." So, then, the joy began
          with the first who heard it, the shepherds. "To you," saith he; "for
          unto you is born." Beloved hearer, shall the joy begin with you
          to-day? -- for it little avails you that Christ was born, or that
          Christ died, unless unto you a child is born, and for you Jesus bled.
          A personal interest is the main point. "But I am poor," saith one. So
          were the shepherds. O ye poor, to you this mysterious child is born.
          "The poor have the gospel preached unto them." "He shall judge the
          poor and needy, and break in pieces the oppressor." But I am obscure
          and unknown," saith one. So were the watchers on the midnight plain.
          Who knew the men who endured hard toil, and kept their flocks by
          night? But you, unknown of men, are known to God: shall it not be
          said, that "unto you a child is born?" The Lord regardeth not the
          greatness of men, but hath respect unto the lowly. But you are
          illiterate you say, you cannot understand much. Be it so, but unto the
          shepherds Christ was born, and their simplicity did not hinder their
          receiving him, but even helped them to it. Be it so with yourself:
          receive gladly the simple truth as it is in Jesus. The Lord hath
          exalted one chosen out of the people. No aristocratic Christ have I to
          preach to you, but the Saviour of the people, the friend of publicans
          and sinners. Jesus is the true "poor men's friend;" he is "a covenant
          for the people," given to be "a leader and commander to the people."
          To you is Jesus given. O that each heart might truly say, to me is
          Jesus born; for it I truly believe in Jesus, unto me Christ is born,
          and I may be as sure of it as if an angel announced it, since the
          Scripture tells me that if I believe in Jesus He is mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the angel had said "to you," he went on to say, "it shall be to
          all people." But our translation is not accurate, the Greek is, "it
          shall be to all the people." This refers most assuredly to the Jewish
          nation; there can be no question about that; if any one looks at the
          original, he will not find so large and wide an expression as that
          given by our translators. It should be rendered "to all the people."
          And here let us speak a word for the Jews. How long and how sinfully
          has the Christian church despised the most honorable amongst the
          nations! How barbarously has Israel been handled by the so-called
          church! I felt my spirit burn indignantly within me in Rome when I
          stood in the Jew's quarter, and heard of the cruel indignities which
          Popery has heaped upon the Jews, even until recently. At this hour
          there stands in the Jew's quarter a church built right in front of the
          entrance to it, and into this the unhappy Jews were driven forcibly on
          certain occasions. To this church they were compelled to subscribe --
          subscribe, mark you, as worshippers of the one invisible God, to the
          support of a system which is as leprous with idolatry as were the
          Canaanites whom the Lord abhorred. Paganism is not more degrading than
          Romanism. Over the door of this church is placed, in their own tongue
          in the Hebrew, these words: -- "All day long have I stretched out my
          hands to a disobedient and gainsaying generation;" how, by such an
          insult as that, could they hope to convert the Jew. The Jew saw
          everywhere idols which his soul abhorred, and he loathed the name of
          Christ, because he associated it with idol worship, and I do not
          wonder that he did. I praise the Jew that he could not give up his own
          simple theism, and the worship of the true God, for such a base,
          degrading superstition as that which Rome presented to him. Instead of
          thinking it a wonder of unbelief that the Jew is not a Christian, I
          honor him for his faith and his courageous resistance of a fascinating
          heathenism. If Romanism be Christianity I am not, neither could I be,
          a Christian. It were a more manly thing to be a simple believer in one
          God, or even an honest doubter upon all religion, than worship such
          crowds of gods and goddesses as Popery has set up, and to bow, as she
          does, before rotten bones and dead men's winding sheets. Let the true
          Christian church think lovingly of the Jew, and with respectful
          earnestness tell him the true gospel; let her sweep away superstition,
          and set before him the one gracious God in the Trinity of his divine
          Unity; and the day shall yet come when the Jews, who were the first
          apostles to the Gentiles, the first missionaries to us who were afar
          off; shall be gathered in again. Until that shall be, the fullness of
          the church's glory can never come. Matchless benefits to the world are
          bound up with the restoration of Israel; their gathering in shall be
          as life from the dead. Jesus the Saviour is the joy of all nations,
          but let not the chosen race be denied their peculiar share of whatever
          promise holy writ has recorded with a special view to them. The woes
          which their sins brought upon them have fallen thick and heavily; and
          even so let the richest blessings distil upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although our translation is not literally correct, it, nevertheless,
          expresses a great truth, taught plainly in the context; and,
          therefore, we will advance another step. The coming of Christ is a joy
          to all people. It is so, for the fourteenth verse says: "On earth
          peace," which is a wide and even unlimited expression. It adds, "Good
          will towards" -- not Jews, but "men" -- all men. The word is the
          generic name of the entire race, and there is no doubt that the coming
          of Christ does bring joy to all sorts of people. It brings a measure
          of joy even to those who are not Christians. Christ does not bless
          them in the highest and truest sense, but the influence of his
          teaching imparts benefits of an inferior sort, such as they are
          capable of receiving; for wherever the gospel is proclaimed, it is no
          small blessing to all the population. Note this fact: there is no land
          beneath the sun where there is an open Bible and a preached gospel,
          where a tyrant long can hold his place. It matters not who he be,
          whether pope or king; let the pulpit be used properly for the
          preaching of Christ crucified, let the Bible be opened to be read by
          all men, and no tyrant can long rule in peace. England owes her
          freedom to the Bible; and France will never possess liberty, lasting
          and well-established, till she comes to reverence the gospel, which
          too long she has rejected. There is joy to all mankind where Christ
          comes. The religion of Jesus makes men think, and to make men think is
          always dangerous to a despot's power. The religion of Jesus Christ
          sets a man free from superstition; when he believes in Jesus, what
          cares he for Papal excommunications, or whether priests give or
          withhold their absolution? The man no longer cringes and bows down; he
          is no more willing, like a beast, to be led by the nose; but, learning
          to think for himself and becoming a man, he disdains the childish
          fears which once held him in slavery. Hence, where Jesus comes, even
          if men do not receive him as the Saviour, and so miss the fullest joy,
          yet they get a measure of benefit; and I pray God that everywhere his
          gospel may be so proclaimed, and that so many may be actuated by the
          spirit of it, that it may be better for all mankind. If men receive
          Christ, there will be no more oppression: the true Christian does to
          others as he would that they should do to him, and there is no more
          contention of classes, nor grinding of the faces of the poor. Slavery
          must go down where Christianity rules, and mark you, if Romanism be
          once destroyed, and pure Christianity shall govern all nations, war
          itself must come to an end; for if there be anything which this book
          denounces and counts the hugest of all crimes, it is the crime of war.
          Put up thy sword into thy sheath, for hath not he said, "Thou shalt
          not kill," and he meant not that it was a sin to kill one but a glory
          to kill a million, but he meant that bloodshed on the smallest or
          largest scale was sinful. Let Christ govern, and men shall break the
          bow and cut the spear in sunder, and burn the chariot in the fire. It
          is joy to all nations that Christ is born, the Prince of Peace, the
          King who rules in righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, beloved, the greatest joy is to those who know Christ as a
          Saviour. Here the song rises to a higher and sublimer note. Unto us
          indeed a child is born, if we can say that he is our "Saviour who is
          Christ the Lord." Let me ask each of you a few personal questions. Are
          your sins forgiven you for his name's sake? Is the head of the serpent
          bruised in your soul? Does the seed of the woman reign in sanctifying
          power over your nature? Oh then, you have the joy that is to all the
          people in the truest form of it; and, dear brother, dear sister, the
          further you submit yourself to Christ the Lord, the more completely
          you know him, and are like him, the fuller will your happiness become.
          Surface joy is to those who live where the Saviour is preached; but
          the great deeps, the great fathomless deeps of solemn joy which
          glisten and sparkle with delight, are for such as know the Saviour,
          obey the anointed one, and have communion with the Lord himself. He is
          the most joyful man who is the most Christly man. I wish that some
          Christians were more truly Christians: they are Christians and
          something else; it were much better if they were altogether
          Christians. Perhaps you know the legend, or perhaps true history of
          the awakening of St. Augustine. He dreamed that he died, and went to
          the gates of heaven, and the keeper of the gates said to him, "Who are
          you?" And he answered, "Christianus sum," I am a Christian. But the
          porter replied, "No, you are not a Christian, you are a Ciceronian,
          for your thoughts and studies were most of all directed to the works
          of Cicero and the classics, and you neglected the teaching of Jesus.
          We judge men here by that which most engrossed their thoughts, and you
          are judged not to be a Christian but a Ciceronian." When Augustine
          awoke, he put aside the classics which he had studied, and the
          eloquence at which he had aimed, and he said, "I will be a Christian
          and a theologian;" and from that time he devoted his thoughts to the
          word of God, and his pen and his tongue to the instruction of others
          in the truth. Oh I would not have it said of any of you, "Well, he may
          be somewhat Christian, but he is far more a keen money-getting
          tradesman." I would not have it said, "Well, he may be a believer in
          Christ, but he is a good deal more a politician." Perhaps he is a
          Christian, but he is most at home when he is talking about science,
          farming, engineering, horses, mining, navigation, or pleasure-taking.
          No, no, you will never know the fullness of the joy which Jesus brings
          to the soul, unless under the power of the Holy Spirit you take the
          Lord your Master to be your All in all, and make him the fountain of
          your intensest delight. "He is my Saviour, my Christ, my Lord," be
          this your loudest boast. Then will you know the joy which the angel's
          song predicts for men.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But I must pass on. The last thing in the text is The SIGN. The
          shepherds did not ask for a sign, but one was graciously given.
          Sometimes it is sinful for us to require as an evidence what God's
          tenderness may nevertheless see fit to give as an aid to faith. Wilful
          unbelief shall have no sign, but weak faith shall have compassionate
          aid. The sign that the joy of the world had come was this, -- they
          were to go to the manger to find the Christ in it, and he was to be
          the sign. Every circumstance is therefore instructive. The babe was
          found "wrapped in swaddling clothes." Now, observe, as you look at
          this infant, that there is not the remotest appearance of temporal
          power here. Mark the two little puny arms of a little babe that must
          be carried if it go. Alas, the nations of the earth look for joy in
          military power. By what means can we make a nation of soldiers? The
          Prussian method is admirable; we must have thousands upon thousands of
          armed men and big cannon and ironclad vessels to kill and destroy by
          wholesale. Is it not a nation's pride to be gigantic in arms? What
          pride flushes the patriot's cheek when he remembers that his nation
          can murder faster than any other people. Ah, foolish generation, ye
          are groping in the flames of hell to find your heaven, raking amid
          blood and bones for the foul thing which ye call glory. A nation's joy
          can never lie in the misery of others. Killing is not the path to
          prosperity; huge armaments are a curse to the nation itself as well as
          to its neighbors. The joy of a nation is a golden sand over which no
          stream of blood has ever rippled. It is only found in that river, the
          streams whereof make glad the city of God. The weakness of submissive
          gentleness is true power. Jesus founds his eternal empire not on force
          but on love. Here, O ye people, see your hope; the mild pacific
          prince, whose glory is his self-sacrifice, is our true benefactor.
        </p>
        <p>
          But look again, and you shall observe no pomp to dazzle you. Is the
          child wrapped in purple and fine linen? Ah, no. Sleeps he in a cradle
          of gold? The manger alone is his shelter. No crown is upon the babe's
          head, neither does a coronet surround the mother's brow. A simple
          maiden of Galilee, and a little child in ordinary swaddling bands, it
          is all you see.
        </p>
        <p>"Bask not in courtly bower,</p>
        <p>Or sunbright hall of power,</p>
        <p>Pass Babel quick,</p>
        <p>and seek the holy land.</p>
        <p>From robes of Tyrian dye,</p>
        <p>Turn with undazzled eye</p>
        <p>To Bethlehem's glade, and by the manger stand."</p>
        <p>
          Alas, the nations are dazzled with a vain show. The pomp of empires,
          the pageants of kings are their delight. How can they admire those
          gaudy courts, in which too often glorious apparel, decorations, and
          rank stand in the stead of virtue, chastity, and truth. When will the
          people cease to be children? Must they for ever crave for martial
          music which stimulates to violence, and delight in a lavish
          expenditure which burdens them with taxation? These make not a nation
          great or joyous. Bah! how has the bubble burst across yon narrow sea.
          A bubble empire has collapsed. Ten thousand bayonets and millions of
          gold proved but a sandy foundation for a Babel throne. Vain are the
          men who look for joy in pomp; it lies in truth and righteousness, in
          peace and salvation, of which yonder new-born prince in the garments
          of a peasant child is the true symbol.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither was there wealth to be seen at Bethlehem. Here in this quiet
          island, the bulk of men are comfortably seeking to acquire their
          thousands by commerce and manufactures. We are the sensible people who
          follow the main chance, and are not to be deluded by ideas of glory;
          we are making all the money we can, and wondering that other nations
          waste so much in fight. The main prop and pillar of England's joy is
          to be found, as some tell us, in the Three per Cents., in the
          possession of colonies, in the progress of machinery, in steadily
          increasing our capital. Is not Mammon a smiling deity? But, here, in
          the cradle of the world's hope at Bethlehem, I see far more of poverty
          than wealth; I perceive no glitter of gold, or spangle of silver. I
          perceive only a poor babe, so poor, so very poor, that he is in a
          manger laid; and his mother is a mechanic's wife, a woman who wears
          neither silk nor gem. Not in your gold, O Britons, will ever lie your
          joy, but in the gospel enjoyed by all classes, the gospel freely
          preached and joyfully received. Jesus, by raising us to spiritual
          wealth, redeems us from the chains of Mammon, and in that liberty
          gives us joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here, too, I see no superstition. I know the artist paints angels
          in the skies, and surrounds the scene with a mysterious light, of
          which tradition's tongue of falsehood has said that it made midnight
          as bright as noon. This is fiction merely; there was nothing more
          there than the stable, the straw the oxen ate, and perhaps the beasts
          themselves, and the child in the plainest, simplest manner, wrapped as
          other children are; the cherubs were invisible and of haloes there
          were none. Around this birth of joy was no sign of superstition: that
          demon dared not intrude its tricks and posturings into the sublime
          spectacle: it would have been there as much out of place as a
          harlequin in the holy of holies. A simple gospel, a plain gospel, as
          plain as that babe wrapped in the commonest garments, is this day the
          only hope for men. Be ye wise and believe in Jesus, and abhor all the
          lies of Rome, and inventions of those who ape her detestable
          abominations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor does the joy of the world lie in philosophy. You could not have
          made a schoolmen's puzzle of Bethlehem if you had tried to do so; it
          was just a child in the manger and a Jewish woman looking on and
          nursing it, and a carpenter standing by. There was no metaphysical
          difficulty there, of which men could say, "A doctor of divinity is
          needed to explain it, and an assembly of divines must expound it." It
          is true the wise men came there, but it was only to adore and offer
          gifts; would that all the wise had been as wise as they. Alas, human
          subtlety has disputed over the manger, and logic has darkened counsel
          with its words. But this is one of man's many inventions; God's work
          was sublimely simple. Here was "The Word made flesh" to dwell among
          us, a mystery for faith, but not a football for argument. Mysterious,
          yet the greatest simplicity that was ever spoken to human ears, and
          seen by mortal eyes. And such is the gospel, in the preaching of which
          our apostle said, "we use great plainness of speech." Away, away, away
          with your learned sermons, and your fine talk, and your pretentious
          philosophies; these never created a jot of happiness in this world.
          Fine-spun theories are fair to gaze on, and to bewilder fools, but
          they are of no use to practical men, they comfort not the sons of
          toil, nor cheer the daughters of sorrow. The man of common sense, who
          feels the daily rub and tear of this poor world, needs richer
          consolation than your novel theologies, or neologies, can give him. In
          a simple Christ, and in a simple faith in that Christ, there is a
          peace deep and lasting; in a plain, poor man's gospel there is a joy
          and a bliss unspeakable, of which thousands can speak, and speak with
          confidence, too, for they declare what they do know, and testify what
          they have seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          I say, then, to you who would know the only true peace and lasting
          joy, come ye to the babe of Bethlehem, in after days the Man of
          Sorrows, the substitutionary sacrifice for sinners. Come, ye little
          children, ye boys and girls, come ye; for he also was a boy. "The holy
          child Jesus" is the children's Saviour, and saith still, "Suffer the
          little children to come unto me, and forbid them not. Come hither, ye
          maidens, ye who are still in the morning of your beauty, and, like
          Mary, rejoice in God your Saviour. The virgin bore him on her bosom,
          so come ye and bear him in your hearts, saying, "Unto us a child is
          born, onto us a son is given." And you, ye men in the plenitude of
          your strength, remember how Joseph cared for him, and watched with
          reverent solicitude his tender years; be you to his cause as a Father
          and a helper; sanctify your strength to his service. And ye women
          advanced in years, ye matrons and widows, come like Anna and bless the
          Lord that you have seen the salvation of Israel, and ye hoar heads,
          who like Simeon are ready to depart, come ye and take the Saviour in
          your arms, adoring him as your Saviour and your all. Ye shepherds, ye
          simple hearted, ye who toil for your daily bread, come and adore the
          Saviour; and stand not back ye wise men, ye who know by experience and
          who by meditation peer into deep truth, come ye, and like the sages of
          the East bow low before his presence, and make it your honor to pay
          honor to Christ the Lord. For my own part, the incarnate God is all my
          hope and trust. I have seen the world's religion at the fountain head,
          and my heart has sickened within me; I come back to preach, by God's
          help, yet more earnestly the gospel, the simple gospel of the Son of
          Man. Jesus, Master, I take thee to be mine for ever! May all in this
          house, through the rich grace of God, be led to do the same, and may
          they all be thine, great Son of God, in the day of thine appearing,
          for thy love's sake. Amen.
