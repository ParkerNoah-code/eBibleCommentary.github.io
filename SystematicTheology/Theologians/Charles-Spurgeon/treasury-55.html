<p align="justify">TITLE. <b>To the Chief Musician</b>. If the leader of the 
    choir is privileged to sing the jubilates of divine grace, he must not 
    disdain to chant the miseries of human depravity. This is the second time he 
    has had the same Psalm entrusted to him (see Psalm 14), and he must, 
    therefore, be the more careful in singing it. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Upon Mahalath</p></b>. Here the tune is chosen for the 
    musician, probably some mournfully solemn air; or perhaps a musical 
    instrument is here indicated, and the master of the choir is requested to 
    make it the prominent instrument in the orchestra; at any rate, this is a 
    direction not found in the former copy of the Psalm, and seems to call for 
    greater care. 
<p align="justify">The word "Mahalath" appears to signify, in some forms of 
    it, "disease," and truly this Psalm is THE SONG OF MAN'S DISEASE—the mortal, 
    hereditary taint of sin. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Maschil</p></b>. This is a second additional note not found 
    in Psalm 14, indicating that double attention is to be given to this most 
    instructive song. 
<b>
<p align="justify">A Psalm of David</p></b>. It is not a copy of the fourteenth 
    Psalm, emended and revised by a foreign hand; it is another edition by the 
    same author, emphasized in certain parts, and rewritten for another purpose.
<p align="justify">SUBJECT. The evil nature of man is here brought before 
    our view a second time, in almost the same inspired words<i>. All 
    repetitions are not vain repetitions. </i>We are slow to learn, and need 
    line upon line. </p>
<p align="justify">David after a long life, found men no better than they 
    were in his youth. Holy Writ never repeats itself needlessly, there is good 
    cause for the second copy of this Psalm; let us read it with more profound 
    attention than before. If our age has advanced from fourteen to fifty-three, 
    we shall find the doctrine of this Psalm more evident than in our youth. The 
    reader is requested to peruse Psalm 14, "Treasury of David".<br/>

<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. The fool has said in his heart: There is no God.</p></b> 
    And this he does because he is a fool. Being a fool he speaks according to 
    his nature; being a great fool he meddles with a great subject, and comes to 
    a wild conclusion. <i>The atheist is, morally as well as mentally, a fool</i>—a 
    fool in the heart as well as in the head; a fool in morals as well as in 
    philosophy. With the denial of God as a starting point, we may well conclude 
    that the fool's progress is a rapid, riotous, raving, ruinous one. He who 
    begins at impiety, is ready for anything.
<b>
<p align="justify">No God</p></b>, being interpreted, means no law, no order, no 
    restraint to lust, no limit to passion. Who but a fool would be of this 
    mind? What a Bedlam, or rather what an Aceldama, would the world become if 
    such lawless principles came to be universal! He who heartily entertains an 
    irreligious spirit, and follows it out to its legitimate outcomes is a son 
    of Belial, dangerous to the commonwealth, irrational, and despicable. Every 
    natural man is, more or less a denier of God. <i>Practical atheism is the 
    religion of the human race.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Corrupt are they.</p></b> They are rotten. It is idle to 
    compliment them as sincere doubters, and amiable thinkers—they are <i>putrid</i>. 
    There is too much dainty dealing nowadays with atheism; it is not a harmless 
    error, it is an offensive, putrid sin, and righteous men should look upon it 
    in that light. <i>All men being more or less atheistic in spirit, are also 
    in that degree corrupt</i>; their heart is foul, their moral nature is 
    decayed.
<b>
<p align="justify">And have done abominable iniquity.</p></b> <i>Bad principles 
    soon lead to bad lives</i>. One does not find virtue promoted by the example 
    of your <i>Voltaires </i>and <i>Tom Paines</i>. Those who <i>talk </i>so 
    abominably as to deny their Maker, will <i>act </i>abominably when it serves 
    their turn. It is the abounding denial and forgetfulness of God among men, 
    which is the source of the unrighteousness and crime which we see around us. 
    If all men are not outwardly wicked, it is to be accounted for by the power 
    of other and better principles. But left to itself the "No God" spirit so 
    universal in mankind would produce nothing but the most loathsome actions.
<b>
<p align="justify">There is none that does good.</p></b> The one typical fool is 
    reproduced in the whole race; without a single exception men have forgotten 
    the right way. This accusation twice made in the Psalm, and repeated a third 
    time by the inspired apostle Paul—is an indictment most solemn and sweeping, 
    but he who makes it cannot err, he knows what is in man; neither will he lay 
    more to man's charge than he can prove.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. God looked down from Heaven upon the children of 
    men. </p></b>He did so in ages past, and he has continued his steadfast gaze 
    from his all surveying observatory. 
<b>
<p align="justify">To see if there were any that did understand, that did 
    seek God. </p></b>Had there been one understanding man, one true lover of his 
    God—the divine eye would have discovered him. Those <i>pure heathens </i>and
    <i>admirable savages </i>that men talk so much of, do not appear to have 
    been visible to the eye of Omniscience—the fact being that they live nowhere 
    but in the realm of fiction. 
<p align="justify">The Lord did not look for great grace, but only for 
    sincerity and right desire, but these he found not. He saw all nations, and 
    all men in all nations, and all hearts in all men, and all motions of all 
    hearts—but he saw neither a clear head nor a clean heart among them all. 
    Where God's eyes see no favorable sign, we may rest assured there is none.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. Every one of them is gone back.</p></b> The whole 
    mass of manhood, all of it, is gone back. In the fourteenth Psalm it was 
    said to turn aside, which was bad enough, but here it is described as 
    running in a diametrically opposite direction. The life of unregenerate 
    manhood is in direct defiance of the law of God—not merely apart from it, 
    but opposed to it. 
<b>
<p align="justify">They are altogether become filthy.</p></b> The whole lump is 
    soured with an evil leaven, fouled with an all pervading pollution, made 
    rank with general putrefaction! 
<p align="justify">Thus, in God's sight, our atheistic nature is not the 
    light thing that we think it to be. Errors as to God are not the mild 
    diseases which some account them, they are abominable evils. Fair is the 
    world to blind eyes, but to the all seeing Jehovah it is otherwise. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">There is none that does good, no, not one. </p></b>How could 
    there be, when the whole mass was leavened with so evil a leaven? This puts 
    an end to the fictions of the <i>innocent savage</i>. 
<p align="justify">The fallen race of man, left to its own energy, has not 
    produced a single lover of God or doer of holiness—nor will it ever do so. 
    Grace must interpose, or not one specimen of humanity will be found to 
    follow after the good and true. This is <i>God's verdict </i>after looking 
    down upon the race. Who shall gainsay it?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge?</p></b> 
    They have no wisdom, certainly, but even so common a thing as knowledge 
    might have restrained them. Can they not see that there is a God? Can they 
    not see that sin is an evil thing? Can they not see that persecution recoils 
    upon a man's own head? Are they such utter fools as not to know that they 
    are their own enemies, and are ruining themselves? 
<b>
<p align="justify">Who eat up my people as they eat bread.</p></b> Do they not 
    see that such food will be hard to digest, and will bring on them a horrible 
    vomit when God deals with them in justice? Can they imagine that the Lord 
    will allow them to devour his people with impunity? They must be insane 
    indeed.
<b>
<p align="justify">They have not called upon God. </p></b>They carry on their 
    cruel enterprises against the saints, and use every means but that which is 
    essential to success in every case, namely, the invocation of God. In this 
    respect persecutors are rather more consistent than Pharisees who devoured 
    widow's houses, and prayed too. The natural man, like Ishmael, loves not the 
    spiritual seed, is very jealous of it, and would gladly destroy it, because 
    it is beloved of God; yet the natural man does not seek after the like favor 
    from God. The carnal mind envies those who obtain mercy, and yet it will not 
    seek mercy itself. It plays the <i>dog </i>in the manger. Sinners will, out 
    of a malicious jealousy, devour those who pray—but yet they will not pray 
    themselves.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. There they were in great fear, where no fear 
    was.</p></b> David sees the end of the ungodly, and the ultimate triumph of the 
    spiritual seed. The rebellious march in fury against the gracious, but 
    suddenly they are seized with a causeless panic. The once fearless boasters, 
    now tremble like the leaves of the aspen, frightened at their own shadows.
    
<p align="justify">In this sentence and this verse, this Psalm differs much 
    from the fourteenth. It is evidently expressive of a higher state of 
    realization in the poet, he emphasizes the truth by stronger expressions.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Without cause the wicked are alarmed.</p></b> He who denies 
    God is at bottom a coward. In his infidelity he is like the boy in the 
    churchyard who "whistles to keep his courage up."
<b>
<p align="justify">For God has scattered the bones of him that encamps 
    against you.</p></b> When the wicked see the destruction of their fellows, they 
    may well quail. Mighty were the hosts which besieged Zion, but they were 
    defeated, and their unburied carcasses proved the prowess of the God whose 
    being they dared to deny. 
<b>
<p align="justify">You have put them to shame, because God has despised 
    them.</p></b> God's people may well look with derision upon their enemies since 
    they are the objects of divine contempt. They scoff at us—but we may with 
    far greater reason laugh them to scorn, because the Lord our God considers 
    them as less than nothing and vanity.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of 
    Zion. </p></b>Would God the final battle were well over. When will the Lord 
    avenge his own elect? When will the long oppression of the saints come to 
    its close, and glory crown their heads? 
<p align="justify">The word <i>salvation </i>is in the plural, to show its 
    greatness. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">When God brings back the captivity of his people, Jacob 
    shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</p></b> Inasmuch as the yoke has been 
    heavy, and the bondage cruel—the liberty will be happy, and the triumph 
    joyous. The second advent and the restoration of Israel are our hope and 
    expectation.
