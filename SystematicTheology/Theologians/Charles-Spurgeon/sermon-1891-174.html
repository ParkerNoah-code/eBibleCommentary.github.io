          1. If, however, any shall endeavour to allegorize [prophecies] of this
          kind, they shall not be found consistent with themselves in all
          points, and shall be confuted by the teaching of the very expressions
          [in question]. For example: "When the cities" of the Gentiles "shall
          be desolate, so that they be not inhabited, and the houses so that
          there shall be no men in them and the land shall be left desolate."
          "For, behold," says Isaiah, "the day of the Lord cometh past remedy,
          full of fury and wrath, to lay waste the city of the earth, and to
          root sinners out of it." And again he says, "Let him be taken away,
          that he behold not the glory of God." And when these things are done,
          he says, "God will remove men far away, and those that are left shall
          multiply in the earth." "And they shall build houses, and shall
          inhabit them themselves: and plant vineyards, and eat of them
          themselves." For all these and other words were unquestionably spoken
          in reference to the resurrection of the just, which takes place after
          the coming of Antichrist, and the destruction of all nations under his
          rule; in [the times of] which [resurrection] the righteous shall reign
          in the earth, waxing stronger by the sight of the Lord: and through
          Him they shall become accustomed to partake in the glory of God the
          Father, and shall enjoy in the kingdom intercourse and communion with
          the holy angels, and union with spiritual beings; and [with respect
          to] those whom the Lord shall find in the flesh, awaiting Him from
          heaven, and who have suffered tribulation, as well as escaped the
          hands of the Wicked one. For it is in reference to them that the
          prophet says: "And those that are left shall multiply upon the earth,"
          And Jeremiah the prophet has pointed out, that as many believers as
          God has prepared for this purpose, to multiply those left upon earth,
          should both be under the rule of the saints to minister to this
          Jerusalem, and that [His] kingdom shall be in it, saying, "Look around
          Jerusalem towards the east, and behold the joy which comes to thee
          from God Himself. Behold, thy sons shall come whom thou hast sent
          forth: they shall come in a band from the east even unto the west, by
          the word of that Holy One, rejoicing in that splendour which is from
          thy God. O Jerusalem, put off thy robe of mourning and of affliction,
          and put on that beauty of eternal splendour from thy God. Gird thyself
          with the double garment of that righteousness proceeding from thy God;
          place the mitre of eternal glory upon thine head. For God will show
          thy glory to the whole earth under heaven. For thy name shall for ever
          be called by God Himself, the peace of righteousness and glory to him
          that worships God. Arise, Jerusalem, stand on high, and look towards
          the east, and behold thy sons from the rising of the sun, even to the
          west, by the Word of that Holy One, rejoicing in the very remembrance
          of God. For the footmen have gone forth from thee, while they were
          drawn away by the enemy. God shall bring them in to thee, being borne
          with glory as the throne of a kingdom. For God has decreed that every
          high mountain shall be brought low, and the eternal hills, and that
          the valleys be filled, so that the surface of the earth be rendered
          smooth, that Israel, the glory of God, may walk in safety. The woods,
          too, shall make shady places, and every sweet-smelling tree shall be
          for Israel itself by the command of God. For God shall go before with
          joy in the light of His splendour, with the pity and righteousness
          which proceeds from Him."

          2. Now all these things being such as they are, cannot be understood
          in reference to super-celestial matters; "for God," it is said, "will
          show to the whole earth that is under heaven thy glory." But in the
          times of the kingdom, the earth has been called again by Christ [to
          its pristine condition], and Jerusalem rebuilt after the pattern of
          the Jerusalem above, of which the prophet Isaiah says, "Behold, I have
          depicted thy walls upon my hands, and thou art always in my sight."
          And the apostle, too, writing to the Galatians, says in like manner,
          "But the Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us
          all." He does not say this with any thought of an erratic Ã†on, or of
          any other power which departed from the Pleroma, or of Prunicus, but
          of the Jerusalem which has been delineated on [God's] hands. And in
          the Apocalypse John saw this new [Jerusalem] descending upon the new
          earth. For after the times of the kingdom, he says, "I saw a great
          white throne, and Him who sat upon it, from whose face the earth fled
          away, and the heavens; and there was no more place for them." And he
          sets forth, too, the things connected with the general resurrection
          and the judgment, mentioning "the dead, great and small." "The sea,"
          he says, "gave up the dead which it had in it, and death and hell
          delivered up the dead that they contained; and the books were opened.
          Moreover," he says, "the book of life was opened, and the dead were
          judged out of those things that were written in the books, according
          to their works; and death and hell were sent into the lake of fire,
          the second death." Now this is what is called Gehenna, which the Lord
          styled eternal fire. "And if any one," it is said, "was not found
          written in the book of life, he was sent into the lake of fire." And
          after this, he says, "I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the
          first heaven and earth have passed away; also there was no more sea.
          And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from heaven, as a
          bride adorned for her husband." "And I heard," it is said, "a great
          voice from the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with
          men, and He will dwell with them; and they shall be His people, and
          God Himself shall be with them as their God. And He will wipe away
          every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more, neither
          sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, because the
          former things have passed away." Isaiah also declares the very same:
          "For there shall be a new heaven and a new earth; and there shall be
          no remembrance of the former, neither shall the heart think about
          them, but they shall find in it joy and exultation." Now this is what
          has been said by the apostle: "For the fashion of this world passeth
          away." To the same purpose did the Lord also declare, "Heaven and
          earth shall pass away." When these things, therefore, pass away above
          the earth, John, the Lord's disciple, says that the new Jerusalem
          above shall [then] descend, as a bride adorned for her husband; and
          that this is the tabernacle of God, in which God will dwell with men.
          Of this Jerusalem the former one is an image -- that Jerusalem of the
          former earth in which the righteous are disciplined beforehand for
          incorruption and prepared for salvation. And of this tabernacle Moses
          received the pattern in the mount; and nothing is capable of being
          allegorized, but all things are stedfast, and true, and substantial,
          having been made by God for righteous men's enjoyment. For as it is
          God truly who raises up man, so also does man truly rise from the
          dead, and not allegorically, as I have shown repeatedly. And as he
          rises actually, so also shall he be actually disciplined beforehand
          for incorruption, and shall go forwards and flourish in the times of
          the kingdom, in order that he may be capable of receiving the glory of
          the Father. Then, when all things are made new, he shall truly dwell
          in the city of God. For it is said, "He that sitteth on the throne
          said, Behold, I make all things new. And the Lord says, Write all
          this; for these words are faithful and true. And He said to me, They
          are done." And this is the truth of the matter.
