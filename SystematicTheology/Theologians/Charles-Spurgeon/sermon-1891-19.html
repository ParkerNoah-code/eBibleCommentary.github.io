          1. I wish also to explain to thee their theory as to the way in which
          the creation itself was formed through the mother by the Demiurge (as
          it were without his knowledge), after the image of things invisible.
          They maintain, then, that first of all the four elements, fire, water,
          earth, and air, were produced after the image of the primary Tetrad
          above, and that then, we add their operations, viz., heat, cold,
          dryness, and humidity, an exact likeness of the Ogdoad is presented.
          They next reckon up ten powers in the following manner: -- There are
          seven globular bodies, which they also call heavens; then that
          globular body which contains these, which also they name the eighth
          heaven; and, in addition to these, the sun and moon. These, being ten
          in number, they declare to be types of the invisible Decad, which
          proceeded from Logos and Zoe. As to the Duodecad, it is indicated by
          the zodiacal circle, as it is called; for they affirm that the twelve
          signs do most manifestly shadow forth the Duodecad, the daughter of
          Anthropos and Ecclesia. And since the highest heaven, beating upon the
          very sphere [of the seventh heaven], has been linked with the most
          rapid precession of the whole system, as a check, and balancing that
          system with its own gravity, so that it completes the cycle from sign
          to sign in thirty years, -- they say that this is an image of Horus,
          encircling their thirty-named mother. And then, again, as the moon
          travels through her allotted space of heaven in thirty days, they
          hold, that by these days she expresses the number of the thirty Ã†ons.
          The sun also, who runs through his orbit in twelve months, and then
          returns to the same point in the circle, makes the Duodecad manifest
          by these twelve months; and the days, as being measured by twelve
          hours, are a type of the invisible Duodecad. Moreover, they declare
          that the hour, which is the twelfth part of the day, is composed of
          thirty parts, in order to set forth the image of the Triacontad. Also
          the circumference of the zodiacal circle itself contains three hundred
          and sixty degrees (for each of its signs comprises thirty); and thus
          also they affirm, that by means of this circle an image is preserved
          of that connection which exists between the twelve and the thirty.
          Still further, asserting that the earth is divided into twelve zones,
          and that in each zone it receives power from the heavens, according to
          the perpendicular [position of the sun above it], bringing forth
          productions corresponding to that power which sends down its influence
          upon it, they maintain that this is a most evident type of the
          Duodecad and its offspring.

          2. In addition to these things, they declare that the Demiurge,
          desiring to imitate the infinitude, and eternity, and immensity, and
          freedom from all measurement by time of the Ogdoad above, but, as he
          was the fruit of defect, being unable to express its permanence and
          eternity, had recourse to the expedient of spreading out its eternity
          into times, and seasons, and vast numbers of years, imagining, that by
          the multitude of such times he might imitate its immensity. They
          declare further, that the truth having escaped him, he followed that
          which was false, and that, for this reason, when the times are
          fulfilled, his work shall perish.<br />
