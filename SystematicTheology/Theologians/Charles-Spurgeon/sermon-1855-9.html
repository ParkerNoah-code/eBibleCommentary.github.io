        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.10)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, January 28th, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "And hast made us unto our God kings and priests; and we shall reign
          on the earth." -- Revelation 5:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          MUSIC HATH Charms." I am sure sacred music has; for I have felt
          something of its charms whilst we have been singing that glorious hymn
          just now. There is a potency in harmony; there is a magic power in
          melody, which either melts the soul to pity, or lifts it up to joy
          unspeakable. I do not know how it may be with some minds; they
          possibly may resist the influence of singing; but I cannot. When the
          saints of God, in full chorus, "chaunt the solemn lay," and when I
          hear sweet syllables fall from their lips, keeping measure and time,
          then I feel elevated; and, forgetting for a time everything
          terrestrial, I soar aloft towards heaven. If such be the sweetness of
          the music of the saints below, where there is much of discord and sin
          to mar the harmony, how sweet must it be to sing above, with cherubim
          and seraphim. Oh, what songs must those be which the Eternal ever
          hears upon his throne! What seraphic sonnets must those be which are
          thrilled from the lips of pure immortals, untainted by a sin,
          unmingled with a groan: where they warble ever hymns of joy and
          gladness, never intermingled with one sigh, or groan, or worldly care.
          Happy songsters! When shall I your chorus join? There is one of your
          hymns that runs --
        </p>
        <p>"Hark! how they sing before the throne!"</p>
        <p>
          and I have sometimes thought I could "hark! how they sing before the
          throne." I have imagined that I could hear the full burst of the swell
          of the chorus, when it pealed from heaven like mighty thunders, and
          the sound of many waters, and have almost heard those full-toned
          strains, when the harpers harped with their harps be fore the throne
          of God; alas, it was but imagination. We cannot hear it now; these
          ears are not fitted for such music; these souls could not be contained
          in the body, if we were once to hear some stray note from the harps of
          angels. We must wait till we get up yonder. Then, purified, like
          silver seven times, from the defilement of earth, washed in our
          Saviour's precious blood, sanctified by the purifying influence of the
          Holy Spirit --
        </p>
        <p>"We shall, unblemished and complete,</p>
        <p>Appear before our Father's throne,</p>
        <p>With joys divinely great."</p>
        <p>"Then loudest of the crowd we'll sing,</p>
        <p>Whilst heaven's resounding mansions ring</p>
        <p>With shouts of sovereign grace."</p>
        <p>
          Our friend John, the highly favoured apostle of the Apocalypse, has
          given us just one note from heaven's song; we shall strike that note,
          and sound it again and again. I shall strike this tuning-fork of
          heaven, and let you hear one of the key notes. "And hast made us unto
          our God kings and priests; and we shall reign on the earth." May the
          great and gracious Spirit, who is the only illumination of darkness,
          light up my mind whilst I attempt, in a brief and hurried manner, to
          speak from this text. There are three things in it: first, the
          Redeemer's doings -- " and hast made us; secondly, the saints' honors
          -- " and hast made us kings and priests unto our God;" and, thirdly,
          the world's future -- " and we shall reign upon the earth."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, we have THE REDEEMER'S DOINGS. They who stand before
          the throne sing of the Lamb -- the Lion of the tribe of Judah, who
          took the book and broke the seals thereof -- " Thou hast made us kings
          and priests unto our God." In heaven they do not sing
        </p>
        <p>"Glory, honor, praise, and power</p>
        <p>Be unto ourselves for ever;</p>
        <p>We have been our own Redeemers; -- Hallelujah!"</p>
        <p>
          They never sing praise to themselves; they glorify not their own
          strength; they do not talk of their own free-will and their own might;
          but they ascribe their salvation, from beginning to end, to God. Ask
          them how they were saved, and they reply, "The Lamb hath made us what
          we are." Ask them whence their glories came, and they tell you, "They
          were bequeathed to us by the dying Lamb." Ask whence they obtained the
          gold of their harps, and they say, "It was dug in mines of agony and
          bitterness by Jesus," Inquire who stringed their harps, and they will
          tell you that Jesus took each sinew of his body to make them. Ask them
          where they washed their robes and made them white, and they will say
          --
        </p>
        <p>"In yonder fountain filled with blood,</p>
        <p>Drawn from Immanuel's veins.'"</p>
        <p>
          Some persons on earth do not know where to put the crown; but those in
          heaven do. They place the diadem on the right head; and they ever sing
          -- " And he hath made us what we are."
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, then, beloved, would not this note well become us here? For "
          what have we that we have not received?" Who hath made us to differ? I
          know, this morning, that I am a justified man; I have the full
          assurance that
        </p>
        <p>"The terrors of law and of God,</p>
        <p>With me can have nothing to do;</p>
        <p>My Saviour's obedience and blood</p>
        <p>Hide all my transgressions from view."</p>
        <p>
          There is not a sin against me in God's book they have all been for
          ever obliterated by the blood of Christ. and cancelled by his own
          right hand. I have nothing to fear; I cannot be condemned. "Who shall
          lay anything to the charge of God's elect?" Not God, for he hath
          justified; not Christ. for he hath died. But if I am justified, who
          made me so? I say -- "And hath made me what I am." Justification from
          first to last. is of God. Salvation is of the Lord alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of you are sanctified persons, but you are not perfectly
          sanctified, you are not redeemed altogether from the dross of earth;
          you have still another law in your members, warring against the law of
          your mind; and you always will have that law while you tabernacle in
          faith; you never will be perfect in your sanctification until you get
          up yonder before the solemn throne of God, where even this
          imperfection of your soul will be taken away, and your carnal
          depravity rooted out. But yet, beloved, there is an inward principle
          imparted; you are growing in grace -- you are making progress in
          holiness. Well, but who made you have that progress? Who redeemed you
          from that lust? Who ransomed you from that vice? Who bade you say
          farewell to that practice in which you indulged? Cannot you say of
          Jesus, "And hath made us!" It is Christ who hath done it all, and to
          his name be honor, and glory, and praise, and dominion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us dwell one moment on this thought, and show you how it is that
          it can be said that Christ hath made us this. When did Christ make his
          people kings and priests? When could it be said, "And hath made us
          kings and priests unto our God?"
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First of all, he made us kings and priests, virtually, when he
          signed the covenant of grace. Far, far back in eternity, the Magna
          Charta of the saints was written by the hand of God, and it needed one
          signature to make it valid. There was a stipulation in that covenant
          that the Mediator should become incarnate should live a suffering
          life, and at last endure a death of ignominy; and it needed but one
          signature, the signature of the Son of God, to make that covenant
          valid, eternal, and "ordered in all things and sure." Methinks I see
          him now, as my imagination pictures the lofty Son of God grasping the
          pen. See how his fingers write the name; and there it stands in
          everlasting letters -- " THE SON!" O sacred ratification of the
          treaty; it is stamped and sealed with the great seal of our father in
          heaven. O glorious covenant, then for ever made secure! At the moment
          of the signature of this wondrous document, the spirits before the
          throne -- I mean the angels -- might have taken up the song, and said
          of the whole body of the elect, "And hast made you kings and priests
          unto your God;" and could all the chosen company have started into
          existence, they could have clapped their hands and sung, "Here we are
          by that very signature constituted kings and priests unto our God."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But he did not stop there. It was not simply agreeing to the terms
          of the treaty; but in due time he filled it all -- yes, to its utmost
          jot and tittle. Jesus said, "I will take the cup of salvation;" and he
          did take it -- the cup of our deliverance. Bitter were its drops;gall
          lay in its depths;there were groans, and sighs, and tears, within the
          red mixture but he took it all, and drank it to its dregs, and
          swallowed all the awful draught. All was gone. He drank the cup of
          salvation, and he ate the bread of affliction. See him, as he drinks
          the cup in Gethsemane, when the fluid of that cup did mingle with his
          blood, and make each drop a scalding poison. Mark how the hot feet of
          pain did travel down his veins. See how each nerve is twisted and
          contorted with his agony. Behold his brow covered with sweat; witness
          the agonies as they follow each other into the very depths of his
          soul. Speak, ye lost, and tell what hell's torment means; but ye
          cannot tell what the torments of Gethsemane were. Oh! the deep
          unutterable! There was a depth which couched beneath, when our
          Redeemer bowed his head, when he placed himself betwixt the upper and
          nether millstones of his Father's vengeance, and when his whole soul
          was ground to powder. Ah! that wrestling man-God -- that suffering man
          of Gethsemane! Weep o'er him, saints -- weep o'er him; when ye see him
          rising from that prayer in the garden, marching forth to his cross;
          when ye picture him hanging on his cross four long hours in the
          scorching sun, overwhelmed by his Father's passing wrath -- when ye
          see his side streaming with gore -- when ye hear his death-shriek, "It
          is finished," -- and see his lips all parched, and moistened by
          nothing save the vinegar and the gall, -- ah! then prostrate
          yourselves before that cross, bow down before that sufferer, and say,
          "Thou hast made us -- thou hast made us what we are; we are nothing
          without thee." The cross of Jesus is the foundation of the glory of
          the saints; Calvary is the birth-place of heaven; heaven was born in
          Bethlehem's manger; had it not been for the sufferings and agonies of
          Golgotha we should have had no blessing. Oh, saint! in every mercy see
          the Saviour's blood; look on this Book -- it is sprinkled with his
          blood; look on this house of prayer -- it is sanctified by his
          sufferings; look on your daily food -- it is purchased with his
          groans. Let every mercy come to you as a blood-bought treasure; value
          it because it comes from him; and ever more say, "Thou hast made us
          what we are."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Beloved, our Saviour Jesus Christ finished the great work of making
          us what we are, by his ascension into heaven. If he had not risen up
          on high and led captivity captive, his death would have been
          insufficient. He "died for our sins," but he "rose again for our
          justification." The resurrection of our Saviour, in his majesty, when
          he burst the bonds of death, was to us the assurance that God had
          accepted his sacrifice; and his ascension up on high, was but as a
          type and a figure of the real and actual ascension of all his saints,
          when he shall come in the clouds of judgment, and shall call all his
          people to him. Mark the man-God, as he goes upward towards heaven;
          behold his triumphal march through the skies, whilst stars sing his
          praises, and planets dance in solemn order; behold him traverse the
          unknown fields of ether till he arrives at the throne of God in the
          seventh heaven, Then hear him say to his Father, "I have finished the
          work which thou gavest me to do; behold me and the children thou hast
          given me; I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course; I
          have done all; I have accomplished every type; I have finished every
          part of the covenant; there is not one iota I have left unfulfilled,
          or one tittle that is left out; all is done." And hark, how they sing
          before the throne of God when thus he speaks: "Thou hast made us unto
          our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth."
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus have I briefly spoken upon the dear Redeemer's doings. Poor lips
          cannot speak better; faint heart will not rise up to the height of
          this great argument. Oh! that these lips had language eloquent and
          lofty, that they might speak more of the wondrous doings of our
          Redeemer!
        </p>
        <p>" Crown him! crown him!</p>
        <p>Crowns become the Saviour's brow."</p>
        <p>
          II. Now, secondly, THE SAINT'S HONORS: "and hast made us unto our God
          kings and priests." The most honorable of all monarchs have ever been
          esteemed to be those who had a right not only to royal, but to
          sacerdotal supremacy -- those kings who could wear at one time the
          crown of loyalty, and at another the mitre of the priesthood, who
          could both use the censer and hold the sceptre -- who could offer
          intercession for the people, and then govern the nations. Those who
          are kings and priests are great indeed; and here you behold the saint
          honored, not with one title, or one office, but with two. He is made
          not a king merely, but a king and a priest; not a priest merely, but a
          priest and a king. The saint has two offices conferred upon him at
          once, he is made a priestly monarch, and a regal priest.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall take, first of all, the royal office of the saints. They are
          KINGS. They are not merely to be kings in heaven, but they are also
          kings on earth; for if my text does not say so, the Bible declares it
          in another passage: "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood."
          We are kings even now. I want you to understand that, before I explain
          the idea. Every saint of the living God, not merely has the prospect
          of being a king in heaven, but positively, in the sight of God, he is
          a king now; and he must say, with regard to his brethren and himself,
          "And hast made us," even now, "unto our God kings and priests; and we
          shall reign upon the earth." A Christian is a king. He is not simply
          like a king, but he is a king, actually and truly. However, I shall
          try and show you how he is like a king.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember his royal ancestry. What a fuss some people make about their
          grand fathers and grandmothers, and distant ancestors. I remember
          seeing in Trinity College, the pedigree of some great lord that went
          back just as far as Adam, and Adam was there digging the ground -- the
          first man. It was traced all the way up. Of course I did not believe
          it. I have heard of some pedigrees that go back further. I leave that
          to your own common sense, to believe it or not. A pedigree in which
          shall be found dukes, marquises, and kings, and princes. Oh! what
          would some give for such a pedigree? I believe, however, that it is
          not what our ancestors were, but what we are, that will make us shine
          before God; that it is not so much in knowing that we have royal or
          priestly blood in our veins, as knowing that we are an honor to our
          race -- that we are walking in the ways of the Lord, and reflecting
          credit upon the church, and upon the grace that makes us honorable.
          But since some men will glory in their descent, I will glory that the
          saints have the proudest ancestry in all the world. Talk of Caesars,
          or of Alexanders, or tell me even of our own good Queen: I say that I
          am of as high descent as her majesty, or the proudest monarch in the
          world. I am descended from the King of kings. The saint may well speak
          of his ancestry -- he may exult in it, he may glory in it -- for he is
          the son of God, positively and actually. His mother, the Church, is
          the Bride of Jesus; he is a twice-born child of heaven: one of the
          blood royal of the universe. The poorest woman or man on earth, loving
          Christ, is of a royal line. Give a man the grace of God in his heart,
          and his ancestry is noble. I can turn back the roll of my pedigree,
          and I can tell you that it is so ancient, that it has no beginning; it
          is more ancient than all the rolls of mighty men put together; for,
          from all eternity my Father existed: and, therefore, I have indeed a
          right royal and ancient ancestry.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, again, the saints, like monarchs, have a splendid retinue.
          Kings and monarchs cannot travel without a deal of state. In olden
          times, they had far more magnificence than they have now; but even in
          these days we see much of it when royalty is abroad. There must be a
          peculiar kind of horse, and a splendid chariot, and outriders; with
          all the etceteras of gorgeous pomp. Ay! and the kings of God, whom
          Jesus Christ has made kings and priests unto their God, have also a
          royal retinue. "Oh!" say you, "but I see some of them in rags; they
          are walking through the earth alone, sometimes without a helper or a
          friend." Ah! but there is a fault in your eyes. If you had eyes to
          see, you would perceive a body-guard of angels always attending every
          one of the blood-bought family. You remember Elijah's servant could
          not see anything around Elijah, till his master opened his eyes; then
          he could see that there were horses and chariots round about Elijah.
          Lo! there are horses and chariots about me. And thou, saint of the
          Lord: where'er thou art, there are horses and chariots. In that
          bed-chamber, where I was born, angels stood to announce my birth on
          high. In seas of trouble, when wave after wave seems to go over me,
          angels are there to lift up my head; when I come to die, when
          sorrowing friends shall, weeping, carry me to the grave, angels shall
          stand by my bier; and, when put into the grave, some mighty angel
          shall stand and guard my dust, and contend for its possession with the
          devil. Why should I fear? I have a company of angels about me; and
          whenever I walk abroad, the glorious cherubim march in front. Men see
          them not, but I see them; for "faith is the substance of things hoped
          for, the evidence of things not seen." We have a royal retinue: we are
          kings, not merely by ancestry, but by our retinue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, notice the insignia and regalia of the saints. Kings and princes
          have certain things that are theirs by perspective right. For
          instance, Her Majesty has her Buckingham Palace, and her other
          palaces, her crown royal, her sceptre, and so on. But, has a saint a
          palace? Yes. I have a palace! and its walls are not made of marble,
          but of gold; its borders are carbuncles and precious gems; its windows
          are of agates; its stones are laid with fair colours; around it there
          is a profusion of every costly thing; rubies sparkle here and there;
          yea, pearls are but common stones within it. Some call it a mansion;
          but I have a right to call it a palace too, for I am a king. It is a
          mansion when I look at God, it is a palace when I look at men; because
          it is the habitation of a prince. Mark where this palace is. I am not
          a prince of Inde -- I have no inheritance in any far-off hand that men
          dream of -- I have no El Dorado, or Home of Prester John; but yet I
          have a substantial palace. Yonder, on the hills of heaven it stands; I
          know not its position among the other mansions of heaven, but there it
          stands; and "I know that if the earthly house of this tabernacle be
          dissolved, I have a building of God, a house not made with hands,
          eternal in the heavens."
        </p>
        <p>
          Have Christians a crown too? O yes; but they do not wear it every day.
          They have a crown, but their coronation day is not yet arrived. They
          have been anointed monarchs, they have some of the authority and
          dignity of monarchs; but they are not crowned monarchs yet. But the
          crown is made. God will not have to order heaven's goldsmiths to
          fashion it in after-time; it is made already hanging up in glory. God
          bath "laid up for me a crown of righteousness." Oh, saint, if thou
          didst just open some secret door in heaven, and go into the treasure
          chamber, thou wouldst see it filled with crowns. When Cortes entered
          the palace of Montezuma, he found a secret chamber bricked up, and he
          thought the wealth of all the world was there, so many different
          things were there stowed away. Could you enter God's secret
          treasure-house, what wealth would you see!" " Are there so many
          monarchs," you would say, "so many crowns, so many princes?" Yes, and
          some bright angel would say, "Mark you that crown? It is yours;" and
          if you were to look within, you would read, "Made for a sinner saved
          by grace, whose name was -- ;" and then you would hardly believe your
          eyes, as you saw your own name engraved upon it. You are indeed a king
          before God; for you have a crown laid up in heaven. What ever other
          insignia belong to monarchs, saints shall have. They shall have robes
          of whiteness; they shall have harps of glory; they shall have all
          things that become their regal state; so that we are indeed monarchs,
          you see; not mock-monarchs, clothed in purple garments of derision,
          and scoffed at with "Hail, king of the Jews;" but we are real
          monarchs. "He hath made us kings and priests unto our God."
        </p>
        <p>
          There is another thought here. Kings are considered the most honorable
          amongst men. They are always looked up to and respected. If you should
          say, "a monarch is here!" a crowd would give way. I should not command
          much respect if I were to attempt to move about in a crowd; but if any
          one should shout, "here is the Queen!" every one would step aside and
          make room for her. A monarch generally commands respect. Ah! beloved,
          we think that worldly princes are the most honorable of the earth; but
          if you were to ask God, he would reply, "my saints, in whom I delight,
          these are the honorable ones." Tell me not of tinsel and gewgaw; tell
          me not of gold and silver; tell me not of diamonds and pearls; tell me
          not of ancestry and rank; preach to me not of pomp and power; but oh!
          tell me that a man is a saint of the Lord, for then he is an honorable
          man. God respects him, angels respect him, and the universe one day
          shall respect him, when Christ shall come to call him to his account,
          and say, "Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the
          joy of thy Lord." You may despise a child of God now, sinner; you may
          laugh at him; you may say he is a hypocrite; you may call him a saint,
          a methodist, a cant, and everything you like; but know that those
          titles will not mar his dignity -- he is the honorable of the earth,
          and God estimates him as such.
        </p>
        <p>
          But some persons will say, "I wish you would prove what you affirm,
          when you say that saints are kings; for, if we were kings, we should
          never have any sorrows; kings are never poor as we are, and never
          suffer as we do." Who told you so? You say if you are kings, you would
          live at ease. Do not kings ever suffer? Was not David an anointed
          king? and was lie not hunted like a partridge on the mountains? Did
          not the king himself pass over the brook Kedron, and all his people
          weeping as he went, when his son Absalom pursued him? And was he not a
          monarch when he slept on the cold ground, with no couch save the damp
          heather? O yes, kings have their sorrows -- crowned heads have their
          afflictions. Full oft
        </p>
        <p>"Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown."</p>
        <p>
          Do not expect that because you are a king, you are to have no sorrows.
          "It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor
          for princes strong drink." And it is often so. The saints get but
          little wine here. It is not for kings to drink the wine of pleasure;
          it is not for kings to have much of the intoxicating drink and the
          surfeits of this world's delight. They shall have joy enough up
          yonder, when they shall drink it new in their Father's kingdom. Poor
          saint! do dwell on this. Thou art a king! I beseech thee, let it not
          go away from thy mind; but in the midst of thy tribulation, still
          rejoice in it. If thou hast to go through the dark tunnel of infamy,
          for Christ's name; if thou art ridiculed and reviled, still rejoice in
          the fact, "I am a king, and all the dominions of the earth shall be
          mine!"
        </p>
        <p>
          That last idea, and I have done with this part of the subject. Kings
          have dominion. Do you know I am a fifth monarchy man? In Cromwell's
          time some said there had been four monarchies, and the fifth would
          come and overturn every other. Well, I never wish to do as they did;
          but I believe with them, that a fifth monarchy shall come. There have
          now existed four great empires, arrogating universal dominion, and
          there never shall be another world-wide monarchy until Christ shall
          come. Jesus, our Lord, is to be King of all the earth, and rule all
          nations in a glorious spiritual, or personal reign. The saints, as
          being kings in Christ, have a right to the whole world. Here am I this
          morning, and my congregation before me. Some persons say, "Keep to
          your own place and preach," and I have heard the advice, "Do not go
          out of your parish." But Rowland Hill used to say he never went out of
          his parish in his life; his parish was England, Scotland, and Wales,
          and he never went out of it. I suppose that is my parish, and the
          parish of every gospel minister. When we see a city full of sin and
          iniquity, what should we say? That is ours, we will go and storm it.
          When we see a street or some crowded area, where the people are very
          bad and wicked, we should say, "That is our alley, we will go and take
          it." When we see a house where people will not receive the gospel, we
          should say, "That is our house, we will go and attack it." We will not
          go with the strong arm of the law; we will not ask the policeman, or
          government to help us; but take with us "the weapons of our warfare."
          which "are not carnal, but spiritual, and mighty through God, to the
          pulling down of strongholds." We will go, and by God's Spirit we shall
          overcome. There is a town where the children are running about the
          street, uneducated; we will go and take those children -- kidnap them
          for Christ. We will have a Sabbath school. If they are ragged urchins
          who cannot come to a Sabbath school, we will have a ragged school.
          There is a part of the world where the inhabitants are sunk in
          ignorance and superstition: we will send a missionary to them. Ah!
          those who do not like missionary enterprise, do not know the dignity
          of the saint. Talk of India; talk of China.; "it is mine," saith the
          saint. All the kingdoms of the earth are ours. "Africa is my washpot
          -- I will triumph over Asia. They are mine! they are mine!" "Who shall
          bring me into the strong city?" Is it not thou, O Lord? God shall give
          us the kingdom of Christ. The whole earth is ours; and by the power of
          the Holy Ghost, Bel shall bow, Nebo shall stoop, the gods of the
          heathen, Budha and Brahma, shall be cast down, and all nations bow
          before the sceptre of Christ. "He has made us kings."
        </p>
        <p>
          Our second point, upon which I shall be very brief, is, "He hath made
          us kings and PRIESTS." Saints are not only kings, but priests. I shall
          go to it at once, without any preface.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are priests, because priests are divinely chosen persons, and so
          are we. "No man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called
          of God, as was Aaron." But we have that calling and election; we were
          all ordained to it from the foundations of the world. We were
          predestinated to be priests, and in process of time we had a special
          effectual call, which we could not and did not resist, and which at
          last so overcame us, that we became at once the priests of God. We are
          priests, divinely constituted. When we say we are priests, we do not
          talk as certain parties do, who say they are priests, wishing thereby
          to arrogate to themselves a distinction. I always have an objection --
          I must state it strongly -- to calling a clergyman, or any man that
          preaches, a priest. We are no more so than you are. All saints are
          priests. But, for a man to stand up and say he is a priest, any more
          than those he preaches to, is a falsehood. I detest the distinction of
          clergy and laity. I like scriptural priestcraft; for that is the craft
          or work of the people, who are all priests; but all other priestcraft
          I abhor. Every saint of the Lord is a priest at God's altar, and is
          bound to worship God with the holy incense of prayer and praise. We
          are priests, each one of us, if we are called by divine grace; for
          thus we are priests by divine constitution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, next, we are priests, because we enjoy divine honors. None but a
          priest might enter within the vail; there was a court of the priests
          into which none might ever go, except the called ones. Priests had
          certain rights and privileges which others had not. Saint of Jesus!
          heir of heaven! thou hast high and honorable privileges, which the
          world wots not of! Hast thou ever been within the vail in communion
          with Christ? Hast thou ever been in the court of the Lord's house, the
          court of the priests, where he has taught thee, and manifested himself
          to thee? Hast thou? Yes, thou knowest thou hast; thou enjoyest
          constant access to God's throne; thou hast a right to come and tell
          thy griefs and sorrows into the ear of Jehovah. The poor worldling
          must not come there; the poor child of wrath has no God to tell his
          troubles to. He must not go within the veil; he has no wish to go: but
          thou mayest; thou mayest come to God's ear, swing the censer before
          the throne, and offer thy petition in the name of Jesus. Others have
          not these divine honors. Thou art divinely honored, and divinely
          blessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then another remark, to finish up with, shall be, we have a divine
          service to perform; and as I want you all, this morning, to turn this
          chapel into one great altar -- as I want to make you all working
          priests, and this the temple for sacrifice -- hook earnestly at your
          service. You are all priests, because you love his dear name and have
          a great sacrifice to perform; not a propitiation for your sins, for
          that has been once offered, but a sacrifice this day of holy
          thanksgiving. Oh! how sweet in God's ear is the prayer of his people!
          That is the sacrifice that he accepts; and when their holy hymn swells
          upwards towards the sky, how pleasant it is in his ears; because then
          he can say, "My hosts of priests are sacrificing praise." And do you
          know, beloved, there is one point in which most of us fail in our
          oblations before God? We offer our prayer, we present our praise; but
          how little do we sacrifice of our substance unto the Lord! I had
          thought this morning, seeing I desire to make you amazingly liberal,
          to have made this my text, "Honor the Lord with thy substance, and
          with the first-fruits of all thine increase: so shall thy barns be
          filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine;"
          and I had thought of showing that our substance was the Lord's, that
          we were bound to devote no small portion of it to him, and that if we
          did do so we might expect prosperity even in worldly business, for he
          would make our barns full and our presses burst with new wine.
          However, I conceive it to be needless to preach a collection sermon --
          I thought I would rather tell your about your honor and dignity, and
          then you shall just give what you like, for the only free-will I like,
          is a free-will offering. Suffer, ye beloved, a few words. God has said
          in his Word that you are to honor him with your substance. As a priest
          of the Lord, will you not sacrifice something to the Lord this day?
          Here we have a great object before us; we want more room for the
          crowds who come to hear the gospel. It seems important, when such a
          throng is gathered, that none should go away. Ought we not to bless
          God that they come? There was a time you were few indeed, and the cry
          was," Who hath believed our report?" But God has given us great
          success, the ministry here has been blessed to the conversion of not a
          few souls; I have many cases, now in this chapel, of broken hearts and
          contrite spirits; doubtless, there are many more than I know of, and I
          believe the blessed Spirit will bring them out in due time. Oh! do you
          not grieve that any should have to turn away from the voice of the
          ministry -- that any who come here should have to go away, perhaps to
          spend the Sabbath in sin. You know not where they have to go, when
          they cannot get within these walls. The thing is, we have come to the
          resolution that this chapel should be enlarged, so that there should
          be accommodation for a larger number. Now, ye priests, sacrifice to
          the Lord. Let the priests build the house of Lord; let those who
          worship in the sanctuary take up the trowel today; let the mortar and
          the brick be laid, and let this house be once more filled with the
          glory of the Lord, and an abundant congregation.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now, I have to close up with THE WORLD'S FUTURE. "We shall reign
          on the earth." I have not much time for this, and I dare say it is
          expected that I shall tell you about the millennium and the personal
          reign of Christ. I shall not at all, because I don't know anything
          about it. I have heard a great many people talk of it; and, if anybody
          shows me a book on the millennium, I say, "I cannot read it just yet."
          A good man has lately written a book on it, and a gentleman
          recommended it to me so strongly, that I could not but buy it out of
          courtesy; but I elevated it to the aristocratic region of library, in
          the higher ranks, and there it rests in quiet repose. I do not think
          myself capable of threading the labyrinths of the subject, and I do
          not believe the very respectable author can do it. It is a subject so
          dark, and I have read so many different views upon it, that it is all
          a phantasmagoria with me. I believe all the Bible says of a glorious
          future, but I cannot pretend to be a maker of charts for all time.
          Only this I gather as a positive fact, that the saints will one day
          reign on the earth. This truth appears to me clear enough, whatever
          may be the different views on the millennium. Now, the saints do not
          reign visibly; they are despised. They were driven, in old times, into
          dens and caves of the earth: but the time is coming when kings will be
          saints, and princes the called ones of God -- when queens shall be the
          nursing mothers, and kings the nursing fathers of Christ's church. The
          hour is coming when the saint, instead of being dishonored, shall be
          honored; and monarchs, once the foes of truth, shall become its
          friends. The saints shall reign. They shall have the majority; the
          kingdom of Christ shall have the upper hand; it shall not be cast down
          -- this shall not be Satan's world any longer -- it shall again sing
          with all its sister stars, the never ceasing song of praise. Oh! I
          believe there is a day coming when Sabbath bells shall sprinkle music
          over the plains of Africa -- when the deep thick jungle of India shall
          see the saints of God going up to the sanctuary; and, I am assured
          that the teeming multitudes of China shall gather together in temples
          built for prayer, and, as you and I have done, shall sing, to the ever
          glorious Jehovah,
        </p>
        <p>"Praise God from whom all blessings flow."</p>
        <p>Happy day! happy day! May it speedily come!</p>
        <p>
          Now, to close up, one very practical inference. Ye are kings and
          priests unto your God. Then how much ought kings to give to the
          collection this morning? Thus speak ye to yourselves. "I am a king; I
          will give as a king giveth unto a king." Now, mark you, no paltry
          subscriptions! We don't expect kings to put down their names for
          trifles. Then, again: you are a priest. Well, priest, do you mean to
          sacrifice? "Yes." But you would not sacrifice a broken-legged lamb, or
          a blemished bullock, would you? Would you not select the best of the
          flock? Very right, then select the very best of the Queen's coins, and
          offer, if you can, sheep with golden fleece. Excuse my pressing this
          subject. I want to get this chapel enlarged; so do you; we are all
          agreed about it; we are all rowing in one boat. I have set my mind on
          £50, and I must, and will, have it to-day, if possible. I hope you
          won't disappoint me. It is not my own cause, but my Master's -- at
          other times you have given liberally -- I am not afraid of you -- but
          hope to come forward, next Sabbath morning, with the cheering
          announcement that the £50 is all raised, and then I think my spirits
          will be so elevated, that, by the help of God, I will venture to
          promise you one of the best sermons I am capable of delivering.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Christian reader will be pleased to learn, that after this appeal,
          the sum of £50 0s.11½d. was collected at the doors, towards defraying
          the expenses of the enlargement. Should any reader of the New Park
          Street Pulpit desire to contribute to this excellent object, any sum
          will be thankfully received by MR. WILLIAM OLNEY, Secretary, at the
          Chapel.<br />
