        <p>SECTION I. To Polycarp -- Hierarch.</p>
        <p>
          I, at any rate, am not conscious, when speaking in reply to Greeks or
          others, of fancying to assist good men, in case they should be able to
          know and speak the very truth, as it really is in itself. For, when
          this is correctly demonstrated in its essential nature, according to a
          law of truth, and has been established without flaw, every thing which
          is otherwise, and simulates the truth, will be convicted of being
          other than the reality, and dissimilar, and that which is seeming
          rather than real. It is superfluous then, that the expounder of truth
          should contend with these or those . For each affirms himself to have
          the royal coin, and perchance has some deceptive image of a certain
          portion of the true. And, if you refute this, first the one, and then
          the other, will contend concerning the same. But, when the true
          statement itself has been correctly laid down, and has remained
          unrefuted by all the rest, every thing which is not so in every
          respect is cast down of itself, by the impregnable stability of the
          really true. Having then as I think well understood this, I have not
          been over zealous to speak in reply to Greeks or to others; but it is
          sufficient for me (and may God grant this), first to know about truth,
          then, having known, to speak as it is fitting to speak.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION II.</p>
        <p>
          But you say, the Sophist Apollophanes rails at me, and calls me
          parricide, as using, not piously, the writings of Greeks against the
          Greeks. Yet, in reply to him, it were more true for us to say, that
          Greeks use, not piously, things Divine against things Divine,
          attempting through the wisdom of Almighty God to eject the Divine
          Worship. And I am not speaking of the opinion of the multitude, who
          cling tenaciously to the writings of the poets, with earthly and
          impassioned proclivities, and Worship the creature rather than the
          Creator; but even Apollophanes himself uses not piously things Divine
          against things Divine; for by the knowledge of things created, well
          called Philosophy by him, and by the divine Paul named Wisdom of God,
          the true philosophers ought to have been elevated to the Cause of
          things created and of the knowledge of them. And in order that he may
          not improperly impute to me the opinion of others, or that of himself,
          Apollophanes, being a wise man, ought to recognise that nothing could
          otherwise be removed from its heavenly course and movement, if it had
          not the Sustainer and Cause of its being moving it thereto, who forms
          all things, and "transforms them " according to the sacred text. How
          then does he not worship Him, known to us even from this, and verily
          being God of the whole, admiring Him for His all causative and
          super-inexpressible power, when sun and moon, together with the
          universe, by a power and stability most supernatural, were fixed by
          them to entire immobility, and, for a measure of a whole day, all the
          constellations stood in the same places; or (which is greater than
          even this), if when the whole and the greater and embracing were thus
          carried along, those embraced did not follow in their course; and when
          a certain other day was almost tripled in duration, even in twenty
          whole hours , either the universe retraced contrary routes for so long
          a time, and (was) turned back by the thus very most supernatural
          backward revolutions; or the sun, in its own course, having contracted
          its five-fold motion in ten hours, retrogressively again retraced it
          in the other ten hours, by traversing a sort of new route. This thing
          indeed naturally astounded even Babylonians , and, without battle,
          brought them into subjection to Hezekiah, as though he were a somebody
          equal to God, and superior to ordinary men. And, by no means do I
          allege the great works in Egypt , or certain other Divine portents,
          which took place elsewhere, but the well-known and celestial ones,
          which were renowned in every place and by all persons. But
          Apollophanes is ever saying that these things are not true. At any
          rate then, this is reported by the Persian sacerdotal legends, and to
          this day, Magi celebrate the memorials of the threefold Mithrus . But
          let him disbelieve these things, by reason of his ignorance or his
          inexperience. Say to him, however, "What do you affirm concerning the
          eclipse, which took place at the time of the saving Cross ?" For both
          of us at that time, at Heliopolis, being present, and standing
          together, saw the moon approaching the sun, to our surprise (for it
          was not appointed time for conjunction); and again, from the ninth
          hour to the evening, supernaturally placed back again into a line
          opposite the sun. And remind him also of something further. For he
          knows that we saw, to our surprise, the contact itself beginning from
          the east, and going towards the edge of the sun's disc, then receding
          back, and again, both the contact and the re-clearing , not taking
          place from the same point, but from that diametrically opposite. So
          great are the supernatural things of that appointed time, and possible
          to Christ alone, the Cause of all, Who worketh great things and
          marvellous, of which there is not number.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION III.</p>
        <p>
          These things say, if occasion serves, and if possible, O Apollophanes,
          refute them, and to me, who was then both present with thee, and saw
          and judged and wondered with thee at them all. And in truth
          Apollophanes begins prophesying at that time, I know not whence, and
          to me he said, as if conjecturing the things taking place, "these
          things, O excellent Dionysius, are requitals of Divine deeds." Let so
          much be said by us by letter; but you are capable, both to supply the
          deficiency, and to bring eventually to God that distinguished man, who
          is wise in many things, and who perhaps will not disdain to meekly
          learn the truth, which is above wisdom, of our religion.
