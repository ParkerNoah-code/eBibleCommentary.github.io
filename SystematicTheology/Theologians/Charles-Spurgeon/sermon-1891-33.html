          1. Others again declare that Cain derived his being from the Power
          above, and acknowledge that Esau, Korah, the Sodomites, and all such
          persons, are related to themselves. On this account, they add, they
          have been assailed by the Creator, yet no one of them has suffered
          injury. For Sophia was in the habit of carrying off that which
          belonged to her from them to herself. They declare that Judas the
          traitor was thoroughly acquainted with these things, and that he
          alone, knowing the truth as no others did, accomplished the mystery of
          the betrayal; by him all things, both earthly and heavenly, were thus
          thrown into confusion. They produce a fictitious history of this kind,
          which they style the Gospel of Judas.

          2. I have also made a collection of their writings in which they
          advocate the abolition of the doings of Hystera. Moreover, they call
          this Hystera the creator of heaven and earth. They also hold, like
          Carpocrates, that men cannot be saved until they have gone through all
          kinds of experience. An angel, they maintain, attends them in every
          one of their sinful and abominable actions, and urges them to venture
          on audacity and incur pollution. Whatever may be the nature of the
          action, they declare that they do it in the name of the angel, saying,
          "O thou angel, I use thy work; O thou power, I accomplish thy
          operation!" And they maintain that this is "perfect knowledge,"
          without shrinking to rush into such actions as it is not lawful even
          to name.

          3. It was necessary clearly to prove, that, as their very opinions and
          regulations exhibit them, those who are of the school of Valentinus
          derive their origin from such mothers, fathers, and ancestors, and
          also to bring forward their doctrines, with the hope that perchance
          some of them, exercising repentance and returning to the only Creator,
          and God the Former of the universe, may obtain salvation, and that
          others may not henceforth be drawn away by their wicked, although
          plausible, persuasions, imagining that they will obtain from them the
          knowledge of some greater and more sublime mysteries. But let them
          rather, learning to good effect from us the wicked tenets of these
          men, look with contempt upon their doctrines, while at the same time
          they pity those who, still cleaving to these miserable and baseless
          fables, have reached such a pitch of arrogance as to reckon themselves
          superior to all others on account of such knowledge, or, as it should
          rather be called, ignorance. They have now been fully exposed; and
          simply to exhibit their sentiments, is to obtain a victory over them.

          4. Wherefore I have laboured to bring forward, and make clearly
          manifest, the utterly ill-conditioned carcase of this miserable little
          fox. For there will not now be need of many words to overturn their
          system of doctrine, when it has been made manifest to all. It is as
          when, on a beast hiding itself in a wood, and by rushing forth from it
          is in the habit of destroying multitudes, one who beats round the wood
          and thoroughly explores it, so as to compel the animal to break cover,
          does not strive to capture it, seeing that it is truly a ferocious
          beast; but those present can then watch and avoid its assaults, and
          can cast darts at it from all sides, and wound it, and finally slay
          that destructive brute. So, in our case, since we have brought their
          hidden mysteries, which they keep in silence among themselves, to the
          light, it will not now be necessary to use many words in destroying
          their system of opinions. For it is now in thy power, and in the power
          of all thy associates, to familiarize yourselves with what has been
          said, to overthrow their wicked and undigested doctrines, and to set
          forth doctrines agreeable to the truth. Since then the case is so, I
          shall, according to promise, and as my ability serves, labour to
          overthrow them, by refuting them all in the following book. Even to
          give an account of them is a tedious affair, as thou seest. But I
          shall furnish means for overthrowing them, by meeting all their
          opinions in the order in which they have been described, that I may
          not only expose the wild beast to view, but may inflict wounds upon it
          from every side.
