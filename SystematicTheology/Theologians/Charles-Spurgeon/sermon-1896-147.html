        <p></p>
        <p>
          97. O how have I loved thy law! Not contented with a simple
          affirmation, the prophet exclaims, by way of interrogation, that he
          was inflamed with incredible love to the law of God; and, in proof of
          this, he adds, that he was continually engaged in meditating upon it.
          If any person boasts that he loves the Divine Law, and yet neglects
          the study of it, and applies his mind to other things, he betrays the
          grossest hypocrisy; for the love of the law, and especially such an
          ardent love of it as the prophet here expresses, always produces
          continual meditation upon it. And, assuredly, unless God's law inflame
          and ravish our hearts with the love of it, many allurements will
          quickly steal upon us, and lead us away to vanity. The prophet, then,
          here commends such a love of the law, as, possessing all our senses,
          effectually excludes all the deceits and corruption's to which we are
          otherwise too much inclined.
        </p>
        <p>
          98. Thou hast made me wiser than my adversaries He here declares, that
          he was more learned than his adversaries, his instructors, and the
          aged, because he was a scholar of God's law. It is in a different
          sense that he describes himself as endued with understanding above his
          adversaries, from that in which he describes himself as wiser than his
          teachers. He surpassed his enemies, because their cunning and
          artifices availed them nothing when they employed these to the utmost
          to effect his destruction. The malice of the wicked is always goading
          them to do mischief; and as they are often artful and deceitful, we
          are afraid lest our simplicity should be imposed upon by their
          deceits, unless we use the same crafts and underhand dealings which
          they practice. Accordingly, the prophet glories, that he found in
          God's law enough to enable him to escape all their snares. When he
          claims the credit of being superior in knowledge to his instructors,
          he does not mean to deny that they also had learned from the word of
          God what was useful to be known. But he gives God thanks for enabling
          him to surpass, in proficiency, those from whom he had learned the
          first elements of knowledge. Nor is it any new thing for the scholar
          to excel his master, according as God distributes to each man the
          measure of understanding. The faithful, it is true, are instructed by
          the pains and labor of men, but it is in such a way, as that God is
          still to be regarded as enlightening them. And it is owing to this
          that the scholar surpasses the master; for God means to show as it
          were, with the finger, that he uses the service of men in such a way
          as that he himself continues still the chief teacher. Let us therefore
          learn to commit ourselves to his tuition, that we may glory with
          David, that by his guidance we have proceeded farther than man's
          instruction could lead us. He adds the same thing respecting the aged,
          for the more abundant confirmation of his statement. Age is of great
          avail in polishing, by long experience and practice, men who, by
          nature, are dull and rude. Now the prophet asserts, that he had
          acquired, by the Divine Law, more discretion than belongs to aged men.
          In short, he means to affirm, that whoever yields himself with
          docility to God, keeps his thoughts in subjection to his word, and
          exercises himself diligently in meditating upon the Law, will thence
          derive wisdom sufficient for enabling him to consult his own safety in
          opposition to the stratagems of his enemies, to exercise
          circumspection requisite for escaping their deceits; and, finally, to
          match with the most eminent masters through the whole course of his
          life. David, however, does not adduce his wisdom, that he may boast of
          it before the world; but, by his own example, he warns us, that
          nothing is better for us than to learn at God's mouth, since those
          only are perfectly wise who are taught in his school. At the same
          time, sobriety is here enjoined upon the faithful, that they may not
          seek for wisdom elsewhere than from God's word, and that ambition or
          curiosity may not incite them to vain boasting. In short, all are here
          recommended to behave themselves with modesty and humility, that no
          man may claim to himself such knowledge as elevates him above the
          Divine Law; but that all men, however intelligent, may willingly yield
          themselves to the lessons of heavenly wisdom revealed in the Divine
          Word. When he says, that he kept God's statutes, he teaches us what
          kind of meditation it is of which we have spoken, to let us know that
          he did not coldly philosophies upon God's precepts, but devoted
          himself to them with earnest affection.
        </p>
        <p>
          101. I have restrained my feet from every evil path He intimates that
          he proclaimed war against every vice, that he might wholly devote
          himself to the service of God. From this we learn the profitable
          lesson, that in order to our keeping God's Law, we must, from the
          commencement, beware lest our feet should step aside into crooked
          by-paths; for with a nature so corrupted as ours is, amidst so many
          allurements, and with minds so fickle, we are in the greatest danger
          of being led astray; yea, it is a rare miracle if any man hold on in
          his life in a right course, without turning aside in one direction or
          another. The faithful, therefore, have need to exercise the greatest
          circumspection, in order to keep their feet from going astray.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next verse, David commends his own constancy in observing the
          Law. He declares that ever since he had learned from God the right
          manner of living, he had pursued the right course. As the way is so
          slippery, and our feet so feeble, and our whole disposition so prone
          to go astray after innumerable errors, no small exertions are
          requisite on our part, in order to avoid declining from God's
          judgments. But we must attend to the manner of teaching to which the
          Psalmist refers; for though all, without exception, to whom God's word
          is preached, are taught, yet scarce one in ten so much as tastes it;
          yea, scarce one in a hundred profits to the extent of being enabled,
          thereby, to proceed in a right course to the end. A peculiar manner of
          teaching is, therefore, here pointed out -- that which consists in
          God's drawing his chosen people to himself. I have been brought, as if
          the Psalmist had said, into the way of salvation, and preserved in it
          by the secret influence of the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          103. O how sweet have been thy words to my palate! He again repeats
          what he had previously stated in different words, that he was so
          powerfully attracted by the sweetness of the Divine Law, as to have no
          desire after any other delight. It is possible that a man may be
          affected with reverence towards the Law of God; but no one will
          cheerfully follow it, save he who has tasted this sweetness. God
          requires from us no slavish service: he will have us to come to him
          cheerfully, and this is the very reason why the prophet commends the
          sweetness of God's word so often in this psalm. If it is demanded in
          what sense he declares that he took such sweet delight in God's Law,
          which, according to the testimony of Paul, (1 Corinthians 3:9,) does
          nothing else but strike fear into men, the solution is easy: The
          prophet does not speak of the dead letter which kills those who read
          it, but he comprehends the whole doctrine of the Law, the chief part
          of which is the free covenant of salvation. When Paul contrasts the
          Law with the Gospel, he speaks only of the commandments and
          threatening. Now if God were only to command, and to denounce the
          curse, the whole of his communication would, undoubtedly, be deadly.
          But the prophet is not here opposing the Law to the Gospel; and,
          therefore, he could affirm that the grace of adoption, which is
          offered in the Law, was sweeter to him than honey; that is to say,
          that no delight was to him equal to this. What I have previously said
          must be remembered, that the Law of God will be unsavory to us, or, at
          least, that it will never be so sweet to us, as to withdraw us from
          the pleasures of the flesh, until we have struggled manfully against
          our own nature, in order to subdue the carnal affections which prevail
          within us.
        </p>
        <p>
          104 By thy statutes I have acquired understanding The prophet seems
          here to invert the order he has just now laid down. He observed that
          he had kept his feet from going astray, that he might observe God's
          Law, and now he institutes a contrary order, beginning with the
          observance of the Law; for he declares that he had been taught by the
          word of God before he amended his faults. Yet these two things are not
          inconsistent, -- that the faithful should withdraw themselves from
          their wanderings, in order to frame their life according to the rule
          of God's word, and that when they are already advanced a considerable
          way in a holy life, the fear of God being then more vigorous in them,
          they should regard all vices with more intense hatred. The beginning
          of a good life, unquestionably, is when a man endeavors to purge
          himself from vices; and the more a man has made progress in a good
          life, he will burn with a, proportionate zeal in his detestation of
          vices and in shunning them. Moreover, we are taught by the words of
          the prophet, that the reason why men are so involved in falsehoods,
          and entangled in perverse errors, is, because they have not learned
          wisdom from the word of God. As the whole world are given to folly,
          those who wander astray plead in excuse, that it is difficult for them
          to guard against the allurements of vice. But the remedy will be near
          at hand, if we follow the counsel of the prophet; that is to say, if,
          instead of leaning on our own wisdom, we seek understanding from the
          word of God, in which he not only shows what is right:. but also
          fortifies our minds, and puts us on our guard against all the deceits
          of Satan, and all the impostures of the world. Would to God that, at
          the present day, this were thoroughly impressed on the minds of all
          who boast themselves of being Christians; for then they would not be
          continually driven about, as the greater part of them are, with such
          inconstancy, according to the conflicting impulses of prevailing
          opinions. As Satan is so sedulously exerting himself to spread abroad
          the mists of error, let us apply ourselves with the greater
          earnestness to the acquisition of this wisdom.<br />
