        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.191)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, May 2, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens</p>
        <p>
          "He shall build the temple of the Lord, and he shall bear the glory."
          -- Zechariah 6:13.
        </p>
        <p>"There's music in all things, if men had ears;</p>
        <p>This world is but the echo of the spheres."</p>
        <p>
          HEAVEN singeth evermore. Before the throne of God, angels and redeemed
          saints extol his name. And this world is singing too; sometimes with
          the loud noise of the rolling thunder, of the boiling sea of the
          dashing cataract, and of the lowing cattle; and often with that still,
          solemn harmony, which floweth from the vast creation, when in its
          silence it praises God. Such is the song which gushes in silence from
          the mountain lifting its head to the sky, covering its face sometimes
          with the wings of mist, and at other times unveiling its snow-white
          brow before its Maker, and reflecting back his sunshine, gratefully
          thanking him for the light with which it has been made to glisten, and
          for the gladness of which it is the solitary spectator, as in its
          grandeur it looks down upon the laughing valleys. The tune to which
          heaven and earth are set, is the same. In heaven they sing, "The Lord
          be exalted; let his name be magnified for ever." And the earth singeth
          the same: "Great art thou in thy works, O Lord! and unto thee be
          glory." It would seem, therefore, a strange anomaly if the church, the
          temple of the living God, should be void of song, and we bless God
          that such an anomaly doth not exist, for "day and night they praise
          God in his temple." And while it is true the ceaseless circles of the
          starry heavens are praising him without cessation, it is also true
          that the stars of earth, the churches of the Lord Jesus Christ, are
          each of them evermore singing their hymns of praise to him. To-day, in
          this house, thousands of voices shout his name, and when the sun of
          to-day shall set, it shall rise upon another land, where Christian
          hearts awakened, shall begin to praise as we have just concluded; and
          when to-morrow we shall enter upon the business of the week, we will
          praise him when we rise, we will praise him when we retire to rest,
          and we will solace ourselves with the sweet thought, that when the
          link of praise here is covered with darkness, another golden link is
          sparkling in the sunshine in the lands where the sun is rising when it
          sets upon us.
        </p>
        <p>
          And mark how the music of the church is set to the same tune as that
          of heaven and earth -- "Greet God, thou art to be magnified." Is not
          this the unanimous song of all the redeemed below? When we sing, is
          not this the sole burden of our hosannahs and hallelujahs? -- "Unto
          him that liveth and sitteth upon the throne, unto him be glory, world
          without end." Now, my text is one note of the song. May God help me to
          understand, and to make you to understand it also. "He shall build the
          temple of the Lord, and he shall bear the glory." We all know that the
          Lord Jesus Christ is here alluded to, for the context runs -- "Behold
          the man, whose name is the Branch" -- which title is ever applied to
          the Messiah, Jesus Christ of Nazareth. "He grew up out of his place,
          and he shall build the temple of the Lord; even he shall build the
          temple of the Lord, and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and
          rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and
          the counsel of peace shall be between them both."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we shall notice this morning, first of all, the temple, that is
          the Church of Christ. We shall notice next, its builder -- "He," that
          is Jesus, "shall build the temple." Then we shall stop a moment and
          pause to admire his glory, -- "He shall bear the glory." Then we shall
          attempt, under the good hand of the Holy Spirit, to make some
          practical applications of the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The first point is THE TEMPLE. The temple is the church of God; and
          here let me begin by just observing, that when I use the term "church
          of God," I use it in a very different sense from that in which it is
          sometimes understood. It is usual with many Church of England people,
          to use the term "church" as specially applying to the bishops,
          archdeacons, rectors, curates, and so forth: these are said to be the
          church and the young man who becomes a pastor of any congregation is
          said to "enter the church." Now I believe that such a use of the term
          is not scriptural. I would never for one moment grant to any man that
          the ministers of the gospel constitute the church. If you speak of the
          army, the whole of the soldiers constitute it; the officers may
          sometimes be spoken of first and foremost, but still the private
          soldier is as much a part of the army as the highest officer. And it
          is so in the church of God, all Christians constitute the church. Any
          company of Christian men, gathered together in holy bonds of communion
          for the purpose of receiving God's ordinances, and preaching what they
          regard to be God's truths, is a church; and the whole of these
          churches gathered into one, in fact all the true believers in Christ
          scattered throughout the world, constitute the One true Universal
          Apostolic Church, built upon a rock, against which the gates of hell
          shall not prevail. Do not imagine, therefore, when I speak at any time
          of the church, that I mean the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of
          London, and some twenty other dignitaries, and the whole host of
          ministers. No, nor when I speak of the church do I mean the deacons,
          the elders, and pastors of the Baptist denomination, or any other -- I
          mean all them that love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity and in
          truth, for these make up the one universal church which hath communion
          in itself with itself, not always in the outward sign, but always in
          the inward grace; the church which was elect of God before the
          foundation of the world, which was redeemed by Christ with his own
          precious blood, which has been called by his Spirit, which is
          preserved by his grace, and which at last shall be gathered in to make
          the church of the first-born, whose names are written in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, now, this church is called the temple of God, and Christ is said
          to be its builder. Why is the church called the temple? I reply very
          briefly, because the temple was the place where God especially dwelt.
          It was true that he did not wholly dwell in the temple made with
          hands, of man's building, which Solomon piled upon the mount of Zion,
          but it is true that in a special sense the Infinite Majesty there held
          its tabernacle and its dwelling place. Between the wings of the
          overshadowing cherubim, there did shine the bright light of the
          Shekinah, the type, the manifestation, and the proof of the special
          presence of Jehovah, the God of Israel. It is true he is everywhere;
          in the highest heavens and in the deepest hell God is to found, but
          especially did he dwell in his temple, so that when his people prayed,
          they were bidden to turn their eye towards the temple as Daniel did,
          when he opened his window towards Jerusalem, and offered his prayer.
          Now such is the church. If you would find God, he dwelleth on every
          hill-top, and in every valley, God is everywhere in creation; but if
          you want a special display of him, if you would know what is the
          secret place of the tabernacle of the Host High, the inner chamber of
          divinity, you must go where you find the church of true believers, for
          it is here he makes his continual residence known -- in the hearts of
          the humble and contrite, who tremble at his word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the temple was the place of the clearest manifestation. He who
          would see God the best of all, must see him in his temple. I repeat,
          he was to be discovered everywhere. If you stood on Carmel's top, and
          looked towards the great sea wherein are all the ships and the great
          leviathan he had made to play therein, there might God be discovered
          in his great strength. If you turned your eye on the same hill, and
          looked toward the vale of Esdraelon there was God to be seen in every
          blade of grass, in every sheep feeding by the Stream; God was
          everywhere to be discovered; but if you would see hint it is not on
          Bashan, it is not on Sermon, it is not on Tabor; it was on Mount Zion
          that the Lord God loved to make a special display of himself. It is so
          with the Church. God is to be seen in the midst of her, her helper,
          her strength, her teacher, her guide her deliverer, her sanctifier. In
          holy communion -- in the breaking of bread, and in the pouring out of
          wine, in holy baptism -- in the immersion of believers into the Lord
          Jesus Christ, in the preaching of the Word, in the constant
          declaration of the great salvation of Jesus, in the lifting up of the
          cross, in the high exalting of him that died upon it, in the preaching
          of the Covenant, in the declaration of the grace of God -- here is he
          to be seen, here is his name written in brighter letters and in
          clearer lines than elsewhere the wide world o'er. Hence his church is
          said to be his temple Oh, Christian people, you know this, for God
          dwelleth in you, and walketh with you; you dwell in him, and he dwells
          in you -- "the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he
          will show them his covenant." It is your happy privilege to walk with
          God; he manifests himself to you, as he doth not unto the world; he
          takes you into his inner chamber; he manifests his love; the song of
          Solomon is sung in your courts, and nowhere else; it is not the song
          of the wide world, it is the sonnet of the inner chamber, the song of
          the house of wine, the music of the banquet. You understand this, for
          you have been brought into near acquaintance with Christ; you have
          been made to lean your head upon his bosom, you have been taught to
          look into his heart, and to see eternal thoughts of love there towards
          you. You know well, better than we can tell you, what it is to be the
          temple of the living God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And once more; we should fail to describe the reason why the word
          "temple" is used to picture the church, if we did not observe that the
          church is like the temple -- a place of worship. There was a law
          passed by God, that no offering should be presented to him except upon
          the one altar in his temple at Jerusalem, and that law is extant to
          this day. No acceptable service can be offered to Christ except by his
          church. Only those who believe in Christ can offer songs, and prayers,
          and praises, that shall be received of God. Whatever ordinances you
          attend to, who are without Christ in your hearts, you do belie that
          ordinance and prostitute it -- you do not honor God therein. Two men
          go up to the temple to pray, the one a believer the other an
          unbeliever. He that is an unbeliever may have the gifts of oratory,
          the mightiest fluency of speech, but his prayer is an abomination unto
          God, whilst the feeblest utterance of the true believer is received
          with smiles by him that sits upon the throne. Two persons go to the
          Master's table -- the one loveth the ordinance in its outward sign,
          and reverenceth it with superstition, but he knows not Christ; the
          other believes in Jesus, and knows how to eat his flesh and drink his
          blood as a worthy partaker in that divine ordinance; God is honored in
          the one, the ordinance is dishonored in the other. Two persons come to
          holy Baptism: the one loves the Master, believes in his name, and
          trusts him; he is baptized, he honors Christ Another comes, perhaps an
          unconscious infant, one who is incapable of faith; or hath no faith;
          he dishonors God, he dishonors the ordinance in venturing to touch it,
          when he is not one of the church, and therefore hath no right to offer
          sacrifice of prayer and praise unto the Lord our God. There is only
          one altar -- that is, Christ; and there is only one set of priests,
          namely, the church of God, the men chosen out of the world to be
          clothed in white robes to minister at his altar. and whosoever besides
          pretendeth to worship God, worshippeth him not aright. His offering is
          like that of Cain; God hath no respect to his sacrifice, for without
          faith it is impossible to please God. We care not who it is that doth
          the act; unless he believeth, he cannot will pleasure from God, nor
          shall his sacrifice be accepted.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have thus noted the reasons why the church is said to be the temple.
          As there was only one temple, so there is only one church. That one
          church is his holy place, where God dwells, where God accepts worship,
          where songs of praise are daily uttered, and the smoking incense of
          prayer continually comes up before his nostrils with acceptance.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, we have an interesting subject in the second part of our
          text. "He shall build the temple of the Lord." CHRIST IS THE CHURCH'S
          ONLY BUILDER. Now, I shall want to make a parallel between Christ's
          building the church, and Solomon, as the builder of the first temple.
          When Solomon built the temple, the first thing he did was to obtain
          instructions with regard to the model upon which he should build it.
          Solomon was exceeding wise, but I do not think he was his own
          architect. The Lord, who had shown the pattern of the old tabernacle
          in the wilderness to Moses, doubtless showed the pattern of the temple
          to Solomon, so that the pillars, and the roof, and the floor thereof
          were all ordained of God and every one of them settled in heaven. Now,
          Christ Jesus in this is no Solomon; with this exception, that being
          God over all, blessed for ever, he was his own architect. Christ has
          made the plan of his church. You and I have made a great many plans
          for the building up of that church. The Presbyterian makes his plans
          extremely precise. He will put an elder in every corner, and the
          Presbytery is the great ground-work -- the pillar and the ground of
          the truth, and right is he in so doing to an extent. The Episcopalian
          builds his temple too. He will have a bishop at the door-post, and he
          will have a priest to shut the gate. He will have everything built
          according to the model that was seen by Cranmer in the mount, if he
          ever was there at all. And those of us who are of severer discipline,
          and have a simpler style, must have Christ's church always built in
          the congregational order; every congregation distinct and separate,
          and governed by its own bishop, and deacons, and elders. But mark,
          Christ does not attend to our points of church government, for there
          is one part of Christ's church that is Episcopalian, and looks as if a
          bishop of the Church of England had ordered it; another part is
          Presbyterian; another, Baptist, another, Congregational; and yet all
          these styles of architecture somehow fused into one by the Great
          Architect, make that goodly structure which is called "the temple of
          Christ, the church of the firing God, the pillar and ground of truth."
          Christ must be his own architect. He will bring out different points
          of truth in different ways. Why, I believe that different
          denominations are sent on purpose to set out different truths. There
          are some of our brethren a little too high, they bring out better than
          any other people, the grand old truths of sovereign grace. There are
          some, on the other hand, a little too low; they bring out with great
          clearness the great and truthful doctrines of man's responsibility. So
          that two truths that might have been neglected, either the one or the
          other, if only one form of Christianity existed, are both brought out,
          both made resplendent, by the different denominations of God's people,
          who are alike chosen of God, and precious to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          God forbid I should say anything that would bolster up any in their
          errors; nevertheless God's people, even in error, are a precious
          people. Even when they seem to be as earthen pitchers, the work of the
          hands of the potter, they are still comparable to fine gold. Rest
          assured that the Lord hath deep designs to answer, even by the
          divisions of his church. We must not interfere with Christ's reasons,
          nor with his style of architecture. Every stone that is in the temple,
          Jesus Christ ordained should be put where it is; even those stones
          that are most contemptible and unseen, were put in their places by
          him. There is not one board of cedar, one piece of burnished pinnacle,
          that was not foreseen and pre-arranged in that eternal covenant of
          grace which was the great plan that Christ, the Almighty Architect,
          did draw for the building of the temple to his praise. Christ, then,
          is the only Architect, and he shall bear the glory, for he designed
          the building.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, you remember that when Solomon set to work to build his temple,
          he found a mountain ready for his purpose, mount Moriah. The top of it
          was not quite broad enough, he had therefore to enlarge it, so that
          there might be room for the beautiful temple, the joy of the whole
          earth. When Jesus Christ came to build his temple, he found no
          mountain on which to build it; he had no mountain in our nature, he
          had to find a mountain in his own, and the mountain upon which he has
          built his church is the mountain of his own unchangeable affection,
          his own strong love, his own omnipotent grace and infallible
          truthfulness. It is this that constitutes the mountain upon which the
          church is built, and on this the foundation hath been digged, and the
          great stones laid in the trenches with oaths and promises and blood to
          make them stand secure, even though earth should rock and all creation
          suffer decay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then after Solomon had his mountain ready and the foundation builded,
          the next trouble was he had no trees near at hand: there were,
          however, fine trees growing in Lebanon, but his servants had not skill
          enough to cut them down. He had therefore, to send for Hirum, king of
          Tyre, with his servants, to cut down the trees upon Lebanon, which,
          after being shaped according to the model, were to be sent by rafts or
          floats to Joppa, the port nearest to Jerusalem, and there brought a
          short distance over land for the building of the temple. He had to do
          the same with the stones of the quarry; for the different stones that
          were needed for the building had to be hewn out of the quarry by
          Hiram's servants, assisted by some of Solomon's people, who had
          inferior skill and therefore were set about the more laborious and
          rougher parts of the work. The same fact you will notice, if you will
          read the history of the building of Solomon's temple, occured with
          regard to the making of the vessels of the house. It is said that
          Hiram did cast them, and Solomon found the gold; and the moulds were
          made in the great plain, and Solomon did cast them there, with Hiram
          for his chief designer and director.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah! but herein Solomon fails to be a type of Christ. Christ builds the
          temple himself. There stand the cedars of Lebanon that the Lord hath
          planted but they are not ready for the building; they are not cut
          down, nor shaped nor made into those planks of cedar, whose
          odoriferous beauty shall make glad the courts of the Lord in Paradise.
          No; Jesus Christ must cut them down with the axe of conviction; he
          must cut them up with the great saw of his law, he must plane and
          polish them with his holy gospel. And when he hath made them fit to be
          pillars in the house of the Lord, then they shall be carried across
          the sea to heaven; then shall they be placed in his temple for ever.
          No Hiram is needed. The axe is in his hand, the plane is in his hand
          too. He understandeth well that business. Was he not a carpenter on
          earth? And spiritually, he shall be the same to his church for ever
          and ever. It is even the same with the stones of the temple. We are
          like rough stones in the quarry. Behold the hole of the pit whence we
          were digged, and the rock whence we were hewn. But we were hewn out of
          that rock by no hand but Christ's. He raised up seed unto Abraham out
          of the stones of the pit; it was his own hammer that broke the rock in
          pieces, and his own arm of strength that wielded the hammer, when he
          dashed us from the rock of our sin. Though we are each of us being
          polished, so that we may be ready for the temple, yet there is nothing
          that polishes but Christ. Afflictions cannot sanctify us, except as
          they are used by Christ, as his mallet and his chisel. Our joys and
          our efforts cannot make us ready for heaven apart from the hand of
          Jesus who fashioneth our hearts aright, and prepareth us to be
          partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus you notice that herein Jesus Christ excels Solomon, for he
          provides all the materials. He hews them himself; he rough-casts them
          first, and then afterwards, during life, polishes them till he makes
          them ready to transport them to the hill of God, whereon his temple is
          to be built. I was thinking what a pretty figure was that floating of
          the trees of Lebanon after being hewn into planks and made ready to be
          fixed as pillars of the temple -- what a fine emblem of death! Is it
          not just so with us. Here we grow, and are at length cut down, and
          made ready to become pillars of the temple. Across the stream of
          death, we are ferried by a loving hand, and brought to the port of
          Jerusalem where we are safely landed, to go no more out for ever, but
          to abide as eternal pillars in the temple of our Lord Now, you know
          the Tyrians floated these rafts; but no stranger, no foreigner shall
          float us across the stream of death. It is remarkable that Jesus
          Christ always uses expressions with regard to his people, which impute
          their death to him alone. You will recollect the expression in the
          Revelation -- "Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come
          for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe." But when he
          begins to reap, not the vintage, which represents the wicked that were
          to be crushed, but the harvest which represents the godly; then it is
          said "He that sat upon the throne thrust in the sickle." He did not
          leave it to his angels, he did it himself. It is so with the bringing
          of those planks, and the moving of those stones. I say no king of Tyre
          and Sidon shall do it, Jesus Christ who is the death of death and
          hell's destruction, he himself shall pilot us across the stream, and
          land us safe on Canaan's side. "He shall build the temple of the
          Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, after these things were brought, Solomon had to employ many
          thousand workmen to put them in their proper places. You know that in
          Solomon's temple there was no sound of hammer heard, for the stones
          were made ready in the quarries, and brought all shaped and marked so
          that the masons might know the exact spot in which they were to be
          placed; so that no sound of iron was needed. All the planks and
          timbers were carried to their right places, and all the catches with
          which they were to be linked together were prepared, so that there
          might not even be the driving of a nail -- everything was ready
          beforehand. It is the same with us. When we get to heaven, there will
          be no sanctifying us there, no squaring us with affliction, no
          hammering us with the rod, no making us. We must be made meet here;
          and blessed be his name, all that Christ will do beforehand. When we
          get there, we shall not need angels to put this member of the church
          in one place, and that member in another; Christ who brought the
          stones from the quarry and made them ready, shall himself place the
          people in their inheritance in paradise. For he has himself said "I go
          to prepare a place for you, and if I go away, I will come again and I
          will receive you unto myself" Christ shall be his own usher, he shall
          receive his people himself, he shall stand at the gates of heaven
          himself to take his own people, and to put them in their allotted
          heritage in the land of the blessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have no doubt you have read many times the story of Solomon's
          temple, and you have noticed that he overlaid all the temple with
          gold. He provided much of the substance, but his father David brought
          him a good store. Now Jesus will overlay all of us with gold, when he
          builds us in heaven. Do not imagine we shall be in heaven what we are
          to-day. No, beloved, if the cedar could see itself after it had been
          made into a pillar, it would not know itself. If you could see
          yourselves as you shall be made, you would say, " It doth not yet
          appear' how great we must be made." Nor were these pillars of cedars
          to be left naked and unadorned -- though they had been fair and lovely
          then -- they were overlaid with sheets of gold. So shall we be. "It is
          sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown a natural body, it
          is raised a spiritual body," plated with pure gold: no longer what it
          was, but precious, lustrous, glorified.
        </p>
        <p>
          And in the temple, we understand, there was a great brazen sea in
          which the priests did wash themselves, and there were other brazen
          seas, in which they washed the lambs and bullocks when they were
          offered. In heaven there is a great laver, in which all our souls have
          been washed, "for they have washed their robes, and made them white in
          the blood of the lamb." Now Christ himself prepares this sacred sea.
          He filled it with blood from his own veins. As for our prayers and
          praises, the great laver in which they are washed, was also made and
          filled by Christ; so that they with us are clean, and we offer
          acceptable sacrifices to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. I say
          again, before I leave this head, there is no part of the great temple
          of the church, which was not made by Christ. There is a great deal in
          the church on earth, that Christ had nothing to do with, but there is
          nothing in his true church, and nothing especially in his glorified
          church, which was not put there by him. Therefore, we may well come to
          the conclusion, on the last head, here, he shall bear all the glory,
          for he was the only builder of it
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now, what a sweet thing it is to try and GLORIFY CHRIST. I am
          happy this morning to have a subject that will magnify my Master. But
          is it not a sad thing, that when we would magnify Christ most, our
          poor, failing lips refuse to speak. Oh, if you would know my Master's
          glory, you must see it for yourselves, for like the Queen of Sheba,
          the halt can never be told you, even by those who know him most and
          love him best. Half his glory never can be told. Pause awhile, and let
          me endeavor to address to you a few loving words. Your Master, O ye
          saints of the Lord, has prepared you and will build you into his
          temple. Speak and say, he shall have all the glory. Let us note,
          first, that the glory which he shall have will be a weighty glory. Dr.
          Gill says, "the expression implies, that the glory will be a weighty
          one, for it said, he shall bear the glory." "They shall hang," says
          another expression, "upon him all the glory of his Father's house;"
          and in another place, we are told, that there is "an exceeding weight
          of glory," which is prepared for the righteous. How great then, the
          weight of glory which shall be given to Christ. Oh, think not that
          Christ is to be glorified in such humble measure, as he is on earth.
          The songs of heaven are nobler strains than ours. The hearts of the
          redeemed pay him loftier homage than we can offer. Try not to judge of
          the magnificence of Christ by the pomp of kings, or by the reverence
          paid to mighty men on earth. His glory far surpasses all the glory of
          this time and space. The honor which shall be bestowed upon him is as
          the brightness of the sun, the honors of earth are but the twinklings
          of a fading star. Before him, at this very day, principalities and
          powers do bow themselves. Ten thousand times ten thousand seraphim
          wait at his footstool. "The chariots of the Lord are twenty thousand,
          even thousands of angels," and all these wait his beck and his
          command. And as for his redeemed, how do they magnify him? never
          staying, never changing, never wearying; they raise their shout
          higher, and higher, and higher, and yet louder, and louder still, the
          strain is lifted up, and evermore it is the same. "To him that liveth
          and was dead and is alive for evermore, unto him be glory, world
          without end."
        </p>
        <p>
          And note again, that this glory is undivided glory. In the church of
          Christ in heaven, no one is glorified but Christ. He who is honored on
          earth has some one to share the honor with him, some inferior helper
          who labored with him in the work; but Christ has none. He is
          glorified, and it is all his own glory. Oh, when you get to heaven, ye
          children of God, will ye praise any but your Master? Calvinists, today
          you love John Calvin; will you praise him there? Lutheran, to-day thou
          dost love the memory of that stern reformer; wilt thou sing the song
          of Luther in heaven? Follower of Wesley, thou hast a reverence for
          that evangelist; wilt thou in heaven have a note for John Wesley?
          None, none, none! Giving up all names and all honors of men, the
          strain shall rise in undivided and unjarring unison "unto him that
          loved us, that washed us from our sins in his blood, unto him be glory
          for ever and ever."
        </p>
        <p>
          But again: he shall have all the glory; all that can be conceived, all
          that can be desired, all that can be imagined shall come to him.
          To-day, you praise him, but not as you can wish; in heaven you shall
          praise him to the summit of your desire. To-day you see him magnified,
          but you see not all things put under him; in heaven all things shall
          acknowledge his dominion. There every knee shall bow before him, and
          every tongue confess that he is Lord. He shall have all the glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to conclude on this point, this glory is continual glory. It says
          he shall bear all the glory. When shall this dominion become effete?
          When shall this promise be so fulfilled that it is put away as a worn
          out garment? Never,
        </p>
        <p>"While life, and thought, and being last,</p>
        <p>Or immortality endures,"</p>
        <p>
          we shall never leave off praising Christ. We think we can almost guess
          how we shall feel when we get to heaven, with regard to our Master.
          Methinks if I should ever be privileged to behold his blessed face
          with joy, I shall want nothing but to be allowed to approach his
          throne, and cast what little honor I may have before his feet, and
          then be there and ever more adore the matchless splendor of his love,
          the marvels of his might. Suppose some one entering were to say to the
          redeemed, "Suspend your songs for a moment! Ye have been praising
          Christ, lo, these six thousand years; many of you have without
          cessation praised him now these many centuries! Stop your song a
          moment; pause and give your songs to some one else for an instant."
          Oh, can you conceive the scorn with which the myriad eyes of the
          redeemed would smite the tempter? "Stop from praising him! No, never.
          Time may stop, for it shall be no more; the world may stop, for its
          revolutions must cease; the universe may stop its cycles and the
          movings of its world but for us to stop our songs -- never, never!" --
          and it shall be said, "Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, the Lord
          God Omnipotent reigneth." He shall have all the glory, and he shall
          have it for ever; his name shall endure for ever; his name shall
          continue as long as the sun; men shall be blessed in him, and all
          generations shall call him blessed; therefore shall they praise him
          for ever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Now, in conclusion, let us just make A PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF
          OUR TEXT. Brothers and sisters, are we to-day built upon Christ? Can
          we say, that we hope that we are a part of his temple; that his
          handiwork has been exhibited upon us, and that we are built together
          with Christ? If so, listen to one word of exhortation. Let us evermore
          honor him. Oh! methinks, every beam of cedar, and every slab of gold,
          and every stone of the temple, felt honored when it was raised up to
          be a part of the fabric for Jehovah's praise. And if that cedar, that
          marble, could have been vocal in that day when the flame descended
          from heaven, the token of Jehovah's presence, the store, and the
          cedar, and the gold, and the silver, and the brass, all would have
          burst out into song, and would have said, "We praise thee, O God, for
          thou hast made the gold more than gold, and the cedar more than cedar,
          inasmuch as thou hast consecrated us to be the temple of shine
          indwelling." And now, will you not do the same? O my brothers and
          sisters! God has highly honored you to be stones in the temple of
          Christ. When you think of what you were, and what you might have been;
          how you might have been stones in the black dungeons of vengeance for
          ever, dark dank stones, where the mobs, and the greed, and the slimy
          thing for ever might have lived; disgraced, abandoned, cast away in
          blackness of darkness for ever -- when you think of this, and then
          remember that you are stones in Jehovah's temple, -- living stones, --
          oh, ye must say that ye will praise him, for man is more than man, now
          that God dwelleth in him. Daughters of Jerusalem, rejoice! you are
          more than women now. Sons of Israel, rejoice! for your manhood is
          exalted, he hath made you temples of the Holy Ghost -- God dwelling in
          you and you in, him. Go out from this place and sing his praise; go
          forth to honor him, and while the dumb world wants you to be its
          mouth, go and speak for the mountain, for the hill, for the lake, for
          the river, for the oak, and for the insect; speak for all things; for
          you are to be like the temple, the seat of the worship of all worlds;
          you are to be like the priests and offerers of the sacrifices of all
          creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me address myself last of all to others of you. Alas! my hearers,
          I have many here who have no portion in Israel, neither any lot in
          Jacob. How many of you there are, who are not stones in the spiritual
          temple, never to be used in the building up of God's Jerusalem. Let me
          ask you one thing; it may seem a slight thing to-day to be left out of
          the muster-roll of Christ's church, -- will it seem a slight thing to
          be left out, when Christ shall call for his people? When you are all
          assembled around his great white throne at last, and the books shall
          be opened, oh! how dread the suspense, while name after name is read!
          how dreadful your suspense, when it comes to the last name, and yours
          has been left out! That verse of our hymn has often impressed me very
          solemnly:
        </p>
        <p>"I love to meet among them now,</p>
        <p>Before thy gracious feet to bow,</p>
        <p>Though vilest of them all;</p>
        <p>But can I bear the piercing thought --</p>
        <p>What if my name should be left out,</p>
        <p>When thou for them shalt call?"</p>
        <p>
          Sinner conceive it! The list is read, and thy name unmentioned. Laugh
          at religion now! scoff at Christ now! now that the angels are
          gathering for the judgment; now that the trumpet sounds exceedingly
          loud and long; now that the heavens are red with fire, that the great
          furnace of hell o'erleaps its boundary, and is about to encircle thee
          in its flame; now despise religion! Ah! no. I see thee. Now thy stiff
          knees are bending, now thy bold forehead for the first time is covered
          with the hot sweat of trembling, now thine eyes that once were full of
          scorn are full of tears, thou dost lock on him whom thou didst
          despise, and thou art weeping for thy sin. sinner, it will be too late
          then. there is no cutting of the stone after it gets to Jerusalem.
          Where thou fallest there thou liest. Where judgment ends thee, there
          eternity shall leave thee. Time shall be no more when judgment comes,
          and when time is no more, change is impossible! In eternity there can
          be no change, no deliverance, no signing of acquittal. Once lost, lost
          for ever; once damned, damned to all eternity. Wilt thou choose this
          and despise Christ? or wilt thou have Christ and have heaven? I charge
          you by him that shall judge the quick and the dead, whose I am, and
          whom I serve, who is the searcher of all hearts, choose ye this day
          whom ye will serve. If sin be best serve sin, and reap its wages. If
          you can make your bed in hell, if you can endure eternal burnings, be
          honest with yourself, and look at the wages while you do the work. But
          if you would have heaven, if you would be amongst the many who shall
          be glorified with Christ, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ; believe
          now, to-day "If ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in
          the provocation." "Kiss the Son, lest he be angry and ye perish from
          the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little." Men, brethren, and
          fathers, believe and live; cast yourself at Jesus' feet, put your
          trust in him,
        </p>
        <p>"Renounce thy works and ways with grief,</p>
        <p>And fly to this most sure relief;"</p>
        <p>
          giving up all you are to come to him, to be saved by him now, and
          saved eternally. O Lord, bless my weak but earnest appeal, for
          Christ's sake. Amen.<br />
