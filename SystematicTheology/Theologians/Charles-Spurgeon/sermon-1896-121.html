          5 Jehovah is gracious. He comes now to point out the fruits of that
          love of which he spoke, setting before him God's titles, in order that
          they might serve to preserve his faith in him. First, he denominates
          him gracious, because he is so ready graciously to render assistance.
          From this source springs that justice which he displays for the
          protection of his own people. To this is subjoined mercy, without
          which we would not deserve God's aid. And as the afflictions which
          overtake us frequently appear to preclude the exercise of his justice,
          hence it follows that there is nothing better than to repose upon him
          alone; so that his fatherly kindness may engross our thoughts, and
          that no voluptuous pleasure may steal them away to any thing else. He
          then accommodates the experience of God's benignity and equity to the
          preserving of the simple, that is, of such as, being undesigning, do
          not possess the requisite prudence for managing their own affairs. The
          term, rendered simple, is often understood in a bad sense, denoting
          persons inconsiderate and foolish, who will not follow wholesome
          advice. But, in this place, it is applied to those who are exposed to
          the abuse of the wicked, who are not sufficiently subtle and
          circumspect to elude the snares which are laid for them, -- in short,
          to those who are easily overreached; while, on the contrary, the
          children of this world are full of ingenuity, and have every means at
          their command for maintaining and protecting themselves. David,
          therefore, acknowledges himself to be as a child, unable to consult
          his own safety, and totally unfit to ward off the dangers to which he
          was exposed. Hence the LXX. have not improperly translated the Hebrew
          term by the Greek, ta nepia, little children. The amount is, that when
          those who are liable to suffering have neither the prudence nor the
          means of effecting their deliverance, God manifests his wisdom towards
          them, and interposes the secret protection of his providence between
          them and all the dangers by which their safety may be assailed. In
          fine, David holds forth himself as a personal example of this fact, in
          that, after being reduced to the greatest straits, he had, by the
          grace of God, been restored to his former state.

          7 Return, O my soul! unto thy rest. He now exhorts himself to be of
          good courage; or rather, addressing his soul, tells it to be tranquil,
          because God was propitious towards him. By the term rest, some
          commentators understand God himself, but this is an unnatural
          interpretation. It is rather to be regarded as expressive of a calm
          and composed state of mind. For it is to be noticed, that David
          confesses himself to have been sorely agitated and perplexed amid an
          accumulation of ills, in the same way as each of us is conscious of
          his own inquietude, when the terrors of death encompass us. Although,
          therefore, David possessed unusual fortitude, he was yet distressed by
          reason of the conflict of grief, and an inward tremor so distracted
          his mind, that he justly complains of being deprived of his peace. He
          declares, however, that the grace of God was adequate to quiet all
          these troubles.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be asked, whether the experience of the grace of God alone can
          allay the fear and trepidation of our minds; since David declares,
          that, having experienced relief from Divine aid, he would, for the
          future, be at rest? If the faithful regain their peace of mind only
          when God manifests himself as their deliverer, what room is there for
          the exercise of faith, and what power will the promises possess? For,
          assuredly, to wait calmly and silently for those indications of God's
          favor, which he conceals from us, is the undoubted evidence of faith.
          And strong faith quiets the conscience, and composes the spirit; so
          that, according to Paul, "the peace of God, which passeth all
          understandings" reigns supremely there, Philippians 4:7. And hence the
          godly remain unmoved, though the whole world were about to go to ruin.
          What is the import of this returning unto rest? I answer, that however
          much the children of God may be driven hither and thither, yet they
          constantly derive support from the word of God, so that they cannot
          totally and finally fall away. Confiding in his promises, they throw
          themselves upon his providence; and still they are sorely distressed
          by disquieting fears, and sadly buffeted by the storms of temptation.
          No sooner does God come to their assistance, than not only inward
          peace takes possession of their minds, but, from the manifestation of
          his grace, they are supplied with grounds for joy and gladness. Of
          this latter kind of quietness David here treats -- declaring that,
          notwithstanding of all the prevalence of agitation of mind, it was now
          time for him to delight himself calmly in God. The term gml, gamal, is
          improperly rendered to reward; because, in Hebrew, it usually
          signifies to confer a favor, as well as to give a recompense; which is
          confirmed by him in the following verse, in which he says that his
          soul was delivered from death. This, then, properly speaking, is the
          recompense; namely, that God, in delivering him from death, had wiped
          away the tears from his eyes. The arrangement of the words is
          transposed; for, according to our idiom, we would rather have said, he
          hath delivered my feet from falling; and mine eyes from tears, and
          then he hath delivered my soul from death; for we are wont to follow
          that arrangement, by which the most important circumstance comes to be
          mentioned last. Among the Hebrews such a collocation of the words, as
          in this passage, is by no means improper. This is their import: God
          has not only rescued me from present death, but also treated me with
          farther kindness, in chasing away sorrow, and stretching out his hand
          to prevent me from stumbling. The grace of God is enhanced, in that he
          restored to life one who had been almost dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          9 I will walk in the presence of Jehovah. To wall in the presence of
          God is, in my opinion, equivalent to living under his charge. And thus
          David expects to enjoy his safety continually. For nothing is more
          desirable than that God should be upon the watch for us, that our life
          may be surrounded by his protecting care. The wicked, indeed, regard
          themselves as secure, the farther they are from God; but the godly
          consider themselves happy in this one thing, that he directs the whole
          tenor of their life. God adding, in the land of the living, he means
          to point out to us the course that we are expected to pursue; and
          that, almost every moment of time, fresh destructions press upon us,
          if he overlook us.<br />
