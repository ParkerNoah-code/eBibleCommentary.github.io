          "I have written to him the great things of my law; but they were
          counted as a strange thing." -- Hosea 8:12
        </p>
        <p>
          This is God's complaint against Ephraim. It is no mean proof of his
          goodness, that he stoops to rebuke his erring creatures; it is a great
          argument of his gracious disposition, that he bows his head to notice
          terrestrial affairs. He might, if he pleased, wrap himself with might
          as with a garment; he might put the stars around his wrist for
          bracelets, and bind the suns around his brow for a coronet; he might
          dwell alone, far, far above this world, up in the seventh heaven, and
          look down with calm and silent indifference upon all the doings of his
          creatures; he might do as the heathens supposed their Jove did, sit in
          perpetual silence, sometimes nodding his awful head to make the fates
          move as he pleased, but never taking thought of the little things of
          earth, disposing of them as beneath his notice, engrossed with his own
          being, swallowed up within himself, living alone and retired; and I,
          as one of his creatures, might stand by night upon a mountain-top, and
          look upon the silent stars and say, "Ye are the eyes of God, but ye
          look not down on me; your light is the gift of his omnipotence, but
          your rays are not smiles of love to me. God, the mighty Creator, has
          forgotten me; I am a despicable drop in the ocean of creation, a sear
          leaf in the forest of beings, an atom in the mountain of existence. He
          knows me not; I am alone, alone, alone." But it is not so, beloved.
          Our God is of another order. He notices every one of us; there is not
          a sparrow or a worm but is found in his decrees. There is not a person
          upon whom his eye is not fixed. Our most secret acts are known to him.
          Whatsoever we do, or bear, or suffer, the eye of God still rests upon
          us, and we are beneath his smile -- for we are his people; or beneath
          his frown -- for we have erred from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! how ten-thousand-fold merciful is God, that, looking down upon the
          race of man, he does not smite it our of existence. We see from our
          text that God looks upon man; for he says of Ephraim, "I have written
          to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange
          thing." But see how, when he observes the sin of man, he does not dash
          him away and spurn him with his foot; he does not shake him by the
          neck over the gulf of hell, until his brain doth reel and then drop
          him forever; but rather, he comes down from heaven to plead with his
          creatures; he argues with them; he puts himself, as it were, upon a
          level with the sinner -- states his grievances and pleads his claim. O
          Ephraim, I have written unto thee the great things of my law, but they
          have been unto thee as a strange thing! I come here to-night in God's
          stead, my friends, to plead with you as God's ambassador, to charge
          many of you with a sin; to lay it to your hearts by the power of the
          Spirit, so that you may be convinced of sin, of righteousness, and of
          a judgment to come. The crime I charge you with is the sin of the
          text. God has written to you the great things of his law, but they
          have been unto you as a strange thing. It is concerning this blessed
          book, the Bible, that I mean to speak tonight. Here lies my text --
          this Word of God. Here is the theme of my discourse, a theme which
          demands more eloquence than I possess; a subject upon which a thousand
          orators might speak at once; a mighty, vast, and comprehensive theme,
          which might engross all eloquence throughout eternity, and still it
          would remain unexhausted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the Bible, I have three things to say to-night, and they
          are all in my text. First, its author, "I have written;" secondly, its
          subjects -- the great things of God's law; and thirdly, its common
          treatment -- it has been accounted by most men a strange thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, concerning this book: Who is the author? The text says
          that it is God. "I have written to him the great things of my law."
          Here lies my Bible -- who wrote it? I open it, and find it consists of
          a series of tracts. The first five tracts were written by a man called
          Moses; I turn on, and I find others. Sometimes I see David is the
          penman, at other times Solomon. Here I read Micah, then Amos, then
          Hosea. As I turn further on, to the more luminous pages of the New
          Testament, I see Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, Paul, Peter, James,
          and others; but when I shut up the book; I ask myself, who is the
          author of it? Do these men jointly claim the authorship? Are they the
          compositors of this massive volume? Do they between themselves divide
          the honor? Our holy religion answers, No! This volume is the writing
          of the living God; each letter was penned with an Almighty finger;
          each word in it dropped from the everlasting lips; each sentence was
          dictated by the Holy Spirit. Albeit, that Moses was employed to write
          his histories with his fiery pen, God guided that pen. It may be that
          David touched his harp, and let sweet Psalms of melody drop from his
          fingers; but God moved his hands over the living strings of his golden
          harp. It may be that Solomon sang canticles of love, or gave forth
          words of consummate wisdom, but God directed his lips, and made the
          preacher eloquent. If I follow the thundering Nahum, when his horses
          plough the waters, or Habakkuk, when he sees the tents of Cushan in
          affliction; if I read Malachi, when the earth is burning like an oven;
          if I turn to the smooth page of John, who tells of love, or the
          rugged, fiery chapters of Peter, who speaks of fire devouring God's
          enemies; if I turn to Jude, who launches forth anathemas upon the foes
          of God, everywhere I find God speaking; it is God's voice, not man's;
          the words are God's words, the words of the Eternal, the Invisible,
          the Almighty, the Jehovah of this earth. This Bible is God's Bible,
          and when I see it, I seem to hear a voice springing up from it,
          saying, "I am the book of God; man, read me. I am God's writing; open
          my leaf, for I was penned by God; read it, for he is my author, and
          you will see him visible and manifest everywhere." "I have written to
          him the great things of my law."
        </p>
        <p>
          How do you know that God wrote the book? That is just what I shall not
          try to prove to you. I could if I pleased, demonstrate it, for there
          are arguments enough, there are reasons enough, did I care to occupy
          your time to-night in bringing them before you; but I shall do no such
          thing. I might tell you, if I pleased, that the grandeur of the style
          is above that of an mortal writing, and that all the poets who have
          ever existed could not, with all their works united, give us such
          sublime poetry and such mighty language as is to be found in the
          Scriptures. I might insist upon it, that the subjects of which it
          treats are beyond the human intellect; that man could never have
          invented the grand doctrines of a Trinity in the Godhead; man could
          not have told us anything of the creation of the universe; he could
          never have been the author of the majestic idea of Providence -- that
          all things are ordered according to the will of one great Supreme
          Being, and work together for good. I might enlarge upon its honesty,
          since it tells the faults of its writers; its unity, since it never
          belies itself; its master simplicity, that he who runs may read it;
          and I might mention a hundred more things, which would all prove, to a
          demonstration, that the book is of God. But I come not here to prove
          it. I am a Christian minister, and you are Christians, or profess to
          be so; and there is never any necessity for Christian ministers to
          make a point of bringing forward infidel arguments in order to answer
          them. It is the greatest folly in the world. Infidels, poor creatures,
          do not know their own arguments till we tell them, and then they glean
          their blunted shafts to shoot them at the shield of truth again. It is
          follow to bring forward these firebrands of hell, even if we are well
          prepared t quench them. Let men of the world learn error of
          themselves; do not let us be propagators of their falsehoods. True,
          there are some preachers who are short of stock, and want to fill them
          up; but God's own chosen men need not do that; they are taught of God,
          and God supplies them with matter, with language, with power. There
          may be some one here to-night who has come without faith, a man of
          reason, a freethinker. With him I have no argument at all. I profess
          not to stand here as a controversialist, but as a preacher of things
          that I know and feel. But I too, have been like him. There was an evil
          hour when I once shipped the anchor of my faith; I cut the cable of my
          belief; I no longer moored myself hard by the coasts of Revelation; I
          allowed my vessel to drift before the wind; I said to reason, "Be thou
          my captain;" I said to my own brain, "Be thou my rudder;" and I
          started on my mad voyage. Thank God, it is all over now; but I will
          tell you its brief history. It was one hurried sailing over the
          tempestuous ocean of free thought. I went on, and as I went, the skies
          began to darken; but to make up for that deficiency, the waters were
          brilliant with coruscations of brilliancy. I saw sparks flying upward
          that pleased me, and I thought, "If this be free thought, it is a
          happy thing." My thoughts seemed gems, and I scattered stars with both
          my hands; but anon, instead of these coruscations of glory, I saw grim
          fiends, fierce and horrible, start up from the waters, and as I dashed
          on, they gnashed their teeth, and grinned upon me; they seized the
          prow of my ship and dragged me on, while I, in part, gloried at the
          rapidity of my motion, but yet shuddered at the terrific rate with
          which I passed the old landmarks of my faith. As I hurried forward,
          with an awful speed, I began to doubt my very existence; I doubted if
          there were a world, I doubted if there was such a thing as myself. I
          went to the very verge of the dreary realms of unbelief. I went to the
          very bottom of the sea of Infidelity. I doubted everything. But here
          the devil foiled himself: for the very extravagance of the doubt,
          proved its absurdity. Just when I saw the bottom of that sea, there
          came a voice which said, "And can this doubt be true?" At this very
          thought I awoke. I started from that deathdream, which, God knows
          might have damned my soul, and ruined this, my body, if I had not
          awoke. When I arose, faith took the helm; from that moment I doubted
          not. Faith steered me back; faith cried, "Away, away!" I cast my
          anchor on Calvary; I lifted my eye to God; and here I am, "alive, and
          out of hell." Therefore, I speak what I do know. I have sailed that
          perilous voyage; I have come safe to land. Ask me again to be an
          infidel! No; I have tried it; it was sweet at first, but bitter
          afterwards. Now, lashed to God's gospel more firmly than ever,
          standing as on a rock of adamant, I defy the arguments of hell to move
          me; for "I know in whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is
          able to keep that which I have committed unto him." But I shall
          neither plead nor argue this night. You profess to be Christian men,
          or else you would not be here. Your professions may be lies; what you
          say you are, may be the very contrary to what you really are; but
          still I suppose you all admit that this is the Word of God. A thought
          or two then upon it. "I have written to him the great things of my
          law."
        </p>
        <p>
          First, my friends, stand over this volume, and admire its authority.
          This is no common book. It is not the sayings of the sages of Greece;
          here are not the utterances of philosophers of past ages. If these
          words were written by a man, we might reject them; but O let me think
          the solemn thought, that this book is God's handwriting -- that these
          words are God's! Let me look at its date; it is dated from the hills
          of heaven. Let me look at its letters; they flash glory on my eye. Let
          me read the chapters; they are big with meaning and mysteries unknown.
          Let me turn over the prophecies; they are pregnant with unthought-of
          wonders. Oh, book of books! And wast thou written by my God? Then will
          I bow before thee. Thou book of vast authority! thou art a
          proclamation from the Emperor of Heaven; far be it from me to exercise
          my reason in contradicting thee. Reason, thy place is to stand and
          find out what this volume means, not to tell what this book ought to
          say. Come thou, my reason, my intellect, sit thou down and listen, for
          these words are the words of God. I do not know how to enlarge on this
          thought. Oh! if you could ever remember that this Bible was actually
          and really written by God. Oh! if ye had been let into the secret
          chambers of heaven, if ye had beheld God grasping his pen and writing
          down these letters -- then surely ye would respect them; but they are
          just as much God's handwriting as if you had seen God write them. This
          Bible is a book of authority; it is an authorized book, for God has
          written it. Oh! tremble, lest any of you despise it; mark its
          authority, for it is the Word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, since God wrote it, mark its truthfulness. If I had written it,
          there would be worms of critics who would at once swarm upon it, and
          would cover it with their evil spawn; Had I written it, there would be
          men who would pull it to pieces at once, and perhaps quite right too.
          But this is the Word of God; come, search, ye critics, and find a
          flaw; examine it, from its Genesis to its Revelation, and find an
          error. This is a vein of pure gold, unalloyed by quartz, or any
          earthly substance. This is a star without a speck; a sun without a
          blot; a light without darkness; a moon without its paleness; a glory
          without a dimness. O Bible! it cannot be said of any other book, that
          it is perfect and pure; but of thee we can declare all wisdom is
          gathered up in thee, without a particle of folly. This is the judge
          that ends the strife, where wit and reason fail. This is the book
          untainted by any error; but is pure, unalloyed, perfect truth. Why?
          Because God wrote it. Ah! charge God with error if ye please; tell him
          that his book is not what it ought to be. I have heard men, with
          prudish and mock-modesty, who would like to alter the Bible; and (I
          almost blush to say it) I have heard ministers alter God's Bible,
          because they were afraid of it. Have you never heard a man say, "He
          that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth
          not" -- what does the Bible say? -- "Shall be damned." But that does
          not happen to be polite enough, so they say, "Shall be condemned."
          Gentlemen, pull the velvet out of your mouths; speak God's word; we
          want none of your alterations. I have heard men in prayer instead of
          saying, "Make your calling and election sure," say "Make your calling
          and salvation sure." Pity they were not born when God lived far -- far
          back that they might have taught God how to write. Oh, impudence
          beyond all bounds! Oh full-blown self-conceit! To attempt to dictate
          to the All-wise -- to teach the Omniscient and instruct the Eternal.
          Strange that there should be men so vile as to use the penknife of
          Jehoiakim to cut passages out of the word, because they are
          unpalatable. O ye who dislike certain portions of Holy Writ, rest
          assured that your taste is corrupt, and that God will not stay for you
          little opinion. Your dislike is the very reason why God wrote it,
          because you out not to be suited; you have no right to be pleased. God
          wrote what you do not like; he wrote the truth. Oh! let us bend in
          reverence before it, for God inspired it. It is pure truth. Here from
          this fountain gushes aqua vitae -- the water of life -- without a
          single particle of earth; here from this sun cometh forth rays of
          radiance, without the mixture of darkness. Blessed Bible! thou art all
          truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet once more, before we leave this point, let us stop and consider
          the merciful nature of God, in having written us a Bible at all. Ah!
          he might have left us without it, to grope our dark way, as blind men
          seek the wall; he might have suffered us to wander on with the star of
          reason as our only guide. I recollect a story of Mr. Hume, who so
          constantly affirmed that the light of reason is abundantly sufficient.
          Being at a good minister's house one evening, he had been discussing
          the question, and declaring his firm belief in the sufficiency of the
          light of nature. On leaving, the minister offered to hold him a candle
          to light him down the steps. He said "No; the light of nature would be
          enough; the moon would do." It so happened that the moon was covered
          with a cloud, and he fell down the steps. "Ah!" said the minister,
          "you had better have had a little light from above, after all, Mr.
          Hume." So, supposing the light of nature to be sufficient, we had
          better have a little light from above too, and then we shall be sure
          to be right. Better have two lights than only one. The light of
          creation is a bright light. God may be seen in the stars; his name is
          written in gilt letters on the brow of night; you may discover his
          glory in the ocean waves, yea, in the trees of the field; but it is
          better to read it in two books than in one. You will find it here more
          clearly revealed; for he has written this book himself, and he has
          given you the key to understand it, if you have the Holy Spirit. Ah,
          beloved, let us thank God for this Bible; let us love it; let us count
          it more precious than much fine gold.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let me say one thing, before I pass on to the second point. If
          this be the Word of God, what will become of some of you who have not
          read it for the last month? "Month, sir! I have not read it for this
          year." Ay, there are some of you who have not read it at all. Most
          people treat the Bible very politely . They have a small pocket
          volume, neatly bound; they put a white pocket-handkerchief round it
          and carry it to their places of worship; when they get home, they lay
          it up in a drawer till next Sunday morning; then it comes out again
          for a little bit of a treat, and goes to chapel; that is all the poor
          Bible gets in the way of an airing. That is your style of entertaining
          this heavenly messenger. There is dust enough on some of your Bibles
          to write "damnation" with your fingers. There are some of you who have
          not turned over your Bibles for a long, long while, and what think
          you? I tell you blunt words, but true words. What will God say at
          last? When you shall come before him, he shall say, "Did you read my
          Bible?" "No." "I wrote you a letter of mercy; did you read it?" "No."
          "Rebel! I have sent thee a letter inviting thee to me; didst thou ever
          read it?" "Lord, I never broke the seal; I kept it shut up." "Wretch!"
          says God, "then, thou deservest hell, if I sent thee a loving epistle,
          and thou wouldst not even break the seal; what shall I do unto thee?"
          Oh, let it not be so with you. Be Bible-readers; be Bible

          II. Our second point is: The subjects on which the Bible treats. The
          words of the text are these: "I have written to him the great things
          of my law." The Bible treats of great things, and of great things
          only. there is nothing in this Bible which is unimportant. Every verse
          in it has a solemn meaning; and if we have not found it out yet, we
          hope yet to do it. You have seen mummies, wrapped round and round with
          folds of linen. Well, God's Bible is like that; it is a vast roll of
          white linen, woven in the loom of truth; so you will have to continue
          unwinding it, roll after roll, before you get the real meaning of it
          from the very depth; and when you have found, as you think, a part of
          the meaning, you will still need to keep on unwinding, unwinding, and
          all eternity you will be unwinding the words of this great volume. Yet
          there is nothing in the Bible but great things. Let me divide, so as
          to be more brief. First, all things in this Bible are great; but,
          secondly, some things are the greatest of all.
        </p>
        <p>
          All things in the Bible are great. Some people think it does not
          matter what doctrines you believe; that it is immaterial what church
          you attend; that all denominations are alike. Well, I dislike Mrs.
          Bigotry above almost all people in the world, and I never give her any
          compliment or praise; but there is another woman I hate equally as
          much, and that is Mrs. Latitudinarianism -- a well-known character,
          who has made the discovery that all of us are alike. Now, I believe
          that a man may be saved in any church. Some have been saved in the
          Church of Rome -- a few blessed men whose names I could mention here.
          I know, blessed be God, what multitudes are saved in the Church of
          England; she has a host of pious, praying men in her midst. I think
          that all sections of Protestant Christians have a remnant according to
          the election of grace; and they had need to have, some of them, a
          little salt, for otherwise they would go to corruption. But when I say
          that, do you imagine that I think them all on a level? Are they all
          alike truthful? One sect says infant baptism is right; another says it
          is wrong; yet you say they are both right. I cannot see that. One
          teaches we are saved by free grace; another say us that we are not,
          but are saved by free will; and yet you believe they are both right. I
          do not understand that. One says that God loves his people, and never
          leaves off loving them; another says that he did not love his people
          before they loved him -- that he often loves them, and then ceases to
          love them, and turns them away. They may both be right in the main;
          but can they both be right when one says "Yes," and the other says
          "No?" I must have a pair of spectacles, to enable me to look backwards
          and forwards at the same time, before I can see that. It cannot be,
          sirs, that they are both right. But some say they differ upon
          non-essentials. This text says, "I have written to him the great
          things of my law." There is nothing in God's Bible which is not great.
          Did ever any of you sit down to see which was the purest religion?
          "Oh," say you, "we never took the trouble. We went just where our
          father and mother went." Ah! that is a profound reason indeed. You
          went where you father and mother did. I thought you were sensible
          people; I didn't think you went where other people pulled you, but
          went of your own selves. I love my parents above all that breathe, and
          the very thought that they believe a thing to be true, helps me to
          think it is correct; but I have not followed them; I belong to a
          different denomination, and I thank God that I do. I can receive them
          as Christian brethren and sisters; but I never thought that, because
          they happened to be one thing, I was to be the same. No such thing.
          God gave me brains, and I will use them; and if you have any
          intellect, use it too. Never say it doesn't matter. Whatever God has
          put here is of eminent importance; he would not have written a thing
          that was indifferent. Whatever is here is of some value; therefore,
          search all questions, try all by the Word of God. I am not afraid to
          have what I preach tried by this book. Only give me a fair field and
          no favor, and this book; if I say anything contrary to it, I will
          withdraw it the next Sabbath-day. By this I stand, by this I fall.
          Search and see; but don't say, "it does not matter." If God says a
          thing, it always must be of importance.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, while all things in God's word are important, all are not equally
          important. There are certain fundamental and vital truths which must
          be believed, or otherwise no man would be saved. If you want to know
          what you must believe, if ye would be saved, you will find the great
          things of God's law between these two covers; they are all contained
          here. As a sort of digest or summary of the great things of law, I
          remember an old friend of mine once saying, "Ah! you preach the three
          R's, and God will always bless you." I said, "What are the three R's?"
          and he answered, "Ruin, redemption, and regeneration." They contain
          the sum and substance of divinity. R for ruin. We were all ruined in
          the fall; we were lost when Adam sinned, and we were all ruined by our
          own transgressions; we are all ruined by our own evil hearts, and our
          own wicked wills; and we all shall be ruined, unless grace saves us.
          Then there is a second R for redemption. We are ransomed by the blood
          of Christ, a lamb without blemish and without spot; we are rescued by
          his power; we are ransomed by his merits; we are redeemed by his
          strength. then there is R for regeneration. If we would be pardoned,
          we must also be regenerated; for no man can partake of redemption
          unless he is regenerate. Let him be as good as he pleases; let him
          serve God, as he imagines, as much as he likes; unless he is
          regenerate, and has a new heart, a new birth, he will still be in the
          first R, that is ruin. These things contain an epitome of the gospel.
          I believe there is a better epitome in the five points of Calvinism;
          -- Election according to the foreknowledge of God; the natural
          depravity and sinfulness of man; particular redemption by the blood of
          Christ; effectual calling by the power of the Spirit; and ultimate
          perseverance by the efforts of God's might. I think all those need to
          be believed, in order to salvation; but I should not like to write a
          creed like the Athanasian, beginning with "Whosoever shall be saved,
          before all things it is necessary that he should hold the Catholic
          faith, which faith is this," -- when I got so far, I should stop,
          because I should not know what to write. I hold the Catholic faith of
          the Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible. It is not for
          me to draw up creeds; but I ask you to search the Scriptures, for this
          is the word of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          God says, "I have written to him the great things of my law." Do you
          doubt their greatness? Do ye think they are not worth your attention?
          Reflect a moment, man. Where art thou standing now?
        </p>
        <p>"Lo on a narrow neck of land,</p>
        <p>'Twixt two unbounded seas I stand;</p>
        <p>An inch of time, a moment's space,</p>
        <p>May lodge me in yon heavenly place,</p>
        <p>Or shut me up in hell."</p>
        <p>
          I recollect standing on a seashore once, upon a narrow neck of land,
          thoughtless that the tide might come up. The tide kept continually
          washing up on either side, and, wrapped in thoughts, I stood there,
          until at last there was the greatest difficulty in getting on shore.
          You and I stand each day on a narrow neck, and there is one wave
          coming up there; see, how near it is to your foot; and lo! another
          follows at every tick of the clock; "Our hearts, like muffled drums,
          are beating funeral marches to the tomb." We are always tending
          downwards to the grave each moment that we live. This book tells me
          that if I am converted, when I die, there is a heaven of joy and love
          to receive me; it tells me that angels' pinions shall be stretched,
          and I, borne by strong cherubic wings, shall out-soar the lightning,
          and mount beyond the stars, up to the throne of God, to dwell forever.
        </p>
        <p>"Far from a world of grief and sin,</p>
        <p>With God eternally shut in."</p>
        <p>
          Oh! it makes the hot tear start from my eye, it makes my heart too big
          for this my body, and my brain whirls at the thought of
        </p>
        <p>"Jerusalem, my happy home,</p>
        <p>Name ever dear to me."</p>
        <p>
          Oh! that sweet scene beyond the clouds; sweet fields arrayed in living
          green, and rivers of delight. Are not these great things? But then,
          poor unregenerate soul, the Bible says if thou are lost, thou art lost
          forever; it tells thee that if thou diest without Christ, without God,
          there is no hope for thee; that there is no place without a gleam of
          hope, where thou shalt read, in burning letters, "Ye knew your duty,
          but ye did it not;" it tells you, that ye shall be driven from his
          presence with a "depart, ye cursed." Are these not great things? Yes,
          sirs, as heaven is desirable, as hell is terrible, as time is short,
          as eternity is infinite, as the soul is precious, as pain is to be
          shunned, as heaven is to be sought, as God is eternal, and as his
          words are sure, these are great things, things ye ought to listen to.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Our last point is: The treatment which the poor Bible receives in
          this world; it is accounted a strange thing. What does that mean --
          the Bible accounted a strange thing? In the first place, it means that
          it is very strange to some people, because they never read it. I
          remember reading, on one occasion, the sacred story of David and
          Goliath, and there was a person present, positively grown up to years
          of maturity, who said to me, "Dear me! what an interesting story; what
          book is that in?" And I recollect a person once coming to me in
          private; I spoke to her about her soul, she told me how deeply she
          felt, how she had a desire t serve God, but she found another law in
          her members. I turned to a passage in Romans, and read to her, "The
          good that I would I do not; and the evil which I would not that I do!"
          She said, "Is that in the Bible? I did not know it." I did not blame
          her, because she had no interest in the Bible till then; but I did not
          wonder that there could be found persons who knew nothing about such a
          passage. Ah! you know more about your ledgers than your Bible; you
          know more about your day-books than what God has written; many of you
          will read a novel from beginning to end, and what have you got? A
          mouthful of froth when you have done. But you cannot read the Bible;
          that solid, lasting, substantial, and satisfying food goes uneaten,
          locked up in the cupboard of neglect; while anything that man writes,
          a catch of the day, is greedily devoured. "I have written to him the
          great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing." Ye
          have never read it. I bring the broad charge against you. Perhaps, ye
          say, I ought not to charge you with any such thing. I always think it
          better to have a worse opinion of you than too good an one. I charge
          you with this: you do not read your Bibles. Some of you have never
          read it through. I know I speak what your heart must say is honest
          truth. You are not Bible readers. You say you have the Bible in your
          houses; do I think you are such heathens as not to have a Bible? But
          when did you read it last? How do you know that your spectacles, which
          you have lost, have not been there for the last three years? Many
          people have not turned over its pages for a long time, and God might
          say unto them, "I have written unto you the great things of my law,
          but they have been accounted unto you a strange thing."
        </p>
        <p>
          Others there be who read the Bible; but when they read it, they say it
          is so horribly dry. That young man over there says it is a "bore;"
          that is the words he uses. He says, "My mother says to me, when you go
          up to town, read a chapter every day. Well, I thought I would please
          her, and I said I would. I am sure I wish I had not. I did not read a
          chapter yesterday, or the day before. We were so busy, I could not
          help it." You do not love the Bible, do you? "No, there is nothing in
          it which is interesting." Ah, I thought so. But a little while ago I
          could not see anything in it. Do you know why? Blind men cannot see,
          can they? But when the Spirit touches the scales of the eyes, they
          fall off; and when he puts eye-salves on, the Bible becomes precious.
          I remember a minister who went to see an old lady, and he thought he
          would give her some precious promises out of the word of God. Turning
          to one, he saw written in the margin "P.," and he asked, "What does
          this mean?" "That means precious, sir." Further down, he saw "T. and
          P.," and he asked what the letters meant. "That," she said, "means
          tried and proved, for I have tried and proved it." If you have tried
          God's word and proved it -- if it is precious to your soul. then you
          are Christians; but those persons who despise the Bible, have "neither
          part nor lot in the matter." If it is dry to you, you will be dry at
          last in hell. If you do not esteem it as better than your necessary
          food, there is no hope for you; for you lack the greatest evidence of
          your Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas! alas! the worst case is to come. There are some people who hate
          the Bible, as well as despise it. Is there such an one stepped in
          here? Some of you said, "Let us go and hear what the young preacher
          has to say to us." This is what he has to say to you: "Behold, ye
          despisers, and wonder and perish." This is what he hath to say to you:
          "The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all that forget God." And
          this, again he has to say to you: "Behold, there shall come in the
          last days, mockers, like yourselves, walking after your own lusts."
          But more: he tells you to-night that if you are saved, you must find
          salvation here. Therefore, despise not the Bible; but search it, read
          it, and come unto it. Rest thee will assured, O scorner, that thy
          laughs cannot alter truth, thy jests cannot avert thine inevitable
          doom. Though in thy hardihood thou shouldst make a league with death,
          and sign a covenant with hell -- yet swift justice shall o'ertake
          thee, and strong vengeance strike the low. In vain dost thou jeer and
          mock, for eternal verities are mightier than thy sophistries, nor can
          thy smart sayings alter the divine truth of a single word of this
          volume of Revelation. Oh! why dost thou quarrel with thy best friend,
          and ill-treat thy only refuge? There yet remains hope, even for the
          scorner. Hope in a Saviour's veins. Hope in the Father's mercy. Hope
          in the Holy Spirit's omnipotent agency.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have done when I have said one word. My friend, the philosopher,
          says it may be very well for me to urge people to read the Bible; but
          he thinks there are a great many sciences far more interesting and
          useful than theology. Extremely obliged to you for your opinion, sir.
          What science do you mean? The science of dissecting beetles and
          arranging butterflies? "No," you say, "certainly not." The science,
          then, of arranging stones, and telling us of the strata of the earth?
          "No, not exactly that." Which science, then? "Oh, all sciences," say
          you, "are better than the science of the Bible." Ah! sir, that is your
          opinion; and it is because you are far from God, that you say so. But
          the science of Jesus Christ is the most excellent of sciences. Let no
          one turn away from the Bible because it is not a book of learning and
          wisdom. It is. Would ye know astronomy? It is here: it tells you of
          the Sun of Righteousness and the Star of Bethlehem. Would you know of
          botany? It is here: it tells you of the plant of renown -- the Lily of
          the Valley, and the rose of Sharon. Would you know geology and
          mineralogy? You shall learn it here: for you may read of the Rock of
          Ages, and the White Stone with the name engraven thereon, which no man
          knoweth saving he that receiveth it. Would ye study history? Here is
          the most ancient of all the records of the history of the human race.
          Whate'er your science is, come and bend o'er this book; your science
          is here. Come and drink out of this fair fount of knowledge and
          wisdom, and ye shall find yourselves made wise unto salvation. Wise
          and foolish, babes and men, gray-headed sires, youths and maidens -- I
          speak to you, I plead with you, I beg of you respect your Bibles, and
          search them out, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and these
          are they which testify of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have done. Let us go home and practice what we have heard. I have
          heard of a woman, who, when she was asked what she remembered of the
          minister's sermon, said, "I don't recollect anything of it. It was
          about short weights and bad measures, and I didn't recollect anything
          but to go home and burn the bushel." So, if you will remember to go
          home and burn the bushel, if you will recollect to go home and read
          your Bibles, I shall have said enough. And may God, in his infinite
          mercy, when you read your Bibles, pour into your souls the
          illuminating rays of the Sun of Righteousness, by the agency of the
          ever-adorable Spirit; then you will read to your profit and to your
          soul's salvation.
        </p>
        <p>We may say of THE BIBLE:</p>
        <p>"God's cabinet of revealed counsel t is!</p>
        <p>Where weal and woe, are ordered so</p>
        <p>That every man may know which shall be his;</p>
        <p>Unless his own mistake, false application make.</p>
        <p>"It is the index to eternity.</p>
        <p>He cannot miss of endless bliss.</p>
        <p>That takes this chart to steer by,</p>
        <p>Nor can he be mistook that speaketh by this book.</p>
        <p>"It is the book of God. What if I should</p>
        <p>Say, God of books, let him that looks</p>
        <p>Angry at that expression, as too bold,</p>
        <p>His thoughts in silence smother, till he find such another."</p>
