        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.138)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, June 28, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          |Thus saith the Lord God; I will yet for this be enquired of by the
          house of Israel to do it for them; I will increase them with men like
          a flock.| -- Ezekiel 36:37.
        </p>
        <p>
          IN reading the chapter we have seen the great and exceeding precious
          promises which God had made to the favored nation of Israel. God in
          this verse declares, that though the promise was made, and though he
          would fulfill it, yet he would not fulfill it until his people asked
          him so to do. He would give them a spirit of prayer, by which they
          should cry earnestly for the blessing, and then when they should have
          cried aloud unto the living God, he would be pleased to answer them
          from heaven, his dwelling-place. The word used here to express the
          idea of prayer is a suggestive one. |I will yet for this be enquired
          of by the house of Israel.| Prayer, then, is an enquiry. No man can
          pray aright, unless he views prayer in that light. First, I enquire
          what the promise is. I turn to my Bible and I seek to find the promise
          whereby the thing which I desire to seek is certified to me as being a
          thing which God is willing to give. Having enquired so far as that, I
          take that promise, and on my bended knees I enquire of God whether he
          will fulfill his own promise. I take to him his own word of covenant,
          and I say to him, |O Lord, wilt thou not fulfill it, and wilt thou not
          fulfill it now?| So that there, again, prayer is enquiry. After prayer
          I look out for the answer; I expect to be heard, and if I am not
          answered I pray again, and my repeated prayers are but fresh
          enquiries. I expect the blessing to arrive; I go and enquire whether
          there is any tidings of its coming. I ask; and thus I say |Wilt thou
          answer me, O Lord? Wilt thou keep thy promise? Or wilt thou shut up
          thine ear, because I misunderstand my own wants and mistake thy
          promise.| Brethren, we must use enquiry in prayer, and regard prayer
          as being, first, an enquiry for the promise, and shell on the strength
          of that promise an enquiry for the fulfillment. We expect something to
          come as a present from a friend: we first have the note, whereby we
          are informed it is upon the road. We enquire as to what the present is
          by the reading of the note, and then, if it arrive not, we call at the
          accustomed place where the parcel ought to have been left, and we ask
          or enquire for such and such a thing. We have enquired about the
          promise, and then we go and enquire again, until we get an answer that
          the promised gift has arrived and is ours. So with prayer. We get the
          promise by enquiry, and we get the fulfillment of it by again
          enquiring at God's hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, this morning I shall try, as God shall help me, first to speak of
          prayer as the prelude of blessing: next I shall try to show why prayer
          is thus constituted by God the forerunner of his mercies, and then I
          shall close by an exhortation, as earnest as I can make it, exhorting
          you to pray, if you would obtain blessings.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Prayer is the FORERUNNER OF MERCIES. Many despise prayer: they
          despise it, because they do not understand it. He who knoweth how to
          use that sacred art of prayer will obtain so much thereby, that from
          its very profitableness he will be led to speak of it with the highest
          reverence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prayer, we assert, is the prelude of all mercies. We bid you turn back
          to sacred history, and you will find that never did a great mercy come
          to this world, unheralded by prayer. The promise comes alone, with no
          preventing merit to precede it, but the blessing promised always
          follows its herald, prayer. You shall note that all the wonders that
          God did in the old times were first of all sought at his hands by the
          earnest prayers of his believing people. But the other Sabbath we
          beheld Pharaoh cast into the depths of the Red Sea, and all his hosts
          |still as a stone| in the depths of the waters. Was there a prayer
          that preceded that magnificent overthrow of the Lord's enemies? Turn
          ye to the Book of Exodus, and ye will read, |The children of Israel
          sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up
          unto God by reason of the bondage.| And mark ye not, that just before
          the sea parted and made a highway for the Lord's people through its
          bosom, Moses had prayed unto the Lord, and cried earnestly unto him,
          so that Jehovah said, |Why criest thou unto me?| A few Sabbaths ago,
          when we preached on the subject of the rain which came down from
          heaven in the days of Elijah, you will remember how we pictured the
          land of Judea as an arid wilderness, a mass of dust, destitute of all
          vegetation. Rain had not fallen for three years; the pastures were
          dried up; the brooks had ceased to flow; poverty and distress stared
          the nation in the face. At an appointed season a sound was heard of
          abundance of rain, and the torrents poured from the skies, until the
          earth was deluged with the happy floods. Do you ask me, whether prayer
          was the prelude to that? I point you to the top of Carmel. Behold a
          man kneeling before his God, crying, |O my God! send the rain;| lo!
          the majesty of his faith -- he sends his servant Gehazi to look seven
          times for the clouds, because he believes that they will come, in
          answer to his prayer. And mark the fact, the torrents of rain were the
          offspring of Elijah's faith and prayer. Wherever in Holy Writ you
          shall find the blessing you shall find the prayer that went before it.
          Our Lord Jesus Christ was the greatest blessing that men ever had. He
          was God's best boon to a sorrowing world. And did prayer precede
          Christ's advent? Was there any prayer which went before the coming of
          the Lord, when he appeared in the temple? Oh yes, the prayers of
          saints for many ages had followed each other. Abraham saw his day, and
          when he died Isaac took up the note, and when Isaac slept with his
          fathers, Jacob and the patriarchs still continued to prey; yea, and in
          the very days of Christ, prayer was still made for him continually:
          Anna the prophetess, and the venerable Simeon, still looked for the
          coming of Christ; and day by day they prayed and interceded with God,
          that he would suddenly come to his temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ay, and mark you, as it has been in Sacred Writ, so it shall be with
          regard to greater things that are yet to happen in the fulfillment of
          promise. I believe that the Lord Jesus Christ will one day come in the
          clouds of heaven. It is my firm belief, in common with all who read
          the Sacred Scriptures aright, that the day is approaching when the
          Lord Jesus shall stand a second time upon the earth, when he shall
          reign with illimitable sway over all the habitable parts of the globe,
          when kings shall bow before him, and queens shall be nursing mothers
          of his Church, But when shall that time come? We shall know its coming
          by its prelude when prayer shall become more loud and strong, when
          supplication shall become more universal and more incessant, then even
          as when the tree putteth forth her first green leaves we expect that
          the spring approacheth, even so when prayer shall become more hearty
          and earnest, we may open our eyes, for the day of our redemption
          draweth nigh. Great prayer is the preface of great mercy, and in
          proportion to our prayer is the blessing that we may expect.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been so in the history of the modern Church. Whenever she has
          been roused to pray, it is then that God has awaked to her help.
          Jerusalem, when thou hast shaken thyself from the dust, thy Lord hath
          taken his sword from the scabbard. When thou hast suffered thy hands
          to hang down, and thy knees to become feeble, he has left thee to
          become scattered by thine enemies; thou hast become barren and thy
          children have been cut off, but when thou hast learned to cry, when
          thou hast begun to pray, God hath restored unto thee the joy of his
          salvation, he hath gladdened thine heart, and multiplied thy children.
          The history of the Church up to this age has been a series of waves, a
          succession of ebbs and flows. A strong wave of religious prosperity
          has washed over the sands of sin, again it has receded, and immorality
          has reigned. Ye shall read in English history: it has been the same.
          Did the righteous prosper in the days of Edward VI? They shall again
          be tormented under a bloody Mary. Did Puritanism become omnipotent
          over the land, did the glorious Cromwell reign, and did the saints
          triumph? Charles the second's debaucheries and wickedness became the
          black receding wave. Again, Whitfield and Wesley poured throughout the
          nation a mighty wave of religion, which like a torrent drove
          everything before it. Again it receded, and there came the days of
          Payne, and of men full of infidelity and wickedness. Again there came
          a strong impulse, and again God glorified himself. And up to this
          date, again, there has been a decline. Religion, though more
          fashionable than it once was, has lost much of its vitality and power,
          much of the zeal and earnestness of the ancient preachers has
          departed, and the wave has receded again. But, blessed be God, flood
          tide has again set in: once more God hath aroused his Church. We have
          seen in these days what our fathers never hoped to see: we have seen
          the great men of a Church, not too noted for its activity, at last
          coming forth -- and God be with them in their coming forth! They have
          come forth to preach unto the people the unsearchable riches of God. I
          do hope we may have another great wave of religion rolling in upon us.
          Shall I tell you what I conceive to be the moon that influences these
          waves? My brethren, even as the moon influences the tides of the sea,
          even so doth prayer, (which is the reflection of the sunlight of
          heaven, and is God's moon in the sky,) influence the tides of
          godliness; for when our prayers become like the crescent moon, and
          when we stand not in conjunction with the sun, then there is but a
          shallow tide of godliness, but when the full orb shines upon the
          earth, and when God Almighty makes the prayers of his people full of
          joy and gladness, it is then that the sea of grace returneth to its
          strength. In proportion to the prayerfulness of the Church shall be
          its present success, though its ultimate success is beyond the reach
          of hazard.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now again, to come nearer home: this truth is true of each of you
          my dearly beloved in the Lord in your own personal experience. God has
          given you many an unsolicited favor, but still great prayer has always
          been the great prelude of great mercy with you. When you first found
          peace through the blood of the cross you had been praying much
          beforehand, and earnestly interceding with God that he would remove
          your doubts, and deliver you from your distresses. Your assurance was
          the result of prayer. And when at any time you have had high and
          rapturous joys, you have been obliged to look upon them as answers to
          your prayers, when you have had great deliverances out of sore
          troubles, and mighty helps in great dangers, you have been able to
          say, |I cried unto the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me out of
          all my fears.| Prayer, we say, in your case, as well as in the case of
          the Church at large, is always the preface to blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now some will say to me, |In what way do you regard prayer, then,
          as affecting the blessing? God, the Holy Ghost vouchsafes prayer
          before the blessing; but in what way is prayer connected with the
          blessing?| I reply, prayer goes before the blessing in several senses.
          It goes before the blessing, as the blessing's shadow. When the
          sunlight of God's mercy rises upon our necessities, it casts the
          shadow of prayer far down upon the plain, or, to use another
          illustration, when God piles up a hill of mercies, he himself shines
          behind them, and he casts on our spirits the shadow of prayer, so that
          we may rest certain, if we are in prayer, our prayers are the shadows
          of mercy. Prayer is the rustling of the wings of the angels that are
          on their way bringing us the boons of heaven. Have you heard prayer in
          your heart? You shall see the angel in your house. When the chariots
          that bring us blessings do rumble, their wheels do sound with prayer.
          We hear the prayer in our own spirits, and that prayer becomes the
          token of the coming blessings. Even as the cloud foreshadoweth rain,
          so prayer foreshadoweth the blessing; even as the green blade is the
          beginning of the harvest, so is prayer the prophecy of the blessing
          that is about to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: prayer goes before mercy, as the representative of it. Often
          times the king, in his progress through his realms, sends one before
          him, who blows a trumpet; and when the people see him they know that
          the king cometh, because the trumpeter is there. But, perhaps, there
          is before him a more important personage, who says, |I am sent before
          the king to prepare for his reception, and I am this day to receive
          aught that you have to send the king, for I am his representative.| So
          prayer is the representative of the blessing before the blessing
          comes. The prayer comes, and when I see the prayer, I say, |Prayer,
          thou art the vice-regent of the blessing, if the blessing he the king,
          thou art the regent. I know and look upon thee as being the
          representative of the blessing I am about to receive.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But I do think also that sometimes, and generally, prayer goes before
          the blessing, even as the cause goes before the effect. Some people
          say, when they get anything, that they get it because they prayed for
          it, but if they are people who are not spiritually minded, and who
          have no faith, let them know, that whatever they may get it is not in
          answer to prayer, for we know that God heareth not sinners, and the
          sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord.| |Well,| says
          one, |I asked God for such-and-such a thing the other day. I know I am
          no Christian, but I got it. Don't you consider that I had it through
          my prayers?| No, sir, no more than I believe the reasoning of the old
          man who affirmed that the Goodwin Sands had been caused by the
          building of Tenterden steeple, for the sands had not been there
          before, and the sea did not come up till it was built, and therefore,
          said he, the steeple must have caused the flood. Now, your prayers
          have no more connection with your blessing than the sea with the
          steeple, in the Christian's case it is far different. Oft-times the
          blessing is actually brought down from heaven by the prayer. An
          objector may reply, |I believe that prayer may have much influence on
          yourself, sir, but I do not believe that it has any effect on the
          Divine Being.| Well, sir, I shall not try to convince you; because it
          is useless for me to try to convince you of that, unless you believe
          the testimonies I bring, as it would be to convince you of any
          historical fact by simply reasoning about it. I could bring out of
          this congregation not one, nor twenty, but many hundreds, who are
          rational, intelligent persons, and who would, each of them, most
          positively declare, that some hundreds of times in their lives they
          have been led to seek most earnestly deliverance out of trouble, or
          help in adversity, and they have received the answers to their prayers
          in so marvellous a manner that they themselves did no more doubt their
          being answers to their cries than they could doubt the existence of a
          God. They felt sure that he heard them; they were certain of it. Oh!
          the testimonies to the power of prayer are so numberless, that the man
          who rejects them flies in the face of good testimonies. We are not all
          enthusiasts; some of us are cool blooded enough, we are not all
          fanatics; we are not all quite wild in our piety, some of us in other
          things, we reckon, act in a tolerably common sense way. But yet we all
          agree in this, that our prayers have been heard; and we could tell
          many stories of our prayers, still fresh upon our memories, where we
          have cried unto God, and he has heard us. But the man, who says he
          does not believe God hears prayer, knows he does. I have no respect to
          his scepticism, any more than I have any respect to a man's doubt
          about the existence of a God. The man does not doubt it; he has to
          choke his own conscience before he dares to say he does. It is
          complimenting him too much to argue with him. Will you argue with a
          liar? He affirms a lie, and knows it is so. Will you condescend to
          argue with him, to prove that he is untrue! The man is incapable of
          reasoning; he is beyond the pale of those who ought to be treated as
          respectable persons. If a man rejects the existence of a God, he does
          it desperately against his own conscience, and if he is bad enough to
          stifle his own conscience so much as to believe that, or pretend that
          he believes it, we think we shall demean ourselves if we argue with so
          loose a character. He must be solemnly warned, for reason is thrown
          away upon deliberate liars. But you know, sir, God hears prayer;
          because if you do not, either way you must be a fool. You are a fool
          for not believing so, and a worse fool for praying yourself; when you
          do not believe he hears you. |But I do not pray sir.| Do not pray? Did
          I not hear a whisper from your nurse when you were sick? She said you
          were a wonderful saint when you had the fever. You do not pray! No,
          but when things lo not go quite well in business you would to God that
          they would go better, and you do sometimes cry out to him a kind of
          prayer which he cannot accept, but which is still enough to show that
          there is an instinct in man that teaches him to pray, I believe that
          even as birds build their nests without any teaching, so men use
          prayer in the form of it (I do not mean spiritual prayer): I say, men
          use prayer from the very instinct of nature. There is something in man
          which makes him a praying animal. He cannot help it; he is obliged to
          do it. He laughs at himself when he is on the dry land; but he prays
          when he is on the sea and in a storm, he seeks at prayer when he is
          well, but when he is sick he prays as fast as anybody. He -- he would
          not pray when he is rich; but when he is poor, he prays then strongly
          enough. He knows God hears prayer, and he knows that men should pray.
          There is no disputing with him. If he dares to deny his own conscience
          he is incapable of reasoning, he is beyond the pale of morality, and
          therefore we dare not try to influence him by reasoning. Other means
          we may and hope we shall use with him, but not that which compliments
          him by allowing him to answer. O saints of God! whatever ye can give
          up, ye can never give up this truth, that God heareth prayer; for if
          ye did disbelieve it to-day, ye would have to believe it again
          to-morrow; for ye would have such another proof of it through some
          other trouble that would roll over your head that ye would be obliged
          to feel, if ye were not obliged to say, |Verily, God heareth and
          answereth prayer.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Prayer, then, is the prelude of mercy, for very often it is the cause
          of the blessing; that is to say, it is a part cause; the mercy of God
          being the great first cause, prayer is often the secondary agency
          whereby the blessing is brought down.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now I am going to try to show you, in the second place, WHY IT
          IS THAT GOD IS PLEASED TO MAKE PRAYER THE TRUMPETER OF MERCY, OR THE
          FORERUNNER OF IT.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. I think it is, in the first place, because God loves that man
          should have some reason for having a connexion with him. Saith God,
          |My creatures will shun me, even my own people will too little seek me
          -- they will flee from me, instead of coming to me. What shall I do? I
          intend to bless them: shall I lay the blessings at their doors so that
          when they open them in the morning they may find them there, unasked
          and unsought?| |Yes,| saith God, |many mercies I will so do with; I
          will give them much that they need, without their seeking for it, but
          in order that they may not wholly forget me, there are some mercies
          that I will not put at their doors but I will make them come to my
          house after them. I love my children to visit me,| says the heavenly
          Father; |I love to see them in my courts, I delight to hear their
          voices and to see their faces; they will not come to see me if I give
          them all they want; I will keep them sometimes without, and then they
          will come to me and ask, and I shall have the pleasure of seeing them,
          and they will have the profit of entering into fellowship with me.| It
          is as if some father should say to his son who is entirely dependent
          upon him, |I might give you a fortune at once, so that you might never
          have to come upon me again; but, my son, it delights me, it affords me
          pleasure to supply your wants. I like to know what it is you require,
          that I may oftentimes have to give you, and so may frequently see your
          face. Now I shall give you only enough to serve you for such a time,
          and if you want to have anything you must come to my house for it. O,
          my son, I do this because I desire to see thee often; I desire often
          to have opportunities of showing how much I love thee.| So doth God
          say to his children, |I do not give you all at once; I give all to you
          in the promise, but if you want to have it in the detail, you must
          come to me to ask me for it: so shall you see my face, and so shall
          you have a reason for often coming to my feet.|
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But there is another reason. God would make prayer the preface to
          mercy, because often prayer itself gives the mercy. You are full of
          fear and sorrow, you want comfort, God says, pray, and you shall get
          it; and the reason is because prayer is of itself a comforting
          exercise. We are all aware, that when we have any heavy news upon our
          minds, it often relieves us if we can tell a friend about it. Now
          there are some troubles we would not tell to others, for perhaps many
          minds could not sympathize with us: God has therefore provided prayer,
          as a channel for the flow of grief. |Come,| saith he, |thy troubles
          may find vent here; come, put them into my ear; pour out thine heart
          before me, and so wilt thou prevent its bursting. If thou must weep,
          come and weep at my mercy-seat; if thou must cry come and cry in the
          closet, and I will hear thee.| And how often have you and I tried
          that! We have been on our knees overwhelmed with sorrow, and we have
          risen up, and said, |Ah! I can meet it all now!|
        </p>
        <p>|Now I can say my God is mine</p>
        <p>Now I can all my joys resign,</p>
        <p>Can tread the world beneath my feet,</p>
        <p>And all that earth calls good or great.|</p>
        <p>Prayer itself sometimes gives the mercy.</p>
        <p>
          Take another case. You are in difficulty, you don't know which way to
          go, nor how to act. God has said that he will direct his people. You
          go forth in prayer and pray to God to direct you. Are you aware that
          your very prayer will frequently of itself furnish you with the
          answer? For while the mind is absorbed in thinking over the matter,
          and in praying concerning the matter, it is just in the likeliest
          state to suggest to itself the course which is proper, for whilst in
          prayer I am spreading all the circumstances before God, I am like a
          warrior surveying the battle-field, and when I rise I know the state
          of affairs, and know how to act. Often, thus, you see, prayer gives
          the very thing we ask for in itself. Often when I have had a passage
          of Scripture that I cannot understand, am I in the habit of spreading
          the Bible before me, and if I have looked at all the commentators, and
          they do not seem to agree, I have spread the Bible on my chair,
          kneeled down, put my finger upon the passage, and sought of God
          instruction. I have thought that when I have risen from my knees I
          understood it far better than before; I believe that the very exercise
          of prayer did of itself bring the answer, to a great degree, for the
          mind being occupied upon it, and the heart being exercised with it,
          the whole man was in the most excellent position for truly
          understanding it. John Bunyan says, |The truths that I know best I
          have learned on my knees;| and says he again, |I never know a thing
          well till it is burned into my heart by prayer.| Now that is in a
          great measure through the agency of God's Holy Spirit; but I think
          that it may in some measure also be accounted for by the fact that
          prayer exercises the mind upon the thing, and then the mind is led by
          an insensible process to lay hold upon the right result. Prayer, then
          is a suitable prelude to the blessing, because often it carrieth the
          blessing in itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But again it seemeth but right, and just, and appropriate, that
          prayer should go before the blessing, because in prayer there is a
          sense of need. I cannot as a man distribute assistance to those who do
          not represent their case to me as being destitute and sick. I cannot
          suppose that the physician will trouble himself to leave his own house
          to go into the house of one that is ill, unless the need has been
          specified to him, and unless he has been informed that the case
          requires his assistance; nor can we expect of God, that he will wait
          upon his own people, unless his own people should first state their
          need to him, shall feel their need, and come before him crying for a
          blessing. A sense of need is a divine gift; prayer fosters it, and is
          therefore highly beneficial.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. And yet again, prayer before the blessing serves to show us the
          value of it. If we had the blessings without asking for them, we
          should think them common things; but prayer makes the common pebbles
          of God's temporal bounties more precious then diamonds; and in
          spiritual prayer, cuts the diamond, and makes it glisten more. The
          thing was precious, but I did not know its preciousness till I had
          sought for it, and sought it long. After a long chase the hunter
          prizes the animal because he has set his heart upon it and is
          determined to have it; and yet more truly, after a long hunger he that
          eateth findeth more relish in his food. So prayer doth sweeten the
          mercy. Prayer teaches us its preciousness. It is the reading over of
          the bill, the schedule, the account, before the estate and the
          properties are themselves transferred. We know the value of the
          purchase by reading over the will of it in prayer, and when we have
          groaned out our own expression of its peerless price, then it is that
          God bestows the benediction upon us. Prayer, therefore, goes before
          the blessing, because it shows us the value of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But doubtless even reason itself suggests that it is but natural that
          God, the all-good, should give his favors to those that ask. It
          seemeth but right that he should expect of us, that we should first
          ask at his hands, and then he will bestow. It is goodness great enough
          that his hand is ready to open: surely it is but little that he should
          say to his people, |For this thing will I be enquired of by the house
          of Israel to do it for them.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Let me close BY STIRRING YOU UP TO USE THE HOLY ART OF PRAYER AS
          A MEANS OF OBTAINING THE BLESSING. Do you demand of me, and for what
          shall we pray? The answer is upon my tongue. Pray for yourselves, pray
          for your families, pray for the Churches, pray for the one great
          kingdom of our Lord on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pray for yourselves. Sure you will never lack some subject for
          intercession. So broad are your wants, so deep are your necessities,
          that until you are in heaven you will always find room for prayer.
          Dost thou need nothing? Then I fear thou dost not know thyself. Hast
          thou no mercy to ask of God? Then I fear thou hast never had mercies
          of him, and art yet |in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of
          inquity.| If thou be a child of God, thy wants will be as numerous as
          thy moments and thou wilt need to have as many prayers as there are
          hours. Pray that thou mayest be holy, humble, zealous, and patient;
          pray that thou mayest have communion with Christ, and enter into the
          banqueting-house of his love. Pray for thyself, that thou mayest be an
          example unto others, that thou mayest honor God here, and inherit his
          kingdom hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next place, pray for your families; for your children. If they
          be pious, you can still pray for them that their piety may be real,
          that they may be upheld in their profession. And if they be ungodly,
          you have a whole fountain of arguments for prayer. So long as thou
          hast a child unpardoned, pray for it; so long as thou hast a child
          alive that is saved, pray for him, that he may be kept. Thou hast
          enough reason to pray for those that have proceeded from thine own
          loins. But if thou hast no cause to do that, pray for thy servants.
          Wilt thou not stoop to that? Then surely thou hast not stooped to be
          saved; for he that is saved knoweth how to pray for all. Pray for thy
          servants, that they may serve God, that their life in thine house may
          be of use to them. That is an ill house where the servants are
          unprayed for. I should not like to be waited upon by one for whom I
          could not pray, Perhaps the day when this world shall perish will be
          the day unbrightened by a prayer; and perhaps the day when a great
          misdeed was done by some man, was the day when his friends left off
          praying for him. Pray for your households.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then pray for the Church. Let the minister have a place in your
          heart. Mention his name at your family altar, and in your closet. You
          expect him to come before you day after day, to teach you the things
          of the kingdom, and exhort and stir up your pure minds by way of
          remembrance. If he be a true minister, there will be work to be done
          in this matter. He cannot write his sermon and read it to you; he does
          not believe Christ said, |Go and read the gospel to every creature.|
          Dost thou know the cares of a minister? Dost thou know the trouble he
          has with his own church -- how the erring ones do grieve him, how even
          the right ones do vex his spirit by their infirmities -- how, when the
          church is large, there will always be some great trouble in the hearts
          of some of his people? And he is the reservoir of all: they come to
          him with all their grief; he is to |weep with them that weep.| And in
          the pulpit what is his work? God is my witness, I scarcely ever
          prepare for my pulpit with pleasure: study for the pulpit is to me the
          most irksome work in the world I have never come into this house that
          I know of with a smile upon mine heart; I may have sometimes gone out
          with one; but never have I had one when I entered. Preach, preach,
          twice a day I can and will do, but still there is a travailing in
          preparation for it, and even the utterance is not always accompanied
          with joy and gladness, and God knoweth that if it were not for the
          good that we trust is to be accomplished by the preaching of the Word,
          it is no happiness to a man's life to be well known. It robs him of
          all comfort to be from morning to night heated for labor, to have no
          rest for the sole of his foot or for his brain -- to be a great
          religious hack -- to bear every burden -- to have people asking, as
          they do in the country, when they want to get into a cart, |Will it
          hold it?| -- never thinking whether the horse can drag it; to have
          them asking, |Will you preach at such a place? you are preaching
          twice, couldn't you manage to get to such a place, and preach again?|
          Every one else has a constitution; the minister has none, until he
          kills himself and is condemned as imprudent. If you are determined to
          do your duty in that place to which God has called you, you need the
          prayers of your people, that you may be able to do the work, and you
          will need their abundant prayers that you may be sustained in it. I
          bless God that I have a valiant corps of men, who day without night
          besiege God's throne on my behalf. I would speak to you, my brethren
          and sisters, again, and beseech you, by our loving days that are past,
          by all the hard fighting that we have had side by side with each
          other, not to cease to pray now. The time was when in hours of
          trouble, you and I have bended our knees together in God's house and
          we have prayed to God that he would give us a blessing. You remember
          how great and sore troubles did roll over our head -- how men did ride
          over us. We went through fire and through water, and now God has
          brought us into a large place, and so multiplied us, let us not cease
          to pray. Let us still cry out unto the living God, that he may give us
          a blesssing. Oh! may God help me, if you cease to pray for me! Let me
          know the day, and I must cease to preach. Let me know when you intend
          to cease your prayers, and I shall cry, |O my God, give me this day my
          tomb, and let me slumber in the dust.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And lastly, let me bid you pray for the church at large. This is a
          happy time we live in. A certain race of croaking souls, who are never
          pleased with anything, are always crying out about the badness of the
          times. They cry, |Oh! for the good old times!| Why, these are the good
          old times, time never was so old as it is now. These are the best
          times. I do think that many an old puritan would jump out of his grave
          if he knew what was doing now. If they could have been told of the
          great movement at Exeter Hall, there is many a man among them who once
          fought against the Church of England, who would lift his hand to
          heaven, and cry, |My God, I bless thee that I see such a day as this!|
          In these times there is a breaking down of many of the barriers. The
          bigots are afraid; they are crying out most desperately, because they
          think God's people will soon love each other too well. They are afraid
          that the trade of persecution will soon be done with, if we begin to
          be more and more united. So they are making an outcry, and saying,
          |These are not good times.| But true lovers of God will say they have
          not lived in better days than these; and they all hopefully look for
          greater things still. Unless you professors of religion are eminently
          in earnest in prayer, you will disgrace yourselves by neglecting the
          finest opportunity that ever men had. I do think that your fathers who
          lived in days when great men were upon earth, who preached with much
          power -- I do think, if they had not prayed, they would have been as
          unfaithful as you will be. For now the good ship floats upon a flood
          tide: sleep now, and you will not cross the bar at the harbour's
          mouth. Never did the sun of prosperity seem to shine much more fully
          on the church during the last hundred years than now. Now is your
          time, neglect now to sow your seed in this good time of seed-sowing;
          neglect now to reap your harvest in these good days when it is ripe,
          and darker days may come, and those of peril, when God shall say,
          |Because they would not cry to me, when I stretched out my hands to
          bless them, therefore will I put away my hand, and will no more bless
          them, until again they shall seek me.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And now to close. I have a young man here who has been lately
          converted. His parents cannot bear him; they entertain the strongest
          opposition to him, and they threaten him that if he does not leave off
          praying they will turn him out of doors. Young man! I have a little
          story to tell you. There was once a young man in your position: he had
          begun to pray, and his father knew it. He said to him, |John, you know
          I am an enemy to religion, and prayer is a thing that never shall be
          offered in my house.| Still the young man continued earnest in
          supplication. |Well,| said the father one day, in a hot passion, |you
          must give up either God or me. I solemnly swear that you shall never
          darken the threshold of my door again, unless you decide that you will
          give up praying. I give you till to-morrow morning to choose. The
          night was spent in prayer by the young disciple. He rose in the
          morning, sad to be cast away by his friends, but resolute in spirit,
          that come what might he would serve his God. The father abruptly
          accosted him -- |Well, what is the answer?| |Father,| he said, |I
          cannot violate my conscience, I cannot forsake my God.| |Leave
          immediately,| said he. And the mother stood there; the father's hard
          spirit had made hers hard too and though she might have wept she
          concealed her tears. |Leave immediately| said he. Stepping outside the
          threshold the young man said, |I wish you would grant me one request
          before I go; and if you grant me that, I will never trouble you
          again.| |Well,| said the father, |you shall have anything you like,
          but mark me, you go after you have had that; you shall never have
          anything again.| |It is,| said the son, |that you and my mother would
          kneel down, and let me pray for you before I go.| Well, they could
          hardly object to it; the young man was on his knees in a moment, and
          began to pray with such unction and power, with such evident love to
          their souls, with such true and divine earnestness, that they both
          fell flat on the ground, and when the son rose there they were; and
          the father said, |You need not go, John; come and stop, come and
          stop;| and it was not long before not only he, but the whole of them
          began to pray and they were united to a Christian Church. So do not
          give way. Persevere kindly but firmly. It may be that God shall enable
          you not only to have your own souls saved, but to be the means of
          bringing your persecuting parents to the foot of the cross. That such
          may be the case is our earnest prayer.
