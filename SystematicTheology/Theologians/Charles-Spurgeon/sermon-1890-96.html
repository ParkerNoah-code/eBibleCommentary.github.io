        <p>From the Book of Extracts.</p>
        <p>Melito to his brother Onesimus, greeting: --</p>
        <p>
          As you have often, prompted by your regard for the word of God,
          expressed a wish to have some extracts made from the Law and the
          Prophets concerning the Saviour, and concerning our faith in general,
          and have desired, moreover, to obtain an accurate account of the
          Ancient Books, as regards their number and their arrangement, I have
          striven to the best of my ability to perform this task: well knowing
          your zeal for the faith, and your eagerness to become acquainted with
          the Word, and especially because I am assured that, through your
          yearning after God, you esteem these things beyond all things else,
          engaged as you are in a struggle for eternal salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I accordingly proceeded to the East, and went to the very spot where
          the things in question were preached and took place; and, having made
          myself accurately acquainted with the books of the Old Testament, I
          have set them down below, and herewith send you the list. Their names
          are as follows: --
        </p>
        <p>
          The five books of Moses -- Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
          Deuteronomy; Joshua, Judges, Ruth, the four books of Kings, the two of
          Chronicles, the book of the Psalms of David, the Proverbs of Solomon,
          also called the Book of Wisdom, Ecclesiastes, the Song of Songs, Job,
          the books of the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, of the twelve contained in
          a single book, Daniel, Ezekiel, Esdras. From these I have made my
          extracts, dividing them into six books.<br />
