        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.69)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, March 2, 1856, by the</p>

        <p>"These are the two covenants." -- Galatians 4:24.</p>
        <p>
          THERE cannot be a greater difference in the world between two things
          than there is between law and grace. And yet, strange to say, while
          the things are diametrically opposed and essentially different from
          each other, the human mind is so depraved, and the intellect, even
          when blessed by the Spirit, has become so turned aside from right
          judgment, that one of the most difficult things in the world is to
          discriminate properly between law and grace. He who knows the
          difference, and always recollects it -- the essential difference
          between law and grace -- has grasped the marrow of divinity. He is not
          far from understanding the gospel theme in all its ramifications, its
          outlets, and its branches, who can properly tell the difference
          between law and grace. There is always in a science some part which is
          very simple and easy when we have learned it, but which, in the
          commencement, stands like a high threshold before the porch. Now, the
          first difficulty in striving to learn the gospel is this. Between law
          and grace there is a difference plain enough to every Christian, and
          especially to every enlightened and instructed one; but still, when
          most enlightened and instructed, there is always a tendency in us to
          confound the two things. They are as opposite as light and darkness,
          and can no more agree than fire and water; yet man will be perpetually
          striving to make a compound of them -- often ignorantly, and sometimes
          wilfully. They seek to blend the two, when God has positively put them
          asunder.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall attempt this morning to teach you something of the allegories
          of Sarah and Hagar, that you may thereby better understand the
          essential difference between the covenants of law and of grace. We
          shall not go fully into the subject, but shall only give such
          illustrations of it as the text may furnish us. First, I shall want
          you to notice the two women, whom Paul uses as types -- Hagar and
          Sarah; then I shall notice the two sons -- Ishmael and Isaac; in the
          third place, I shall notice Ishmael's conduct to Isaac; and I shall
          conclude by noticing the the different fates of the two.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, we invite you to notice THE TWO WOMEN -- Hagar and Sarah. It
          is said that they are the types of the two covenants; and before we
          start we must not forget to tell you what the covenants are. The first
          covenant for which Hagar stands, is the covenant of works, which is
          this: "There is my law, O man; if thou on thy side wilt engage to keep
          it, I on my side will engage that thou shalt live by keeping it. If
          thou wilt promise to obey my commands perfectly, wholly, fully,
          without a single flaw, I will carry thee to heaven. But mark me, if
          thou violatest one command, if thou dost rebel against a single
          ordinance, I will destroy thee for ever." That is the Hagar covenant
          -- the covenant propounded on Sinai, amidst tempests, fire and smoke
          -- or rather, propounded, first of all, in the garden of Eden, where
          God said to Adam, "In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
          surely die." As long as he did not eat of the tree, but remained
          spotless and sinless, he was most assuredly to live. That is the
          covenant of the law, the Hagar covenant. The Sarah covenant is the
          covenant of grace, not made with God and man, but made with God and
          Christ Jesus, which covenant is this: "Christ Jesus on his part
          engages to bear the penalty of all his people's sins, to die, to pay
          their debts, to take their iniquities upon his shoulders; and the
          Father promises on his part that all for whom the Son doth die shall
          most assuredly be saved; that seeing they have evil hearts, he will
          put his law in their hearts, that they shall not depart from it, and
          that seeing they have sins, he will pass them by and not remember them
          any more for ever." The covenant of works was, "Do this and live, O
          man!" but the covenant of grace is, "Do this, O Christ, and thou shalt
          live, O man!" The difference of covenants rests here. The one was made
          with man, the other with Christ; the one was a conditional covenant,
          conditional on Adam's standing, the other is a conditional covenant
          with Christ, but as perfectly unconditional with us. There are no
          conditions whatever in the covenant of grace, or if there be
          conditions, the covenant gives them. The covenant gives faith, gives
          repentance, gives good works, gives salvation, as a purely gratuitous
          unconditional act; nor does our continuance in that covenant depend in
          the least degree on ourselves. The covenant was made by God with
          Christ, signed, sealed, and ratified, in all things ordered well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now come and look at the allegory. First, I would have you notice,
          that Sarah who is the type of the new covenant of grace, was the
          original wife of Abraham. Before he knew anything about Hagar, Sarah
          was his wife. The covenant of grace was the original covenant after
          all. There be some bad theologians who teach that God mad man upright,
          and made a covenant with him; that man sinned, and that as a kind of
          afterthought God mad a new covenant with Christ for the salvation of
          his people. Now, that is a complete mistake. The covenant of grace was
          made before the covenant of works; for Christ Jesus, before the
          foundation of the world, did stand as its head and representative; and
          we are said to be elect according to the foreknowledge of God the
          Father, through the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus.
          We, long ere we fell, were loved of God; he did not love us out of
          pity to us, but he loved his people, considered purely as creatures.
          He loved them when they became sinners; but when he started with them
          he considered them as creatures. He allowed them to fall into sin, to
          show forth the riches of his grace, which existed before their sin. He
          did not love them and choose them from among the rest, after their
          fall, but he loved them beyond their sin, and before their sin. He
          made the covenant of grace before we fell by the covenant of works. If
          you could go back to eternity, and ask which is the oldest born, you
          would hear that grace was born before law -- that it came into the
          world long before the law was promulgated. Older even than the
          fundamental principles which guide our morals is that great
          fundamental rock of grace, in covenant made of old, long ere seers
          preached the law, and long ere Sinai smoked. Long before Adam stood in
          the garden God had ordained his people to eternal life, that they
          might be saved through Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice next: though Sarah was the elder wife, yet Hagar bare the first
          son. So the first man Adam was the son of Hagar; though he was born
          perfectly pure and spotless, he was not the son of Sarah when he was
          in the garden. Hagar had the first son. She bore Adam, who lived for a
          time under the covenant of works. Adam lived in the garden on this
          principle. Sins of commission were to be his fall; and if he omitted
          to do the sin, then he was to stand for ever. Adam had it entirely in
          his own power whether he would obey God or not: his salvation, then,
          rested simply on this basis, "If thou touchest that fruit thou diest;
          if thou obeyest my command, and dost not touch it, thou shalt live."
          And Adam, perfect as he was, was but an Ishmael, and not an Isaac,
          till after his fall. Apparently, at any rate, he was a Hagarene,
          though secretly, in the covenant of grace, he may have been a child of
          promise. Blessed be God, we are not under Hagar now; we are not under
          the law since Adam fell. Now Sarah hath brought forth children. The
          new covenant is, "The mother of us all."
        </p>
        <p>
          But notice again, Hagar was not intended to be a wife; she never ought
          to have been anything but a hand-maid to Sarah. The law was never
          intended to save men: it was only designed to be a hand-maid to the
          covenant of grace. When God delivered the law on Sinai, it was apart
          from his ideas that any man would ever be saved by it; he never
          conceived that man would attain perfection thereby. But you know that
          the law is a wondrous handmaid to grace. Who brought us to the
          Saviour? Was it not the law thundering in our ears? We should never
          have come to Christ if the law had not driven us there; we should
          never have known sin if the law had not revealed it. The law is
          Sarah's handmaid to sweep our hearts, and make the dust fly so that we
          may cry for blood to be sprinkled that the dust may be laid. The law
          is, so to speak, Jesus Christ's dog, to go after his sheep, and bring
          them to the shepherd; the law is the thunderbolt which affrighteth
          ungodly men, and maketh them turn from the error of their ways, and
          seek after God. Ah! if we know rightly how to use the law, if we
          understand how to put her in her proper place, and make her obedient
          to her mistress, then all will be well. But this Hagar will always be
          wishing to be mistress, as well as Sarah; and Sarah will never allow
          that, but will be sure to treat her harshly, and drive her out. We
          must do the same; and let none murmur at us, if we treat the Hagarenes
          harshly in these days -- if we sometimes speak hard things against
          those who are trusting in the works of the law. We will quote Sarah as
          an example. She treated Hagar harshly, and so will we. We mean to make
          Hagar flee into the wilderness: we wish to have nothing to do with
          her. Yet it is very remarkable, that coarse and ill-featured as Hagar
          is, men have always a greater love for her than they have for Sarah;
          and they are prone continually to be crying, "Hagar, thou shalt be my
          mistress," instead of saying, "Nay, Sarah, I will be thy son, and
          Hagar shall be bondmaid." What is God's law now? It is not above a
          Christian -- it is under a Christian. Some men hold God's law like a
          rod, in terrorem, over Christians, and say, "If you sin you will be
          punished with it." It is not so. The law is under a Christian; it is
          for him to walk on, to be his guide, his rule, his pattern. "We are
          not under the law, but under grace." Law is the road which guides us,
          not the rod which drives us, nor the spirit which actuates us. The law
          is good and excellent, if it keeps its place. Nobody finds fault with
          the handmaid, because she is not the wife; and no one shall despise
          Hagar because she is not Sarah. If she had but remembered her office,
          it had been all well, and her mistress had never driven her out. We do
          not wish to drive the law out of chapels, as long as it is kept in its
          right position; but when it is set up as mistress, away with her; we
          will have nought to do with legality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: Hagar never was a free woman, and Sarah never was a slave. So,
          beloved, the covenant of works never was free, and none of her
          children ever were. All those who trust in works never are free, and
          never can be, even could they be perfect in good works. Even if they
          have no sin, still they are bond-slaves, for when we have done all
          that we ought to have done, God is not our debtor, we are debtors
          still to him, and still remain as bond-slaves. If I could keep all
          God's law, I should have no right to favour, for I should have done no
          more than was my duty, and be a bond-slave still. The law is the most
          rigorous master in the world, no wise man would love its service; for
          after all you have done, the law never gives you a "Thank you," for
          it, but says, "Go on, sir, go on.!" The poor sinner trying to be saved
          by law is like a blind horse going round and round a mill, and never
          getting a step further, but only being whipped continually; yea, the
          faster he goes, the more work he does, the more he is tired, so much
          the worse for him. The better legalist a man is, the more sure he is
          of being damned; the more holy a man is, if he trust to his works, the
          more he may rest assured of his own final rejection and eternal
          portion with Pharisees. Hagar was a slave; Ishmael, moral and good as
          he was, was nothing but a slave, and never could be more. Not all the
          works he ever rendered to his father could make him a free-born son.
          Sarah never was a slave. She might be sometimes taken prisoner by
          Pharoah, but she was not a slave then; her husband might sometimes
          deny her, but she was his wife still; she was soon owned by her
          husband, and Pharoah was soon obliged to send her back. So the
          covenant of grace might seem once in jeopardy, and the representative
          of it might cry, "My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from
          me;" but it never was in real hazard. And sometimes the people under
          the covenant of grace may seem to be captives and bond-slaves; but
          still they are free. Oh! that we knew how to "stand fast in the
          liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free."
        </p>
        <p>
          One thought more. Hagar was cast out, as well as her son; but Sarah
          never was. So the covenant of works has ceased to be a covenant. Not
          only have the people been cast away who trusted in it, not simply was
          Ishmael cast out, but Ishmael's mother too. SO the legalist may not
          only know himself to be damned, but the law as a covenant has ceased
          to be, for mother and son are both driven out by the gospel, and those
          who trust in law are sent away by God. You ask to-day who is Abraham's
          wife? Why Sarah; does she not sleep side by side with her husband in
          the Machpelah's cave at this instant? There she lies, and if she lie
          there for a thousand years to come, she will still be Abraham's wife,
          while Hagar never can be. Oh, how sweet to think, that the covenant
          made of old was in all things ordered well, and never, never shall be
          removed. "Although my house be not so with God, yet hath he made with
          me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and sure." Ah! ye
          legalists, I do not wonder that ye teach the doctrine of falling away,
          because that is consistent with your theology. Of course, Hagar has to
          be driven out, and Ishmael too. But we who preach the covenant of free
          and full salvation know, that Isaac never shall be driven out, and
          that Sarah never shall cease to be the friend and wife of Abraham. Ye
          Hagarenes! ye ceremonialists! ye hypocrites! ye formalists! of what
          avail will it be, when at last ye shall say, "Where is my mother?
          Where is my mother, the law?" Oh! she is driven out, and thou mayest
          go with her into eternal oblivion. But where is my mother? the
          Christian can say at last; and it will be said, "There is the mother
          of the faithful, Jerusalem above, the mother of us all; and we shall
          enter in, and dwell with our Father and our God."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now we are going to review the TWO SONS. While the two women were
          types of the two covenants, the two sons were types of those who live
          under each covenant. Isaac is a type of the man who walks by faith,
          and not by sight, and who hopes to be saved by grace; Ishmael of the
          man who lives by works, and hopes to be saved by his own good deeds.
          Let us look at these two.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, Ishmael is the elder. So, beloved, the legalist is a great deal
          older than the Christian. If I were a legalist to-day, I should be
          some fifteen or sixteen years older than I am as a Christian, for we
          are all born legalists. Speaking of Arminians, Whitfield said, "We are
          all born Arminians." It is grace that turns us into Calvinists, grace
          that makes Christians of us, grace that makes us free, and makes us
          know our standing in Christ Jesus. The legalist must be expected,
          then, to have more might of argument than Isaac; and when the two boys
          are wrestling, of course Isaac generally gets a fall, for Ishmael is
          the biggest fellow. And you must expect to hear Ishmael making the
          most noise, for he is to be a wild man, his hand against every man,
          and every man's hand against him; whereas Isaac is a peaceful lad. He
          always stands up for his mother, and when he is mocked, he can go and
          tell his mother that Ishmael mocked him, but that is all that he can
          do; he has not much strength. So you notice now-a-days. The
          Ishmaelites are generally the strongest, and they can give us
          desperate falls when we get into argument with them. In fact, it is
          their boast and glory that the Isaacs have not much power of reasoning
          -- not much logic. No, Isaac does not want it, for he is an heir
          according to promise, and promise and logic do not much consist
          together. His logic is his faith; his rhetoric is his earnestness.
          Never expect the gospel to be victorious when you are disputing after
          the manner of men; more usually look to be beaten. If you are
          discoursing with a legalist, and he conquers you, say, "Ah! I expected
          that; it shows I am an Isaac, for Ishmael will be sure to give Isaac a
          thrashing, and I am not at all sorry for it. Your father and mother
          were in the prime of life, and were strong; and it was natural that
          you should overcome me, for my father and mother were quite old
          people.
        </p>
        <p>
          But where was the difference between the two lads in their outward
          appearance? There was no difference between them as to ordinances, for
          both of them were circumcised. There was no distinction with regard to
          outward and visible signs. So, my dearly beloved, there is often no
          difference between Ishmael and Isaac, between the legalist and the
          Christian, in matters of outward ceremonies. The legalist takes the
          sacrament and is baptized; he would be afraid to die if he did not.
          And I do not believe there was much difference as to character.
          Ishmael was nearly as good and honorable a man as Isaac; there is
          nothing said against him in Scripture; indeed, I am led to believe
          that he was an especially good lad, from the fact that when God gave a
          blessing, he said, "With Isaac shall the blessing be." Abraham, said,
          "O that Ishmael might live before thee." He cried to God for Ishmael,
          because he loved the lad, doubtless, for his disposition. God said,
          yes, I will give Ishmael such-and-such a blessing; he shall be the
          father of princes, he shall have temporal blessings; but God would not
          turn aside, even for Abraham's prayer. And when Sarah was rather
          fierce, as she must have been that day when she turned Hagar out of
          the house, it is said, "It grieved Abraham because of his son;" and I
          do not suspect that Abraham's attachment was a foolish one. There is
          one trait in Ishmael's character that you love very much. When Abraham
          died, he did not leave Ishmael a single stick or stone, for he had
          previously given him his portion and sent him away; yet he came to his
          father's funeral, for it is said that his sons Ishmael and Isaac
          buried him in Machpelah. There seems then to have been but little
          difference in the characters of the two. So, dearly beloved, there is
          little difference between the legalist and the Christian as to the
          outward walk. They are both the visible sons of Abraham. It is not a
          distinction of life; for God allowed Ishmael to be as good as Isaac,
          in order to show that it was not the goodness of man that made any
          distinction, but that he "will have mercy on whom he will have mercy,
          and whom he will be hardeneth."

          Then what was the distinction? Paul has told us that the first was
          born after the flesh, and the second after the Spirit. The first was a
          natural son, the other a spiritual one. Ask the legalist, "You do good
          works; you have repented, you say: you are keeping the law, and you
          have no need to repent. Now, where did you get your strength from?"
          Perhaps he says, "Grace;" but if you ask him what he means, he says
          that he used it; he had grace, but he used it. Then the difference is,
          you used your grace, and others did not. Yes. Well, then, it is your
          own doing. You may call it grace, or you may call it mustard; it was
          no grace after all, for it was your using, you say, that made the
          difference. But ask poor Isaac how he has kept the law, and what does
          he say? Very badly, indeed. Are you a sinner, Isaac? "Oh! yes, an
          exceedingly great one; I have rebelled against my father times without
          number; I have often gone astray from him." Then you do not think
          yourself quite as good as Ishmael, do you? "No." But yet there is a
          difference between you and him after all. What has made the
          difference? "Why, grace has made me to differ." Why is not Ishmael an
          Isaac? Could Ishmael have been an Isaac? "No," says Isaac, "it was God
          who made me to differ, from the first to the last; he made me a child
          of promise before I was born, and he must keep me so."
        </p>
        <p>"Grace all the work shall crown</p>
        <p>Through everlasting days;</p>
        <p>It lays in heaven the topmost stone,</p>
        <p>And well deserves the praise."</p>
        <p>
          Isaac has more really good works; he does not stand second to Ishmael.
          When he is converted, he labours, if it be possible, to serve his
          father far more than the legalist does his master; but still
          doubtless, if you were to hear both their tales, you would hear Isaac
          say that he was a poor miserable sinner, while Ishmael would make
          himself out a very honorable Pharisaic gentleman. The difference is
          not in works, however, but in motives; not in the life, but in the
          means of sustaining life -- not in what they do, so much as in how
          they do it. Here, then, is the difference between some of you. Not
          that you legalists are worse than Christians; you may be often better
          in your lives, and yet you may be lost. Do you complain of that as
          unjust? Not in the least. God says men must be saved by faith, and if
          you say, "No, I will be saved by works," you may try it, but you will
          be lost for ever. It is as if you had a servant, and you should say,
          "John, go and do such-and-such a thing in the stable;" but he goes
          away and does the reverse, and then says, "Sir, I have done it very
          nicely." "Yes," you say, "but that is not what I told you to do." So
          God has not told you to work out your salvation by good works; but he
          has said, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it
          is God that worketh in you to will and to do of his good pleasure." So
          that when you come before God with your good works he will say, "I
          never told you to do that. I said, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
          and be baptized, and thou shalt be saved." "Ah!" you say, "I though
          the other was a great deal better way." Sir, you will be lost for your
          thoughts. "Why is it that the Gentiles, who followed not after
          righteousness, have attained unto righteousness," when Israel, who
          followed after righteousness, hath not attained it? It is this:
          "Because they sought it not by faith, but by the works of the law."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now I will briefly say a word or two concerning ISHMAEL'S CONDUCT
          TO ISAAC. It says that Ishmael mocked Isaac. Have not some of you,
          dear sons of Hagar, felt exceedingly irritated when you heard this
          doctrine? You have said, "It is dreadful, it is horrible, it is quite
          unjust, that I may be as good as I like, but if I am not a son of the
          promise, I cannot be saved; it is really awful, it is an immoral
          doctrine; it does a deal of damage, and ought to be stopped." Of
          course! That shows that you are an Ishmael. Of course Ishmael will
          mock at Isaac; and we need no further explanation. Where the pure
          sovereignty of God is preached, where it is held that the child of the
          promise, and not the child of the flesh, is the heir, the child of the
          flesh always makes a hubbub about it. What said Ishmael to Isaac?
          "What business have you here? Am I not my father's eldest son? I
          should have had all the property, if it had not been for you. Are you
          above me?" That is how the legalist talks. "Is not God the father of
          everybody? Are we not all his children? He ought not to make any
          difference." Said Ishmael: "Am not I as good as you? Do I not serve my
          father as well? As for you, you know you are your mother's favourite,
          but my mother is as good as yours." And so he teased and mocked at
          Isaac. That is just how you Arminians do with free salvation. The
          legalist says, "I don't see it, I cannot have it, and I won't; if we
          are both equal in character, it cannot be fair that one should be
          lost, and the other saved." And thus he mocks at free grace. You may
          get on very easily, if you do not preach free grace too fully, but if
          you dare to speak such things, though they are obnoxious to the crowd,
          what will people say? They call them "baits for popularity." (See the
          so-called FREEMAN Newspaper.) Few fishes, however, bite at those
          baits. Most men say, "I hate him, I cannot bear him; he is so
          uncharitable." You say we preach this to gain popularity! Why, it is,
          upon the surface of it, a bare-faced lie; for the doctrine of God's
          sovereignty will always be unpopular; men will always hate it, and
          grind their teeth, just as they did when Jesus taught it. Many widows
          he said, were in Israel, but to none of them was the prophet sent,
          save unto a widow of Sarepta. And many lepers were in Israel, but none
          of them were healed, except one who came far away from Syria. A fine
          popularity our Saviour got from that sermon. The people ground their
          teeth at him; and all the popularity he had, would have been to be
          pushed down the hill, from which, it is said, they would have cast him
          headlong, but he made his way out of them and escaped. What! popular
          to humble a man's pride, to abolish man's standing, and make him
          cringe before God as a poor sinner? No; it will never be popular till
          men be born angels, and all men love the Lord, and that will not be
          just yet, I ween.
        </p>
        <p>IV. But we have to enquire WHAT BECAME OF THE TWO SONS.</p>
        <p>
          First, Isaac had all the inheritance, and Ishmael none. Not that
          Ishmael came off poorly, for he had many presents, and became very
          rich and great in this world; but he had no spiritual inheritance. So
          the legalist will get many blessings, as a reward for his legality; he
          will be respected and honored. "Verily," said Christ, "the Pharisees
          have their reward." God does not rob any man of his reward. Whatever a
          man angles for, he catches. God pays men all he owes, and a great deal
          over; and those who keep his law, even in this world, will receive
          great favours. By obeying God's command they will not injure their
          bodies as much as the vicious, and they will preserve their reputation
          better-obedience does good in this way. But then Ishmael had none of
          the inheritance. So, thou poor legalist, if thou art depending on thy
          works, or on anything, except the free sovereign grace of God, for thy
          deliverance from death, thou wilt not have so much as a foot of the
          inheritance of Canaan, but in that great day when God shall allot the
          portions of all the sons of Jacob, there will be not a scrap for thee.
          But if thou art a poor Isaac, a poor guilty trembling sinner -- and if
          thou sayest, "Ishmael has his hands full,
        </p>
        <p>But nothing in my hands I bring,</p>
        <p>Simply to the cross I cling."</p>
        <p>If thou art saying this morning --</p>
        <p>I am nothing at all,</p>
        <p>But Jesus Christ is my all in all."</p>
        <p>
          If thou renouncest all the works of the flesh, and dost confess, "I
          the chief of sinners am, but I am the child of the promise; and Jesus
          died for me," thou shalt have an inheritance, and thou shalt not be
          robbed of it by all the mocking Ishmaels in the world; nor shall it be
          diminished by the sons of Hagar. Thou mayest sometimes be sold, and
          carried down to Egypt, but God will bring his Josephs and his Isaacs
          back again, and thou shalt yet be exalted to glory, and sit on
          Christ's right hand. Ah! I have often thought what consternation there
          will be in hell when outwardly good men go there. "Lord," saith one as
          he goes in, "am I to go into that loathsome dungeon? Did not I keep
          the Sabbath? Was not I a strict Sabbatarian? I never cursed or swore
          in all my life. Am I to go there? I paid tithes of all that I
          possessed, and am I to be locked up there? I was baptized; I took the
          Lord's supper; I was everything that ever a man could be, that was
          good. It is true, I did not believe in Christ; but I did not think I
          needed Christ, for I thought I was too good and too honorable; and am
          I to be locked up there?" Yes, sir! and amongst the damned thou shalt
          have this pre-eminence, that thou didst scorn Christ most of all. They
          never set up an anti-Christ. They followed sin, and so didst thou in
          thy measure, but thou didst add to thy sin this most damnable of sins:
          that thou didst set up thyself as an anti-Christ, and bowed down and
          worshipped thine own fancied goodness. Then God will proceed to tell
          the legalist, "On such a day I heard thee rail at my sovereignty; I
          heard thee say it was unfair of me to save my people, and distribute
          my favors after the counsel of my own will; thou didst impugn thy
          Creator's justice, and justice thou shalt have in all its power." The
          man had thought he had a great balance on his side, but he finds it is
          only some little grain of duty; but then God holds up the immense roll
          of his sins, with this at the bottom: "Without God, without hope, a
          stranger from the common wealth of Israel!" The poor man then sees
          that his little treasure is not half a mite, while God's great bill is
          ten thousand million talents; and so with an awful howl, and a
          desperate shriek, he runs away with all his little notes of merit that
          he had hoped would have saved him; crying, "I am lost! I am lost with
          all my good works! I find my good works were sands, but my sins were
          mountains; and because I had not faith, all my righteousness was but
          white-washed hypocrisy."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, once more, Ishmael was sent away, and Isaac was kept in the
          house. So there you are some of you, when the searching day shall come
          to try God's church, though you have been living in the church as well
          as others, though you have got the mask of profession on you, you will
          find that it will not avail. You have been like the elder son;
          whenever a poor prodigal has come into the church, you have said, "As
          soon as thy son is come which hath devoured thy living with harlots,
          thou hast killed for him the fatted calf." Ah! envious legalist, thou
          wilt be banished at last from the house. I tell you legalist, and
          formalist, that you have no more to do with Christ than the heathens
          have, and thou you have been baptized with Christian baptism, though
          you sit at a Christian table, though you hear a Christian sermon, you
          have neither part nor lot in the matter, any more than a Catholic or a
          Mahomedan, unless you are trusting simply in the grace of God, and are
          an heir according to the promise. Whosoever doth trust to his works,
          though it be ever so little, will find that that little trust will
          ruin his soul. All that nature spins must be unravelled. That ship
          which works have builded must have her keel cut in halves. A soul must
          trust simply and wholly to the covenant of God, or else that soul is
          lost. Legalist, thou hopest to be saved by works. Come, now, I will
          treat thee respectfully. I will not charge thee with having been a
          drunkard, or a swearer; but I want to ask thee, Art thou aware, that
          in order to be saved by thy works, it is requisite that thou shouldst
          be entirely perfect? God demands the keeping of the whole law. If you
          have a vessel with the smallest crack in it, it is not a whole one.
          Have you never committed sin in all your life? Have you never thought
          an evil thought, never had an evil imagination? Come, sire, I would
          not suppose that you have stained those white kid gloves with anything
          like lust, or carnality, or that your fine mouth which uses such
          chaste language ever condescended to an oath, or anything like
          lasciviousness; I will not imagine that you have ever sung lascivious
          son; I will leave that out of the question -- but hast thou never
          sinned? "Yes," sayest thou. Then, mark this: "the soul that sinneth,
          it shall die;" and that is all I have to say to thee. But if thou wilt
          deny that thou hast ever sinner, dost thou know that if in future thou
          commit but one sin -- though thou shouldst live for seventy years a
          perfect life, and at the end of that seventy years thou shouldst
          commit one sin, all thy obedience would go for nothing; for "He that
          offends in one point is guilty of all." "Sir," you say, "you are going
          on a wrong supposition, for though I believe I ought to do some good
          works, I believe Jesus Christ is very merciful, and though I am not
          exactly perfect, I am sincere, and I think sincere obedience will be
          accepted instead of perfect obedience." You do, indeed! and pray what
          is sincere obedience? I have known a man get drunk once a week; he was
          very sincere, and he did not think he was doing wrong so long as he
          was sober on a Sunday. Many people have what they call a sincere
          obedience, but it is one which always leaves a little margin for
          iniquity. But then you say, "I do not take too much margin, it is only
          a little sin I allow." My dear sir, you are quite in error as to your
          sincere obedience, for if this be what God requires, then hundreds of
          the vilest characters are as sincere as you are. But I do not believe
          you are sincere. If you were sincere, you would obey what God says,
          "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." It
          strikes me thy sincere obedience is a sincere delusion, and such thou
          wilt find it. "Oh," sayest thou, "I believe that after all we have
          done, we must go to Jesus Christ, and we must say, "Lord, there is a
          great deficiency here, wilt thou make it up?" I have heard of weighing
          witches against the parish Bible, and if they were found heavier they
          were declared to be innocent; but to put the witch and the Bible in
          the same scale is a new idea. Why, Christ will not get in the scale
          with such a conceited fool as thou art. You wish Christ to be a
          make-weight. He is much obliged to you for the compliment, but he will
          accept no such menial service. "Oh," sayest thou, "he shall assist me
          in the matter of salvation." Yes, I know that would please you; but
          Christ is a very different kind of Saviour; he has a propensity when
          he does a thing to do it all. You may think it strange, but he never
          likes any assistance. When he made the world, he did not ask the angel
          Gabriel so much as to cool the molten matter with his wing, but he did
          it entirely himself. So it is in salvation: he says, "My glory I will
          not give to another." And I beg to remind thee, as thou professest to
          go to Christ, and yet to have a little share in the business thyself,
          that there is a passage in the Scriptures which is apropos to thee,
          and which thou mayest masticate at thy leisure, "And if by grace, then
          is it no more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be
          of works, then is it no more grace; otherwise work is no more work."
          For if you mix the two together, you spoil them both. Go home, sir,
          and make yourself a stirabout with fire and water, endeavour to keep
          in your house a lion and a lamb, and when you have succeeded in doing
          these, tell me that you have made works and grace agree, and I will
          tell you, you have told me a lie even then, for the two things are so
          essentially opposite, that it cannot be done. Whosoever amongst you
          will cast all his good works away, and will come to Jesus, with this
          "Nothing, nothing, NOTHING,
        </p>
        <p>Nothing in my hands I bring,</p>
        <p>Simply to the cross I cling,</p>
        <p>
          Christ will give you good works enough, his Spirit will work in you to
          will and to do of his good pleasure, and will make you holy and
          perfect; but if you have endeavoured to get holiness before Christ,
          you have begun at the wrong end, you have sought the flower before you
          have the root, and are foolish for your pains. Ishmaels, tremble
          before him now! If others of you be Isaacs, may you ever remember that
          you are children of the promise. Stand fast. Be not entangled by the
          yoke of bondage, for you are not under the law, but under grace.
