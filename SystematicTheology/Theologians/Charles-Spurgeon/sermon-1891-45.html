          1. They do not believe that He, who is God above all, formed by His
          Word, in His own territory, as He Himself pleased, the various and
          diversified [works of creation which exist], inasmuch as He is the
          former of all things, like a wise architect, and a most powerful
          monarch. But they believe that angels, or some power separate from
          God, and who was ignorant of Him, formed this universe. By this
          course, therefore, not yielding credit to the truth, but wallowing in
          falsehood, they have lost the bread of true life, and have fallen into
          vacuity and an abyss of shadow. They are like the dog of Ã†sop, which
          dropped the bread, and made an attempt at seizing its shadow, thus
          losing the [real] food. It is easy to prove from the very words of the
          Lord, that He acknowledges one Father and Creator of the world, and
          Fashioner of man, who was proclaimed by the law and the prophets,
          while He knows no other, and that this One is really God over all; and
          that He teaches that that adoption of sons pertaining to the Father,
          which is eternal life, takes place through Himself, conferring it [as
          He does] on all the righteous.

          2. But since these men delight in attacking us, and in their true
          character of cavillers assail us with points which really tell not at
          all against us, bringing forward in opposition to us a multitude of
          parables and [captious] questions, I have thought it well, on the
          other side, first of all to put to them the following inquiries
          concerning their own doctrines, to exhibit their improbability, and to
          put an end to their audacity. After this has been done, [I intend] to
          bring forward the discourses of the Lord, so that they may not only be
          rendered destitute of the means of attacking us, but that, since they
          will be unable reasonably to reply to those questions which are put,
          they may see that their plan of argument is destroyed; so that, either
          returning to the truth, and humbling themselves, and ceasing from
          their multifarious phantasies, they may propitiate God for those
          blasphemies they have uttered against Him, and obtain salvation; or
          that, if they still persevere in that system of vainglory which has
          taken possession of their minds, they may at least find it necessary
          to change their kind of argument against us.<br />
