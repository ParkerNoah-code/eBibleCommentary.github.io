          1. How, again, could either the angels, or the Creator of the world,
          have been ignorant of the Supreme God, seeing they were His property,
          and His creatures, and were contained by Him? He might indeed have
          been invisible to them on account of His superiority, but He could by
          no means have been unknown to them on account of His providence. For
          though it is true, as they declare, that they were very far separated
          from Him through their inferiority [of nature], yet, as His dominion
          extended over all of them, it behoved them to know their Ruler, and to
          be aware of this in particular, that He who created them is Lord of
          all. For since His invisible essence is mighty, it confers on all a
          profound mental intuition and perception of His most powerful, yea,
          omnipotent greatness. Wherefore, although "no one knows the Father,
          except the Son, nor the Son except the Father, and those to whom the
          Son will reveal Him," yet all [beings] do know this one fact at least,
          because reason, implanted in their minds, moves them, and reveals to
          them [the truth] that there is one God, the Lord of all.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. And on this account all things have been [by general consent]
          placed under the sway of Him who is styled the Most High, and the
          Almighty. By calling upon Him, even before the coming of our Lord, men
          were saved both from most wicked spirits, and from all kinds of
          demons, and from every sort of apostate power. This was the case, not
          as if earthly spirits or demons had seen Him, but because they knew of
          the existence of Him who is God over all, at whose invocation they
          trembled, as there does tremble every creature, and principality, and
          power, and every being endowed with energy under His government. By
          way of parallel, shall not those who live under the empire of the
          Romans, although they have never seen the emperor, but are far
          separated from him both by land and sea, know very well, as they
          experience his rule, who it is that possesses the principal power in
          the state? How then could it be, that those angels who were superior
          to us [in nature], or even He whom they call the Creator of the world,
          did not know the Almighty, when even dumb animals tremble and yield at
          the invocation of His name? And as, although they have not seen Him,
          yet all things are subject to the name of our Lord, so must they also
          be to His who made and established all things by His word, since it
          was no other than He who formed the world. And for this reason do the
          Jews even now put demons to flight by means of this very adjuration,
          inasmuch as all beings fear the invocation of Him who created them.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If, then, they shrink from affirming that the angels are more
          irrational than the dumb animals, they will find that it behoved
          these, although they had not seen Him who is God over all, to know His
          power and sovereignty. For it will appear truly ridiculous, if they
          maintain that they themselves indeed, who dwell upon the earth, know
          Him who is God over all whom they have never seen, but will not allow
          Him who, according to their opinion, formed them and the whole world,
          although He dwells in the heights and above the heavens, to know those
          things with which they themselves, though they dwell below, are
          acquainted. [This is the case], unless perchance they maintain that
          Bythus lives in Tartarus below the earth, and that on this account
          they have attained to a knowledge of Him before those angels who have
          their abode on high. Thus do they rush into such an abyss of madness
          as to pronounce the Creator of the world void of understanding. They
          are truly deserving of pity, since with such utter folly they affirm
          that He (the Creator of the world) neither knew His Mother, nor her
          seed, nor the Pleroma of the Ã†ons, nor the Propator, nor what the
          things were which He made; but that these are images of those things
          which are within the Pleroma, the Saviour having secretly laboured
          that they should be so formed [by the unconscious Demiurge], in honour
          of those things which are above.
