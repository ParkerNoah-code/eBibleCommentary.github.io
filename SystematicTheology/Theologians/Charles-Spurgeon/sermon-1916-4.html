        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.3496)</p>
        <p>Published on Thursday, January 27th, 1916.</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.</p>
        <p>On Lord's-day Evening, September 3rd, 1871.</p>
        <p>
          "But now in Christ Jesus, ye, who sometimes were far off, are made
          nigh by the blood of Christ." -- Ephesians 2:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          I DO not want you to feel at this time as if you were listening to a
          sermon, or to any sort of set discourse, but rather I should like, if
          it were possible, that you should feel as if you were alone with the
          Saviour, and were engaged in calm and quiet meditation; and I will try
          to be the prompter, standing at the elbow of your contemplation,
          suggesting one thought and then another; and I pray, dear brethren and
          sisters in, Christ, as many of you as are truly in him, that you may
          be able so to meditate as to be profited, and to say at the close, "My
          meditation on him was sweet. I will be glad in his name." There are
          three very simple things in the text. The first is what we were. Some
          time ago "we were far off." But secondly, what we are -- we are "made
          nigh" And then there is the how, the means of this great change. It is
          "in Christ Jesus," and it is added, "by the blood of Christ." First,
          then, let us with humility consider, as believers: --
        </p>
        <p>I. WHAT WE WERE.</p>
        <p>
          There was a day when we passed from death unto life. All of us who are
          children of God have undergone a great and mysterious change; we have
          been new created, we have been born again. If any of you have not
          experienced this great change, I can only pray that you may, but you
          will not be likely to take much interest in the theme of meditation
          this evening. As many of you as have experienced this great change are
          now asked to recollect what you were. You were far off, first, in the
          respect that you were aliens from the commonwealth of Israel. The Jew
          was brought nigh. The Jewish people were favoured of God with light,
          while the rest of the world remained in darkness. "To them he gave"
          the oracles; with them he made a covenant; but as for the rest of the
          nations, they were left unclean and far off. They could not come near
          to God. This was our condition. We were Gentiles. We had no
          participation in the covenant that God had made with Abraham; we had
          no share in the sacrifices of Aaron or his successors. We could not
          come in by the way of circumcision. We were not born after the flesh,
          and we had no right to that fleshly covenant, however great its
          privileges. We are brought nigh now. All that the Jew ever had we
          have. We have all his privileges, and more. He had but the shadow, we
          have the substance. He had but the type: we have the reality. But
          aforetime we had neither shadow nor substance; we were afar off, and
          had no participation in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, beloved, when we think of our distance from God, there are three
          or four ways in which we may illustrate it. We were far off from God,
          for a vast cloudland of ignorance hung between our souls and him. We
          were lost as in a tangled wood in which there was no pathway. We were
          like some bird drifted out to sea that should be bereft of the
          instinct which guides it on its course, driven to and fro by every
          wind, and tossed like a wave by every tempest. We knew not God,
          neither did we care to know. We were in the dark with regard to him
          and his character; and when we did make guesses concerning God, they
          were very wide of the truth, and did not help to bring us at all near.
          He has taught us better now; he has taught us to call him Father, and
          to know that he is love. Since we have known God, or, rather, have
          been known of God, we have come nigh, but once our ignorance kept us
          very far off. Worse than that, there was between us and God a vast
          range of the mountains of sin. We can measure the Alps, the Andes have
          been sealed, but the mountains of sin no man has ever measured yet.
          They are very high. They pierce the clouds. Can you think of the
          mountains of your sin, beloved? Reckon them all up since your
          birth-sins of childhood, and youth, and manhood, and riper years; your
          sins against the gospel, and against the law; sins with the body, and
          sins with the mind; sins of every shape and form -- ah! what a
          mountain range they make! And you were on one side of that mountain,
          and God was on the other. A holy God could not wink at sin, and you,
          an unholy being, could not have fellowship with the thrice Holy God.
          What a distance! -- an impassable mountain sundered you from your God.
          It has all gone now. The mountains have sunk into the sea, our
          transgressions have all gone, but, oh! what hills they were once, and
          what mountains they were but a little while ago! In addition to these
          mountains, there was, on the other side nearest to God, a great gulf
          of divine wrath. God was angry, justly angry, with us. He could not
          have been God if sin had not made him angry. He that plays with sin is
          very far from knowing anything of the character of the Most High.
          There was a deep gulf. Ah! even the lost in hell know not how deep it
          is. They have been sinking: but this abyss hath no bottom. God's love
          is infinite. Who knoweth the power of shine anger, O Most High? It is
          all filled now, as far as we are concerned. Christ has bridged the
          chasm. He has taken us to the other side of it; he ho brought us nigh;
          but what a gulf it was! Look down and shudder. Have you ever stood on
          a glacier and looked down a crevasse, and taken a great stone and
          thrown it down, and waited till at last you heard the sound as it
          reached the bottom? Have not you shuddered at the thought of falling
          down that steep? But there you stood but a little while ago, an heir
          of wrath, even as others. So the Apostle puts it, "even as others."
          Oh! how far off you were!
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor was this all, for there was another division between you and God.
          When, dear friends, we were brought to feel our state, and to have
          some longings after the Most High, had the mountains of sin been moved
          and the chasm of wrath been filled, yet there remained another
          distance of our own making. There was a sea of fear rolling between us
          and God. We dare not come to him. He told us he would forgive, but we
          could not think it true. He said that the blood would cleanse us --
          the precious blood of the atoning sacrifice -- but we thought our
          stains too crimson to be removed. We dared not believe in the infinite
          compassion of our Father. We ran from him; we could not trust him. Do
          you not remember those times when to believe seemed an impossibility,
          and salvation by faith appeared to be as difficult a thing as
          salvation by the works of the law? That sea has gone away now. We have
          been ferried o'er its streams. We have no fear of God now in the form
          of trembling, slavish fear; we are brought nigh and say, "Abba
          Father," with an untrembling tongue. You see then something of the
          distance there was between us and God, but I will illustrate it in
          another way. Think of God a moment. Your thoughts cannot reach him: he
          is infinitely pure; the heavens are not clean in his sight; and he
          charges his angels with folly. That is one side of the picture. Now
          look at yourself, a worm that has rebelled against its Creator,
          loathsome with sin, through and through defiled. When I see a beggar
          and a prince stand together I see a distance, but ah! it is but an
          inch, a span, compared with the infinite leagues of distance in
          character and nature between God and the fallen man. Who but Christ
          could have lifted up from so low an estate to so high a condition --
          from fellowship with devils unto communion with Jehovah himself? The
          distance was inconceivable. We were lost in wonder at the greatness of
          the love that made it all to vanish. We were afar off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I have stated that very simply. Think it over a minute. And what
          do you feel as the result of your thought? Why, humility rises.
          Suppose you are a very experienced Christian, and a very intelligent
          reader of the Bible; suppose that for many years your have been able
          to maintain a consistent character. Ah! my dear brother, my dear
          sister, you have nothing whereof glory when you recollect what you
          were, and what you would have been still if it had not been for
          sovereign grace. You, perhaps, have forgotten a little that you were
          just what the Bible says. You have been so contemplating your present
          privileges that you have for a while failed to remember that it is
          only by the grace of God that you are what you are. Let these
          considerations bring you beck to your true condition. And now with
          lowly reverence at the cross-foot bow down your soul and say, "My
          Lord, between me and the greatest reprobate there is no difference but
          what thy grace has made; between me and lost souls in hell there is no
          difference except what shine infinite compassion has deigned to make.
          I humbly bless thee, and adore thee, and love thee, because thou hast
          brought me nigh."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now we shall continue our contemplation, but take the second
          point. We have a bitter pill in this first one, but the next
          consideration kills it, takes the bitterness away, and sweetens it. It
          is:
        </p>
        <p>II. WHAT WE ARE -- WHAT WE ARE</p>
        <p>
          "We are made nigh through the blood of Christ." You will please to
          observe that the Apostle does not say, "We hope we are"; he speaks
          positively, as every believer should. Nor does he say, "We shall be."
          There are privileges reserved for the future, but here he is speaking
          of a present blessing, which may be now the object of distinct
          definite knowledge, which ought to be, indeed, a matter of present
          experimental enjoyment. We are brought nigh. What means he by this?
          Does not he mean, first, what I have already said, that as we were far
          off, being Gentiles, and not of the favoured commonwealth of Israel,
          we are now brought nigh, that is to say, we have all the privileges of
          the once favoured race. Are they the seed of Abraham? So, are we. for
          he was the Father of the faithful, and we, having believed, have
          become his spiritual children. Had they an altar? We have an altar
          whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. Had they
          any high priest? We have an high priest we have one who has entered
          into the heavenly. Had they a sacrifice and paschal supper? We have
          Christ Jesus, who, by his one offering, hath for ever put away our
          sin, and who is to-day the spiritual meat on which we feed. All that
          they had we have, only we have it in a fuller and clearer sense. "The
          law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ," and
          they have come to us. But we are brought a great deal nearer than the
          Jew -- than most of the Jews were, for you know, brethren, the most
          devout Jew could not offer sacrifice to God; I mean, as a rule.
          Prophets were exceptions. They could not offer sacrifices themselves;
          they could bring the victim, but there were some special persons who
          must act as priests. The priest came nigh to God on the behalf of the
          people. Listen, O ye children of God, who were once afar off! It is
          the song of heaven. Let it be your song on earth -- "Thou wast slain
          and hast redeemed us unto God by thy blood, and hath made us priests
          and kings." We are all priests if we love the Saviour. Every believer
          is a priest. It is for him to bring his sacrifice of prayer, and
          thanksgiving, and come in, even into the holy place in the presence of
          the Most High. And I might say more, for no priest went into the most
          holy place of all, save one, the high priest, and he once in the year,
          not without blood and not without smoke and of incense, ventured into
          the most holy place. Be we, brethren, see the veil taken right away,
          and we come up to the mercy-seat without the trembling which the high
          priest felt of old, for we see the blood of Jesus on the mercy-seat
          and the veil rent, and we come, boldly to the throne of heavenly grace
          to obtain grace to help in time of need. Oh! how near we are; nearer
          than the ordinary Jew; nearer than the priest; as near as the high
          priest himself, for in the person of Christ we are where he is, that
          is, at the throne of God. Let me say, dear brethren, that we are near
          to God today, for all that divides us from God is gone. The moment a
          sinner believes, all that mountain of sin ceases to be. Can you see
          those hills -- those towering Andes? Who shall climb them? But lo! I
          see one come who has the soar of one that has died upon a cross. I see
          him hold up his pierced hand, and one drop of blood falls on the
          hills, and they smoke; they dissolve like the fat of rams; they burn
          to vapour, and they are gone. There is not so much as a vestige of
          them left. Oh! glory be to God, there is no sin in God's book against
          the believer; there is no record remaining; he hath taken it away and
          nailed it to his cross, and triumphed in the deed. As the Egyptians
          were all drowned in the sea, and Israel said, "The depths have covered
          them; there was not one of them left," so may every believer say," All
          sin is gone, and we are pure, accepted in the Beloved, justified
          through the blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ." Oh! how glorious
          this nearness is when all distance is gone!
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, brethren, we are near to God, for we are his friends. He is
          our mighty friend, and we love him in return. Better than that, we are
          his children. A friend might be forgotten, but a child -- a father's
          bowels yearn towards him. We are his children. He has chosen us that
          we may approach unto him, that we may dwell in his courts and abide,
          and go no more out for ever." The servant abideth not in the house for
          ever, but the son abideth ever." And this is our privilege. And yet
          even more than that. Can anybody here imagine how near Jesus Christ is
          to God, So near are we, for that is truth which the little verse
          sings: --
        </p>
        <p>"So near -- so very near to God,</p>
        <p>More near I cannot be;</p>
        <p>For in the person of his Son</p>
        <p>I am as near as he."</p>
        <p>
          If we are, indeed, in Christ, we are one with him: we are members of
          his body, of his flesh, and of his bones; and he has said, "Where I
          am, there shall also my servants be," and he has declared that we
          shall receive the glory -- the glory which he had with the Father
          before the world was. What nearness is this!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I have stated that truth, I want you now to feed on it for a
          minute, and draw the natural conclusions, and feel the fit emotion.
          Beloved, if you are brought so near to God, what manner of lives ought
          you to lead? Common subjects ought never to speak traitorous word, but
          a member of the Privy Council, one who is admitted to the Court,
          should certainly be loyal through and through. Oh! how we ought to
          love God, who has made us nigh! -- a people near unto him. How ought
          heavenly things and holy things to engross our attention! How joyously
          we ought to live too, for with such high favours as these it would be
          ungrateful to be unhappy! We are near to God, brethren. Then God sees
          us in all things -- our heavenly Father knows what we have need of; he
          is always watching over us for good. We are near to him -- let us pray
          as if we were near God. There are some prayers that are dreadful from
          the distance there is evidently in the mind of the offerer. Too
          generally liturgies are addresses to a God too far off to be reached,
          but the humble familiarity which boldly comes trembling with fear, but
          rejoicing with faith, into the presence of God -- this becomes those
          who are made nigh. When a man is near a neighbour whom he trusts he
          tells him his griefs, he asks his help. Deal thus with God; live on
          him, live for him, live in him. Be never distant from a God who has
          made you nigh unto himself. Our life ought to be a heavenly one,
          seeing that we are brought nigh to God -- the God of heaven. Brethren,
          how assured every one of us may be of our safety if we are, indeed,
          believers in Christ, for if we are made nigh by love and friendship to
          our God, he cannot leave us. If, when we were enemies, he brought us
          nigh, will he not keep us now he has made us friends? He loved us so
          as to bring us up from the depths of sin, when we had no thoughts, nor
          desires towards good, and now he has taught us to love him and to long
          for him, will he forsake us? Impossible! What confidence this doctrine
          gives!
        </p>
        <p>
          And once more, dear brethren and sisters, if the Lord has brought us
          nigh, what hope we ought to have for those who are farthest off from
          God to-day! Never be you amongst that pharisaical crew who imagine
          that fallen women or degraded men cannot be uplifted again. Ye were
          sometimes far off, but he has made you nigh. The distance was so great
          in your case that surely he who met that can also meet the distance in
          another case. Have hope for any who can be got under the sound of the
          gospel, and labour on until the more hopeless, the most hopeless, are
          brought there. Oh! let us gird up our loins for Christian work!
          believing that if God has saved us, there remain no impossibles. The
          chief of sinners was saved years ago. Paul said so. He had no mock
          modesty. I believe he said the truth The chief of sinners has gone
          through the gate into heaven, and there is room for the second worst
          to get through -- there is room for thee, friend, as there is room for
          me. The God that brought me nigh has taught me to know that no man is
          beyond the reach of his grace. But I must leave that with you, hoping
          that it will flavour all your thoughts to-night. Once more. The last
          thing we are to consider is: --
        </p>
        <p>III. HOW THE GREAT CHANGE WAS WROUGHT.</p>
        <p>
          We were put into Christ, and then through the blood we were made nigh.
          The doctrine of the Atonement is no novelty in this house. We have
          preached it often, nay, we preach it constantly, and let this mouth be
          dumb when it prefers any other theme to that old, old story of the
          passion, the substitution, and consequent redemption by blood.
          Beloved, it is the blood of Jesus that has done everything for us. Our
          debts Christ has paid; therefore, those debts have ceased to be. The
          punishment of our sin Christ has borne and, therefore, no punishment
          is due to us; substitution has met a case that is never to be met by
          any other means. The just has suffered for the unjust to bring us to
          God. We deserved the sword, but it has fallen upon him who deserved it
          not, who voluntarily placed himself in our room instead, that he might
          give compensation to justice and full liberty to mercy. It is by the
          blood that we are brought nigh then. Christ has suffered in our stead,
          and we are, therefore, forgiven. But think about that blood a minute.
          It means suffering; it means a life surrendered with agony. Suffering
          -- we talk about it; ah! but when you feel it, then you think more of
          the Saviour. When the bones ache, when the body is racked, when sleep
          goes from the eyelids, when the mind is depressed, when the head
          turns; ah! then we say, "My Saviour, I see a little of the price that
          redeemed me from going down into the pit." The mental and physical
          suffering of Christ are both worthy of our consideration, but depend
          upon it his soul's sufferings were the soul of his sufferings; and
          when we are under deep depression, brought near even unto death with
          sorrow, then again we guess how the Saviour bought us. The early
          Church was noted in its preaching for preaching facts. I am afraid now
          that we are too noted for forgetting facts and preaching doctrine. Let
          us have doctrine by all means, but, after all the fact is the great
          thing. When Paul gave a summary of the gospel which he triad preached,
          he said, "This is the gospel that I have preached -- that Jesus Christ
          was crucified, died, was buried, rose again." There in Gethsemane,
          where bloody sweat bedews the soil; there on the pavement, where the
          lash tears again and again into those blessed shoulders till the
          purple streams gush down, and the ploughers make their furrows, and
          the blood fills them; there when they hurl him on his back to the
          ground, and fasten his hands to the wood with rough iron; there when
          they lift him up and dislocate his bones, when they fix the gross into
          the earth; there when they sit and watch him, and insult his prayers,
          and mock his thirst, while he hangs naked to his shame in the midst of
          a ribald crew; there where God himself forsakes him, where Jehovah
          turns his face away from him, where the sufferer shrieks in agony, "My
          God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" -- there it is that we were
          brought nigh, even we that were far off. Adore your Saviour, my
          brethren -- bow before him. He is not here. for he is risen; but your
          hearts can rise, and you can bow at his feet. Oh! kiss those wounds of
          his; ask that by faith you may put your finger into the print of his
          nails, and your hand into his side. "Be not faithless, but believing,"
          and let all your sacred powers of mind assist your imagination and
          faith to realise now the price with which the Saviour brought you from
          a bondage intolerable. God grant you grace to feel something of this.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have laid the truth before you. Now sit down and quietly turn it
          over in your mind. And what will strike you? Why, surely first the
          heinousness of sin. Was there nothing that could wash out sin but
          blood, and was there no blood that could wash it out hut the blood of
          the Son of God? O sin! O sin! what a black, what a damning thing thou
          art! Only the blood of an incarnate God can wash out the smallest
          stain of sin. My heart, I charge thee to hate it; my eyes, look not on
          it; my ears, listen not to its siren charm; my feet, run not in its
          paths; my hands, refuse to handle it; my soul, loathe, loathe that
          which murdered Christ, and thrust a spear through the tenderest heart
          that ever beat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next to that, do you not feel emotions of intense gratitude that, if
          such a price was needed, such a price was found? God had but one son,
          dearer to him than Isaac was to Abraham, and though there was none to
          command him to do it, as there was in Abraham's case, yet voluntarily
          the gracious Father led his son up to the cross. and it pleased the
          Father to bruise, him; he put him to grief; he gave him up for us.
          Which shall I most admire -- the love of the Father, or the love of
          tile Son? Blessed be God, we are not asked to make distinctions, for
          they are one. "I and my Father are one," and in that sacred act of the
          sacrifice for the sins of men the Father and the Son are both to be
          worshipped with equal love. You see, then, the heinousness of sin in
          some degree, for its needing for its pardon the love of Jesus, and the
          love of God that gave the Saviour's blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, dear friends, ere I sit down, let me remark that we learn from
          our text and from the whole contemplation. what it is that would bring
          us nearer experimentally than we are to-night. How did I get nigh
          first? Through the blood. Do I want to get near to God to-night? Have
          I been wandering? Is my heart cold? Have I got into a backsliding
          state? Do I want to come close now to my blessed Father, and again to
          look up to him, and say, " Abba," and rejoice in that filial spirit?
          There is no way for me to come nearer except the blood. Let me think
          of it then, and let me see' its infinite value; it is sufficient, let
          me hear its everlasting, ever-prevalent plea, and oh! then I shall
          feel my soul drawn; for that which draws us nearer to God, and will
          draw us right up to heaven, is none other than the crimson cord Of the
          Saviour's endless, boundless, dying, but ever-living love.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this teaches me, and teaches you, too, and here I have done, what
          it is we ought to preach and teach if we would bring the, far-off ones
          in -- if we would bring near to God those that now wander from him.
          Philosophy, bah! You will philosophize men into hell, but never into
          heaven. Ceremonies you can amuse children, and you can degrade men
          into idiots with them, but you can do nothing else. The gospel, and
          the essence of that gospel, which is the blood of Jesus Christ -- it
          is this which is an omnipotent leverage to uplift the filth,
          debauchery, and poverty of this city into life, into light, and into
          holiness. There is no battering-ram that will ever shake the gates of
          hell except that which every time it strikes sounds this word, "Jesus,
          Jesus, the Crucified." "God forbid that we should glory, save in the
          cross of our Lord Jesus Christ." If it will save us, it will save
          others; only let us spread the good news, let us tell the good
          tidings. Every one of us ought to preach the gospel somehow. You that
          speak in common conversation forget not to speak of him. Scatter such
          tracts as are most full of Christ -- they are the best; others will be
          of little use. Write letters concerning him. Remember his name is like
          ointment, full of sweetness, but to get the perfume you must pour it
          forth. Oh! that we could make fragrant all this neighbourhood with the
          savour of that dear name! Oh! that wherever we dwell every one of us
          might so think of Christ in our hearts that we could not help speaking
          of him with our lips! Living, may we rejoice in him; dying, may we
          triumph in him. May our last whisper on earth be what our first song
          shall be in heaven, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain and hath
          redeemed us unto God by his blood." Oh! I pray God to make this season
          of communion very sweet to you, and I think it will be if you have the
          key of our meditation to-night, and can unlock the door -- if you know
          how far off you were, and see how near you are by the precious blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! there are some far-off ones here to-night, however, to whom I must
          say just this word. Far-off one, God can make you nigh; you can be
          made nigh to-night. Whoever you may be, he is able still to save, but
          the blood must make you nigh -- the blood of Jesus. Trust him. To
          believe is to live, and to believe means only and simply to trust, to
          depend upon. That is faith. Have confidence in Christ's sacrifice, and
          you are saved. God grant you may be enabled to do it, for Jesus' sake.
          Amen.
