          In the third year of Claudius Cæsar, Simon Cephas departed from
          Antioch to go to Rome. And as he passed on he preached in the divers
          countries the word of our Lord. And, when he had nearly arrived there,
          many had heard of it and went out to meet him, and the whole church
          received him with great joy. And some of the princes of the city,
          wearers of the imperial headbands, came to him, that they might see
          him and hear his word. And, when the whole city was gathered together
          about him, he stood up to speak to them, and to show them the
          preaching of his doctrine, of what sort it was. And he began to speak
          to them thus: --
        </p>
        <p>
          Men, people of Rome, saints of all Italy, hear ye that which I say to
          you. This day I preach and proclaim Jesus the Son of God, who came
          down from heaven, and became man, and was with us as one of ourselves,
          and wrought marvellous mighty-works and signs and wonders before us,
          and before all the Jews that are in the land of Palestine. And you
          yourselves also heard of those things which He did: because they came
          to Him from other countries also, on account of the fame of His
          healing and the report of the marvellous help He gave; and whosoever
          drew near to Him was healed by His word. And, inasmuch as He was God,
          at the same time that He healed He also forgave sins: for His healing,
          which was open to view, bore witness of His hidden forgiveness, that
          it was real and trustworthy. For this Jesus did the prophets announce
          in their mysterious sayings, as they were looking forward to see Him
          and to hear His word: Him who was with His Father from eternity and
          from everlasting; God, who was hidden in the height, and appeared in
          the depth; the glorious Son, who was from His Progenitor, and is to be
          glorified, together with His Father, and His divine Spirit, and the
          terrible power of His dominion. And He was crucified of His own will
          by the hands of sinners, and was taken up to His Father, even as I and
          my companions saw. And He is about to come again, in His own glory and
          that of His holy angels, even as we heard Him say to us. For we cannot
          say anything which was not heard by us from Him, neither do we write
          in the book of His Gospel anything which He Himself did not say to us:
          because this word is spoken in order that the mouth of liars may be
          shut, in the day when men shall give an account of idle words at the
          place of judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, because we were catchers of fish, and not skilled in books,
          therefore did He also say to us: "I will send you the Spirit, the
          Paraclete, that He may teach you that which ye know not;" for it is by
          His gift that we speak those things which ye hear. And, further, by it
          we bring aid to the sick, and healing to the diseased: that by the
          hearing of His word and by the aid of His power ye may believe in
          Christ, that He is God, the Son of God; and may be delivered from the
          service of bondage, and may worship Him and His Father, and glorify
          His divine Spirit. For when we glorify the Father, we glorify the Son
          also with Him; and when we worship the Son, we worship the Father also
          with Him; and when we confess the Spirit, we confess the Father also
          and the Son: because in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
          the Spirit, were we commanded to baptize those who believe, that they
          may live for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flee therefore from the words of the wisdom of this world, in which
          there is no profit, and draw near to those which are true and
          faithful, and acceptable before God; whose reward also is laid up in
          store, and whose recompense standeth sure. Now, too, the light has
          arisen on the creation, and the world has obtained the eyes of the
          mind, that every man may see and understand that it is not fit that
          creatures should be worshipped instead of the Creator, nor together
          with the Creator: because everything which is a creature is made to be
          a worshipper of its Maker, and is not to be worshipped like its
          Creator. But this One who came to us is God, the Son of God, in His
          own nature, notwithstanding that He mingled His Godhead with our
          manhood, in order that He might renew our manhood by the aid of His
          Godhead. And on this account it is right that we should worship Him,
          because He is to be worshipped together with His Father, and that we
          should not worship creatures, who were created for the worship of the
          Creator. For He is Himself the God of truth and verity; He is Himself
          from before all worlds and creatures; He is Himself the veritable Son,
          and the glorious fruit which is from the exalted Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          But ye see the wonderful works which accompany and follow these words.
          One would not credit it: the time lo! is short since He ascended to
          His Father, and see how His Gospel has winged its flight through the
          whole creation -- that thereby it may be known and believed that He
          Himself is the Creator of creatures, and that by His bidding creatures
          subsist. And, whereas ye saw the sun become darkened at His death, ye
          yourselves also are witnesses. The earth, moreover, quaked when He was
          slain, and the veil was rent at His death. And concerning these things
          the governor Pilate also was witness: for he himself sent and made
          them known to Cæsar, and these things, and more than these, were read
          before him, and before the princes of your city. And on this account
          Cæsar was angry against Pilate because he had unjustly listened to the
          persuasion of the Jews; and for this reason he sent and took away from
          him the authority which he had given to him. And this same thing was
          published and known in all the dominion of the Romans. That,
          therefore, which Pilate saw and made known to Cæsar and to your
          honourable senate, the same do I preach and declare, as do also my
          fellow-apostles. And ye know that Pilate could not have written to the
          imperial government of that which did not take place and which he had
          not seen with his own eyes; but that which did take place and was
          actually done -- this it was that he wrote and made known. Moreover,
          the watchers of the sepulchre also were witnesses of those things
          which took place there: they became as dead men; and, when those
          watchers were questioned before Pilate, they confessed before him how
          large a bribe the chief-priests of the Jews had given them, so that
          they might say that we His disciples had stolen the corpse of Christ.
          Lo! then, ye have heard many things; and moreover, if ye be not
          willing to be persuaded by those things which ye have heard, be at
          least persuaded by the mighty-works which ye see, which are done by
          His name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let not Simon the sorcerer delude you by semblances which are not
          realities, which he exhibits to you, as to men who have no
          understanding, who know not how to discern that which they see and
          hear. Send, therefore, and fetch him to where all your city is
          assembled together, and choose you some sign for us to do before you;
          and, whichever ye see do that same sign, it will be your part to
          believe in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And immediately they sent and fetched Simon the sorcerer; and the men
          who were adherents of his opinion said to him: As a man concerning
          whom we have confidence that there is power in thee to do anything
          whatsoever, do thou some sign before us all, and let this Simon the
          Galilæan, who preaches Christ, see it. And, whilst they were thus
          speaking to him, there happened to be passing along a dead person, a
          son of one of those who were chiefs and men of note and renown among
          them. And all of them, as they were assembled together, said to him:
          Whichever of you shall restore to life this dead person, he is true,
          and to be believed in and received, and we will all follow him in
          whatsoever he saith to us. And they said to Simon the sorcerer:
          Because thou wast here before Simon the Galilæan, and we knew thee
          before him, exhibit thou first the power which accompanieth thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then Simon reluctantly drew near to the dead person; and they set down
          the bier before him; and he looked to the right hand and to the left,
          and gazed up into heaven, saying many words: some of them he uttered
          aloud, and some of them secretly and not aloud. And he delayed a long
          while, and nothing took place, and nothing was done, and the dead
          person was lying upon his bier.
        </p>
        <p>
          And forthwith Simon Cephas drew near boldly towards the dead man, and
          cried aloud before all the assembly which was standing there: In the
          name of Jesus Christ, whom the Jews crucified at Jerusalem, and whom
          we preach, rise up thence. And as soon as the word of Simon was spoken
          the dead man came to life and rose up from the bier.
        </p>
        <p>
          And all the people saw and marvelled; and they said to Simon: Christ,
          whom thou preachest, is true. And many cried out, and said: Let Simon
          the sorcerer and the deceiver of us all be stoned. But Simon, by
          reason that every one was running to see the dead man that was come to
          life, escaped from them from one street to another and from house to
          house, and fell not into their hands on that day.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the whole city took hold of Simon Cephas, and they received him
          gladly and affectionately; and he ceased not from doing signs and
          wonders in the name of Christ; and many believed in him. Cuprinus,
          moreover, the father of him that was restored to life, took Simon with
          him to his house, and entertained him in a suitable manner, while he
          and all his household believed in Christ, that He is the Son of the
          living God. And many of the Jews and of the pagans became disciples
          there. And, when there was great rejoicing at his teaching, he built
          churches there, in Rome and in the cities round about, and in all the
          villages of the people of Italy; and he served there in the rank of
          the Superintendence of Rulers twenty-five years.
        </p>
        <p>
          And after these years Nero Cæsar seized him and shut him up in prison.
          And he knew that he would crucify him; so he called Ansus, the deacon,
          and made him bishop in his stead in Rome. And these things did Simon
          himself speak; and moreover also the rest, the other things which he
          had in charge, he commanded Ansus to teach before the people, saying
          to him: Beside the New Testament and the Old let there not be read
          before the people anything else: which is not right.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, when Cæsar had commanded that Simon should be crucified with his
          head downwards, as he himself had requested of Cæsar, and that Paul's
          head should be taken off, there was great commotion among the people,
          and bitter distress in all the church, seeing that they were deprived
          of the sight of the apostles. And Isus the guide arose and took up
          their bodies by night, and buried them with great honour, and there
          came to be a gathering-place there for many.
        </p>
        <p>
          And at that very time, as if by a righteous judgment, Nero abandoned
          his empire and fled, and there was a cessation for a little while from
          the persecution which Nero Cæsar had raised against them. And many
          years after the great coronation of the apostles, who had departed out
          of the world, while ordination to the priesthood was proceeding both
          in all Rome and in all Italy, it happened then that there was a great
          famine in the city of Rome.
        </p>
        <p>Here endeth the teaching of Simon Cephas.<br /></p>
