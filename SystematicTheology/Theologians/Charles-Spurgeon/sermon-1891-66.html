          1. Moreover, this impious opinion of theirs with respect to actions --
          namely, that it is incumbent on them to have experience of all kinds
          of deeds, even the most abominable -- is refuted by the teaching of
          the Lord, with whom not only is the adulterer rejected, but also the
          man who desires to commit adultery; and not only is the actual
          murderer held guilty of having killed another to his own damnation,
          but the man also who is angry with his brother without a cause: who
          commanded [His disciples] not only not to hate men, but also to love
          their enemies; and enjoined them not only not to swear falsely, but
          not even to swear at all; and not only not to speak evil of their
          neighbours, but not even to style any one "Raca" and "fool;"
          [declaring] that otherwise they were in danger of hell-fire; and not
          only not to strike, but even, when themselves struck, to present the
          other cheek [to those that maltreated them]; and not only not to
          refuse to give up the property of others, but even if their own were
          taken away, not to demand it back again from those that took it; and
          not only not to injure their neighbours, nor to do them any evil, but
          also, when themselves wickedly dealt with, to be long-suffering, and
          to show kindness towards those [that injured them], and to pray for
          them, that by means of repentance they might be saved -- so that we
          should in no respect imitate the arrogance, lust, and pride of others.
          Since, therefore, He whom these men boast of as their Master, and of
          whom they affirm that He had a soul greatly better and more highly
          toned than others, did indeed, with much earnestness, command certain
          things to be done as being good and excellent, and certain things to
          be abstained from not only in their actual perpetration, but even in
          the thoughts which lead to their performance, as being wicked,
          pernicious, and abominable, -- how then can they escape being put to
          confusion, when they affirm that such a Master was more highly toned
          [in spirit] and better than others, and yet manifestly give
          instruction of a kind utterly opposed to His teaching? And, again, if
          there were really no such thing as good and evil, but certain things
          were deemed righteous, and certain others unrighteous, in human
          opinion only, He never would have expressed Himself thus in His
          teaching: "The righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
          of their Father;" but He shall send the unrighteous, and those who do
          not the works of righteousness, "into everlasting fire, where their
          worm shall not die, and the fire shall not be quenched."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. When they further maintain that it is incumbent on them to have
          experience of every kind of work and conduct, so that, if it be
          possible, accomplishing all during one manifestation in this life,
          they may [at once] pass over to the state of perfection, they are, by
          no chance, found striving to do those things which wait upon virtue,
          and are laborious, glorious, and skilful, which also are approved
          universally as being good. For if it be necessary to go through every
          work and every kind of operation, they ought, in the first place, to
          learn all the arts: all of them, [I say,] whether referring to theory
          or practice, whether they be acquired by self-denial, or are mastered
          through means of labour, exercise, and perseverance; as, for example,
          every kind of music, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and all such as
          are occupied with intellectual pursuits: then, again, the whole study
          of medicine, and the knowledge of plants, so as to become acquainted
          with those which are prepared for the health of man; the art of
          painting and sculpture, brass and marble work, and the kindred arts:
          moreover, [they have to study] every kind of country labour, the
          veterinary art, pastoral occupations, the various kinds of skilled
          labour, which are said to pervade the whole circle of [human]
          exertion; those, again, connected with a maritime life, gymnastic
          exercises, hunting, military and kingly pursuits, and as many others
          as may exist, of which, with the utmost labour, they could not learn
          the tenth, or even the thousandth part, in the whole course of their
          lives. The fact indeed is, that they endeavour to learn none of these,
          although they maintain that it is incumbent on them to have experience
          of every kind of work; but, turning aside to voluptuousness, and lust,
          and abominable actions, they stand self-condemned when they are tried
          by their own doctrine. For, since they are destitute of all those
          [virtues] which have been mentioned, they will [of necessity] pass
          into the destruction of fire. These men, while they boast of Jesus as
          being their Master, do in fact emulate the philosophy of Epicurus and
          the indifference of the Cynics, [calling Jesus their Master,] who not
          only turned His disciples away from evil deeds, but even from [wicked]
          words and thoughts, as I have already shown.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Again, while they assert that they possess souls from the same
          sphere as Jesus, and that they are like to Him, sometimes even
          maintaining that they are superior; while [they affirm that they were]
          produced, like Him, for the performance of works tending to the
          benefit and establishment of mankind, they are found doing nothing of
          the same or a like kind [with His actions], nor what can in any
          respect be brought into comparison with them. And if they have in
          truth accomplished anything [remarkable] by means of magic, they
          strive [in this way] deceitfully to lead foolish people astray, since
          they confer no real benefit or blessing on those over whom they
          declare that they exert [supernatural] power; but, bringing forward
          mere boys [as the subjects on whom they practise], and deceiving their
          sight, while they exhibit phantasms that instantly cease, and do not
          endure even a moment of time, they are proved to be like, not Jesus
          our Lord, but Simon the magician. It is certain, too, from the fact
          that the Lord rose from the dead on the third day, and manifested
          Himself to His disciples, and was in their sight received up into
          heaven, that, inasmuch as these men die, and do not rise again, nor
          manifest themselves to any, they are proved as possessing souls in no
          respect similar to that of Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. If, however, they maintain that the Lord, too, performed such works
          simply in appearance, we shall refer them to the prophetical writings,
          and prove from these both that all things were thus predicted
          regarding Him, and did take place undoubtedly, and that He is the only
          Son of God. Wherefore, also, those who are in truth His disciples,
          receiving grace from Him, do in His name perform [miracles], so as to
          promote the welfare of other men, according to the gift which each one
          has received from Him. For some do certainly and truly drive out
          devils, so that those who have thus been cleansed from evil spirits
          frequently both believe [in Christ], and join themselves to the
          Church. Others have foreknowledge of things to come: they see visions,
          and utter prophetic expressions. Others still, heal the sick by laying
          their hands upon them, and they are made whole. Yea, moreover, as I
          have said, the dead even have been raised up, and remained among us
          for many years. And what shall I more say? It is not possible to name
          the number of the gifts which the Church, [scattered] throughout the
          whole world, has received from God, in the name of Jesus Christ, who
          was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and which she exerts day by day
          for the benefit of the Gentiles, neither practising deception upon
          any, nor taking any reward from them [on account of such miraculous
          interpositions]. For as she has received freely from God, freely also
          does she minister [to others].
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Nor does she perform anything by means of angelic invocations, or
          by incantations, or by any other wicked curious art; but, directing
          her prayers to the Lord, who made all things, in a pure, sincere, and
          straightforward spirit, and calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus
          Christ, she has been accustomed to work miracles for the advantage of
          mankind, and not to lead them into error. If, therefore, the name of
          our Lord Jesus Christ even now confers benefits [upon men], and cures
          thoroughly and effectively all who anywhere believe on Him, but not
          that of Simon, or Menander, or Carpocrates, or of any other man
          whatever, it is manifest that, when He was made man, He held
          fellowship with His own creation, and did all things truly through the
          power of God, according to the will of the Father of all, as the
          prophets had foretold. But what these things were, shall be described
          in dealing with the proofs to be found in the prophetical writings.<br />
