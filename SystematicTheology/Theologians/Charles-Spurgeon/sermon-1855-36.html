        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.37)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, August 26, 1855, by the</p>

        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where
          sin abounded, grace did much more abound." -- Romans 5:20.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no point upon which men make greater mistakes than upon the
          relation which exists between the law and the gospel. Some men put the
          law instead of the gospel: others put the gospel instead of the law;
          some modify the law and the gospel, and preach neither law nor gospel:
          and others entirely abrogate the law, by bringing in the gospel. Many
          there are who think that the law is the gospel, and who teach that men
          by good works of benevolence, honesty, righteousness, and sobriety,
          may be saved. Such men do err. On the other hand, many teach that the
          gospel is a law; that it has certain commands in it, by obedience to
          which, men are meritoriously saved; such men err from the truth, and
          understand it not. A certain class maintain that the law and the
          gospel are mixed, and that partly by observance of the law, and partly
          by God's grace, men are saved. These men understand not the truth, and
          are false teachers. This morning I shall attempt -- God helping me to
          show you what is the design of the law, and then what is the end of
          the gospel. The coming of the law is explained in regard to its
          objects: "Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound."
          Then comes the mission of the gospel: "But where sin abounded, grace
          did much more abound."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall consider this text in two senses this morning. First, as it
          respects the world at large and the entrance of the law into it; and
          then afterwards, as respecting the heart of the convinced sinner, and
          the entrance of the law into the conscience.
        </p>
        <p>I. First, we shall speak of the text as CONCERNING THE WORLD.</p>
        <p>
          The object of God in sending the law into the world was "that the
          offence might abound." But then comes the gospel, for "where sin
          abounded, grace did much more abound." First, then, in reference to
          the entire world, God sent the law into the world "that the offence
          might abound." There was sin in the world long before God sent the
          law. God gave his law that the offence might seem to be an offence;
          ay, and that the offence might abound exceedingly more than it could
          have done without its coming. There was sin long before Sinai smoked;
          long ere the mountain trembled beneath the weight of Deity, and the
          dread trumpet sounded exceeding loud and long, there had been
          transgression. And where that law has never been heard, in heathen
          countries where that word has never gone forth, yet there is sin, --
          because, though men cannot sin against the law which they have never
          seen, yet they can all rebel against the light of nature, against the
          dictates of conscience, and against that traditional remembrance of
          right and wrong, which has followed mankind from the place where God
          created them. All men, in every land, have consciences, and therefore
          all men can sin. The ignorant Hottentot, who has never heard anything
          of a God, has just so much of the light of nature, that in the things
          that are outwardly good or bad he will discern the difference; and
          though he foolishly bows down to stocks and stones, he has a judgment
          which, if he used it, would teach him better. If he chose to use his
          talents, he might know there is a God; for the Apostle, when speaking
          of men who have only the light of nature, plainly declares that "the
          invisible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly
          seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal
          power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse." Romans 1:20.
          Without a divine revelation men can sin, and sin exceedingly --
          conscience, nature, tradition, and reason, being each of them,
          sufficient to condemn them for their violated commandments. The law
          makes no one a sinner; all men are such in Adam, and were so
          practically before its introduction. It entered that "the offence
          might abound." Now this seems a very terrible thought at first sight,
          and many ministers would have shirked this text altogether. But when I
          find a verse I do not understand, I usually think it is a text I
          should study; and I try to seek it out before my heavenly Father, and
          then when he has opened it to my soul, I reckon it my duty to
          communicate it to you, with the holy aid of the Spirit. "The law
          entered that the offence might abound." I will attempt to show you how
          the law makes offenses "abound."
        </p>
        <p>1.</p>
        <p>2.</p>
        <p>3.</p>
        <p>
          Methinks I hear some say, "How unwise it must have been that a law
          should come to make these things abound!" Does it not, at first sight,
          seem very harsh that the great author of the world should give us a
          law which will not justify, but indirectly cause our condemnation to
          be greater? Does it not seem to be a thing which a gracious God would
          not reveal, but would have withheld? But, know ye, "that the
          foolishness of God is wiser than men;" and understand ye that there is
          a gracious purpose even here. Natural men dream that by a strict
          performance of duty they shall obtain favor, but God saith thus: "I
          will show them their folly by proclaiming a law so high that they will
          despair of attaining unto it. They think that works will be sufficient
          to save them. They think falsely, and they will be ruined by their
          mistake. I will send them a law so terrible in its censures, so
          unflinching it its demands, that they cannot possibly obey it, and
          they will be driven even to desperation, and come and accept my mercy
          through Jesus Christ. They cannot be saved by the law -- not by the
          law of nature. As it is, they have sinned against it. But yet, I know,
          they have foolishly hoped to keep my law, and think by works of the
          law they may be justified; whereas I have said, By the works of the
          law no flesh living can be justified;' therefore I will write a law --
          it shall be a black and heavy one -- a burden which they cannot carry;
          and then they will turn away and say, I will not attempt to perform
          it; I will ask my Saviour to bear it for me.'" Imagine a case -- Some
          young men are about to go to sea, where I foresee they will meet with
          a storm. Suppose you put me in a position where I may cause a tempest
          before the other shall arise. Well, by the time the natural storm
          comes on, those young men will be a long way out at sea, and they will
          be wrecked and ruined before they can put back and be safe. But what
          do I? Why, when they are just at the mouth of the river, I send a
          storm, putting them in the greatest danger, and precipitating them
          ashore, so that they are saved. Thus did God. He sends a law which
          shows them the roughness of the journey. The tempest of law compels
          them to put back to the harbour of free grace, and saves them from a
          most terrible destruction, which would otherwise overwhelm them. The
          law never came to save men. It never was its intention at all. It came
          on purpose to make the evidence complete that salvation by works is
          impossible, and thus to drive the elect of God to rely wholly on the
          finished salvation of the gospel. Now, just to illustrate my meaning,
          let me describe it by one more figure. You all remember those high
          mountains called the Alps. Well, it would be a great mercy if those
          Alps were a little higher. It would have been, at all events, for
          Napoleon's soldiers when he led his large army over, and caused
          thousands to perish in crossing. Now, if it could have been possible
          to pile another Alps on their summit, and make them higher than the
          Himalaya, would not the increased difficulty have deterred him from
          his enterprise, and so have adverted the destruction of thousands?
          Napoleon demanded, "Is it possible?" "Barely possible," was the reply.
          "Avancez," cried Buonaparte; and the host were soon toiling up the
          mountain side. Now, by the light of nature, it does seem possible for
          us to go over this mountain of works, but all men would have perished
          in the attempt, the path even of this lower hill being too narrow for
          mortal footsteps. God, therefore, puts another law, like a mountain,
          on the top; and now the sinner says, "I cannot climb over that. It is
          a task beyond Herculean might. I see before me a narrow pass, called
          the pass of Jesus Christ's mercy -- the pass of the cross -- methinks
          I will wend my way thither." But if it had not been that the mountain
          was too high for him, he would have gone climbing up, and climbing up,
          until he sank into some chasm, or was lost under some mighty
          avalanche, or in some other way perished eternally. But the law comes
          that the whole world might see the impossibility of being saved by
          works.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us turn to the more pleasing part of the subject -- the
          superabundance of grace. Having bewailed the devastations and
          injurious deeds of sin, it delights our hearts to be assured that
          "grace did much more abound."
        </p>
        <p>1.</p>
        <p>
          What though those who have been deluded by superstition, and destroyed
          by lust, must be counted by thousands -- grace has still the
          pre-eminence. Saul has slain his thousands, but David his
          ten-thousands. We admit that the number of the damned will be immense,
          but we do think that the two states of infancy and millennial glory
          will furnish so great a reserve of saints that Christ shall win the
          day. The procession of the lost may be long; there must be thousands,
          and thousands, and thousands, of those who have perished, but the
          greater procession of the King of kings shall be composed of larger
          hosts than even these. "Where sin abounded, grace did much more
          abound." The trophies of free grace will be far more than the trophies
          of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet again. Grace doth "much more abound," -- because a time shall come
          when the world shall be all full of grace; whereas there has never
          been a period in this world's history when it was wholly given to sin.
          When Adam and Eve rebelled against God, there was still a display of
          grace in the world; for in the garden at the close of the day, God
          said, "I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy
          seed and her seed; it shalt bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise his
          heel;" and since that first transgression, there has never been a
          moment when grace has entirely lost its footing in the earth. God has
          always had his servants on earth; at times they have been hidden by
          fifties in the caves, but they have never been utterly cut off. Grace
          might be low; the stream might be very shallow, but it has never been
          wholly dry. There has always been a salt of grace in the world to
          counteract the power of sin. The clouds have never been so universal
          as to hide the day. But the time is fast approaching when grace shall
          extend all over our poor world and be universal. According to the
          Bible testimony, we look for the great day when the dark cloud which
          has swathed this world in darkness shall be removed, and it shall
          shine once more like all its sister planets. It hath been for many a
          long year clouded and veiled by sin and corruption; but the last fire
          shall consume its rags and sackcloth. After that fire, the world in
          righteousness shall shine. The huge molten mass now slumbering in the
          bowels of our common mother shall furnish the means of purity.
          Palaces, and crowns, and peoples, and empires, are all to be melted
          down; and after like a plague-house, the present creation has been
          burned up entirely, God will breathe upon the heated mass, and it will
          cool down again. He will smile on it as he did when he first created
          it, and the rivers will run down the new-made hills, the oceans will
          float in new-made channels; and the world will be again the abode of
          the righteous for ever and for ever. This fallen world will be
          restored to its orbit; that gem which was lost from the sceptre of God
          shall be set again, yea, he shall wear it as a signet about his arm.
          Christ died for the world; and what he died for, he will have. He died
          for the whole world, and the whole world he will have, when he has
          purified it and cleansed it and fitted it for himself. "Where sin
          abounded, grace did much more abound;" for grace shall be universal,
          whereas sin never was.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thought more. Hath the world lost its possessions by sin? It has
          gained far more by grace. True, we have been expelled a garden of
          delights, where peace, love, and happiness found a glorious
          habitation. True, Eden is not ours, with its luscious fruits, its
          blissful bowers, and its rivers flowing o'er sands of gold, but we
          have through Jesus a fairer habitation. He hath made us sit together
          in heavenly places -- the plains of heaven exceed the fields of
          paradise in the ever-new delights which they afford, while the tree of
          life, and the river from the throne render the inhabitants of the
          celestial regions more than emparadised. Did we lose natural life and
          subject ourselves to painful death by sin? Has not grace revealed an
          immortality for the sake of which we are too glad to die? Life lost in
          Adam is more restored in Christ. We admit that our original robes were
          rent in sunder by Adam, but Jesus has clothed us with a divine
          righteousness, far exceeding in value even the spotless robes of
          created innocence. We mourn our low and miserable condition, through
          sin, but we will rejoice at the thought, that we are now more secure
          than before we fell, and are brought into closer alliance with Jesus
          than our standing could have procured us. O Jesus! thou hast won us an
          inheritance more wide than our sin has ever lavished. Thy grace has
          overtopped our sins. "Grace doth much more abound."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now we come to the second part of the subject, and that is THE
          ENTRANCE OF THE LAW INTO THE HEART.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have to deal carefully when we come to deal with internal things;
          it is not easy to talk about this little thing, the heart. When we
          begin to meddle with the law of their soul, many become indignant, but
          we do not fear their wrath. We are going to attack the hidden man this
          morning. The law entered their hearts that sin might abound, "but
          where sin abounded, grace did much more abound."
        </p>
        <p>1.</p>
        <p>
          John Bunyan shall explain my meaning by an extract from his famous
          allegory: "Then the Interpreter took Christian by the hand and led him
          into a very large parlour that was full of dust, because never swept;
          in which after he had reviewed it a little while, the Interpreter
          called for a man to sweep. Now, when he began to sweep, the dust
          became so abundantly to fly about, that Christian had almost therewith
          been choked. Then said Interpreter to a damsel that stood by, Bring
          hither water, and sprinkle the room'; the which when she had done, it
          was swept and cleansed with pleasure. Then said Christian, What means
          this?' The Interpreter answered, This parlour is the heart of a man
          that was never sanctified by the sweet grace of the gospel. The dust
          is his original sin and inward corruptions that have defiled the whole
          man. He that began to sweep, at first, is the law; but she that
          brought the water and did sprinkle it, is the gospel. Now, whereas
          thou sawest that as soon as the first began to sweep, the dust did so
          fly about, that the room could not by him be cleansed, but that thou
          wast almost choked therewith; this is to show thee, that the law,
          instead of cleansing the heart (by its working) from sin, doth revive,
          Romans 7:9, put strength into, 1 Corinthians 15:56, and increase it in
          the soul, Romans 5:20, even as it doth discover and forbid it, for
          that doth not give power to subdue. Again, as thou sawest the damsel
          sprinkle the room with water, upon which it was cleansed with
          pleasure; this is to show thee, that when the gospel comes in the
          sweet and precious influences thereof to the heart, then, I say, even
          as thou sawest the damsel lay the dust by sprinkling the floor with
          water, so is sin vanquished and subdued, and the soul made clean,
          through the faith of it, and consequently fit for the King of glory to
          inhabit.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          The heart is like a dark cellar, full of lizards, cockroaches,
          beetles, and all kinds of reptiles and insects, which in the dark we
          see not, but the law takes down the shutters and lets in the light,
          and so we see the evil. Thus sin becoming apparent by the law, it is
          written the law makes the offence to abound.
        </p>
        <p>2.</p>
        <p>3.</p>
        <p>
          The law cuts into the core of the evil, it reveals the seat of the
          malady, and informs us that the leprosy lies deep within. Oh! how the
          man abhors himself when he sees all his rivers of water turned into
          blood, and loathsomeness creeping over all his being. He learns that
          sin is no flesh wound, but a stab in the heart; he discovers that the
          poison has impregnated his veins, lies in his very marrow, and hath
          its fountain in his inmost heart. Now he loathes himself, and would
          fain be healed. Actual sin seems not half so terrible as in-bred sin,
          and at the thought of what he is, he turns pale, and gives up
          salvation by works as an impossibility.
        </p>
        <p>4.</p>
        <p>5.</p>
        <p>
          When Moses smites the sinner he bruises and mangles him with the first
          blow, but at a second or a third, he falls down as one dead. I myself
          have been in such a condition that if heaven could have been purchased
          by a single prayer I should have been damned, for I could no more pray
          than I could fly. Moreover, when we are in the grave which the law has
          digged for us, we feel as if we did not feel, and we grieve because we
          cannot grieve. The dread mountain lies upon us which renders it
          impossible to stir hand or foot, and when we would cry for help our
          voice refuses to obey us. In vain the minister cries, "Repent," Our
          hard heart will not melt; in vain he exhorts us to believe; that faith
          of which he speaks seems to be as much beyond our capacity as the
          creation of the universe. Ruin is now become ruin indeed. The
          thundering sentence is in our ears, "CONDEMNED ALREADY," another cry
          follows it, "DEAD IN TRESPASSES AND SINS," and a third, more awful and
          terrible, mingles its horrible warning, "The wrath to come -- the
          wrath to come." In the opinion of the sinner he is now cast out as a
          corrupt carcass, he expects each moment to be tormented by the worm
          that never dies and to lift up his eyes in hell. Now is mercy's
          moment, and we turn the subject from condemning law to abounding
          grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Listen, O heavy laden, condemned sinner, while in my Master's name, I
          publish superabounding grace. Grace excels sin in its measure and
          efficacy. Though your sins are many, mercy hath many pardons. Though
          they excel the stars, the sands, the drops of dew in their number, one
          act of remission can cancel all. Your iniquity, though a mountain,
          shall be cast into the midst of the sea. Your blackness shall be
          washed out by the cleansing flood of your Redeemer's gore. Mark! I
          said YOUR sins, and I meant to say so, for if you are now a
          law-condemned sinner, I know you to be a vessel of mercy by that very
          sign. Oh, hellish sinners, abandoned profligates, off-casts of
          society, outcasts from the company of sinners themselves, if ye
          acknowledge your iniquity, here is mercy, broad, ample, free, immense,
          INFINITE. Remember this O sinner, --
        </p>
        <p>"If all the sins that men have done,</p>
        <p>In will, in word, in thoughts, in deed,</p>
        <p>Since words were made, or time began,</p>
        <p>Were laid on one poor sinner's head.</p>
        <p>The stream of Jesus' precious blood</p>
        <p>Applied, removes the dreadful load."</p>
        <p>
          Yet again, grace excelleth sin in another thing. Sin shows us its
          parent, and tells us our heart is the father of it, but grace
          surpasseth sin there, and shows the Author of grace -- the King of
          kings. The law traces sin up to our heart; grace traces its own origin
          to God, and
        </p>
        <p>"In his sacred breast I see</p>
        <p>Eternal thoughts of love to me."</p>
        <p>
          O Christian, what a blessed thing grace is, for its source is in the
          everlasting mountains. Sinner, if you are the vilest in the world, if
          God forgives you this morning, you will be able to trace your pedigree
          to him, for you will become one of the sons of God, and have him
          always for your Father. Methinks I see you a wretched criminal at the
          bar, and I hear mercy cry, "Discharge him!" He is pallid, halt, sick,
          maimed -- heal him. He is of a vile race -- lo, I will adopt him into
          my family. Sinner! God taketh thee for his son. What, though thou art
          poor, God says, "I will take thee to be mine for ever. Thou shalt be
          my heir. There is thy fair brother. In ties of blood he is one with
          thee -- Jesus is thy actual brother!" Yet how came this change? Oh! is
          not that an act of mercy? "Grace did much more abound."
        </p>
        <p>"Grace hath put me in the number</p>
        <p>Of the Saviour's family."</p>
        <p>
          Grace outdoes sin, for it lifts us higher than the place from which we
          fell.
        </p>
        <p>
          And again, "where sin abounded, grace did much more abound"; because
          the sentence of the law may be reversed, but that of grace never can.
          I stand here and feel condemned, yet, perhaps, I have a hope that I
          may be acquitted. There is a dying hope of acquittal still left. But
          when we are justified, there is no fear of condemnation. I cannot be
          condemned if I am once justified; fully absolved I am by grace. I defy
          Satan to lay hands on me, if I am a justified man. The state of
          justification is an unvariable one, and is indissolubly united to
          glory. "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God
          that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died,
          yea, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God
          who also maketh intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the
          love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or
          famine, or nakedness, or sword? Nay, in all these things we are more
          than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded that
          neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
          nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any
          other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God,
          which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." Oh! poor condemned sinner, doth
          not this charm thee, and make thee in love with free grace? And all
          this is YOURS. Your crimes, if once blotted out, shall never be laid
          to your charge again. The justification of the gospel is no Arminian
          sham, which may be reversed if you should in future turn aside. No;
          the debt once paid, cannot be demanded twice -- the punishment, once
          endured, cannot again be inflicted. Saved, saved, saved, entirely
          saved by divine grace, you may walk without fear the wide world over.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet, once more. Just as sin makes us sick, and grievous, and sad,
          so does grace make us far more joyful and free. Sin causeth one to go
          about with an aching heart, till he seems as if the world would
          swallow him, and mountains hang above ready to drop upon him. This is
          the effect of the law. The law makes us sad; the law makes us
          miserable. But, poor sinner, grace removeth the evil effects of sin
          upon your spirit, if thou dost believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, thou
          shalt go out of this place with a sparkling eye and a light heart. Ah!
          well do I remember the morning when I stepped into a little place of
          worship, as miserable almost as hell could make me -- being ruined and
          lost. I had often been at chapels where they spoke of the law, but I
          heard not the gospel. I sat down the pew a chained and imprisoned
          sinner; the Word of God came, and I went out free. Though I went in
          miserable as hell, I went out elated and joyful. I sat there black; I
          went away whiter than driven snow. God had said, "Though your sins be
          as scarlet, they shall be whiter than snow." Why not this be thy lot,
          my brother, if thou feelest thyself a sinner now? It is all he asks of
          thee, to feel thy need of him, this thou hast, and now the blood of
          Jesus lies before thee. "The law has entered that sin might abound."
          Thou are forgiven, only believe it; elect, only believe it; tis the
          truth that thou are saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, lastly, poor sinner, has sin made thee unfit for heaven?
          Grace shall render thee a fit companion for seraphs and the just made
          perfect. Thou who art to-day lost and destroyed by sin, shalt one day
          find thyself with a crown upon thy head, and a golden harp in thine
          hand, exalted to the throne of the Most High. Think, O drunkard, if
          thou repentest, there is a crown laid up for thee in heaven. Ye
          guiltiest, most lost and depraved, are ye condemned in your conscience
          by the law? Then I invite you, in my Master's name, to accept pardon
          through his blood. He suffered in your stead, he has atoned for your
          guilt and you are acquitted. Thou art an object of his eternal
          affection, the law is but a schoolmaster, to bring thee to Christ.
          Cast thyself on him. Fall into the arms of saving grace. No works are
          required, no fitness, no righteousness, no doings. Ye are complete in
          him who said, "It is finished."
        </p>
        <p>"Ye debtors whom he gives to know</p>
        <p>That you ten thousand talents owe,</p>
        <p>When humble at his feet you fall,</p>
        <p>Your gracious God forgives them all.</p>
        <p>"Slaves, that have borne the heavy chain</p>
        <p>Of sin, and hell's tyrannic reign,</p>
        <p>To liberty assert your claim,</p>
        <p>And urge the great Redeemer's name.</p>
        <p>"The rich inheritance of heaven,</p>
        <p>Your joy, your boast, is freely giv'n;</p>
        <p>Fair Salem your arrival waits,</p>
        <p>With golden streets, and pearly gates.</p>
        <p>"Her blest inhabitants no more</p>
        <p>Bondage and poverty implore!</p>
        <p>No debt, but love immensely great;</p>
        <p>Their joy still rises with the debt."<br /></p>
