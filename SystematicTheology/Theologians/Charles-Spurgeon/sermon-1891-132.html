          1. Then again, in opposition to the Valentinians, and the other
          Gnostics, falsely so called, who maintain that some parts of Scripture
          were spoken at one time from the Pleroma (a summitate) through means
          of the seed [derived] from that place, but at another time from the
          intermediate abode through means of the audacious mother Prunica, but
          that many are due to the Creator of the world, from whom also the
          prophets had their mission, we say that it is altogether irrational to
          bring down the Father of the universe to such straits, as that He
          should not be possessed of His own proper instruments, by which the
          things in the Pleroma might be perfectly proclaimed. For of whom was
          He afraid, so that He should not reveal His will after His own way and
          independently, freely, and without being involved with that spirit
          which came into being in a state of degeneracy and ignorance? Was it
          that He feared that very many would be saved, when more should have
          listened to the unadulterated truth? Or, on the other hand, was He
          incapable of preparing for Himself those who should announce the
          Saviour's advent?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But if, when the Saviour came to this earth, He sent His apostles
          into the world to proclaim with accuracy His advent, and to teach the
          Father's will, having nothing in common with the doctrine of the
          Gentiles or of the Jews, much more, while yet existing in the Pleroma,
          would He have appointed His own heralds to proclaim His future advent
          into this world, and having nothing in common with those prophecies
          originating from the Demiurge. But if, when within the Pleroma, He
          availed Himself of those prophets who were under the law, and declared
          His own matters through their instrumentality; much more would He,
          upon His arrival hither, have made use of these same teachers, and
          have preached the Gospel to us by their means. Therefore let them not
          any longer assert that Peter and Paul and the other apostles
          proclaimed the truth, but that it was the scribes and Pharisees, and
          the others, through whom the law was propounded. But if, at His
          advent, He sent forth His own apostles in the spirit of truth, and not
          in that of error, He did the very same also in the case of the
          prophets; for the Word of God was always the self-same: and if the
          Spirit from the Pleroma was, according to these men's system, the
          Spirit of light, the Spirit of truth, the Spirit of perfection, and
          the Spirit of knowledge, while that from the Demiurge was the spirit
          of ignorance, degeneracy, and error, and the offspring of obscurity;
          how can it be, that in one and the same being there exists perfection
          and defect, knowledge and ignorance, error and truth, light and
          darkness? But if it was impossible that such should happen in the case
          of the prophets, for they preached the word of the Lord from one God,
          and proclaimed the advent of His Son, much more would the Lord Himself
          never have uttered words, on one occasion from above, but on another
          from degeneracy below, thus becoming the teacher at once of knowledge
          and of ignorance; nor would He have ever glorified as Father at one
          time the Founder of the world, and at another Him who is above this
          one, as He does Himself declare: |No man putteth a piece of a new
          garment upon an old one, nor do they put new wine into old bottles.|
          Let these men, therefore, either have nothing whatever to do with the
          prophets, as with those that are ancients, and allege no longer that
          these men, being sent beforehand by the Demiurge, spake certain things
          under that new influence which pertains to the Pleroma; or, on the
          other hand, let them be convinced by our Lord, when He declares that
          new wine cannot be put into old bottles.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But from what source could the offspring of their mother derive his
          knowledge of the mysteries within the Pleroma, and power to discourse
          regarding them? Suppose that the mother, while beyond the Pleroma, did
          bring forth this very offspring; but what is beyond the Pleroma they
          represent as being beyond the pale of knowledge, that is, ignorance.
          How, then, could that seed, which was conceived in ignorance, possess
          the power of declaring knowledge? Or how did the mother herself, a
          shapeless and undefined being, one cast out of doors as an abortion,
          obtain knowledge of the mysteries within the Pleroma, she who was
          organized outside it and given a form there, and prohibited by Horos
          from entering within, and who remains outside the Pleroma till the
          consummation [of all things], that is, beyond the pale of knowledge?
          Then, again, when they say that the Lord's passion is a type of the
          extension of the Christ above, which he effected through Horos, and so
          imparted a form to their mother, they are refuted in the other
          particulars [of the Lord's passion], for they have no semblance of a
          type to show with regard to them. For when did the Christ above have
          vinegar and gall given him to drink? Or when was his raiment parted?
          Or when was he pierced, and blood and water came forth? Or when did he
          sweat great drops of blood? And [the same may be demanded] as to the
          other particulars which happened to the Lord, of which the prophets
          have spoken. From whence, then, did the mother or her offspring divine
          the things which had not yet taken place, but which should occur
          afterwards?
        </p>
        <p>
          4. They affirm that certain things still, besides these, were spoken
          from the Pleroma, but are confuted by those which are referred to in
          the Scriptures as bearing on the advent of Christ. But what these are
          [that are spoken from the Pleroma] they are not agreed, but give
          different answers regarding them. For if any one, wishing to test
          them, do question one by one with regard to any passage those who are
          their leading men, he shall find one of them referring the passage in
          question to the Propator -- that is, to Bythus; another attributing it
          to Arche -- that is, to the Only-begotten; another to the Father of
          all -- that is, to the Word; while another, again, will say that it
          was spoken of that one Æon who was [formed from the joint
          contributions] of the Æons in the Pleroma; others [will regard the
          passage] as referring to Christ, while another [will refer it] to the
          Saviour. One, again, more skilled than these, after a long protracted
          silence, declares that it was spoken of Horos; another that it
          signifies the Sophia which is within the Pleroma; another that it
          announces the mother outside the Pleroma; while another will mention
          the God who made the world (the Demiurge). Such are the variations
          existing among them with regard to one [passage], holding discordant
          opinions as to the same Scriptures; and when the same identical
          passage is read out, they all begin to purse up their eyebrows, and to
          shake their heads, and they say that they might indeed utter a
          discourse transcendently lofty, but that all cannot comprehend the
          greatness of that thought which is implied in it; and that, therefore,
          among the wise the chief thing is silence. For that Sige (silence)
          which is above must be typified by that silence which they preserve.
          Thus do they, as many as they are, all depart [from each other],
          holding so many opinions as to one thing, and bearing about their
          clever notions in secret within themselves. When, therefore, they
          shall have agreed among themselves as to the things predicted in the
          Scriptures, then also shall they be confuted by us. For, though
          holding wrong opinions, they do in the meanwhile, however, convict
          themselves, since they are not of one mind with regard to the same
          words. But as we follow for our teacher the one and only true God, and
          possess His words as the rule of truth, we do all speak alike with
          regard to the same things, knowing but one God, the Creator of this
          universe, who sent the prophets, who led forth the people from the
          land of Egypt, who in these last times manifested His own Son, that He
          might put the unbelievers to confusion, and search out the fruit of
          righteousness.<br />
