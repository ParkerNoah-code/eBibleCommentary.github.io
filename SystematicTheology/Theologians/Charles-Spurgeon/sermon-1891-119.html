          1. Now in the last days, when the fulness of the time of liberty had
          arrived, the Word Himself did by Himself "wash away the filth of the
          daughters of Zion," when He washed the disciples' feet with His own
          hands. For this is the end of the human race inheriting God; that as
          in the beginning, by means of our first [parents], we were all brought
          into bondage, by being made subject to death; so at last, by means of
          the New Man, all who from the beginning [were His] disciples, having
          been cleansed and washed from things pertaining to death, should come
          to the life of God. For He who washed the feet of the disciples
          sanctified the entire body, and rendered it clean. For this reason,
          too, He administered food to them in a recumbent posture, indicating
          that those who were lying in the earth were they to whom He came to
          impart life. As Jeremiah declares, "The holy Lord remembered His dead
          Israel, who slept in the land of sepulture; and He descended to them
          to make known to them His salvation, that they might be saved." For
          this reason also were the eyes of the disciples weighed down when
          Christ's passion was approaching; and when, in the first instance, the
          Lord found them sleeping, He let it pass, -- thus indicating the
          patience of God in regard to the state of slumber in which men lay;
          but coming the second time, He aroused them, and made them stand up,
          in token that His passion is the arousing of His sleeping disciples,
          on whose account "He also descended into the lower parts of the
          earth," to behold with His eyes the state of those who were resting
          from their labours, in reference to whom He did also declare to the
          disciples: "Many prophets and righteous men have desired to see and
          hear what ye do see and hear."

          2. For it was not merely for those who believed on Him in the time of
          Tiberius CÃ¦sar that Christ came, nor did the Father exercise His
          providence for the men only who are now alive, but for all men
          altogether, who from the beginning, according to their capacity, in
          their generation have both feared and loved God, and practised justice
          and piety towards their neighbours, and have earnestly desired to see
          Christ, and to hear His voice. Wherefore He shall, at His second
          coming, first rouse from their sleep all persons of this description,
          and shall raise them up, as well as the rest who shall be judged, and
          give them a place in His kingdom. For it is truly "one God who"
          directed the patriarchs towards His dispensations, and "has justified
          the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith." For
          as in the first we were prefigured, so, on the other hand, are they
          represented in us, that is, in the Church, and receive the recompense
          for those things which they accomplished.
