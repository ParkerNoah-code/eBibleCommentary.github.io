        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.121)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Evening, March 8, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and it shall be
          eaten as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when
          they cast their leaves; so the holy seed shall be the substance
          thereof." -- Isaiah 6:3.
        </p>
        <p>
          OUR FIRST business to-night will be briefly to explain the metaphor
          employed in the text. The prophet was told that despite all the
          remonstrances he was instructed to deliver, and notwithstanding the
          eloquent earnestness of his lips, which had been just touched by a
          live coal from off the altar, still the people of Israel would
          persevere in their sins, and would therefore be certainly destroyed.
          He asked the question, "Lord, how long?" that is, How long will the
          people be thus impenitent? How long will thy sore judgment thus
          continue? And he was informed that God would waste and destroy the
          cities and their inhabitants, till the land should be utterly
          desolate. Then it was added, for his comfort, "Yet in it shall be a
          tenth." And so it happened; for when "Nebuchadnezzar carried away all
          Jerusalem," the historian gives this reservation -- 'none remained
          save the poorer sort of the people of the land." They were left by the
          captain of the guard, "to be vine-dressers and husbandmen." Thus in it
          there was a tenth; this small remnant of the people, however, was to
          be nearly destroyed too. "It shall return and shall be eaten;" the
          sense is, eaten up or consumed. The poor creatures left in the land,
          many of them fled into Egypt at the time of the conspiracy of Ishmael
          (not Ishmael, the son of Hagar, but an unworthy member of the royal
          family of Judah), and there in Egypt most of them were cut off and
          perished. "But," says God, "although this tenth only shall be
          preserved, and then even this small part shall be subjected to many
          perils yet Israel shall not be destroyed, for it shall be as a
          terebinth tree and as an oak;" their "substance is in them, when they
          cast their leaves," and so lose their verdure and their beauty; thus,
          in like manner, a holy seed, a chosen remnant, shall still be the
          substance of the children of Israel, when the fruitful land is
          stripped of its foliage, and that fair garden of earth is barren as
          the desert.
        </p>
        <p>
          The figure is taken, first of all, from the terebinth or turpentine
          tree -- here translated the teil tree. That tree is an evergreen, with
          this exception, that in very severe and inclement weather it loses its
          leaves; but even then the terebinth tree is not dead. And so of the
          oak; it loses its leaves every year, of course, but even then it is
          not dead. "So," says God, "you have seen the tree in winter, standing
          naked and bare, without any sign of life, its roots buried in the hard
          and frozen soil, and its naked branches exposed to every blast,
          without a bloom or a bud; yet the substance is in the tree when the
          leaves are gone. It is still alive, and it shall, by and by, in due
          season, bud and bloom; so," says he, "Nebuchadnezzar shall cut off all
          the leaves of the tree of Israel -- take away the inhabitants, only a
          tenth shall be left, and they shall well nigh be eaten up; still the
          church of God and the Israel of God never shall be destroyed; they
          shall be like the terebinth tree and the oak, whose substance is in
          them, when they cast their leaves; so the holy seed shall be the
          substance thereof."
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope I have made the meaning of the passage as plain as words can
          make it. Now, then, for the application -- first, to the Jews;
          secondly, to the Church; thirdly, to each believer.
        </p>
        <p>I. First, TO THE JEWS.</p>
        <p>
          What a history is the history of the Jew! He has antiquity stamped
          upon his forehead. His is a lineage more noble than that of any
          knights or even kings of this our island, for he can trace his
          pedigree back to the very loins of Abraham, and through him to that
          patriarch who entered into the ark, and thence up to Adam himself. Our
          history is hidden in gloom and darkness; but theirs, with certainty,
          may be read from the first moment even down till now. And what a
          checkered history has been the history of the Jewish nation.
          Nebuchadnezzar seemed to have swept them all away with the huge broom
          of destruction; the tenth left was again give over to the slaughter;
          and one would have thought we should have heard no more of Israel; but
          in a little time they rose phoenix-like, from their ashes. A second
          temple was builded and the nation became strong once more, and though
          often swept with desolations in the mean time, yet it did not abide,
          and the scepter did not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between
          his feet, until Shiloh came. And, since then, how huge have been the
          waves that have rushed over the Jewish race! The Roman emperor razed
          the city to the ground, and left not a vestige standing; another
          emperor changed the name of Jerusalem into that of Eliah, and forbade
          a Jew to go within some miles of it, so that he might not even look
          upon his beloved city. It was plowed and left desolate. But is the Jew
          conquered? Is he a subjugated man? Is his country seized? No; he is
          still one of earth's nobles -- distressed, insulted, spit upon; still
          it is written, "To the Jew first, and afterward to the Gentile." He
          claims a high dignity above us, and he has a history to come which
          will be greater and more splendid than the history of any nation that
          has yet existed. If we read the Scriptures aright, the Jews have a
          great deal to do with this world's history. They shall be gathered in;
          Messiah shall come, the Messiah they are looking for -- the same
          Messiah who came once shall come again -- shall come as they expected
          him to come the first time. They then thought he would come a prince
          to reign over them, and so he will when he comes again. He will come
          to be king of the Jews, and to reign over his people most gloriously;
          for when he comes, Jew and Gentile will have equal privileges, though
          there shall yet be some distinction afforded to that royal family from
          whose loins Jesus came; for he shall sit upon the throne of his father
          David, and unto him shall be gathered all nations. O!
        </p>
        <p>"Ye chosen seed of Israel's race,</p>
        <p>A remnant weak and small,"</p>
        <p>ye may indeed,</p>
        <p>"Hail him who saves you by his grace,</p>
        <p>And crown him Lord of all;"</p>
        <p>
          your church shall never die, and your race shall never become extinct.
          The Lord hath said it. "The race of Abraham shall endure for ever, and
          his seed as many generations."
        </p>
        <p>
          But why is it that the Jewish race is preserved? We have our answer in
          the text: "The holy seed is the substance thereof." There is something
          within a tree mysterious, hidden, and unknown, which preserves life in
          it when every thing outward tends to kill it. So in the Jewish race
          there is a secret element which keeps it alive. We know what it is: it
          is the "remnant according to the election of grace;" in the worst of
          ages there has never been a day so black but there was a Hebrew found
          to hold the lamp of God. There has always been found a Jew who loved
          Jesus; and though the race now despise the great Redeemer, yet there
          are not a few of the Hebrew race who still love Jesus, the Saviour of
          the uncircumcised, and bow before him. It is these few, this holy
          seed, that are the substance of the nation; and for their sake,
          through their prayers, because of God's love to them, he still says of
          Israel to all nations, "Touch not these mine anointed, do my prophets
          no harm. These are the descendants of Abraham, my friend. I have
          sworn, and will not repent; I will show kindness unto them for their
          father's sake, and for the sake of the remnant I have chosen."
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us think a little more of the Jews than we have been wont; let us
          pray oftener for them. "Pray for the peace old Jerusalem; they shall
          prosper that love her." As truly as any great thing is done in this
          world for Christ's kingdom, the Jews will have more to do with it than
          any of us have dreamed. So much for the first point. the Jewish nation
          is like "a terebinth tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them,
          when they cast their leaves; so the holy seed shall be the substance
          thereof."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now, secondly, THE CHURCH OF CHRIST, whereof the Jewish people
          are but a dim shadow, and an emblem.
        </p>
        <p>
          The church has had its trials; trials from without and trials within.
          It has had days of blood-red persecution, and of fiery trial; it has
          had times of sad apostacy, when an evil heart of unbelief and
          departing from the living God has broken out, and a root of bitterness
          springing up has troubled many, and thereby they have been defiled.
          Yet, blessed be God, through all the winters of the church she still
          lived, and she gives signs now of a sweeter spring-tide, a fresher
          greenness and a healthier condition than she has shown before for many
          a day. Why is it that the church is still preserved, when she looks so
          dead? For this reason: that there is in the midst of her -- though
          many are hypocrites and impostors -- a "chosen seed," who are "the
          substance thereof." You might have looked back a hundred years ago
          upon the professing church of Christ in this land, and what a sad
          spectacle it would have exhibited! In the Church of England there was
          mere formality; in the Independent and Baptist denominations there was
          truth, but it was dead, cold, lifeless truth. Ministers dreamed on in
          their pulpits, and hearers snored in their pews; infidelity was
          triumphant; the house of God was neglected and desecrated. The church
          was like a tree that had lost its leaves: it was in a wintry state.
          But did it die? No; there was a holy seed within it. Six young men
          were expelled from Oxford for praying, reading the Bible, and talking
          to poor people about Christ; and these six young men, with many others
          whom the Lord had hidden by fifties in the caves of the earth, secret
          and unknown -- these young men, leaders of a glorious revival, came
          out, and though ridiculed and laughed at as Methodists, they brought
          forth a great and glorious revival, almost equaling the commencement
          of the gospel triumphs under Paul and the apostles, and very little
          inferior to the great Reformation of Luther, of Calvin, and Zwingle.
          And just now the church is to a great degree in a barren and lifeless
          state. But will she therefore die? you say that true doctrine is
          scarce, that zeal is rare, that there is little life and energy in the
          pulpit and true devotion in the pew, while formality and hypocrisy
          stalk over us, and we sleep in our cradles. But will the church die?
          No; she is like a teil tree and an oak; her substance is in her when
          she has lost her leaves; there is a holy seed in her still that is the
          substance thereof. Where these are we know not; some, I doubt not, are
          here in this church -- some, I hope, are to be found in every church
          of professing Christians: and woe worth the day to the church that
          loses her holy seed; for she must die, like the oak blasted by the
          lightning, whose heart is scorched out of it -- broken down, because
          it has no substance in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me now draw your attention, as a church connected with this place,
          to this point -- that the holy seed is the substance of the church. A
          great many of you might be compared to the bark to the tree; some of
          you are like the big limbs; others are like pieces of the trunk. Well,
          we should be very sorry to lose any of you; but we could afford to do
          so without any serious damage to the life of the tree. Yet there are
          some here -- God knoweth who they are -- who are the substance of the
          tree. By the word "substance" is meant the life, the inward principle.
          The inward principle is in the tree, when it has lost its leaves. Now,
          God discerns some men in this church, I doubt not, who are toward us
          like the inward principle of the oak; they are the substance of the
          church. I would feign hope that all the members of the church in some
          degree contribute to the substance; but I can not think so. I am
          obliged to say I doubt it; because when one hath fallen and another,
          it makes us remember that a church hath much in it that is not life.
          There be some branches on the vine that be cut off, because they do
          not draw sap from the heart of it, they are only branches bound on by
          profession, pretended graftings that have never struck root into the
          parent stock, and that must be cut off, and hewn down, and cast into
          the fire. But there is a holy seed in the church that is the substance
          of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please to note here, that the life of a tree is not determined by the
          shape of the branches, nor by the way it grows, but it is the
          substance. The shape or a church is not its life. In one place I see a
          church formed in an Episcopalian shape; in another place I see one
          formed in a Presbyterian shape; then, again, I see one, like ours,
          formed on an Independent principle. Here I see one with sixteen ounces
          to the pound of doctrine; there I see one with eight, and some with
          very little clear doctrine at all. And yet I find life in all the
          churches, in some degree -- some good men in all of them. How do I
          account for this? Why, just in this way -- that the oak may be alive,
          whatever its shape, if it has got the substance. If there be but a
          holy seed in the church, the church will live; and it is astonishing
          how the church will live under a thousand errors, if there be but the
          vital principle in it. You will find good men among the denominations
          that you can not receive as being sound in faith. You say, "What! can
          any good thing come out of Nazareth?" and you go through, and find
          that there are even in them some true Nazarites of the right order.
          The very best of men found in the worst of churches! A church lives
          not because of its rubrics, and its canons, and its articles; it lives
          because of the holy seed that is in it as the substance. No church can
          die while it has a holy seed in it, and no church can live that has
          not the holy seed, for "the holy seed is the substance thereof."
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, again, that the substance of the oak is a hidden thing; you
          can not see it. When the oak or the terebinth is standing destitute of
          leaves, you know that life is there somewhere. But you can not see it.
          And very likely you can not and do not know the men that are the holy
          seed, the substance of the church. Perhaps you imagine the substance
          of the church lies in the pulpit. Nay, friend! Let us pray to God that
          such of us as are in the pulpit may be a part of that substance; but
          much of the substance of the church lies where you don't know any
          thing of it. There is a mine near Plymouth, where the men who work in
          it, two hundred and fifty feet below the surface, have a little shelf
          for their Bibles and hymn-books, and a little place where every
          morning, when they go down in the black darkness, they bow before God,
          and praise him whose tender mercies are over all his works. You never
          heard of these miners, perhaps, and do not know of them; but perhaps
          some of them are the very substance of the church. There sits Mr.
          Somebody in that pew; O! what a support he is to the church. Yes, in
          money matters, perhaps; but do you know, there is poor old Mrs. Nobody
          in the aisle that is most likely a greater pillar to the church than
          he, for she is a holier Christian, one who lives nearer to her God and
          serves him better, and she is "the substance thereof." Ah! that old
          woman in the garret who is often in prayer; that old man on his bed
          who spends days and nights in supplication; such people as these are
          the substance of the church. O! you may take away your prelates, your
          orators, and the best and greatest of those who stand among earth's
          mighty men, and their place could be supplied; but take away our
          intercessors; take away the men and women that breathe out prayer by
          night and day, and like the priests of old offer the morning and
          evening lamb as a perpetual sacrifice, and you kill the church at
          once. What are the ministers? They are but the arms of the church, and
          the lips of it. A man may be both dumb and armless, and yet live. But
          these, the heavenly seed, the chosen men and women who live near their
          God, and serve him with sacred fervent piety -- these are the heart of
          the church; we can not do without them. If we lose them we must die.
          "The holy seed is the substance thereof."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, my hearers, thou art a church member. Let me ask thee -- art
          thou one of the holy seed? Has thou been begotten again to a lively
          hope? Has God made thee holy by the sanctifying influence of his
          Spirit, and by the justifying righteousness of Christ, and by the
          application to thy conscience of the blood of Jesus? If so, then thou
          art the substance of the church. They may pass by thee and not notice
          thee, for thou art little; but the substance is little; the life-germ
          within the grain of barley is too small for us, perhaps, to detect;
          the life within the egg is almost an animalcula -- you can scarcely
          see it; and so the life of the church is among the little ones, where
          we can scarcely find it out. Rejoice, if you are much in prayer; you
          are the life of the church. But you, O you proud man, pull down your
          grand thoughts of yourself; you may give to the church, you may speak
          for the church, and act for the church, but unless you are a holy seed
          you are not the substance thereof, and it is the substance which is in
          reality of the greatest value.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here let me say one thing before I leave this point. Some of you
          will say, "How is it that good men are the means of preserving the
          visible church?" I answer, the holy seed doth this, because it derives
          its life from Christ. If the holy seed had to preserve the church by
          its own purity and its own strength, the church would go to ruin
          to-morrow; but it is because these holy ones draw fresh life from
          Christ continually that they are able to be, as it were, the salvation
          of the body, and by their influence, direct and indirect, shed life
          over the whole visible church. The prayers of those living ones in
          Zion bring down many a blessing upon us; the groans and cries of these
          earnest intercessors prevail with heaven, and bring down very argosies
          of mercy from the gates of paradise. And besides, their holy example
          tends to check us and preserve us in purity; they walk among us like
          God's own favored ones, wrapped in white, reflecting his image
          wherever they go, and tending, under God, to the sanctifying of
          believers, not through their vaunting any self-righteousness, but by
          stirring up believers to do more for Christ, and to be more like him.
          "The holy seed shall be the substance thereof."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now I come to the third point. this is true of EVERY
          INDIVIDUAL BELIEVER: his substance is in him when he has lost his
          leaves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Arminian says that when a Christian loses his leaves he is dead.
          "No," say God's Word, "he is not; he may look as if he were dead, and
          not have so much as here and there a leaf upon the topmost bough; but
          he is not dead. Their substance is in them even when they lose their
          leaves."
        </p>
        <p>
          By losing their leaves allow me to understand two things. Christian
          men lose their leaves when they lose their comforts, when they lose
          the sensible enjoyment of their Master's presence, and when their full
          assurance is turned into doubting. You have had many such a time as
          that, have you not? Ah! you were one day in such a state of joy, that
          you said you could
        </p>
        <p>"Sit and sing yourself away</p>
        <p>To everlasting bliss."</p>
        <p>
          But a wintry state came, and your joy all departed, and you stood like
          a bare tree, after the wind had swept it in the time of winter, with
          just perhaps one sere leaf hanging by a thread on the topmost bough.
          But you were not dead then; no, your substance was in you, when you
          had lost your leaves. You could not see that substance, and good
          reason why, because your life was hid with Christ in God; you saw not
          your signs, but you had your substance still, though you could not
          discover it. There were no heavings of faith, but faith was there;
          there were no lookings out of hope, but though hope's eyelids were
          shut, the eyes were there, to be opened afterwards; there was no
          lifting, perhaps, of the hand of ardent prayer, but the hands and arms
          were there, though they hung powerless by the side. God said,
          afterwards, "Strengthen the feeble knees, and lift up the hands that
          hang down." Your substance was in you when you had lost your leaves.
          Good Baxter says -- "We do not see graces, except when they are in
          exercise; and yet they are as much there when they are not in exercise
          as when they are." Saith he, "Let a man take a walk into a wood; there
          lieth a hare or a rabbit asleep under the leaves; but he can not see
          the creature until it is frightened, and it runneth out, and then he
          seeth it to be there." So if faith be in exercise you will perceive
          your evidence, but if faith be slumbering and still, you will be led
          to doubt its existence; and yet it is there all the while.
        </p>
        <p>"Mountains when in darkness hidden,</p>
        <p>Are as real as in day,"</p>
        <p>
          said one; and truly the faith of the Christian, when shrouded by
          doubts and fears, is just as much there as when he rejoiceth devoutly
          in the display of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a common error of young converts that they attempt to live by
          their experience, instead of tracing their life up to its precious
          source. I have known persons rejoicing in the fullest assurance one
          day, and sinking into the deepest despondency the next. The Lord will
          sometimes strip you of the leaves of evidence to teach you to live by
          faith, as John Kent says --
        </p>
        <p>"If to-day he deigns to bless us</p>
        <p>With a sense of pardoned sin;</p>
        <p>He to-morrow may distress us</p>
        <p>Make us feel the plague within;</p>
        <p>All to make us</p>
        <p>Sick of self and fond of him."</p>
        <p>
          But, ah! there is a worse phase to the subject than this. Some
          Christians lose their leaves not by doubts, but by sin. This is a
          tender topic -- one which needs a tender hand to touch. O! there are
          some in our churches that have lost their leaves by lust and sin. Fair
          professors once they were; they stood green among the church, like the
          very leaves of paradise; but in an evil hour they fell, the slaves of
          temptation. They were God's own people by many infallible marks and
          signs; and if they were so, though it is grievous that they should
          have lost their leaves, yet there is the sweet consolation, their
          substance is in them still: they are still the Lord's, still his
          living children, though they have fallen into the coma of sin, and are
          now in a fainting fit, having gone astray from him, and having their
          animation suspended, while life is still there. Some, as soon as they
          see a Christian do any thing inconsistent with his profession, say,
          "That man is no child of God; he can not be; it is impossible." Ay,
          but, sir, remember what he thought who once said -- "If a brother err,
          ye that are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness,
          considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted." It is a fact, deny it
          who will, and abuse it, if you please, to your own wicked purposes; I
          can not help it -- it is a fact that some living children of God have
          been allowed -- and an awful allowance it is -- to go into the very
          blackest sins. Do you think David was not a child of God, even when he
          sinned? It is a hard subject to touch; but it is not to be denied. He
          had the life of God within him before; and though he sinned -- O!
          horrid and awful was the crime! -- yet his substance was in him when
          he lost his leaves. And many a child of God has gone far away from his
          Master; but his substance is in him. And how know we this? Because a
          dead tree never lives again; if the substance be really gone, it never
          lives; and God's holy Word assures us, that if the real life of grace
          could die out in any one, it could never come again; for saith the
          apostle, "it is impossible, if they have been once enlightened, and
          have tasted the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the
          Holy Ghost" -- if these fall away -- "it is impossible to renew them
          again unto repentance." Their tree is "dead, plucked up by the roots."
          And the apostle Peter says -- "For if, after they have escaped the
          corruption that is in the world through lust, they are again turned
          back, their last end shall be worse than the first." But now take
          David, or take Peter, which you please. Peter we will have. O! how
          foully did he curse his Master! With many an oath he denied him. But
          had not Peter the life of God in him then? Yes; and how do we know?
          Because when his Master looked upon him, he "went out and wept
          bitterly." Ah! if he had been a dead man, hardened and without the
          substance in him, his Master might have looked to all eternity, and he
          would not have wept bitterly. How know I that David was yet alive?
          Why, by this -- that although there was a long, long winter, and there
          were many prickings of conscience, like the workings of the sap within
          a tree, abortive attempts to thrust forward here and there a shoot
          before its time, yet when the hour was come, and Nathan came to him
          and said, "Thou art the man," had David been dead, without the life of
          God, he would have spurned Nathan from him, and might have done what
          Manasseh did with Isaiah, cut him in pieces in his anger; but instead
          of that he bowed his head and wept before God; and still it is
          written, "The Lord hath put away thy sin, thou shalt not die." His
          substance was in him, when he lost his leaves. O! have pity upon poor
          fallen brethren. O! burn them not; they are not dead logs; though
          their leaves are gone their substance is in them. God can see grace in
          their hearts when you can not see it; he has put a life there that can
          never expire, for he has said, "I give unto my sheep eternal life,"
          and that means a life that live for ever; "the water that I shall give
          him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting
          life." You may choke the well up with big stones, but the water will
          find its way out yet, and well up notwithstanding. And so the heir of
          heaven may, to the grief of the church and to the injury of himself,
          most grievously transgress -- and weep, my eyes, O weep for any that
          have done so, and O bleed, my heart, and thou hast bled, for any that
          have so sinned -- but yet their "substance is in them, when they cast
          their leaves: so the holy seed" -- that is, Christ within them, the
          Holy Ghost within them, the new creature within them -- "the holy seed
          shall be the substance thereof." Poor backslider! here is a word of
          comfort for you. I would not comfort you in your sins; God forbid! But
          if you know your sins and hate them, let me comfort you. Thou art not
          dead! As Jesus said of the damsel, "She is not dead, but sleepeth," so
          let me say of thee, "Thou art not dead; thou shalt yet live." Dost
          thou repent? Dost thou grieve over thy sin? That is thee bud that
          shows that there is life within. When a common sinner sins he repents
          not, or if he doth repent it is with a legal repentance. His
          conscience pricks him, but he hushes it. He does not leave his sin and
          turn from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But did you ever see a child of God after he had been washed from a
          foul sin? He was a changed man. I know such an one, who used to carry
          a merry countenance, and many were the jokes he made in company; but
          when I met him after an awful sin, there was a solemnity about his
          countenance that was unusual to him. He looked, I should say,
          something like Dante, the poet, of whom the boys said, "There is the
          man that has been in hell;" because he had written of hell, and looked
          like it -- he looked so terrible. And when we spoke of sin there was
          such a solemnity about him; and when we spoke of going astray the
          tears ran down his cheeks, as much to say, "I have been astray too."
          He seemed like good Christian, after he had been in Giant Despair's
          castle. Do you not remember, beloved, the guide who took the pilgrims
          up to the top of a hill called Clear, and he showed them from the top
          of the hill a lot of men with their eyes put out, groping among the
          tombs, and Christian asked what it meant. Said the guide, "These are
          pilgrims that were caught in Giant Despair's castle; the giant had
          their eyes put out, and they are left to wander among the tombs to
          die, and their bones are to be left in the court-yard." Whereupon John
          Bunyan very naively says, "I looked, and saw their eyes full of water,
          for they remembered they might have been there too." Just as the man
          talked and spoke that I once knew. He seemed to wonder why God had not
          left him to be an apostate for ever, as the lot of Judas or Demas. He
          seemed to think it such a startling thing that while many had gone
          aside altogether from God's way, he should still have had his
          substance in him, when he had lost his leaves, and that God should
          still have loved him. Perhaps, beloved, God allows some such men to
          live, and sin, and afterward repent, for this reason. You know there
          are some voices needed in music that are very rare, and when, now and
          then, such a voice is to be heard, every one will go to hear it. I
          have thought that perhaps some of these men in heaven will song
          soprano notes before the throne -- choice, wondrous notes of grace,
          because they have gone into the depths of sin after profession; and
          yet he had loved them when their feet made hast to perdition, and
          fetched them up, because he "loved them well." There are but few such;
          for most men will go foully into sin; they will go out from us because
          they are not of us, for if they had been of us they would doubtless
          have continued with us. But there have been a few such -- great
          saints, then great backsliding sinners, and then great saints again.
          Their substance was in them when they had lost their leaves. O! you
          that have gone far astray, sit and weep. You can not weep too much,
          though you should cry with Herbert --
        </p>
        <p>"O, who will give me tears? Come, all ye springs,</p>
        <p>Dwell in my head and eyes; come, clouds and rain!</p>
        <p>My grief hath need of all the water things</p>
        <p>That nature hath produced."</p>
        <p>You might well say --</p>
        <p>"Let every vein</p>
        <p>Suck up a river to supply mine eyes,</p>
        <p>My weary, weeping eyes; too dry for me,</p>
        <p>Unless they get new conduits, new supplies,</p>
        <p>To bear them out, and with my state agree."</p>
        <p>
          But yet remember, "He hath not forsaken his people, neither hath he
          cut them off;" for still he says --
        </p>
        <p>"Return, O wanderer, return,</p>
        <p>And seek an injured father's heart."</p>
        <p>
          Return! return! return! Thy Father's bowels still move for thee. He
          speaks through the written oracles at this moment, saying, "How shall
          I give thee up, Ephraim? How shall I deliver thee, O Israel? How can I
          make thee as Adimah? How can I set thee as Zeboim?" My bowels are
          moved; my repentings are kindled together; for I will heal their
          backslidings, I will receive them graciously, I will love them freely,
          for they are mine still. As the terebinth and as the oak, whose
          substance is in them when they cast their leaves, even so the holy
          seed within the elect and called vessels of mercy, is still the
          substance thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, what have I to say to some of you that live in black sin, and
          yet excuse yourselves on account of the recorded falls of God's
          people? Sir, know this! Inasmuch as you do this, you wrest the
          Scriptures to your own destruction. If one man has taken poison, and
          there has been a physician by his side so skillful that he has saved
          his life by a heavenly antidote, is that any reason why thou, who hast
          no physician and no antidote, should yet think that the poison will
          not kill thee? Why, man, the sin that does not damn a Christian,
          because Christ washes him in his blood, will damn you. Said Brookes --
          and I will repeat his words and have done -- "He that believeth and is
          baptized shall be saved, said the apostle, be his sins never so many;
          but he that believeth not shall be damned, be his sins never so few.
          Truly your sins may be little; but you are lost for them without
          Christ. Your sins may be great; but if Christ shall pardon them, then
          you shall be saved. The one question, then, I have to ask of thee, is
          -- Hast thou Christ? For if thou hast not, then thou hast not the holy
          seed; thou art a dead tree, and in due time thou shalt be tinder for
          hell. Thou art a rotten-hearted tree, all touch-wood, ready to be
          broken in pieces; eaten by the worms of lust; and ah! when the fire
          shall take hold of thee, what a blazing and a burning! O! that thou
          hadst life! O! that God would give it to thee! O! that thou wouldst
          now repent! O! that thou wouldst cast thyself on Jesus! O! that thou
          wouldst turn to him with full purpose of heart! For then, remember,
          thou wouldst be saved -- saved now, and saved for ever; for "the holy
          seed" would be "the substance thereof."<br />
