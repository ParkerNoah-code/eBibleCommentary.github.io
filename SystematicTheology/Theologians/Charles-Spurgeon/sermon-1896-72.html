          6. We have sinned with our fathers, we have acted iniquitously, we
          have done wickedly.7. Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt;
          they remembered not the multitude of thy kindnesses; they rebelled at
          the sea, even the Red Sea.8. Yet he saved them for his own name's
          sake, that he might make his power to be known.9. Also he rebuked the
          Red Sea, and dried it up; and made them walk through the depths, as
          through the desert.10. And saved them from the hand of the enemy, and
          delivered them from the hand of the wicked.11. And the waters covered
          their oppressors: there was not one of them left.

          6 We have sinned with our fathers It is quite plain from these words,
          that although the prophet may have spoken in the person of one man, he
          yet dictates a form of prayer for the common use of the whole Church,
          seeing that he now identifies himself with the whole body. And from
          this to the end of the psalm, he gleans from ancient histories that
          their fathers had always been of a malign and perverse spirit, of
          corrupt practice, rebellious, ungrateful and perfidious towards God;
          and confesses that their descendants were not better; and having made
          this confession, they come and ask the remission of their sins. And as
          we are unable to obtain the pardon of our sins until we have first
          confessed ourselves to be guilty of sin, and as our hardness of heart
          shuts out the grace of God from us, the prophet, therefore, with great
          propriety, humbly acknowledges the guilt of the people in this their
          severe and sore chastisement, and that God might justly inflict upon
          them a yet harder punishment. On another account it was advantageous
          for the Jews to have their sins set before them; because, if God
          punish us severely, we at once suppose that his promises have failed.
          But when, on the contrary, we are reminded that we are receiving the
          reward due to us for our transgressions, then if we thoroughly repent,
          those promises in which God appears as pacified towards us will come
          to our aid. Besides, by the three expressions which he employs in
          reference to their transgressions, he points out their enormity, that
          (as is usually the case) their hearts might not be slightly affected,
          but deeply wounded with sorrow. For we know how men are fettered by
          their vices, and how ready to let themselves alone, until compelled to
          examine themselves in good earnest; nay, what is more, when God calls
          them to judgment, they make a kind of verbal confession of their
          iniquities, while, at the same time, hypocrisy blinds their minds.
          When, therefore, the prophet says, that the people acted iniquitously
          in sinning, and had become ungodly and wicked, he employs no useless
          or unnecessary accumulation of words. Let any of us examine ourselves,
          and we will easily find that we have equal need to be constrained to
          make an ingenuous confession of our sins; for though we dare not say
          that we have no sin, yet there is not one of us but is disposed to
          find a cloak and subterfuge for his sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a very similar manner, Daniel, in the ninth chapter of his
          prophecies, acknowledges the guilt of his own iniquities and those of
          the people; and it may be that the author of this psalm followed his
          example. From both let us learn, that the only way of pleasing God is
          to institute a rigid course of self-examination. Let it also be
          carefully observed, that the holy prophets, who never departed from
          the fear and worship of God, uniformly confessed their own guilt in
          common with the people; and this they did, not out of feigned
          humility, but because they were aware that they themselves were
          tainted with manifold corruptions, for when iniquity abounds, it is
          almost impossible for even the best of men to keep themselves from
          being infected by its baneful effects. Not comparing themselves with
          others, but sisting themselves before God's tribunal, they at once
          perceive the impossibility of making their escape.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time impiety had attained to such a degree of enormity among
          the Jews, that it is not astonishing if even the best and most upright
          men were carried away, as if by the violence of a tempest. How very
          abominable, then, is the pride of those who hardly imagine that they
          offend in the least possible way; nay, who even, like certain fanatics
          of the day, conceive that they have attained to a state of sinless
          perfection! It must be borne in mind, however, that Daniel, who
          carefully kept himself under the fear of God, and whom the Holy
          Spirit, by the mouth of the prophet Ezekiel, declares to be one of the
          most upright of men, did not with reigned lips acknowledge his own
          transgressions, and those of the people, when he confessed them, under
          a deep sense of their grievously and dreadfully abhorrent character in
          the eyes of God. True, indeed, he was not overwhelmed in the same
          torrent of iniquity with others; but he knew that he had contracted a
          very large amount of guilt. Besides, the prophet does not bring
          forward their fathers for the purpose of palliating his own
          delinquency, (as many at the present day set at nought all reproof,
          shielding themselves with this, namely, that they have been so taught
          by their fathers, and that, therefore, their bad education, and not
          they, is at fault,) but rather to show that he and those of his own
          nation were obnoxious to severe punishment, because even from the very
          first, and as if co-existent with their early infancy, they never
          ceased to provoke the displeasure of God against themselves more and
          more by their fresh transgressions. It is in this manner that he
          involves the fathers with the children in many of the grounds of
          condemnation.
        </p>
        <p>
          7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt, Here he relates how
          the people immediately, from the very commencement of their
          emancipation from bondage, were ungrateful to God, and conducted
          themselves in a rebellious manner. Nor does he confine himself to the
          history of one period only, but the whole drift of his narrative is to
          point out that the people had never ceased from doing wickedly,
          although God met them in return with inconceivable kindness; which is
          a proof of the invincible and desperate perversity of this nation. He
          first blames the folly of the people as the occasion of such
          ingratitude. In calling it folly, he does not intend to lessen the
          offense, (as some are often wont to do,) but to expose the vile and
          disgraceful stupidity of the people, in being blind in matters so
          plain; for God's works were such that even the blind might behold
          them. Whence could such gross ignorance originate, unless that Satan
          had so maddened them that they did not regard the miracles of God,
          which might have moved the very stones? Now, when he adds, they
          remembered not, he expresses more forcibly the inexcusable nature of
          their ignorance, nay, that their blindness was the result of stupid
          indifference, more than the want of proper instruction. For the cause
          of their ignorance was their overlooking those matters which, in
          themselves, were abundantly manifest. He further mentions how quickly
          that forgetfulness came upon them, which tended to increase their
          guilt. For it was marvelous that not even the very sight of these
          things could arouse their spirits. Hence it came to pass, that while
          they had scarcely made their departure from Egypt, and were passing
          through the sea, they proudly rose up against their deliverer. Surely
          not one year, nor even a century, ought to have erased from their
          minds deeds so worthy of being remembered. What madness, then, at that
          very time to murmur against God, as if he had abandoned them to be
          slaughtered by their enemies? That arm of the sea through which the
          people passed is, in the Hebrew, called the Sea of Suph. Some
          translate it the Sea of Sedge, and will have the word svph, suph, to
          signify sea-weed. But whatever be its derivation, there can be no
          doubt about the place. It is very likely that the name was given to it
          because it abounded with rushes.

          8 And saved them The prophet here teaches what any one could easily
          learn from the preceding sentence, that the Israelites were saved, not
          on account of their deserving to be so, but because God had a regard
          to his own glory. That obstacle being removed, God went on to
          accomplish that deliverance which he had commenced, in order that his
          holy name might not become a reproach among the heathen. Besides, we
          must not overlook the antithesis between the name of God and the
          merits of men, because God, out of a regard to his own glory, can find
          in us no cause wherefore he should be moved to save us. The
          inestimable kindness of God, which, for the sake of a people so
          perverse, altered the usual order of nature, is more illustriously
          displayed by the account which is afterwards given of the means by
          which they were preserved. When he says that the sea was rebuked, he
          extols the power of God, at whose command and will the sea was dried
          up -- the waters receded, so that a free passage was opened up between
          the opposite heaps of waters. With the design of magnifying the
          miracle, he employs a similitude, which, in all likelihood, was drawn
          from Isaiah; for in the sixty-third chapter and thirteenth verse, he
          says, "Thou hast made thy people to walk through the deeps, as an
          horse in the wilderness, that he might not stumble." When the people
          walked through the sea as upon a dry plain, the prophet informs us
          that this was done solely by the astonishing power of God. It is quite
          possible, that in the desert in which the people wandered, there was
          many an abyss, the path rugged, and many a hill and dale and ragged
          rock. But it cannot be doubted that the prophet extols the power of
          God in the passage through the sea, and enhances it by this
          consideration, that the path through that deep sea was smooth.
          Besides, he gives greater strength to the miracle in saying that their
          enemies were drowned; because, when the sea afforded a free passage to
          the children of Israel, and covered and engulfed the Egyptians, so
          that not one of them escaped alive, whence proceeded this
          instantaneous difference, but from this, that God made a distinction
          between the one people and the other?<br />
