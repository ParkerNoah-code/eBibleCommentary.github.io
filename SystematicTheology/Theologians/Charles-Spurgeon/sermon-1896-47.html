          9. He will not always chide: nor will he keep his anger for ever.10.
          He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to
          our iniquities.11. For in proportion to the height of the heavens
          above the earth has been the greatness of his goodness upon them that
          fear him.12. As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he
          removed our transgressions from us.

          9 He will not always chide David, from the attributes ascribed to God
          in the preceding verse, draws the conclusion, that when God has been
          offended, he will not be irreconcilable, since, from his nature, he is
          always inclined to forgive. It was necessary to add this statement;
          for our sins would be continually shutting the gate against his
          goodness were there not some way of appeasing his anger. David tacitly
          intimates that God institutes an action against sinners to lay them
          low under a true sense of their guilt; and that yet he recedes from it
          whenever he sees them subdued and humbled. God speaks in a different
          manner in Genesis 6:3, where he says, |My Spirit shall no longer
          strive with man,| because the wickedness of men being fully proved, it
          was then time to condemn them. But here David maintains that God will
          not always chide, because so easy is he to be reconciled, and so ready
          to pardon, that he does not rigidly exact from us what strict justice
          might demand. To the same purpose is the language in the second
          clause: nor will he keep anger for ever The expression, to keep anger
          for ever, corresponds with the French phrase, Je lui garde, Il me l'a
          garde, which we use when the man, who cannot forgive the injuries he
          has received, cherishes secret revenge in his heart, and waits for an
          opportunity of retaliation. Now David denies that God, after the
          manner of men, keeps anger on account of the injuries done to him,
          since he condescends to be reconciled. It is, however, to be
          understood that this statement does not represent the state of the
          Divine mind towards all mankind without distinction: it sets forth a
          special privilege of the Church; for God is expressly called by Moses,
          (Deuteronomy 5:9) |a terrible avenger, visiting the iniquities of the
          fathers upon the children.| But David, passing by unbelievers, upon
          whom rests the everlasting and unappeasable wrath of God, teaches us
          how tenderly he pardons his own children, even as God himself speaks
          in Isaiah, (Isaiah 54:7, 8,) |For a small moment have I forsaken thee;
          but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my
          face from them for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have
          mercy on thee.|

          10. He hath not dealt with us after our sins The Psalmist here proves
          from experience, or from the effect, what he has stated concerning the
          Divine character; for it was entirely owing to the wonderful
          forbearance of God that the Israelites had hitherto continued to
          exist. Let each of us, as if he had said, examine his own life; let us
          inquire in how many ways we have provoked the wrath of God? or,
          rather, do we not continually provoke it? and yet he not only forbears
          to punish us, but bountifully maintains those whom he might justly
          destroy.

          11. For in proportion to the height of the heavens above the earth The
          Psalmist here confirms by a comparison the truth that God does not
          punish the faithful as they have deserved, but, by his mercy, strives
          against their sins. The form of expression is equivalent to saying
          that God's mercy towards us is infinite. With respect to the word gvr,
          gabar, it is of little consequence whether it is taken in a neuter
          signification, or in a transitive, as is noted on the margin; for in
          either way the immeasurableness of God's mercy is compared to the vast
          extent of the world. As the mercy of God could not reach us, unless
          the obstacle of our guilt were taken away, it is immediately added,
          (verse 12th,) that God removes our sins as far from us as the east is
          distant from the west The amount is, that God's mercy is poured out
          upon the faithful far and wide, according to the magnitude of the
          world; and that, in order to take away every impediment to its course,
          their sins are completely blotted out. The Psalmist confirms what I
          have just now stated, namely, that he does not treat in general of
          what God is towards the whole world, but of the character in which he
          manifests himself towards the faithful. Whence also it is evident that
          he does not here speak of that mercy by which God reconciles us to
          himself at the first, but of that with which he continually follows
          those whom he has embraced with his fatherly love. There is one kind
          of mercy by which he restores us from death to life, while as yet we
          are strangers to him, and another by which he sustains this restored
          life; for that blessing would forthwith be lost did he not confirm it
          in us by daily pardoning our sins. Whence also we gather how
          egregiously the Papists trifle in imagining that the free remission of
          sins is bestowed only once, and that afterwards righteousness is
          acquired or retained by the merit of good works, and that whatever
          guilt we contract is removed by satisfactions. Here David does not
          limit to a moment of time the mercy by which God reconciles us to
          himself in not imputing to us our sins, but extends it even to the
          close of life. Not less powerful is the argument which this passage
          furnishes us in refutation of those fanatics who bewitch both
          themselves and others with a vain opinion of their having attained to
          perfect righteousness, so that they no longer stand in need of
          pardon.<br />
