          1. But let us return to the fore-mentioned question as to the
          production [of the Æons]. And, in the first place, let them tell us
          the reason of the production of the Æons being of such a kind that
          they do not come in contact with any of those things which belong to
          creation. For they maintain that those things [above] were not made on
          account of creation, but creation on account of them; and that the
          former are not images of the latter, but the latter of the former. As,
          therefore, they render a reason for the images, by saying that the
          month has thirty days on account of the thirty Æons, and the day
          twelve hours, and the year twelve months, on account of the twelve
          Æons which are within the Pleroma, with other such nonsense of the
          same kind, let them now tell us also the reason for that production of
          the Æons, why it was of such a nature, for what reason the first and
          first-begotten Ogdoad was sent forth, and not a Pentad, or a Triad, or
          a Septenad, or any one of those which are defined by a different
          number? Moreover, how did it come to pass, that from Logos and Zoe
          were sent forth ten Æons, and neither more nor less; while again from
          Anthropos and Ecclesia proceeded twelve, although these might have
          been either more or less numerous?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. And then, again, with reference to the entire Pleroma, what reason
          is there that it should be divided into these three -- an Ogdoad, a
          Decad, and a Duodecad -- and not into some other number different from
          these? Moreover, with respect to the division itself, why has it been
          made into three parts, and not into four, or five, or six, or into
          some other number among those which have no connection with such
          numbers as belong to creation? For they describe those [Æons above] as
          being more ancient than these [created things below], and it behoves
          them to possess their principle [of being] in themselves, one which
          existed before creation, and not after the pattern of creation, all
          exactly agreeing as to the point.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The account which we give of creation is one harmonious with that
          regular order [of things prevailing in the world], for this scheme of
          ours is adapted to the things which have [actually] been made; but it
          is a matter of necessity that they, being unable to assign any reason
          belonging to the things themselves, with regard to those beings that
          existed before [creation], and were perfected by themselves, should
          fall into the greatest perplexity. For, as to the points on which they
          interrogate us as knowing nothing of creation, they themselves, when
          questioned in turn respecting the Pleroma, either make mention of mere
          human feelings, or have recourse to that sort of speech which bears
          only upon that harmony observable in creation, improperly giving us
          replies concerning things which are secondary, and not concerning
          those which, as they maintain, are primary. For we do not question
          them concerning that harmony which belongs to creation, nor concerning
          human feelings; but because they must acknowledge, as to their
          octiform, deciform, and duodeciform Pleroma (the image of which they
          declare creation to be), that their Father formed it of that figure
          vainly and thoughtlessly, and must ascribe to Him deformity, if He
          made anything without a reason. Or, again, if they declare that the
          Pleroma was so produced in accordance with the foresight of the
          Father, for the sake of creation, as if He had thus symmetrically
          arranged its very essence, then it follows that the Pleroma can no
          longer be regarded as having been formed on its own account, but for
          the sake of that [creation] which was to be its image as possessing
          its likeness (just as the clay model is not moulded for its own sake,
          but for the sake of the statue in brass, or gold, or silver about to
          be formed), then creation will have greater honour than the Pleroma,
          if, for its sake, those things [above] were produced.<br />
