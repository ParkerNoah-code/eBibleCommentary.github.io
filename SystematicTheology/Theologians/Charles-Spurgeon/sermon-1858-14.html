        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.178)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Thursday Evening, November 5, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made
          perfect by the flesh?" -- Galatians 3:3.
        </p>
        <p>
          YES, we are just so foolish. Folly is bound up not only in the heart
          of a child, but in the heart of even a child of God; and though the
          rod may be said to bring folly out of a child, it will take many a
          repetition of the rod of affliction upon the shoulders of a Christian
          before that folly is taken out of him. I suppose we are all of us very
          sound as a matter of theory upon this point. If any should ask us how
          we hope to have our salvation worked in us, we should without the
          slightest hesitation aver our belief that salvation is of the Lord
          alone, and we should declare that, as the Holy Spirit first of all
          commenced our piety in us, we look alone to his might to continue and
          to preserve, and at last to perfect the sacred work. I say we are
          sound enough on that point as a matter of theory, but we are all of us
          very heretical and unsound as a matter of practice; for alas! you will
          not find a Christian who does not have to mourn over his
          self-righteous tendencies; you will not discover a believer who has
          not at certain periods in his life, to groan because the spirit of
          self-confidence has risen in his heart, and prevented him from feeling
          the absolute necessity of the Holy Spirit -- has led him to put his
          confidence in the mere strength of nature, the strength of good
          intentions, the strength of strong resolutions, instead of relying
          upon the might of God the Holy Spirit alone. This one thing I know,
          brethren, that whilst as a preacher I can tell you all, that the Holy
          Spirit must work all our works in us, and that without him we can do
          nothing, yet as a man I find myself tempted to deny my own preachings,
          not in my words, but to deny them in fact by endeavoring to do deeds
          without looking first to the Holy Spirit. Whilst I should never be
          unsound in the didactic part of it, yet in that part which concerns
          the working of it out, in common with all that love the Lord Jesus,
          but who are still subject to the infirmities of flesh and blood, I
          have to groan that I repeatedly find myself, having begun in the
          Spirit, seeking to be made perfect in the flesh. Yes, we are just as
          foolish as that; and my brethren, it is well for us if we have a
          consciousness that we are foolish, for when a man is foolish and knows
          it, there is the hope that he will one day be wise: to know one's-self
          to be foolish is to stand upon the doorstep of the temple of wisdom;
          to understand the wrongness of any position is half way towards
          amending it; to be quite sure that our self-confidence is a heinous
          sin and folly, and an offense towards God, and to have that thought
          burned into us by God's Holy Spirit, is going a great length towards
          the absolute casting our self-confidence away, and the bringing of our
          souls in practice, as well as in theory, to rely wholly upon the power
          of God's Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          This evening, however, I shall run away from my text somewhat. Having
          just in a few words endeavored to explain the meaning of the whole
          sentence, I intend only this evening to dwell upon the doctrine which
          incidentally the apostle teaches us. He teaches us that we begin in
          the Spirit -- "Having begun in the Spirit" I have already illustrated
          the whole text sufficiently for our understanding if God the Holy
          Spirit shall enlighten us; and I shall now, I say, confine myself to
          the thought that Christians begin in the Spirit; that the early part
          of Christianity is of God's Spirit, and of God's Spirit only, while it
          is equally true that all the way through we must lean upon the same
          power and depend upon the same strength. And I have selected this text
          for this reason: we have a very large influx of young believers, month
          after month -- week after week I may say, for every week we receive
          additions to the church to a considerable number, and month after
          month these hands baptize into a profession of faith of the Lord Jesus
          many of those who are yet young in the faith of the Gospel. Now I am
          astonished to find those persons that thus come before me so well
          instructed in the doctrines of grace and so sound in all the truths of
          the covenant, insomuch that I may think it my boast and glory, in the
          name of Jesus, that I know not that we have any members, whom we have
          received into the church, who do not give their full assent and
          consent unto all the doctrines of the Christian religion, commonly
          called Calvinistic doctrines Those which men are wont to laugh at as
          being high doctrinal points, are those which they most readily
          receive, believe, and rejoice in. I find, however, that the greatest
          deficiency lies in this point, forgetfulness of the work of the Holy
          Spirit. I find them very easily remembering the work of God the
          Father; they do not deny the great doctrine of election; they can see
          clearly the great sentence of justification passed by the Father upon
          the elect through the vicarious sacrifice and perfect righteousness of
          Jesus; and they are not backward in understanding the work of Jesus
          either: they can see how Christ was the substitute for his people and
          stood in their room, place and stead; nor do they for one moment
          impugn any doctrine concerning God's Spirit; but they are not clear
          upon the point: they can talk upon the other points better than they
          can upon those which more particularly concern the blessed work of
          that all adorable person of the Godhead, God the Holy Spirit. I
          thought, therefore, that I would just preach as simply as ever I could
          upon the work of the Holy Spirit, and begin at the beginning; hoping
          on succeeding evening, at different times, as God the Holy Spirit
          shall guide me, to enter more fully into the subject of the work of
          the Spirit from the beginning even to the end. But let me say, it is
          no use your expecting me to preach a course of sermons. I know a great
          deal better than that. I don't believe God the Holy Spirit ever
          intended men to publish three months before hand, lists of sermons
          that they were going to preach; because there always will arise
          changes in Providence, and different states of mind both in the
          preacher and the hearer, and he will be a very wise man who has got an
          Old Moore's Almanack correct enough to let him know what would be the
          best sort of sermon to preach three months ahead. He had better leave
          it to his God to give him in the same hour what he shall speak, and
          look for his sermons, as the Israelites looked for the manna, day by
          day. However, we now commence by endeavoring to narrate the different
          points of the Spirit's work in the beginning of salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And first, let me start by asserting that THE COMMENCEMENT OF
          SALVATION IS THE HOLY SPIRIT'S WORK. Salvation is not begun in the
          soul by the means of grace apart from the Holy Spirit. No man in the
          world is at liberty to neglect the means that God has appointed. If a
          house be builded for prayer, that man must expect no blessing who
          neglects to tread its floor. If a pulpit be erected for the
          ministration of the Word, no man must expect (although we do sometimes
          get more than we expect) to be saved except by the hearing of the
          Word. If the Bible be printed in our own native language, and we can
          read it, he who neglecteth Holy Scripture. and ceaseth from its study,
          has lost one great and grand opportunity of being blessed. There are
          many means of grace, and let us speak as highly of them as ever we
          can; we would be far from depreciating them; they are of the highest
          value; blessed are the people who have them; happy is the nation which
          is blessed with the means of grace. But my brethren, no man was ever
          saved by the means of grace apart from the Holy Spirit. You may hear
          the sermons of the man whom God delighteth to honor; ye may select
          from all your puritanical divines the writings of the man whom God did
          bless with a double portion of his Holy Spirit; ye may attend every
          meeting for prayer; ye may turn over the leaves of this blessed book;
          but in all this, there is no life for the soul apart from the breath
          of the Divine Spirit. Use these means, we exhort you to use them, and
          use them diligently: but recollect that in none of these means is
          there.anything that can benefit you unless God the Holy Spirit shall
          own and crown them. These are like the conduit pipes of the market
          place; when the fountain-head floweth with water then they are full,
          and we do derive a blessing from them; but if the stream be stayed, if
          the fountain head doth cease to give forth its current, then these are
          wells without water, clouds without rain; and ye may go to ordinances
          as an Arab turns to his skin bottle when it is dry, and with your
          parched lips ye may suck the wind and drink the whirlwind, but receive
          neither comfort, nor blessing, nor instruction, from the means of
          grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is the salvation of any sinner commenced in him by a minister or
          by a priest, God forgive the man that ever called himself a priest, or
          suffered anyone else to call him so since the days of our Lord Jesus.
          The other morning at family prayer, I read the case of King Uzziah,
          who, having the kingly office, must needs thrust himself into the
          tabernacle of the Lord, and take the place of the priests. You
          remember how the priests withstood him, and said, "This is not thy
          portion, O Uzziah;" and you remember how he seized the censer and
          would burn incense as a priest before the Lord God; and whilst they
          yet spake, lo! the leprosy did rise in his face and he went out a
          leper, as white as snow, from the house of God. Ah! my brethren, it is
          no mean offense against God for any man to call himself a priest; not
          but that all the saints have a priestly office through Christ Jesus;
          but when any man putteth to the idea a speciality as applicable to
          himself above his fellows, and claimeth to be a priest among men, he
          committeth a sin before God, which, even though it be a sin of
          ignorance, is indeed great and grievous, and leadeth unto divers great
          and deadly errors, the guilt of which must lie partly upon the head of
          the man who gave foot-hold for those errors by allowing the title to
          be applied to himself. Well, there is no man -- call him priest if you
          like, by way of ill courtesy -- that can begin the work with us -- no,
          not in the use of the ceremony. The Papist may tell us, and the Papist
          masked, -- the devil in white, the Puseyite, -- may tell us that grace
          begins in the heart at the dropping of the water upon the child's
          brow; but he telleth a lie, a lie before God, that hath not even so
          much as the shadow of truth to justify the liar. There is no power in
          man, though he were ordained by one who could most assuredly claim
          succession from the apostles -- though he were endowed with miraculous
          gifts, though he were the apostle Paul himself -- if he did assert
          that he had in himself power to convert, power to regenerate, let him
          be accursed, for he hath denied the truth and Paul himself would have
          declared him anathema, maranatha, for having departed from the
          everlasting gospel, one cardinal point of which is -- regeneration,
          the work of God the Holy Spirit; the new birth, a thing that is from
          above.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, my brethren, it is quite certain that no man ever begins the new
          birth himself. The work of salvation never was commenced by any man.
          God the Holy Spirit must commence it. Now, the reasons why no man ever
          commenced the work of grace in his own heart, is very plain and
          palpable. First, because he cannot; secondly, because he won't. The
          best reason of all is, because he cannot -- he is dead. Well the dead
          may be made alive, but the dead cannot make themselves alive, for the
          dead can do nothing. Besides, the new thing to be created as yet hath
          no being. The uncreated cannot create. "Nay," but you say, "that man
          can create." Yes, can hell create heaven? Then sin may create grace.
          What! will you tell me that fallen human nature, that has come almost
          to a level with the brutes, is competent to rival God; that it can
          emulate the divinity in working as great marvels, and in imparting as
          divine a life as even God himself can give? It cannot. Besides, it is
          a creation; we are created anew in Christ Jesus. Let any man create a
          fly, and afterwards let him create a new heart in himself; until he
          hath done the less he cannot do the greater. Besides, no man will. If
          any man could convert himself, there is no man that would. If any man
          saith he would, if that be true, he is already converted; for the will
          to be converted is in great part conversion. The will to love God, the
          desire to be in unison with Christ, is not to be found in any man who
          hath not already been brought to be reconciled with God through the
          death of his Son. There may be a false desire, a desire grounded upon
          a misrepresentation of the truth; but a true desire after true
          salvation by the true Spirit, is a certain index that the salvation
          already is there in the germ and in the bud, and only needs time and
          grace to develope itself. But certain it is, that man neither can nor
          will, being on the one hand utterly impotent and dead, and on the
          other hand utterly depraved and unwilling; hating the change when he
          sees it in others, and most of all despising it in himself. Be
          certain, therefore, that God the Holy Spirit must begin, since none
          else can do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, my brethren, I must just enter into the subject very briefly,
          by showing what the Holy Spirit does in the beginning. Permit me to
          say that in describing the work, the true work of salvation in the
          soul, you must not expect me to exhibit any critical nicety of
          judgment. We have heard of an assembly of divines, who once debated
          whether men did repent first or believe first; and after a long
          discussion, some one wiser than the rest suggested another question,
          whether in the new-born child the lungs did first heave, or the blood
          did first circulate. "Now," said he, "when you shall ascertain the
          one, you may be able to ascertain the other." You shall not know which
          cometh first; they are, very likely, begotten in us at the same
          moment. We are not able, when we mention these things in order,
          exactly to declare and testify that these do all happen according to
          the order in which we mention them; but we only, according to the
          judgment of men, according to our own experience, seek now to set
          forth what is the usual way of acting with God the Holy Spirit in the
          work of salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing, then, that God the Holy Spirit doth in the soul is,
          to regenerate it. We must always learn to distinguish between
          regeneration and conversion. A man may be converted a great many times
          in his life, but regenerated only once. Conversion is a thing which is
          caused by regeneration, but regeneration is the very first act of God
          the Spirit in the soul. "What," say you, "does regeneration come
          before conviction of sin?" most certainly; there could be no
          conviction in the dead sinner. Now, regeneration quickens the sinner,
          and makes him live. He is not competent to have true spiritual
          conviction worked in him until, first of all he has received life. It
          is true that one of the earliest developments of life is conviction of
          sin; but before any man can see his need of a Saviour he must be a
          living man; before he can really, I mean, in a spiritual position, in
          a saving, effectual manner, understand his own deep depravity, he must
          have eyes with which to see the depravity, he must have ears with
          which to hear the sentence of the law, he must have been quickened and
          made alive; otherwise he could not be capable of feeling, or seeing,
          or discerning at all. I believe, then, the first thing the Spirit does
          is this -- he finds the sinner dead in sin, just where Adam left him;
          he breathes into him a divine influence. The sinner knows nothing
          about how it is done, nor do any of us understand it. "Thou
          understandest not the wind -- it bloweth where it listeth;" but we see
          its effects. Now, none of us can tell how the Holy Spirit works in
          men. I doubt not there have been some who have sat in these pews, and
          in the middle of a sermon or in prayer, or singing -- they knew not
          how it was -- the Spirit of God was in their hearts; he had entered
          into their souls; they were no longer dead in sin, no longer without
          thought, without hope, without spiritual capacity, but they had begun
          to live. And I believe this work of regeneration, when it is done
          effectually -- and God the Spirit would not do it without doing it
          effectually -- is done mysteriously, often suddenly, and it is done in
          divers manners; but still it hath always this mark about it -- that
          the man although he may not understand how it is done, feels that
          something is done. The what, the how, he doth not know; but he knows
          that something is done; and he now begins to think thoughts he never
          thought before; he begins to feel as he never felt before; he is
          brought into a new state, there is a change wrought in him -- as if a
          dead post standing in the street were on a sudden to find itself
          possessed of a soul, and did hear the sound of the passing carriages,
          and listen to the words of the foot-passengers; there is something
          quite new about it. The fact is, the man has got a spirit; he never
          had one before; he was nothing but a body and a soul; but now, God has
          breathed into him the third great principle, the new life, the Spirit,
          and he has become a spiritual man. Now, he is not only capable of
          mental exercise, but of spiritual exercise; as, having a soul before,
          he could repent, he could believe, as a mere mental exercise; he could
          think thoughts of God, and have some desires after him; but he could
          not have one spiritual thought, nor one spiritual wish or desire, for
          he had no powers that could educe these things; but now, in
          regeneration, he has got something given to him, and being given, you
          soon see its effects. The man begins to feel that he is a sinner; why
          did he not feel that before? Ah, my brethren, he could not, he was not
          in a state to feel; he was a dead sinner; and though he used to tell
          you, and tell God, by way of compliment, that he was a sinner, he did
          not know anything about it. He said he was a sinner; yes, but he
          talked about being a sinner just as the blind man talks about the
          stars that be has never seen, as he talks about the light, the
          existence of which he would not know unless he were told of it; but
          now it is a deep reality. You may laugh at him, ye who have not been
          regenerated; but now he has got something that really puts him beyond
          your laughter. He begins to feel the exceeding weight and evil of
          transgression; his heart trembles, his very flesh quivers -- in some
          cases the whole frame is affected. The man is sick by day and night;
          his flesh creepeth on his bones for fear; he cannot eat, his appetite
          fails him. He cannot bear the sound of melody and mirth; all his
          animal spirits are dried up. He cannot rejoice; he is unhappy, he is
          miserable. downcast, distressed; in some cases, almost ready to go
          mad; though in the majority of cases it takes a lighter phase, and
          there are the gentle whispers of the Spirit; but even then, the pangs
          and pains caused by regeneration, while the new life discovers the sin
          and evil of the past condition of the man are things that are not to
          be well described or mentioned without tears. This is all the work of
          the Spirit.
        </p>

          And having brought the soul thus far, the next thing the Holy Spirit
          doth is, to teach the soul that it is utterly incapable of saving
          itself. It knew that before, mayhap, if the man sat under a Gospel
          ministry; but he only knew it with the ear, and understood it with the
          mind. Now, it has become part of his very life; he feels it; it has
          entered into his soul, and he knows it to be true. Once he thought he
          would be good, and thought that would save him; the Holy Spirit just
          knocks the brains out of that thought. "Then," he says, "I will try
          ceremonies. and see whether I cannot gain merit so;" God the Holy
          Spirit shoots the arrow right through the heart of that thought, and
          it falls dead before him, and he cannot bear the sight of the carcase,
          so that, like Abraham said of Sarah, he exclaims, "Bury the dead out
          of my sight." Though once he loved it dearly, now he hates the sight
          thereof. He thought once that he could believe; he had an Arminian
          notion in his head, that he could believe when he liked, and repent
          when he liked. Now, God the Spirit has brought him in such a
          condition, that he says, "I can do nothing." He begins to discover his
          own death, now that he is made alive; he did not know anything about
          it before. He now finds that he has no hand of faith to lift, though
          the minister tells him to do it. He now discovers, when he is bidden
          to pray, that he would, but cannot pray. He now finds that he is
          powerless, and he dies in the hand of God like clay in the hand of the
          potter, and is made to cry out, "O Lord, my God, unless thou save me,
          I am damned to all eternity; for I cannot lift a finger in this matter
          until thou first of all givest me strength." And if you urge him to do
          anything, he longs to be doing, but he is so afraid that it should
          only be fleshly doings, and not the doings of the Spirit, that he
          meditates, and stops, and stays, until he groans and cries; and
          feeling that these groans and cries are the real work of the Spirit,
          and prove that he has spiritual life, he then begins in right earnest
          to look to Jesus Christ the Saviour. But mark, all these things are by
          the Spirit, and none of them can ever be produced in the soul of any
          man or woman, apart from the divine influence of God the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          This being done, the soul being now weaned from all confidence, and
          despairing and brought to its last standing place, yea, laid prostrate
          on the ground, the rope being about its neck, and the ashes and
          sackcloth on its head; God the Holy Ghost next applies the blood of
          Jesus to the soul, gives the soul the grace of faith whereby it lays
          hold of Jesus, and gives it an anointing of holy consolation and
          unction of assurance, whereby, casting itself wholly on the blood and
          righteousness of Jesus, it receiveth joy, knoweth itself to be saved,
          and rejoiceth in pardon. But mark, that is the work of the Spirit.
          Some preachers will tell their people, "Believe, only believe." Yes,
          it is right they should tell them so; but they should remember it is
          also right to tell them that even this must be the work of the Spirit;
          for though we say, "Only believe," that is the greatest only in the
          world; and what some men say is so easy is just what those who want to
          believe find to be the hardest thing in all the world. It is simple
          enough for a man that hath the Spirit in him to believe, when he hath
          the written Word before him and the witness of the Spirit in him; that
          is easy enough. But for the poor, tried sinner, who cannot see
          anything in the Word of God but thunder and threatening -- for him to
          believe -- ah my brethren, it is not such a little matter as some make
          it to be. It needs the fullness of the power of God's Spirit to bring
          any man to such faith as that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, when the sinner hath thus believed, then the Holy Spirit
          bringeth all the precious things to him. There is the blood of Jesus;
          that can never save my soul, unless God the Spirit takes that blood,
          and sprinkles it upon my conscience. There is the perfect spotless
          righteousness of Jesus; it is a robe that will fit me and adorn me
          from head to foot, but it is no use to me till I have put it on; and I
          cannot put it on myself; God the Holy Spirit must put the robe of
          Jesus' righteousness on me. There is the covenant of adoption, whereby
          God gives me the privileges of a son; but I cannot rejoice in my
          adoption until I receive the spirit of adoption whereby I may be able
          to cry, "Abba, Father." So, beloved, you see -- I might enlarge, but
          my time fails me -- you see that every point that is brought out in
          the experience of the new-born Christian, every point in that part of
          salvation which we may call its beginning in the soul, has to do with
          God the Holy Spirit. There is no step that can be taken without him,
          there is nothing which can be accomplished aright without him; yea,
          though ye had the best of means, the rightest of ceremonies, the most
          orthodox of truths, and though ye did exercise, your minds upon all
          these things, and though the blood of Jesus Christ were shed for you,
          and God himself had ordained you from before the foundations of the
          world to be saved, yet still there must be that one link always
          inserted in the golden chain of the plan of salvation; for without
          that it were all incomplete. You must be quickened by the Spirit; you
          must be called out of darkness into light; you must be made a new
          creature in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I wonder how many of you know anything about this. That is the
          practical part of it. Now my hearer, dost thou understand this?
          Perhaps, sir, thou art one exceeding wise, and thou turnest on thy
          heel with a sneer, and thou sayest "Supernaturalism in one of its
          phases; these Methodists are always talking about supernatural
          things." You are very wise, exceeding so, doubtless; but it seemeth to
          me that Nicodemus of old had gotten as far as you, and you have gotten
          no farther than he; for he asked "How could a man be born again when
          he is old?" And though every Sunday-school child has had a smile at
          the expense of Nicodemus's ignorance, you are not wiser. And yet you
          are a Rabbi, sir, and you would teach us, would you? And you would
          teach us about these things, and yet you sneer about supernaturalism.
          Well, the day may come -- I pray it may come to you before the day of
          your death and your doom -- when the Christ of the supernaturalists
          will be the only Christ for you; when you shall come into the floods
          of death, where you shall need something more than nature, then you
          will be crying for a work that is supernatural within your hearts; and
          it may be that then, when you first of all awake to know that your
          wisdom was but one of the methods of madness, you may perhaps have to
          cry in vain, having for your only answer, "I called, and ye refused; I
          stretched out my hands, and no man regarded; I also will mock at your
          calamity, and laugh when your fear cometh."
        </p>
        <p>
          I hear another of you say, "Well, sir, I know nothing of this work of
          God the Holy Spirit, in my heart; I am just as good as other people, I
          never make a profession of religion; it is very rarely that I go into
          a place of worship at all, but I am as good as the saints, any of
          them: look at some of them -- very fine fellows certainly." Stop, now,
          religion is a thing between yourself and your Maker, and you have
          nothing to do with those very fine fellows you have spoken of. Suppose
          I make a confession that a large number of those who are called saints
          deserve a great deal more to be called sinners double-dyed, and then
          white-washed, -- suppose I make a confession of that, what has that to
          do with you? Your religion must be for yourself, and it must be
          between you and your God. If all the world were hypocrites, that would
          not exonerate you before your God. When you came before the Master, if
          you were still at enmity to him, could you venture to plead such an
          excuse as this -- "All the world was full of hypocrites?" "Well," he
          would say, "what had that to do with you? so much the more reason why
          you should have been a honest man. If you say the church was thus
          drifting away upon the quicksands, through the evil conduct and folly
          of the members thereof, so much the more reason why you should have
          helped to make it sound, if you thought you could have done so."
          Another cries, "Well, I do not see that I need it; I am as moral a man
          as I can be; I never break the Sabbath; I am one of the most
          punctillious of Christians; I always go to church twice a Sabbath; I
          hear a thoroughly evangelical minister, and you would not find fault
          with him." Or perhaps says another, "I go to a Baptist chapel, I am
          always found there, I am scrupulously correct in my conduct; I am a
          good father, a good husband; I do not know that any man can find fault
          with me in business." Well certainly that is very good, and if you
          will be so good to-morrow morning as to go into Saint Paul's and wash
          one of those statues till you make it alive, then you will be saved by
          your morality; but since you, even you, are dead in trespasses and
          sins, without the Spirit you may wash yourself never so clean, but you
          cannot wash life into you any more than those statues, by all your
          washing, could be made to walk, or think, or breathe. You must be
          quickened by the Holy Spirit, for you are dead in trespasses and sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, my comely maiden, thou that art everything excellent; thou that
          art not to be blamed in aught; thou that art affectionate, tender,
          kind, and dutiful; whose very life seems to be so pure, that all who
          see thee think thou seemest an angel; even thou, except thou be born
          again, canst not see the kingdom of God; the golden gate of heaven
          must grind upon its hinges with a doleful sound and shut thee out for
          ever, unless thou art the subject of a divine change, for this knows
          no exception. And, O ye vilest of the vile, ye who have wandered
          farthest from the paths of rectitude, "ye must be born again," ye must
          be quickened by a divine life; and it is comforting for you to
          recollect, that the very same power which can awaken the moral man,
          which can save the man of rectitude and honesty, is able to work in
          you, is able to change you; to turn the lion to a lamb, the raven to a
          dove.
        </p>
        <p>
          O my hearers, ask yourselves, are you the subjects of this change? And
          if you be, rejoice with joy unspeakable, for happy is that mother's
          child. and full of glory, that can say, "I am born of God;" blessed is
          that man: God and the holy angels call him blessed who hath received
          the quickening of the Spirit, and is born of God. For him there may be
          many troubles, but there is "a far more exceeding and eternal weight
          of glory" to counterbalance all his woe; for him there may be wars and
          fightings; but let him tarry, there are trumpets of victory, there are
          better wreaths than the laurels of conquerors, there is a crown of
          immortal glory, there is bliss unfading, there is acceptance in the
          breast of God for aye, and perpetual fellowship with Jehovah. But oh!
          if thou be not born again this night I can but tremble for thee, and
          lift my heart in prayer to God, and pray for thee, that he may now by
          his Divine Spirit make thee alive, give thee to know thy need of him,
          and then direct thee to the cross of Jesus. But if thou knowest thy
          need of a Saviour tonight, if thou art this night conscious of thy
          death in sin, hear me preach the gospel and I have done. The Lord
          Jesus Christ died for you. Dost thou know thyself to be guilty, not as
          the hypocrite pretendeth to know it, but dost thou know it
          consciously, sensitively, dost thou weep over it? Dost thou lament it?
          Dost thou feel that thou canst not save thyself? Art thou sick of all
          fleshly ways of saving? Canst thou say to-night, "Unless God shall put
          out the hand of his mercy, I know I deserve to be lost for ever, and I
          am?" Then, as the Lord my God liveth, before whom I stand, my Master
          bought you with his blood, and those whom he bought with blood he will
          have; from the fangs of the lion and the jaws of the bear will he
          pluck them. He will save thee, for thou art a part of his bloody
          purchase; he has taken thy sins upon his heal; he suffered in thy room
          and place, he has been punished for thee; thou shalt not die; "thy
          sins, which are many, are all forgiven," and I am the Master's glad
          herald to tell thee to night what his Word tells thee also, that thou
          mayest rejoice in the fullness of faith, for "Christ Jesus came into
          the world to save sinners," and "this is a faithful saying, and worthy
          of all acceptation"
        </p>
        <p>May the Lord now be pleased to add his blessing for Jesus' sake.</p>
