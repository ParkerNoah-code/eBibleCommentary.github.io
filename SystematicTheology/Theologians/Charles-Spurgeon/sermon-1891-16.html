          1. This Marcus then, declaring that he alone was the matrix and
          receptacle of the Sige of Colorbasus, inasmuch as he was
          only-begotten, has brought to the birth in some such way as follows
          that which was committed to him of the defective Enthymesis. He
          declares that the infinitely exalted Tetrad descended upon him from
          the invisible and indescribable places in the form of a woman (for the
          world could not have borne it coming in its male form), and expounded
          to him alone its own nature, and the origin of all things, which it
          had never before revealed to any one either of gods or men. This was
          done in the following terms: When first the unoriginated,
          inconceivable Father, who is without material substance, and is
          neither male nor female, willed to bring forth that which is ineffable
          to Him, and to endow with form that which is invisible, He opened His
          mouth, and sent forth the Word similar to Himself, who, standing near,
          showed Him what He Himself was, inasmuch as He had been manifested in
          the form of that which was invisible. Moreover, the pronunciation of
          His name took place as follows: -- He spoke the first word of it,
          which was the beginning [of all the rest], and that utterance
          consisted of four letters. He added the second, and this also
          consisted of four letters. Next He uttered the third, and this again
          embraced ten letters. Finally, He pronounced the fourth, which was
          composed of twelve letters. Thus took place the enunciation of the
          whole name, consisting of thirty letters, and four distinct
          utterances. Each of these elements has its own peculiar letters, and
          character, and pronunciation, and forms, and images, and there is not
          one of them that perceives the shape of that [utterance] of which it
          is an element. Neither does any one know itself, nor is it acquainted
          with the pronunciation of its neighbour, but each one imagines that by
          its own utterance it does in fact name the whole. For while every one
          of them is a part of the whole, it imagines its own sound to be the
          whole name, and does not leave off sounding until, by its own
          utterance, it has reached the last letter of each of the elements.
          This teacher declares that the restitution of all things will take
          place, when all these, mixing into one letter, shall utter one and the
          same sound. He imagines that the emblem of this utterance is found in
          Amen, which we pronounce in concert. The diverse sounds (he adds) are
          those which give form to that Æon who is without material substance
          and unbegotten, and these, again, are the forms which the Lord has
          called angels, who continually behold the face of the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Those names of the elements which may be told, and are common, he
          has called Æons, and words, and roots, and seeds, and fulnesses, and
          fruits. He asserts that each of these, and all that is peculiar to
          every one of them, is to be understood as contained in the name
          Ecclesia. Of these elements, the last letter of the last one uttered
          its voice, and this sound going forth generated its own elements after
          the image of the [other] elements, by which he affirms, that both the
          things here below were arranged into the order they occupy, and those
          that preceded them were called into existence. He also maintains that
          the letter itself, the sound of which followed that sound below, was
          received up again by the syllable to which it belonged, in order to
          the completion of the whole, but that the sound remained below as if
          cast outside. But the element itself from which the letter with its
          special pronunciation descended to that below, he affirms to consist
          of thirty letters, while each of these letters, again, contains other
          letters in itself, by means of which the name of the letter is
          expressed. And thus, again, others are named by other letters, and
          others still by others, so that the multitude of letters swells out
          into infinitude. You may more clearly understand what I mean by the
          following example: -- The word Delta contains five letters, viz., D,
          E, L, T, A: these letters again, are written by other letters, and
          others still by others. If, then, the entire composition of the word
          Delta [when thus analyzed] runs out into infinitude, letters
          continually generating other letters, and following one another in
          constant succession, how much vaster than that [one] word is the
          [entire] ocean of letters! And if even one letter be thus infinite,
          just consider the immensity of the letters in the entire name; out of
          which the Sige of Marcus has taught us the Propator is composed. For
          which reason the Father, knowing the incomprehensibleness of His own
          nature, assigned to the elements which He also terms Æons, [the power]
          of each one uttering its own enunciation, because no one of them was
          capable by itself of uttering the whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Moreover, the Tetrad, explaining these things to him more fully,
          said: -- I wish to show thee Aletheia (Truth) herself; for I have
          brought her down from the dwellings above, that thou mayest see her
          without a veil, and understand her beauty -- that thou mayest also
          hear her speaking, and admire her wisdom. Behold, then, her head on
          high, Alpha and Omega; her neck, Beta and Psi; her shoulders with her
          hands, Gamma and Chi; her breast, Delta and Phi; her diaphragm,
          Epsilon and Upsilon; her back, Zeta and Tau; her belly, Eta and Sigma;
          her thighs, Theta and Rho; her knees, Iota and Pi; her legs, Kappa and
          Omicron; her ankles, Lambda and Xi; her feet, Mu and Nu. Such is the
          body of Truth, according to this magician, such the figure of the
          element, such the character of the letter. And he calls this element
          Anthropos (Man), and says that is the fountain of all speech, and the
          beginning of all sound, and the expression of all that is unspeakable,
          and the mouth of the silent Sige. This indeed is the body of Truth.
          But do thou, elevating the thoughts of thy mind on high, listen from
          the mouth of Truth to the self-begotten Word, who is also the
          dispenser of the bounty of the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. When she (the Tetrad) had spoken these things, Aletheia looked at
          him, opened her mouth, and uttered a word. That word was a name, and
          the name was this one which we do know and speak of, viz., Christ
          Jesus. When she had uttered this name, she at once relapsed into
          silence. And as Marcus waited in the expectation that she would say
          something more, the Tetrad again came forward and said: -- Thou hast
          reckoned as contemptible that word which thou hast heard from the
          mouth of Aletheia. This which thou knowest and seemest to possess, is
          not an ancient name. For thou possessest the sound of it merely,
          whilst thou art ignorant of its power. For Jesus ('Iesous) is a name
          arithmetically symbolical, consisting of six letters, and is known by
          all those that belong to the called. But that which is among the Æons
          of the Pleroma consists of many parts, and is of another form and
          shape, and is known by those [angels] who are joined in affinity with
          Him, and whose figures (mightinesses) are always present with Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Know, then, that the four-and-twenty letters which you possess are
          symbolical emanations of the three powers that contain the entire
          number of the elements above. For you are to reckon thus -- that the
          nine mute letters are [the images] of Pater and Aletheia, because they
          are without voice, that is, of such a nature as cannot be uttered or
          pronounced. But the semi-vowels represent Logos and Zoe, because they
          are, as it were, midway between the consonants and the vowels,
          partaking of the nature of both. The vowels, again, are representative
          of Anthropos and Ecclesia, inasmuch as a voice proceeding from
          Anthropos gave being to them all; for the sound of the voice imparted
          to them form. Thus, then, Logos and Zoe possess eight [of these
          letters]; Anthropos and Ecclesia seven; and Pater and Aletheia nine.
          But since the number allotted to each was unequal, He who existed in
          the Father came down, having been specially sent by Him from whom He
          was separated, for the rectification of what had taken place, that the
          unity of the Pleromas, being endowed with equality, might develop in
          all that one power which flows from all. Thus that division which had
          only seven letters, received the power of eight, and the three sets
          were rendered alike in point of number, all becoming Ogdoads; which
          three, when brought together, constitute the number four-and-twenty.
          The three elements, too (which he declares to exist in conjunction
          with three powers, and thus form the six from which have flowed the
          twenty-four letters), being quadrupled by the word of the ineffable
          Tetrad, give rise to the same number with them; and these elements he
          maintains to belong to Him who cannot be named. These, again, were
          endowed by the three powers with a resemblance to Him who is
          invisible. And he says that those letters which we call double are the
          images of the images of these elements; and if these be added to the
          four-and-twenty letters, by the force of analogy they form the number
          thirty.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. He asserts that the fruit of this arrangement and analogy has been
          manifested in the likeness of an image, namely, Him who, after six
          days, ascended into the mountain along with three others, and then
          became one of six (the sixth), in which character He descended and was
          contained in the Hebdomad, since He was the illustrious Ogdoad, and
          contained in Himself the entire number of the elements, which the
          descent of the dove (who is Alpha and Omega) made clearly manifest,
          when He came to be baptized; for the number of the dove is eight
          hundred and one. And for this reason did Moses declare that man was
          formed on the sixth day; and then, again, according to arrangement, it
          was on the sixth day, which is the preparation, that the last man
          appeared, for the regeneration of the first. Of this arrangement, both
          the beginning and the end were formed at that sixth hour, at which He
          was nailed to the tree. For that perfect being Nous, knowing that the
          number six had the power both of formation and regeneration, declared
          to the children of light, that regeneration which has been wrought out
          by Him who appeared as the Episemon in regard to that number. Whence
          also he declares it is that the double letters contain the Episemon
          number; for this Episemon, when joined to the twenty-four elements,
          completed the name of thirty letters.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. He employed as his instrument, as the Sige of Marcus declares, the
          power of seven letters, in order that the fruit of the independent
          will [of Achamoth] might be revealed. "Consider this present
          Episemon," she says -- "Him who was formed after the [original]
          Episemon, as being, as it were, divided or cut into two parts, and
          remaining outside; who, by His own power and wisdom, through means of
          that which had been produced by Himself, gave life to this world,
          consisting of seven powers, after the likeness of the power of the
          Hebdomad, and so formed it, that it is the soul of everything visible.
          And He indeed uses this work Himself as if it had been formed by His
          own free will; but the rest, as being images of what cannot be [fully]
          imitated, are subservient to the Enthymesis of the mother. And the
          first heaven indeed pronounces Alpha, the next to this Epsilon, the
          third Eta, the fourth, which is also in the midst of the seven, utters
          the sound of Iota, the fifth Omicron, the sixth Upsilon, the seventh,
          which is also the fourth from the middle, utters the elegant Omega,"
          -- as the Sige of Marcus, talking a deal of nonsense, but uttering no
          word of truth, confidently asserts. "And these powers," she adds,
          "being all simultaneously clasped in each other's embrace, do sound
          out the glory of Him by whom they were produced; and the glory of that
          sound is transmitted upwards to the Propator." She asserts, moreover,
          that "the sound of this uttering of praise, having been wafted to the
          earth, has become the Framer and the Parent of those things which are
          on the earth."
        </p>
        <p>
          8. He instances, in proof of this, the case of infants who have just
          been born, the cry of whom, as soon as they have issued from the womb,
          is in accordance with the sound of every one of these elements. As,
          then, he says, the seven powers glorify the Word, so also does the
          complaining soul of infants. For this reason, too, David said: "Out of
          the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise;" and
          again: "The heavens declare the glory of God." Hence also it comes to
          pass, that when the soul is involved in difficulties and distresses,
          for its own relief it calls out, "Oh" (O), in honour of the letter in
          question, so that its cognate soul above may recognise [its distress],
          and send down to it relief.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. Thus it is, that in regard to the whole name, which consists of
          thirty letters, and Bythus, who receives his increase from the letters
          of this [name], and, moreover, the body of Aletheia, which is composed
          of twelve members, each of which consists of two letters, and the
          voice which she uttered without having spoken at all, and in regard to
          the analysis of that name which cannot be expressed in words, and the
          soul of the world and of man, according as they possess that
          arrangement, which is after the image [of things above], he has
          uttered his nonsensical opinions. It remains that I relate how the
          Tetrad showed him from the names a power equal in number; so that
          nothing, my friend, which I have received as spoken by him, may remain
          unknown to thee; and thus thy request, often proposed to me, may be
          fulfilled.
