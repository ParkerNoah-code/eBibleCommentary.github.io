          "Now will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved." -- Isaiah
          5:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          IT was a prophet who wrote this, a prophet inspired of God. An
          ordinary believer might suffice to sing, but he counts it no stoop for
          a prophet, and no waste of his important time, to occupy himself with
          song. There is no engagement under heaven that is more exalting than
          praising God, and however great may be the work which is committed to
          the charge of any of us, we shall always do well if we pause awhile to
          spend a time in sacred praise. I would not wish to prefer one
          spiritual exercise before another, else I think I would endorse the
          saying of an old divine who said that a line of praise was better than
          even a leaf of prayer; that praise was the highest, noblest, best,
          most satisfying, and most healthful occupation in which a Christian
          man could be found. If these may be regarded as the words of the
          Church, the Church of old did well to turn all her thoughts in the
          direction of praising her God. Though the winning of souls be a great
          thing, though the edifying of believers be an important matter, though
          the reclamation of backsliders calls for earnest attention, yet never,
          never, never may we cease from praising and magnifying the name of the
          well-beloved. This is to be our occupation in heaven: let us begin the
          music here, and make a heaven of the Church, even here below. The
          words of the text are, "Now will I sing," and that seems to give us a
          starting word.
        </p>
        <p>I. THE STRAINS OF THE SOUL'S SONG.</p>
        <p>
          "Now will I sing." Does not that imply that there were times when he
          who spake these words could not sing? "Now," said he, "will I sing to
          my well-beloved." There were times, then, when his voice, and his
          heart, and his circumstances were not in such order that he could
          praise God. My brethren, a little while ago we could not sing to our
          well-beloved, for we did not love him, we did not know him, we were
          dead in trespasses and sins. Perhaps we joined in sacred song, but we
          mocked the Lord. We stood up with his people, and we uttered the same
          sounds as they did, but our hearts were far from him. Let us blush for
          those mock psalms; let us shed many a tear of repentance that we could
          so insincerely have come before the Lord Most High. After that, we
          were led to feel our state by nature, and our guilt lay heavy upon us.
          We could not sing to our well-beloved then. Our music was set to the
          deep bass and in the minor key. We could only bring forth sighs and
          groans. Well do I remember when my nights were spent in grief, and my
          days in bitterness. It as a perpetual prayer, a confession of sin, and
          a bemoaning of myself, which occupied all my time. I could not sing
          then, and if any of you are in that condition to night, I know you
          cannot sing just now. What a mercy you can pray. Bring forth the fruit
          which is seasonable, and in your case the most seasonable fruit will
          be a humble acknowledgement of your sin, and an earnest seeking for
          mercy through Christ Jesus. Attend to that, and by and by you, too,
          shall sing to your well-beloved a song. Brethren in Christ Jesus, it
          is now some years ago since we believed in Christ, but since then
          there have been times when we could not sing. Alas! for us, there was
          a time when we watched not our steps, but went astray, when the
          flatterer led us from the strait road that leads to heaven, and
          brought us into sin; and then the chastisement of God came upon us,
          our heart was broken, until we cried out in anguish, as David did in
          the 51st Psalm. Then if we did sing, we could only bring out
          penitential odes, but no songs. We laid aside all parts of the book of
          Psalms that had to do with Hallelujah, and we could only groan forth
          the notes of repentance. There were no songs for us then, till at last
          Emmanuel smiled upon us once more, and we were reconciled again,
          brought back from our wanderings and restored to a sense of the divine
          favour. Besides that, we have had, occasionally had, to sorrow through
          the loss of the light of God's countenance. It is not always summer
          weather with the best of us. Though for the most part:
        </p>
        <p>"We can read our title clear,</p>
        <p>To mansions in the skies,"</p>
        <p>
          yet we have our fasting time when the bridegroom is not with us. Then
          do we fast. He does not intend that this world should be so much like
          heaven that we should be willing to stop in it; he, therefore,
          sometimes passes a cloud before the sun, that we in darkness may cry
          out, "Oh! that I knew where I might find him! I would come even to his
          seat." Even the means of grace at such times will bring us no comfort.
          We may go to the throne of mercy in private prayer, but we shall
          perceive but little light even there. If the Lord withdraw himself,
          there is no merry-making in the soul, but sadness, darkness, and gloom
          shall cover all. Then we hang our harps upon the willows, and if any
          require of us a song we tell them we are in a strange land, and the
          king hath gone -- how can we sing? Our heart is heavy, and our sorrows
          are multiplied. Once more, we cannot very well sing the praises of our
          well-beloved when the Church of God is under a cloud. I trust we are
          such true patriots, such real citizens of the new Jerusalem that, when
          Christ's kingdom does not advance, our hearts are full of anguish. My
          brethren, if you happen to be members of a church divided against
          itself, where the ministry appears to be without power, where there
          are no additions, no conversions, no spiritual life -- then, indeed,
          you will feel that whatever the state of your own heart, you must sigh
          and cry for the desolations of the Church of God. "If I forget thee, O
          Jerusalem, may my right hand forget her cunning." This is the view of
          every true citizen of Zion, and however our own hearts may flourish,
          and our souls be like a well-watered garden, yet if we see the place
          of worship neglected, the Lord's house dishonoured, the Church
          diminished and brought low, the gospel held in contempt, infidelity
          rampant, superstition stalking through the land, the old doctrines
          denied, and the cross of Christ made to be on none effect -- then,
          again, we feel we cannot sing; our hearts are not in tune, our fingers
          forget the accustomed string, and not then can we sing to our
          well-beloved a song.
        </p>
        <p>
          With these exceptions, however, I turn to a very different strain, and
          say that the whole life of the Christian ought to be describable by
          the text, "Now will I sing to my well-beloved a song." From the first
          moment in which sin is pardoned, to the last moment in which we are
          here on earth, it should be evermore our delight to sing to our
          well-beloved a song. "How can we do that?" say you. Well, we can do it
          in three or four ways. There is such a thing as thanks-feeling --
          feeling thankful, and this ought to be the general, universal spirit
          of the Christian. Suppose, my dear brother, you are not rich, be
          thankful that you have to eat and to drink, and wherewithal you may be
          clothed. Suppose, even, that you had not a hope of heaven, I might say
          to a man, "Be thankful that you are not in hell." But to you,
          Christian, I would add, "Be thankful that you never will be there, and
          that, if just now your present joys do not overflow, yet "there
          remaineth a rest for the people of God": let that console you. Is
          there ever a day in the year, or ever a moment in the day, in which
          the Christian ought not to be grateful? Our answer is not slow to give
          -- there is never such a day, there is never such a moment. Always
          receiving blessings untold, and incalculably precious, let us always
          be magnifying the hand that gives them. Always, beloved; as we have
          been, before the foundations of the world with our names engraved on
          the Saviour's hands, always redeemed by the precious blood, always
          preserved by the power of God which dwells in the Mediator, always
          secure of the heritage which is given to us in covenant by oath, by
          the blood of Christ -- let us always be grateful, and, if not always
          singing with our lips, let us always be singing with our hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, brethren, we ought to be always thanks-living. I think that is a
          better thing than thanksgiving -- thanks-living. How is this to be
          done? By a general cheerfulness of manner, by an obedience to the
          command of him by whose mercy we live, by a perpetual, constant,
          delighting ourselves in the Lord, and submission of our desires to his
          mind. Oh! I wish that our whole life might be a psalm; that every day
          might be a stanza of a mighty poem; that so from the day of our
          spiritual birth until we enter heaven we might be pouring forth sacred
          minstrelsy in every thought, and word, and action of our lives. Let us
          give him thankfulness and thanks-living.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then let us add thanks-speaking with the tongue. We don't sing
          enough, my brethren. How often do I stir you up about the matter of
          prayer, but perhaps I might be just as earnest about the matter of
          praise. Do we sing as much as the birds do? Yet what have birds to
          sing about, compared with us? Think you, do we sing as much as the
          angels do? yet were they never redeemed by the blood of Christ. Birds
          of the air, shall ye excel me? Angels of heaven, shall ye exceed me?
          Ye have done so, but I do intend to emulate you henceforth, and day by
          day, and night by night, pour forth my soul in sacred song.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may sometimes thank God not only by feeling thankfulness and living
          thankfulness, and speaking our thanks, but by that silent blessing of
          him which consists in patient suffering and accepting the evil as well
          as the good from Jehovah's hand. That is often better thanksgiving
          than the noblest psalm that the tongue could utter. To bow down before
          him and say, "Not my will, but thine be done," is to render him a
          homage equal to the Hallelujahs of cherubim and seraphim. To feel not
          only resigned, but acquiescent, willing to be anything or nothing,
          according as the Lord would have it -- this is in truth to sing to our
          well-beloved a song.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now having put this before you, that there are some times when we
          cannot sing, but that, as a rule, our life should be praise, let me
          come to the text again by saying that sometimes on choice occasions
          appointed by providence and grace our soul will be compelled to say,
          "Now, now if never before, now beyond all other occasions, I will sing
          to my well-beloved a song." I only hope that some -- that all
          Christians here -- will feel that tonight is one of those occasions.
          And as you sit here in presence of this table, upon which will soon
          appear the emblems of your Saviour's passion, I trust you will be
          saying, "Now tonight I feel I must sing to my well-beloved a song, for
          if ever I loved him, I love him tonight." Let us ponder now: --
        </p>
        <p>II. SOME OF THE OCCASIONS IN WHICH WE MUST SING TO HIS NAME.</p>
        <p>
          The first is when our soul first perceives the infinite love of Jesus
          to us, when we receive the pardon of sin, when we enter into the
          marriage relationship with Christ as our bridegroom and our Lord. The
          song becomes the wedding feast. How should it be a marriage without
          joyfulness? Oh! do you remember, even years ago, do you not remember
          now that day when first you looked to him and were lightened, and when
          your soul clasped his hands, and you and he were one? Other days I
          have forgotten, but that day never can I forget. Other days have
          mingled with their fellows, and, like coins which have been in
          circulation, the image and superscription have departed from them.
          That day when first I saw the Saviour is as fresh and distinct in all
          its outlines as though it were but yesterday coined in the mint of
          time. How can I forget it -- that first moment when Jesus told me I
          was his, and my beloved was mine? Were any of you saved last week? Did
          any of you find Jesus Christ at any of the meetings last week? Have
          you found him this morning? Did a blessing come to you this afternoon?
          Then hallow the occasion, pour out your soul before the Most High.
          Now, if never before, let your well-beloved have your choicest music.
          "Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp; I myself will wake
          right early. I will praise thee, for though thou wast angry with me,
          thine anger is taken away and thou comfortest me." Other occasions,
          however, come after our first day, for with Christ it is not all joy
          the first few weeks. No, blessed be his name! Sometimes, however, we
          have our high days and holidays, when the King entertains us at a
          feast. It is often so with my soul at this table. Coming to the
          Communion supper every Lord's day, I don't find it grow stale and flat
          with me. On the contrary, I think every time I come I love better than
          I did before to commemorate my Lord's sufferings in the breaking of
          bread; and usually when we do come round the table, we, who know what
          it means, feel, "Now will I sing to my well-beloved a song." Twas well
          that after supper they sang a hymn. We want some such expression for
          the sacred joy that rises in our soul at this feast. But not only when
          the emblems are before us, but when you hear a sermon that feeds your
          soul; when you read a chapter, and the promises are very precious;
          when you are in private prayer, and are able to get very near to
          Jesus, I know your hearts then say, "Now will I sing to my
          well-beloved a song. He has visited me, and I will praise him; he has
          made my soul like the chariots of Ammi-nadib, and where shall my
          strength and rapture be spent but at his dear feet, adoring and
          magnifying his ever blessed name?" Oh! I wish we often had broken
          through order and decorum, even, to give to our Lord a song. He well
          deserves it. Let not cold ingratitude freeze our praises on our lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ought to praise our Lord Jesus Christ, and sing to our well-beloved
          a song, particularly when we have had a remarkable deliverance. "Thou
          shalt compass me about," says David, "with songs of deliverance." Were
          you raised from a bed of sickness? Have you passed through a great
          pecuniary difficulty? Through God's help has your character been
          cleared from slander? Have you been helped in some enterprise, and
          prospered in the world? Have you seen a child restored from sickness,
          or a beloved wife once more given back to you from the gates of the
          grave? Have you just experienced the light of Christ's countenance in
          your own soul? Has a snare been broken? Has a temptation been removed?
          Are you in a joyous frame of mind? "Is any merry? Let him sing
          psalms." Oh! give your well-beloved a song now the sun shines and the
          flowers bloom. When the year begins to turn and fair weather comes,
          the birds seem to feel it, and they renew their music. Do so, oh!
          believer. When the winter is past, and the rain is over and gone, fill
          the earth with your songs of gratitude. But remember, O believer, that
          you should sing your well-beloved a song chiefly when it is not so
          with you, when sorrows befall. He giveth songs in the night. Perhaps
          there is no music so sweet as that which comes from the lip and heart
          of a tried believer. It is real then. When Job blessed God on the
          dunghill, even the devil himself could not insinuate that Job was a
          hypocrite. When Job prospered, then the devil said, "Doth Job serve
          God for naught?" but when he lost his all, and yet said, "Blessed be
          the name of the Lord," then the good man shone like a star when the
          clouds are gone. Oh! let us be sure to praise God when things go ill
          with us. Make certain that you sing then. A holy man, walking one
          night with a companion, listened to the nightingale, and he said,
          "Brother, that bird in the darkness is praising her Maker. Sing, I
          pray you, and let your Lord have a song in the night." But the other
          replied, "My voice is hoarse and little used to sing." "Then," said
          the other, "I will sing." And he sang, and the bird seemed to hear
          him, and to sing louder still, and he sang on, and other birds joined
          and the night seemed sweet with song. But by and by the good man says,
          "My voice fails me, but this bird's throat holds out longer than mine.
          Would God," said he, "I could even fly away where I could sing on for
          ever and for ever." Oh! it is blessed when we can praise God when the
          sun is gone down, when darkness lowers and trials multiply. Then let
          us say, "I will sing to my well-beloved a song." I will tell you
          exactly what I mean by that. One of you has just passed through a very
          terrible trouble, and you are almost broken-hearted, and you are
          inclined to say, "I will ask the prayers of the Church that I may be
          sustained." It is quite right, my dear brother, to do that, but
          suppose you could be a little stronger and say, 'Now will I sing to my
          well-beloved a song! Oh! it will be grand work: it will glorify God:
          it will strengthen you. Yes, the dear child is dead: I cannot bring
          him back again; but the Lord has done it, and he must do right. I will
          give him a song, even now." "Yes, the property has gone, and I shall
          be brought from wealth to poverty; but now, instead of fretfulness, I
          will give to my well-beloved extra music from my heart. He shall be
          praised by me now. Though he slay me, yet will I praise him." This is
          the part of a Christian. God help us ever to act it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved friends, we may well sing to our beloved a song when it shall
          be near the time of our departure. It draweth nigh, and as it draweth
          nigh we must not dread it, but rather thank God for it. The swan is
          said to sing her dying song -- a myth, I doubt not; but the Christian
          is God's swan, and he sings sweetest at the last. Like the old Simeon,
          he becomes a poet at the last, and pours out his soul before God, and
          I would we each desired, if we are spared to old age, to let our last
          days be perfumed with thanksgiving, and to bless and magnify the Lord,
          while yet we linger where mortal ears may hear the strain. Break, O
          fetters, and divide, ye clouds; be rolled up, O veil that hides the
          place of mystery from the world. Let our spirits pass into eternity
          singing. What a song to our well-beloved will we pour out from amidst
          ten thousand times ten thousand choristers. We will take our part --
          every note for him that loved us, and that washed us from our sins in
          his own blood; each note undefiled with sin; each note undistracted
          and undivided by worldly thoughts; each note full of perfection and
          acceptable to him to whom it shall be presented. O long-expected day,
          begin! Our hearts are ready to cry out, "Open, ye two-leaved gates,
          and let my spirit pass through, that I may give to my well-beloved a
          song."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I just linger here a minute to put it all round to every Christian
          here. Brother, haven't you a song for the well-beloved? Sister,
          haven't you a song for the well-beloved? Aged friend, will you not
          give him a note? Young brother full of vigour, haven't you a verse
          full of praise for him? Oh! if we might all come to the Communion
          table in the spirit of praise! Perhaps some can dance before the ark
          like David. Others, perhaps, are, like Ready-to-halt, on their
          crutches, but even he laid them down, according to John Bunyan, once
          upon a time when he heard the sweet music of praise. Let us bless the
          name of the Lord. The day has passed and been full of mercy, and
          eventide has come, and as the sun goeth down let us magnify him whose
          mercy lasteth to us through the night and will come again upon us in
          the morning, and will be with us till nights and days shall no more
          change the scene. Lift up your hearts, my brethren; let every one of
          you lift up your hands unto the name of the Most High, and magnify him
          that liveth for ever. "Oh! that men would praise the Lord for his
          goodness -- for his wonderful works to the children of men!" Now I
          have just a few observations to make about: --
        </p>
        <p>III. THE QUALITY OF THE SONG.</p>
        <p>
          I will suppose that every Christian here singing has found that he has
          got one of the Lord's songs to sing about. "Now will I sing to my
          well-beloved a song." Dear brother, the Lord's music has one thing
          about it -- that it is always new. How very frequently we find in the
          New Testament that saints and angels sing "a new song." Very different
          from the songs we used to sing; very different from the songs the
          world still delights in -- ours is heart-music, soul-music. Ours is
          real joy -- no fiction -- no mere crackling of thorns under a pot.
          Solid joys and last pleasures make up the new song of the Christian.
          New mercies make the song always new. There is a freshness in it of
          which we never weary. Some of you have heard the gospel now for fifty
          years: has it got flat to you? The name of Jesus Christ was known to
          you as the most precious of all sounds fifty or sixty years ago: has
          it become stale now? Those of us who have known and loved him twenty
          years can only say, "The more we know him the more sweet he is, and
          the more we enjoy his gospel the more resolved we are to keep to the
          old-fashioned gospel as long as ever we live." We could, indeed, sing
          a new song, though we have sung the self-same praises these twenty
          years. All the saints' praises have this about them -- that they are
          all harmonious. I do not say that their voices are. Here and there,
          there is a brother who sings very earnestly through his nose, and very
          often puts out the rest that are round about him; but it does not
          matter about the sound of the voice to the ear of man: it is the sound
          of the heart to the ear of God. If you were in a forest, and there
          were fifty sorts of birds, and they were all singing at once, you
          would not notice any discord. The little songsters seem to pitch their
          songs in keys very different from each other, but yet, somehow or
          other, all are in harmony. Now the saints, when they pray -- it is
          very strange -- they all pray in harmony. So when they praise God. I
          have frequently attended prayer-meetings where there were brethren of
          all sorts of Christian denominations, and I would have defied the
          angel Gabriel to have told what they were when they were on their
          knees. So is it with praise. I may say, "The saints in praise appear
          as one: --
        </p>
        <p>"In word, and deed, and mind,</p>
        <p>While with the Father and the Son,</p>
        <p>Sweet fellowship they find."</p>
        <p>
          Though our words be broken and our notes fall short of melody, yet if
          our hearts are right, our words are acceptable, and our music is
          harmony in the ears of the Most High. Beloved, be it noticed about the
          saints' music that it always seems very poor to them. They feel that
          they must break out. There are some of David's Psalms in which in the
          Hebrew the words are very much disconnected and broken, as though the
          poet had strained himself beyond the power of language; and how
          constantly do you find him calling upon others to help him praise God
          -- not only to other saints, but as if he felt there were not enough
          of saints, he calls on all creatures that have breath to praise God.
          How frequently do you find holy men invoking the dwellers above the
          skies, and earth, and air, and sea, to help them lift high the praise
          of God, and, as if they were not content with all animated beings, you
          will hear them bidding the trees of the wood break out and clap their
          hands, while they invite the sea to roar and the fullness thereof to
          magnify the Most High. Devout minds feel as though the whole creation
          were like a great organ with ten thousand times ten thousand pipes,
          and we little men, who have God within us, come and put our little
          hands to the keys and make the whole universe echo with thunders of
          praise to the Most High, for man is the world's priest, and the man
          that is blood-washed makes the whole earth his tabernacle and his
          temple, and in that temple doth every one speak of God's glory. He
          lights up the stars like lamps to burn before the throne of the Most
          High, and bids all creatures here below become servants in the temple
          of the infinite majesty. Oh! brethren, may God give us to feel in this
          state of mind tonight, and though we should think our praises are like
          to break down, and feel how mean they are, compared with the majesty
          of Jehovah and his boundless love, yet shall we have praised him
          acceptably.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would be very earnest in the next minute or two to stir up my
          brethren here to sing to their well-beloved a song, because I am quite
          sure the exercise will be most fitting and most beneficial. I will
          speak only for myself, but I will say this -- if I did not praise and
          bless Christ my Lord, I should deserve to have my tongue torn out by
          its roots from my mouth, and I will add -- if I did not bless and
          magnify his name, I should deserve that every stone I tread on in the
          streets should rise up to curse my ingratitude, for I am a drowned
          debtor to the mercy of God -- over head and ears -- to infinite love
          and boundless compassion am I a debtor. Are you not the same? Then I
          charge you by the love of Christ, awake, awake your hearts now to
          magnify his glorious name. It will do you much good, my brethren.
          There is, perhaps, no exercise that, on the whole, strengthens us to
          much as praising God. Sometimes, even when prayer fails, praise will
          do it. It seems to gird up the loins; it pours a holy anointing oil
          upon the head and upon the spirit; it gives us a joy of the Lord which
          is always our strength. Sometimes, if you begin to sing in a dull
          frame, you can sing yourself up the ladder. Singing will often make
          the heart rise. The song, though at first it be a drag, will by and by
          come to be wings to lift the spirit with it. Oh! sing more, my
          brethren, and you will sing more still, for the more you sing the more
          you will be able to sing the praises of God. It will glorify God; it
          will comfort yourself; it will also prove an attraction to those who
          are lingering around the churches. The melancholy of some Christians
          tends to repel seekers, but the holy joy of others tends to attract
          them. More flies will always be caught with honey than with vinegar,
          and more souls will be brought to Christ by your cheerfulness than my
          your moroseness, more by your consecrated joy than by your selfish
          dolour. God grant us to sing the praises of God with heart and life
          until we sing them in heaven, and I doubt not that, as a church, we
          should thus become more useful, and more would be led to cast in their
          lot with us, for they would perceive that God blessed us. If God
          should make you feel that you must praise him tonight, the purpose
          that I desire to fulfil will have been accomplished. Oh! I wish I
          could bid you all say, "I will sing to my beloved a song!" But there
          are some of you who don't love him, and cannot, therefore, sing to
          him. In Exeter Hall, some years ago, at one of our services, I gave
          out the hymn: --
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus, lover of my soul,</p>
        <p>Let me to thy bosom fly."</p>
        <p>
          There was one present who was a total stranger to the gospel, but that
          touching expression, "Jesus, lover of my soul," touched his heart, and
          he said, "Is Jesus the lover of my soul? Then I will love him too,"
          and he gave his heart to Jesus and cast in his lot with his people. I
          would that some here would say the same. Then shall they also sing to
          their beloved a song; but now their fittest duty will be prayer and
          penitent trust. God help them to seek and find the Saviour -- even
          Jesus Christ the Lord. Amen.<br />
