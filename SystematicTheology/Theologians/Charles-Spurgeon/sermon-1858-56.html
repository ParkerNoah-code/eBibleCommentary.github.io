        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.220)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, November 16th, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>BELOVED FRIENDS AND KINDRED IN CHRIST,</p>
        <p>
          The days seem like weeks and the weeks seem like months since I went
          up to the house of the Lord. My heart and my flesh are crying out for
          the assembly of the saints. Oh how I long to hear once more the solemn
          shout of the festal throng who with the voice of joy and praise keep
          holy day!
        </p>
        <p>
          I am slowly rallying. My great struggle now is with weakness. I feel
          as if my frail bark had weathered a heavy storm which has made every
          timber creak. Do not attribute this illness to my having laboured too
          hard for my Master. For his dear sake, I would that I may yet be able
          to labour more. Such toils as might be hardly noticed in the ramp for
          the service of one's country, would excite astonishment in the church
          for the service of our God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, I entreat you for love's sake to continue in prayer for me.
          When ye find access to God, remember me. Mind it is not by the words
          of your mouth, nor yet by the cravings of your heart, but it is by the
          precious blood of Christ ye must draw nigh to God. And when ye find
          his sweet presence and are bedewed with his holy anointing, then pour
          out your souls before him, and make mention of me in your
          supplications.
        </p>
        <p>Yours to love and serve in the Gospel,</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON.</p>

          "Fear ye not me? saith the Lord; will ye not tremble at my presence,
          which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual
          decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss
          themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they
          not pass over it? But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious
          heart; they are revolted and gone." -- Jeremiah 5:22-23.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE MAJESTY OF God, as displayed in creation and providence, ought to
          stir up our hearts in adoring wonder and melt them down in willing
          obedience to his commands. The Almighty power of Jehovah, so clearly
          manifest in the works if his hands, should constrain us, his
          creatures, to fear his name and prostrate ourselves in humble
          reverence before his throne. When we know that the sea, however
          tempestuous, is entirely submissive to the behests of God; that when
          he saith, "Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further," it dares not
          encroach -- "the pride of its waves is stayed." When we know that God
          bridles the tempest, though "nature rocks beneath his tread," and
          curbs the boisterous storm -- he ought to be feared -- verily, he is a
          God before whom it is no dishonour for us to bow ourselves in the very
          dust. The contemplation of the marvellous works which he doth upon
          "the great and wide sea," where he tosseth the waves to and fro, and
          yet keepeth them in their ordained courses, should draw forth our
          devoutest emotions, and I could almost say, inspire us with homage.
          Great art thou, O Lord God; greatly art thou to be praised; let the
          world which thou hast made, and all that therein is, declare thy
          glory! I can scarcely conceive a heart so callous that it feels no
          awe, or a human mind so dull and destitute of understanding, as fairly
          to view the tokens of God's omnipotent power, and then turn aside
          without some sense of the fitness of obedience. One might think the
          impression would be spontaneous in every breast, and if not, only let
          reason do her office, and by slower process every mind should yet be
          convinced. Let your eyes behold the stars; God alone can tell their
          numbers, yet he calls them all by names; by him they are marshalled in
          their spheres, and travel through the aerial universe just as he gives
          them charge; they are all his servants, who with cheerful haste
          perform the bidding of their Lord. You see how the stormy wind and
          tempest like slaves obey his will; and you know that the great pulse
          of ocean throbs and vibrates with its ebb and flow entirely under his
          control. Have these great things of God, these wondrous works of his,
          no lesson to teach us? Do they not while declaring his glory reveal
          our duty? Our poets, both the sacred and the uninspired, have feigned
          consciousness to those inanimate agents that they might the more
          truthfully represent their honourable service. But if because we are
          rational and intelligent beings, we withhold our allegiance from our
          rightful Sovereign, then our privileges are a curse, and our glory is
          a shame. Alas, then the instincts of men very often guide them to act
          by impulse more wisely than they commonly do by a settled conviction.
          Where is the man that will not bend the knee in time of tempest? Where
          is the man that does not acknowledge God when he hears the terrible
          voice of his deep-toned thunder, and sees with alarm the shafts of his
          lightning fly abroad, cleaving the thick darkness of the atmosphere?
          In times of plague, famine, and pestilence, men are prone to take
          refuge in religion -- they will make confession, like Pharaoh, when he
          said, "I have sinned this time: the lord is righteous, and I and my
          people are wicked;" but like him, when "the rain, and the hail, and
          the thunders have ceased," when the plagues are removed, then they sin
          yet more, and their hearts are hardened. Hence their sin becomes
          exceeding sinful, since they sin against truths which even nature
          itself teaches us are most just. We might learn, even without the
          written oracles of Scripture, that we ought to obey God, if our
          foolish hearts were not so darkened; thus unbelief of the Almighty
          Creator is a crime of the first magnitude. If it were a petty
          Sovereign against whom ye rebelled, it might be pardonable; if he were
          a man like yourselves, ye might expect that your faults would easily
          find forgiveness; but since he is the God who reigns alone where
          clouds and darkness are round about him, the God to whom all nature is
          obedient, and whose high behests are obeyed both in heaven and in
          hell, it becomes a crime, the terrible character of which words cannot
          pourtray, that you should ever sin against a God so marvellously
          great. The greatness of God enhances the greatness of our sin. I
          believe this is one lesson which the prophet intended to teach us by
          the text. He asks us in the name of God, or rather, God asks us
          through him -- "Fear ye not me? saith the Lord: will ye not tremble at
          my presence?"
        </p>
        <p>
          But while it is a lesson, I do not think it is the lesson of the text.
          There is something else which we are to learn from it. God here
          contrasts the obedience of the strong, the mighty the untamed sea,
          with the rebellious character of his own people. "The sea," saith he,
          "obeys me; it never breaks its boundary; it never leapeth from its
          channel; it obeys me in all its movements. But man, poor puny man, the
          little creature whom I could crush as the moth, will not be obedient
          to me. The sea obeys me from shore to shore, without reluctance, and
          its ebbing floods, as they retire from its bed, each of them says to
          me, in the voices of the pebbles, O Lord, we are obedient to thee, for
          thou art our master.' But my people," says God, "are a revolting and a
          rebellious people; they go astray from me." And is it not, my
          brethren, a marvellous thing, that the whole earth is obedient to God,
          save man? Even the mighty Leviathan, who maketh the deep to be hoary,
          sinneth not against God, but his course is ordered according to his
          Almighty Master's decree. Stars, those wondrous masses of light, are
          easily directed by the very wish of God; clouds, though they seem
          erratic in their movement, have God for their pilot; "he maketh the
          clouds his chariot;" and the winds, though they seem restive beyond
          control, yet do they blow, or cease to blow just as God willeth. In
          heaven, on earth, even in the lower regions, I had almost said, we
          could scarcely find such a disobedience as that which is practised by
          man; at least, in heaven, there is a cheerful obedience; and in hell
          there is constrained submission to God, while on earth man makes the
          base exception, he is continually revolting and rebelling against his
          Maker.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still there is another thought in the text, and this I shall endeavour
          to dilate upon. Let us read it again. "Fear ye not me? saith the Lord:
          will ye not tremble at my presence?" -- now here is the pith of the
          matter -- "which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a
          perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof
          toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they soar, yet can
          they not pass over it? But this people hath a revolting and a
          rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone." "The sea," says God,
          "is not only obedient, but it is rendered obedient by the restraint
          merely of sand." It is not the rock of adamant that restrains the sea
          one half so easily as just that little belt of sand and shingle which
          preserves the dry land from the inundations of the ocean. "The sea
          obeys me, and has for its only check the sand; and yet," says he, "my
          people, though they have restraints the strongest that reason could
          imagine, are a revolting and a rebellious people, and scarcely can my
          commands, my promises, my love, my judgment, my providence or my word
          restrain them from sin."
        </p>
        <p>
          That is the point we shall dwell upon this morning. The sea is easily
          restrained by a belt of sand; but we, notwithstanding all the
          restraints of God, are a people bent on revolting from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of the text, seems to me to be this -- that without
          supernatural means God can make all creatures obedient save man; but
          man is so disobedient in his heart, that only some supernatural agency
          can make him obedient to God, while the simple agency of sand can
          restrain the sea, without any stupendous effort of divine power more
          than he ordinarily puts out in nature: he can not thus make man
          obedient to his will.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my brethren, let us look back into history, and see if it has not
          been so. What has been a greater problem, if we may so speak
          concerning the Divine mind, than that of restraining men from sin? How
          many restraints God has put upon man! Adam is in the garden, pure and
          holy; he has restraints that one would think strong enough to prevent
          his committing a sin so contemptible and apparently unprofitable as
          that by which he fell. He is to have the whole garden in perpetuity,
          if he will not eat of that tree of life; his God will walk with him,
          and make him his friend; moreover, in the cool of the day, he shall
          hold converse with angels, and with the Lord, the Master of angels;
          and yet he dares eat of that holy fruit which God had set forth not to
          be touched by man. Then he must die. One would think it was enough, to
          promise reward for obedience, and punishment for sin; but no, the
          check fails. Man, left to his own free will, touches the fruit, and he
          falls. Man cannot be restrained, even in his purity, so easily as the
          mighty sea. Since that time, mark what God has done by way of
          restraint. The world has become corrupt it is altogether covered with
          iniquity. Forth comes a prophet. Enoch prophesies of the coming of the
          Lord, declaring that he sees him coming with ten thousand of his
          saints to judge the world. That world goes on, as profane and
          unheeding as before. Another prophet is raised up, and cries, "Yet a
          little while, and this earth shall be drowned in a flood of water." Do
          men cease from sin? No; profligacy, crime, iniquities of the vilest
          class, are as prevalent as before. Man rushes on to his destruction;
          the deluge comes and destroys all but a favoured few. The new family
          goes out to people the earth: will not the world now be clean and
          holy? Wait a little, and ye shall see. One of these men will do a deed
          which shall render him a curse for ever, and his son Canaan shall in
          after years inherit his father's curse. Not long after that you see
          Sodom and Gomorrah devoured with fire which God rains out of heaven.
          But what of this? What though in later years Pharaoh and his chariots
          are drowned in the Red sea? What though Sennacherib and his hosts
          perish at midnight by the blast of an archangel? What though the world
          reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, being drunken with
          the wine of God's wrath? What though the earth be scarred and burned
          by war? What though it be deluged with floods? What though it be
          oppressed with famines, pestilences, and diseases? She still goes on
          in the same manner; at this hour the world is a sinful, rebellious
          world, and until God shall work a work in our day, such as we shall
          scarce believe, though a man tell it to us, the world shall never be
          pure and holy. The sea is restrained by sand; we admire the beautiful
          poetic fact; but man, being naturally more ungovernable than the storm
          and more impetuous than the ocean, is not to be tamed; he will not
          bend his neck to the Lord, nor will he be obedient to the God of the
          whole earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But what of this fact?" -- you say -- "we know it is true; we do not
          doubt it." Stay awhile; I am now coming to deal with your hearts and
          consciences; and may the Holy Spirit help me in doing so! I shall
          divide, as God would divide them, -- saints and sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, ye saints, I have a word to say to you. I want you to
          look at this as a doctrine not more evident in the history of mankind
          at large, than abundantly verified in your own case. Come, now, I want
          to ask of you this morning, whether it cannot be said of you truly --
          "The sea is bound by sand; but I am one of those people who are bent
          on revolting from God, neither can any of his restraints keep me from
          sin." Let us review, for a few moments, the various restraints which
          God has put upon his people to keep them from sins which,
          nevertheless, are altogether ineffectual, without the accompanying
          power of irresistible grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, then, remember there is a restraint of gratitude which, to the
          lowly regenerated heart, must necessarily form a very strong motive to
          obedience. I can conceive of nothing that ought so much to prompt me
          to obedience as the thought that I owe so much to God. O heir of
          heaven! thou canst look back to eternity and see thy name in life's
          fair book set down; thou canst sing of electing love; thou dost
          believe that a covenant was made with Christ in thy behalf, and that
          thy salvation was made secure in that moment when the hands of the
          Eternal Son grasped the stylus and signed his name as the
          representative of all the elect. Thou believest that on Calvary thy
          sins were all atoned for; thou hast in thy soul the conviction that
          thy sins, past, present, and to come, were all numbered on the
          scape-goat's head of old, and carried away for ever; thou believest
          that neither death nor hell can ever divide thee from thy Saviour's
          breast; thou knowest that there is laid up for thee a crown of life
          which fadeth not away, and thine expectant soul anticipates that with
          branches of palms in thine hands, with crowns of gold on thine head,
          and streets of gold beneath thy feet, thou shalt be happy for ever.
          Thou believest thyself to be one of the favoured of heaven, a special
          object of divine solicitation; thou thinkest that all things work
          together for thy good, yea, thou art persuaded that everything in
          providence has a special regard to thee, and to thy favoured brethren.
          I ask thee, O saint, is not this a bond strong enough to keep thee
          from sin? If it were not for the desperate unstableness of thy heart,
          wouldst thou not be restrained from sin by this? Is not thy sin
          exceeding sinful, because it is sin against electing love, against
          redeeming peace, against all-surpassing mercy, against matchless
          affection, against shoreless grace, against spotless love? Ah! sin has
          reached its climax, when it dares to sin against such love as this. O
          Christian! thine affection to thy Lord and Master should restrain thee
          from iniquity. And is it not a fearful proof of the terrible character
          of thine heart, of thine heart even now, for still thou hast evil
          remaining in it, that all the ties of gratitude are still incapable of
          keeping thee from unholiness. The sins of yesterday rise to thy memory
          now. Oh! look back on them. Do they not tell thee that thou dost sin
          most ungratefully? O saint! didst thou not yesterday use thy Master's
          name in vain, and not thy Master's only, but thy Father's name? Hadst
          thou not yesterday an unbelieving heart? Wast thou not petulant when
          girded with favours that ought to make a living man unwilling to
          complain? Wast thou not, when God hath forgiven thee ten thousand
          talents, angry with thy neighbour, who owed thee a hundred pence? Ah
          Christian! thou art not yet free from sin, nor wilt thou be, until
          thou hast washed thy garments in death's black stream, and then thou
          shalt be holy, as holy as the glorified and pure and spotless, even as
          the angels around the throne, but not till then. I ask thee, O saint,
          viewing thy sins as sins against love and mercy, against covenant
          promises, covenant oaths, covenant engagements, ay, and covenant
          fulfilments, is not thy sin a desperate thing, and art not thou
          thyself a rebellious and revolting being, seeing that thou canst not
          be restrained by such a barrier of adamant as thy soul acknowledges?
        </p>
        <p>
          Next notice, that the saint has not only this barrier against sin, but
          many others. He has the whole of God's Word given him by way of
          warning; its pages he is accustomed to read; he reads there, that if
          he break the statutes and keep not the commandments of the Lord, his
          Father will visit his transgressions with a rod, and his iniquity with
          stripes. He has before him in God's Word abundant examples. He finds a
          David going with broken bones to his grave after his sin; he finds a
          Samson shorn of his locks, and with his eyes put out; he sees proof
          upon proof that sin will find a man out; that the backslider in heart
          shall be filled with his own ways. Abundant warnings there are for the
          child of God, not of saints who have perished, for we have none such
          on record in Scripture, and none ever shall finally perish -- but we
          have many warnings of great and grievous damages sustained by God's
          own children when they have sailed out of their proper course. And
          yet, O Christian, against all warning and against all precept thou
          darest to sin. Oh! art thou not a rebellious creature, and mayest thou
          not this morning humble thyself at the thought of the greatness of
          thine iniquity?
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: the saint sins against his own experience, When he looks back
          upon his past life he finds that sin has always been a loss to him; he
          has never found any profit, but has always lost by it. He remembers
          such and such a transgression; it appeared sweet to him at the time,
          but oh! it made his Master withdraw his presence and hide his face.
          The saint can look back on the time when sin hung like a mill-stone
          round his neck, and he felt the terrible flame of remorse burning in
          his soul, and knew how evil a thing and bitter it is to sin against
          God. And yet the saint sins. Now, if the unconverted man sins, he does
          not sin against his own experience, for he has not had that true
          heartfelt experience that renders sin exceeding sinful. But every time
          thou sinnest, O grey-headed saint, thou sinnest with a vengeance, for
          thou hast had all through thy life so much proof of what sin has been
          to thee. Thou hast not been deceived about it, for thou hast felt its
          bitterness in thy bowels: and when thou sippest the accursed draught
          thou art infatuated indeed, because thou sinnest against experience.
          Ay, and the youngest of the saints, have you not been made to taste
          the bitterness of sin? I know you have, if you are saints! and will
          you go and dip your fingers in the nauseous cup? Will you put the
          poisoned goblet to your lips again? Yes, you will; but because you do
          so in the teeth of your experience, it ought to make you weep, that
          you should be such desperate rebels against such a loving God, who has
          put not merely a barrier of sand, but a barrier of tried steel to keep
          in your lusts, and yet they will break forth; verily ye are a
          rebellious and revolting people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then again, God guards all his children with providence, in order to
          keep them from sin. I could tell you, even from the little experience
          I have had of spiritual things, many cases in which I feel I have been
          kept from sin by Divine providence. There have been seasons when the
          strong hand of sin has appeared for a while to get the mastery over
          us, and we have been dragged along by some strong inherent lust, which
          we were prone to practise before our regeneracy. We were intoxicated
          with the lust, we remember how pleasurable it was to us in the days of
          our iniquity, how we revelled in it, till we were on a sudden dragged
          to the very edge of the precipice, and we looked down; our brain
          reeled, we could not stand; and do we not remember how just then some
          striking providence came in our way, and saved us, or else we should
          have been excommunicated from the church for violating the rules of
          propriety. Ah! strange things happen to some of us; strange things
          have happened to some of you. It was only a providence which on some
          sad and solemn occasion, to which you never look back without regret,
          saved you from sin which would have been a scab on your character.
          Bless God for that! But remember, notwithstanding the girdlings of his
          providence, how many times you have offended; and let the frequency of
          your sin remind you that you must indeed be a rebellious creature.
          Though he has afflicted you, you have sinned; though he has given you
          chastisement, you have sinned; though he has put you in the furnace.
          yet the dross has not departed from you. Oh! how corrupt your hearts
          are, and how prone you are still to wander, notwithstanding all the
          barriers God has given you to encompass you!
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, once more let me remind you, beloved, that the ordinances of
          God's house are all intended to be checks to sin. He girds us by the
          worship of the sanctuary; he girds us by the remembrance of our holy
          baptism; and all else that is connected with Christianity is intended
          to check us from sin. And great are the effects which these produce;
          yet all are insufficient, without the preserving grace of God, given
          to us day by day. Let us think, beloved, too, that God has given to us
          a tender conscience, more tender than the conscience of worldly men,
          because he has given us living consciences, whereas theirs are often
          seared and dead. And yet, against this living conscience, against the
          warnings of the Spirit, against precept, against promise, against
          experience, against the honour of God, and against the gratitude they
          owe him, the saints of God have dared to sin, and they must confess
          before him that they are rebellious, and have revolted from him. Bow
          down your heads with shame while ye consider your ways, and then lift
          up your hearts, Christians, in adoring love, that he has kept you when
          your feet were making haste to hell, where you would have gone, but
          for his preserving grace. Shall not this long suffering of your God,
          this tender compassion, be your theme every day --
        </p>
        <p>"While life, and thought, and being last,</p>
        <p>Or immortality endures?"</p>
        <p>
          Will you not pray, that God should not cast you away, nor take his
          Holy Spirit from you, though you are a rebellious creature, and though
          you have revolted against him?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is for the saints; and now may the Spirit help me, while I strive
          to apply it to sinners! Sinner, I have solemn things to say to thee
          this morning; lend me for a few minutes thy very closest attention; I
          will speak to thee as though this were the last message I should ever
          deliver in thine ear. I have asked my God, that I may so speak to
          thee, O sinner, that if I win not thy heart I may at least be free
          from thy blood; and that if I am not able to convince thee of thy sin,
          I may at any rate make thee without excuse in that day "when God shall
          judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel."
          Come, then, sinner; in the first place, I bid thee consider thy guilt.
          Thou hast heard what I have said. The mighty ocean is kept in
          obedience by God, and restrained within its channel by simple sand;
          and thou, a pitiful worm, the creature of a day, the ephemera of an
          hour, thou art a rebel against God. The sea obeys him; thou dost not.
          Consider, I beseech thee, how many restraints God has put on thee: he
          has not checked thy lusts with sand but with beetling cliffs; and yet
          thou hast burst through every bound in the violence of thy
          transgressions. Perhaps he has checked thy soul by the remembrance of
          thy guilt. Thou hast this morning felt thyself a despiser of God; or
          if not a despiser, thou art a mere hearer, and hast no part nor lot in
          this matter. Dost thou not remember thy sins in the face of thy
          mother's counsels and thy father's strong admonitions? Do they never
          check thee? Dost thou never think thou seest a mother's tears coming
          after thee? Hast thou never heard a father's prayer for thee? When
          thou hast been spending thy nights in dissipation, and hast gone home
          late to thy bed, hast thou never thought thou hast seen thy father's
          spirit at thy bed side, offering one more prayer for an Absalom, his
          son, or for an Ishmael, his rebellious child? Consider what thou hast
          learned, child! Baptized with a mother's tears, almost immersed in
          them; thou wast early taught to know something of God; when thou didst
          go from thy mother's knees, thou wentest to those of a pious teacher;
          thou wast trained in a Sabbath school, or at any rate thou wast taught
          to read the Bible. Thou knowest the threatenings of God; it is no new
          tale to thee, when I warn thee that sinners must be condemned; it is
          no new story when I tell thee that saints shall wear the starry crown;
          thou knowest all that. Consider, then, how great is thy guilt; thou
          hast sinned against light and knowledge; thou art not the Hottentot
          sinner, who sins in darkness, but thou art a sinner before high
          heaven, in the full light of day; thou hast not sinned ignorantly,
          thou hast done it when thou knewest better; and when thou comest to he
          lost, thou shalt have an additional doom, because thou didst know thy
          duty, but thou didst it not. I charge that home upon thee, I charge it
          solemnly upon thy conscience; is it true, or is it not? Some of you
          have had other things. Don't you remember, some little time ago, when
          sickness was rife, you were stretched on your bed? One night you will
          never forget; sickness had got strong hold of you, and the strong man
          bowed himself. Do you not remember what a sight you had then of the
          regions of the damned; not with your eyes, but with your conscience?
          You thought you heard their shrieks; you thought you would be amongst
          them yourself soon. Methinks I see you; you turned your face to the
          wall, and you cried, "O God, if thou wilt save my life, I will give
          myself to thee!" Perhaps it was an accident; thou didst fear that
          death was very near; the terrors of death laid hold of thee, and thou
          didst cry, "Oh! God, let me but reach home in safety, and my bended
          knees and my tears pouring in torrents, shall prove that I am sincere
          in the vow I make." But didst thou perform that vow? Nay, thou hast
          sinned against God; thy broken vows have gone before thee to judgment.
          Dost thou think it a little thing to make a promise to thy fellow
          creature and break it? It may be so in thine estimation, but not so in
          that of honest men. But dost thou think it a little thing to promise
          to thy Maker, and to break thy promise? There is no light penalty for
          sinning against the Almighty God; it will cost thee thy soul, man, and
          thy soul's blood for ever, if thou goest on in this fashion. Vow and
          pay, or if thou payest not, vow not; for God shall visit those vows
          upon thee, in the day when he maketh inquisition for blood, and
          destroyeth thy soul. Thou hast been guarded thus; remember that thou
          hast had extraordinary deliverances, the disease did not kill thee;
          thy broken bones were healed; thou didst not die; when the jaws of
          death were uplifted, they did not close upon thee: here thou art
          still. Thy life is spared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! my dear hearers, some of you are the worst; you have regularly sat
          in these pews -- God is my witness, how earnestly I have longed for
          you all in the bowels of Christ. I have not shunned to declare the
          whole counsel of God to you. If I had been a time-server, and kept
          back part of the truth, much more honour would I have received from
          men than I have received; but I have cleared my conscience, I trust,
          from your blood. How many times have I seen men and women cry, the hot
          tears falling down their cheeks in quick succession? and expected that
          I should have seen a change in some of your lives. But how many of you
          there are, who have gone on sinning against warnings, which, I am
          sure, though they may have been excelled in eloquence, have never been
          exceeded in heartiness! Do you think it a little thing to sin against
          God's ambassador? It is no little sin: every time we sin against the
          warnings we have received, we sin so much the more heinously. But
          there are some -- I had hope for you, but ye have gone back to the
          ways of perdition; I have cried, "Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die?"
          But I have been obliged to go to my Master with that exclamation, "Who
          hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord
          revealed?" Woe unto thee, Bethsaida; it were better for thee that thou
          hadst been Tyre and Sidon than that thou shouldst have been left in
          the midst of privileges, if thou shouldst perish at last! Woe unto
          you, hearers of New Park Street! Woe unto you that listen not to the
          voice of the minister here! If ye perish beneath our warnings, ye
          shall perish in a horrible manner! Woe unto thee, Capernaum! thou art
          exalted unto heaven, but thou shalt be cast down to hell." Woe unto
          thee, young woman! thou hast had a pious mother, and thou hast had
          many warnings. Woe unto thee, young man! thou hast been a profligate
          youth; thou hast been brought to this house of prayer from thine
          infancy, and thou art sitting there even now; often does thy
          conscience prick thee; often thy heart hast told thee that thou art
          wrong; and yet thou art still unchanged! Woe unto thee! Woe unto thee!
          And yet will I cry unto my God, that he would avert that woe and
          pardon thee; that he would not let thee die, but bring thee unto
          himself, lest now ye perish in your sins. Ye sinners! God has a
          controversy with you; he tames the sea, but ye will not be tamed;
          nothing but his marvellous grace exerted in you will ever check you in
          your lusts. You have sinned against warnings and reproofs, against
          providences, mercies, and judgments, and still ye sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! my hearers, when you sin, you do not sin so cheaply as others; for
          when you sin, you sin in the very teeth of hell. There is not a man or
          woman in this place, I am sure, who, when he or she sins, does not
          know that hell is the inevitable consequence! Sirs, ye do not sin in
          the dark. When God shall give you the wages of your iniquity, you
          shall not be able to say, "O God, I did not know this would be the pay
          for my labour." When thou didst sow tares, thou couldst not expect
          that thou shouldst reap wheat; thou knowest "that they who sow carnal
          things, shall reap carnal things;" thou art sowing to the flesh, but
          not with the hope that thou wilt reap salvation; for thou knowest that
          "he who soweth to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption."
          Sinner, it is a dreadful thing to sin, when God puts hell before thee!
          What! sin when he has given out his threatening? Sin! while Sinai is
          thundering, while hell is blazing? Ay, that is to sin indeed. But how
          many of you, may dear hearers, have sinned like this. I would to God,
          that he would turn this house into a Bochim, that you might weep over
          your guilt. It is the hardest thing in the world to make men believe
          their guilt. If we could once get them to do that, we should find that
          Christ would reveal to them his salvation. I cannot with my poor voice
          and my weak utterance, even bring you to think that it is Christ Jesus
          in the ministry of his Spirit who can give you a true and real sense
          of your sin. Hath he done so? Hath he blessed my words to any of you?
          Do any of you feel your sins? Do any of you know that you are
          rebellious? Do you say, from this time forth you will mend your ways?
          Sirs, let me tell you, you cannot do that. Are you better than the
          mightiest of men? The best of men are but men at the best, and they
          are convinced that they cannot tame their own turbulent passions. God
          saith that the sea can be tamed with sand; but the heart of man cannot
          be restrained, it is still revolting. Dost thou think thou canst do
          that, which God saith is impossible? Dost thou suppose thyself
          stronger than God Almighty? What! canst thou change thine own heart,
          when God declares that we must he born again from above, or else we
          cannot see the kingdom of heaven? Others have tried to do it, but they
          cannot. I beseech thee, do not try to do it with thine own strength. I
          am glad thou knowest thy guilt; but O do not increase that guilt, by
          seeking to wash it out in the foul stream of thine own resolutions. Go
          and tell God that thou knowest thy sin, and confess it before him, and
          ask him to create in thee a clean heart, and renew in thee a right
          spirit. Tell him thou knowest that thou art rebellious, and thou art
          sure that thou always wilt be, unless he change thy heart; and I
          beseech thee, rest not satisfied until thou hast a new heart. My
          hearer, be not content with Baptism; be not content with the Lord's
          Supper; be not content with shutting up your shop on Sunday; be not
          content with leaving off drunkenness; be not content with giving up
          swearing. Remember, you may do all that, and be damned. It is a new
          heart and a right spirit you want; begin with that, and when you have
          that, all the rest will come right. Bethink thee, my hearer; thou
          mayest varnish and gild thyself, but thou canst never change thyself.
          Thou mayest moralise, but thou canst never spiritualise thy heart. But
          just bethink thee. Thou art this morning lost; and just think of this,
          -- thou canst do nothing whatever to save thyself. Let that thought
          rise in thy soul, and lay thee very low; and when thou goest to God,
          cry, "O Lord, do what I cannot do; save me, O my God, for thy mercy's
          sake."
        </p>
        <p>
          My dear hearers, have I spoken harshly to you, or wilt ye rather take
          it in love? Ye who have sinned thus terribly against God, do ye feel
          it? Well, I have no grace to offer to thee, I have no Christ to offer
          to thee, but I have Christ to preach to thee. Oh! what shall I say?
          This: -- you are a sinner. "It is a faithful saying, and worthy of all
          acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,
          even the chief." Art thou a sinner? Then he came to save thee. Oh!
          joyful sound. I am ready to leap in the pulpit for very joy, to have
          this to preach to thee. I can clap my hands with ecstacy of heart,
          that I am allowed again to tell thee -- "It is a faithful saying, and
          worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to
          save sinners." Let me tell you that when he came into this world he
          was nailed to the cross, and that there he expired in desperate griefs
          and agony; and there he shrieked, "My God, my God, why hast thou
          forsaken me?" There the blood ran from his hands and feet, and because
          he suffered he is able to forgive. Sinner, dost thou believe that?
          Thou art black; dost thou believe, in the face of thy blackness, that
          Christ's blood can make thee white? What sayest thou, sinner? God has
          convinced thee of thy sin; art thou willing to be saved in God's way
          this morning? If thou art willing, thou shalt be saved. It is written,
          -- "Whosoever will, let him come." Art thou thirsty this morning? come
          hither and drink. Art thou hungry? come and eat. Art thou dying? come
          and live. My Master bids me tell you, all you who feel your sins, that
          you are forgiven; all you who know your transgressions, he bids me
          tell you this: -- " I, even I, am he that blotteth out your
          transgressions, for my name's sake." Hast thou been an adulterer, hast
          thou been a whore-monger, a thief, a drunkard, a Sabbath-breaker, a
          swearer? I find no exception in this proclamation; -- "Whosoever will,
          let him come." I find no exception in this; -- "Him that cometh I will
          in nowise cast out." Dost thou know thy guilt? then I do not ask thee
          what thy guilt is. Though thou wert the vilest creature, again, I tell
          thee, if thou knowest thy guilt, Christ will forgive thee. Believe it,
          and thou art saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now will ye go away and forget all this? Some of you have wept
          this morning. No wonder; the wonder is that we do not all weep, until
          we find ourselves saved! You will go away to-morrow to your farms and
          to your merchandize, to your shops, and to your offices; and the
          impression that may have been produced on you this Sabbath morning
          will pass away like the morning cloud. My hearers, I would not weep,
          though you should call me all the names you can think of, but I wilt
          weep because you will not weep for yourselves. Sinners, why will ye be
          damned? Is it a pleasant thing to revolt in the flames of hell? Sirs,
          what profit is there in your death! What! is it an honorable thing to
          rebel against God? Is it an honor to stand and be the scorn of God's
          universe? Dost thou say thou shalt not die; yet thou wilt put it off a
          little while? Sinner, thou wilt never have a more convenient season;
          if to-day is inconvenient, to-morrow will be more so. Put it off
          to-day, wipe away the tears from your eyes, and the day may come when
          you would give a million worlds for a tear, but you shall not be able
          to get one. Many a man has had a soft heart; it has passed away, and
          in after years he has said, "Oh, that I could but shed a tear!" O God!
          make thy word like a hammer this morning, that it may break the rocky
          heart in pieces! Ye who know your sins, as God's ambassador, I beseech
          you, "be ye reconciled unto God." "Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and
          ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little."
          Remember, once lost, ye are lost for ever; but if ye are once saved,
          ye are certainly saved for ever. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
          and thou shalt be saved," said Paul of old; Jesus himself hath said
          "He that believeth and is haptised shall be saved; but he that
          believeth not shall be damned." I will not finish with a curse. "He
          that believeth shall be saved." God give you all an interest in that
          eternal blessing, for the Lord Jesus' sake!<br />
