          The property, moreover, in the possession of the several parishes was
          left in the hands of the bishops, who hold the place of the apostles;
          and it is so to this day, and ought to be so in all future time. And
          out of those possessions the bishops and the faithful as their
          stewards ought to furnish to all who wish to enter the life in common
          all necessaries as they best can, so that none may be found in want
          among them. For the possessions of the faithful are also called
          oblations, because they are offered to the Lord. They ought not
          therefore to be turned to any other uses than those of the Church, and
          in behoof of Christian brethren before mentioned, and of the poor; for
          they are the offerings of the faithful, and they are redemption moneys
          for sins (pretia peccatorum), and the patrimony of the poor, and are
          given over to the Lord for the purpose already named. But if any one
          act otherwise (which may God forbid), let him take care lest he meet
          the condemnation of Ananias and Sapphira, and be found guilty of
          sacrilege, as those were who lied as to the price of the property
          designated, of whom we read thus in the before-cited passage of the
          Acts of the Apostles: |But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira
          his wife, sold land (agrum), and kept back part of the price, his wife
          also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the
          apostles' feet. But Peter said to Ananias, Why hath Satan tempted
          (tentavit) thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part
          of the price of the land? Whilst it remained, was it not thine own?
          and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? Why hast thou
          conceived this thing in thine heart? Thou hast not lied unto men, but
          unto the Lord. And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down, and gave
          up the ghost. And great fear came on all them that heard these things.
          And the young men arose, and removed him (amoverunt), and carried him
          out, and buried him. And it was about the space of three hours after,
          when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in. And Peter answered
          unto her, and said, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And
          she said, Yea, for so much. Then Peter said unto her, How is it that
          ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the
          feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall
          carry thee out. Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and
          yielded up the ghost. And the young men came in, and found her dead,
          and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband. And great fear
          came upon all the Church, and upon as many as heard these things.|
          These things, brethren, are carefully to be guarded against, and
          greatly to be feared. For the property of the Church, not being like
          personal, but like common property, and property offered to the Lord,
          is to be dispensed with the deepest fear, in the spirit of
          faithfulness, and for no other objects than the above-named, lest
          those should incur the guilt of sacrilege who divert it from the hands
          to which it was consigned, and lest they should come under the
          punishment and death of Ananias and Sapphira, and lest (which is yet
          worse) they should become anathema maranatha, and lest, though their
          body may not fall dead like that of Ananias and Sapphira, their soul,
          which is nobler than the body, should fall dead, and be cut off from
          the company of the faithful, and sink into the depths of the pit.
          Wherefore all must give heed to this matter, and watch in
          faithfulness, and avert the dishonour of such usurpation, lest
          possessions dedicated to the uses of things secret (or sacred) and
          heavenly be spoiled by any parties invading them. And if any one do
          so, then, after the sharp vengeance which is due to such a crime, and
          which is justly to be carried out against the sacrilegious, let him be
          condemned to perpetual infamy, and cast into prison or consigned to
          life-long exile. For, according to the apostle, we ought to deliver
          such a man to Satan, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the
          Lord.<br />
