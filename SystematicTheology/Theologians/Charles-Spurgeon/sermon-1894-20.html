          He that is hasty to trust is lightminded; and he that sinneth shall
          offend against his own soul. He that maketh merry in his heart shall
          be condemned: and he that hateth talk hath the less wickedness. Never
          repeat what is told thee, and thou shalt fare never the worse. Whether
          it be of friend or foe, tell it not; and unless it is a sin to thee,
          reveal it not: for he hath heard thee, and observed thee, and when the
          time cometh he will hate thee. Hast thou heard a word? let it die with
          thee: be of good courage, it will not burst thee. A fool will travail
          in pain with a word, as a woman in labour with a child. As an arrow
          that sticketh in the flesh of the thigh, so is a word in a fool's
          belly. Reprove a friend: it may be he did it not, and if he did
          something, that he may do it no more. Reprove thy neighbour: it may be
          he said it not, and if he hath said it, that he may not say it again.
          Reprove a friend, for many times there is slander; and trust not every
          word. There is one that slippeth, and not from the heart; and who is
          he that hath not sinned with his tongue? Reprove thy neighbour before
          thou threaten him; and give place to the law of the Most High.
