          It should be borne in mind by the reader that the holy martyr Fabian
          must not be less esteemed because this forgery was put upon him long
          after his decease. The forger puts many good things into his work, to
          make it accord with the character to which he attributes good and bad
          together. So with all the Decretals: they are made specious by piety
          and texts of Scripture.<br />
