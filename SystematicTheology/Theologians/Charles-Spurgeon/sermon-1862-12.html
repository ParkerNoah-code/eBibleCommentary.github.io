        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.481)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, November 23rd, 1862, by</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both
          they that have wives be as though they had none; And they that weep,
          as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they
          rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; And
          they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this
          world passeth away.| -- 1 Corinthians 7:29-31.
        </p>
        <p>
          HOLY SCRIPTURE SELDOM gives a special rule for each particular case,
          but it rather instructeth us by general principles applicable to all
          cases. To meet every distinct moral emergency which could possibly
          arise, and solve every separate problem of action, would require
          rather a library than a volume. To men who are taught of the Spirit of
          God, general principles are far more valuable than special precepts,
          and I am half persuaded that it is so with all persons; for it is less
          difficult to apply a general principle to a peculiar case than it is
          to find out exactly what the particular case may be, and what the
          special rule applicable to it. In writing to the Church at Corinth the
          apostle had to answer several questions with regard to marriage;
          whether, for instance, it was not better in those persecuting times,
          when men often had to flee suddenly from their houses, that they
          should remain unmarried; whether, again, supposing a person became a
          Christian after marriage, it was lawful for him to separate from the
          person with whom he was unequally yoked; and several other questions
          as to fitting action in certain extraordinary positions. To these the
          apostle answers with an |I suppose,| or again, |Howbeit, for this
          speak I, not the Lord;| as if he felt himself quite out of his element
          in attempting to meet every case; but soon he lands on sure ground in
          the verses before us, and seems to say, |Whatever may be the answers
          which I ought to give to these special questions, of this one thing I
          am quite sure; I say positively and without any doubt that the time is
          short, and therefore it remaineth, whether ye are married or not,
          whether ye weep or whether ye rejoice, whether ye buy or whether ye
          sell, that ye should act in all these things as knowing, their
          temporary and unsubstantial character.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear brethren, the important lesson which we endeavor to teach this
          morning is just this -- that because time is so short, and the things
          of this world so frail and fleeting, it becomes us always to look at
          the things which are seen in their true character, and never to build
          substantial hopes on unsubstantial comforts, nor seek for solid joy
          from unreal things.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order that I may make this matter very plain, and may be the more
          likely to enlist your attention, and to secure the friendship of your
          memories in future years, I intend this morning to take you to a play.
          Strange thing for me to do, who have never crossed the threshold of a
          theater on any occasion, good or bad! Yet this morning I shall seat
          you in front of the stage, and I shall put the worldling side by side
          with you while the five acts are performed. I shall next invite you to
          attend in the character of a Christian, to look through the whole and
          discern its emptiness; then, in the third place, I shall point you to
          the curtain which is quite sure to drop upon the scene; and then we
          will walk out of this theater of unreal show, this fashion of this
          world which passeth away, and see what there is to do in this world
          which is real, practical, and lasting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not suppose that the idea of taking you to a theater this morning
          is original on my part; it is in my text. |The fashion of this world
          passeth away,| -- the word translated |fashion| is borrowed from the
          changing scenes of the drama; where the splendid pageantry vanishes as
          the scene changes. Nor will you think Holy Scripture too severe in its
          comparison, when I remind you that one of the world's own poets has
          said
        </p>
        <p>|All the world's a stage,</p>
        <p>And all the men and women merely players.|</p>
        <p>
          Nor will the most precise among you complain of the levity of a
          metaphor which is sanctioned by Apostolic use; but I trust you will
          all cheerfully listen, while in simple words I tell the story which
          the bard of the sanctuary has sung in flowing verse.
        </p>
        <p>|This life's a dream, an empty show;</p>
        <p>But the bright world to which I go,</p>
        <p>Hath joys substantial and sincere:</p>
        <p>When shall I wake and find me there?|</p>
        <p>
          I. WE WILL WITNESS |THE FASHION OF THIS WORLD| AS IT PASSES BEFORE US,
          LISTENING TO THE WORLDLING'S COMMENT.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first act introduces those that have wives. It opens with a
          wedding. The bride and bridegroom advance to the altar in bridal
          attire. The bells are ringing; crowds are cheering at the door, while
          overflowing mirth is supreme within. In another scene we observe
          domestic happiness and prosperity, a loving husband and a happy wife.
          Yet, further on in the performance, rosy children are climbing the
          father's knee; the little prattlers are lisping their mother's name.
          |Now,| says our companion as he gazes with rapture, |This is real and
          enduring, I know it is; this will satisfy me; I crave for nothing more
          than this. Home is a word as sweet as heaven, and a healthy happy race
          of children is as fine a possession as even angels can desire. On this
          rock will I build all my hope; secure me this portion, and I
          cheerfully renounce the dreamy joys of religion.| We whisper in his
          ear that all this is but a changing scene, and will by-and-bye pass
          away, for time is short, and wife and children are dying creatures.
          The man laughs at us, and says, |Fanatics and enthusiasts may seek
          eternal joys, but these are enough me.| He believes that if there be
          anything permanent in the universe it is marrying and being given in
          marriage, educating and bringing up a family, and seeing them all
          comfortably settled. He is right in valuing the blessing, but wrong in
          making it his all. Will he see his error before the curtain falls? Or
          will he continue to found the hopes of an immortal spirit upon dying
          joys? See the green mounds in the cemetery, and the headstone, with
          |Here he lies.| Alas for thee, poor deluded worldling, where is thy
          soul now? Doth it console thee that the dust of thine offspring shall
          mingle with thine ashes? Where hast thou now a home? What family hast
          thou now to care for? The first act is over; take breath and say,
          |This also is vanity.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The tenour of the drama changes, alas, how soon! Household joys are
          linked with household sorrows. They that weep are now before us in the
          second act. The cloudy and dark days have come. There are parents
          wringing their hands; a beloved child has died, and they are following
          its corpse to the tomb. Anon, the merchant has suffered a tremendous
          loss; he puts his hand to his aching head and mourns, for he knows not
          what will be the end of his troubles. The wife is smitten by the hand
          of death; she lies on her bed, blanched with sickness and wan with
          pain; there is a weeping husband at her side, and then there is
          another funeral, and in the dim distance I see the black horses again
          and again. The woes of men are frequent, and sorrow's visits are not,
          like those of angels, few and far between. Our man of the world, who
          is much moved at this second act, foreseeing his own sorrows therein,
          weeps, until he fairly sobs out his feelings, clutches us with
          earnestness, and cries, |Surely this is awfully real; you cannot call
          this a fleeting sorrow or a light affliction. I will wring my hands
          for ever; the delight of my eyes has been taken from me; I have lost
          all my joys now; my beloved in whom I trusted has withered like a leaf
          in autumn before my face; now shall I despair; I shall never look up
          again!| |I have lost my fortune,| says the afflicted merchant, |and
          distress overwhelms me; this world is indeed a wilderness to me; all
          its flowers are withered. I would not give a snap of my finger to live
          now, for everything worth living for is gone!| Sympathising deeply
          with our friend, we nevertheless venture to tell him that these trials
          to the Christian, because they are so short and produce such lasting
          good, are not killing sorrows. |Ah,| says he, |you men of faith may
          talk in that way, but I cannot; I tell you these are real things.|
          Like an English sailor, who, seeing a play, sprung upon the stage to
          help a lady in distress, believing that the whole was real, so do such
          men weep and sigh, as if they were to mourn for ever, because some
          earthly good has been removed. Oh that they knew that the depths of
          sorrow were never yet explored by a mortal mourner! Oh that they would
          escape from those lower deeps where immortal spirits weep and wail
          amidst an emphasis of misery! The sorrows of time are trifles indeed
          when compared with the pains of everlasting punishment; and on the
          other hand we reckon that they me not worthy to be compared with the
          glory which shall be revealed in us. They are but light afflictions,
          which are but for a moment, a mere pin's prick to the man of faith.
          Happy is the man whose eyes are opened to see that heirs of heaven
          sorrow not as those who are without hope. A real joy of heavenly
          origin is ever with believers, and it is but the shadow of sorrow
          which falls upon them. There let the curtain drop -- let us enter into
          an eternal state, and what and where are these temporary griefs?
        </p>
        <p>
          But the third act comes on, and presents us with a view of those who
          rejoice. It may be that the first-born son has come of age, and there
          are great festivities. They are eating and drinking in the servants'
          hall, and in the master's banquet chamber; there are high notes of
          joy, and many compliments, and the smiling sire is as glad as man can
          be. Or it is the daughter's wedding, and kind friends implore a
          thousand blessings on her head, and the father smiles and shares the
          joy. Or it is a gain in business, a fortunate speculation; or the
          profits of industry have come flowing in, slowly perhaps, but still
          surely, and the man is full of rejoicing; he has a house, and home,
          and friends, and reputation, and honor, and he is, in the eyes of all
          who know him, happy; those who do not know him, think he has no cares,
          that he can have no sorrows, that his life must be one perpetual
          feast, and that, surely there can be no spot in his sun, no winter in
          his year, no ebb to follow his floods. Our friend by our side is
          smiling at this sunny picture. |There,| says he, |is not that real?
          Why, there must be something in that! What more do you want? Only let
          me get the same, and I will leave you the joys of faith, and heaven,
          and immortality, to yourselves; these are the things for me; only let
          me laugh and make merry, and you may pray as you will. Fill high the
          bowl for me; put the roast and the viands on the table, and let me eat
          and drink, for to-morrow I die.| If we gently hint to our friend that
          all this passes away like a vision of the night, and that we have
          learned to look on it as though it were not, he laughs us to scorn,
          and accounts us mad when he is most mad himself. As for ourselves, so
          far from resting upon the softest couch that earth can give us, we
          spurn its vain delights.
        </p>
        <p>|There's nothing round this spacious earth</p>
        <p>That suits my large desire;</p>
        <p>To boundless joy and solid mirth</p>
        <p>My nobler thoughts aspire.</p>
        <p>Where pleasure rolls its living flood,</p>
        <p>From sin and dross refined,</p>
        <p>Still springing from the throne of God,</p>
        <p>And fit to cheer the mind.|</p>
        <p>
          But the fourth act of the drama is before us, and they that buy demand
          our attention. The merchant is neither a mourner nor a man of mirth;
          in the eyes of certain Mammonites he is attending to the one thing
          needful, the most substantial of all concerns. Here feast your eyes,
          ye hard, practical, earth-scrapers. There are his money-bags; hear how
          they thump on the table! There are the rolls of bonds, the banker's
          books, the title-deeds of estates, mortgages and securities, and the
          solid investment in his country's own console. He has made a good
          thing of life, and still he adheres business, as he should do; and,
          like a painstaking man, he is accumulating still and piling up his
          heap, meanwhile adding field to field and estate to estate, till soon
          he will possess a whole county. He has just now been buying a large
          and very fine house, where he intends to spend the remainder of his
          days, for he is about to retire from business; the layover is busy
          making out the transfer; the sum of money is waiting to be paid, and
          the whole thing is as good as settled. |Ah! now,| says our friend, who
          is looking on at the play, |you are not going to tell me that this is
          all a shadow? It is not; there is something very solid and real here,
          at least, something that will perfectly satisfy me.| We tell him we
          dare say there is something that will satisfy him, but our desires are
          of a larger span, and nothing but the infinite can fill them. Alas for
          the man who can find satisfaction in earthly things! It will be only
          for a time; for when he comes to lie upon his dying-bed, he will find
          his buyings and his sellings poor things wherewithal to stuff a dying
          pillow; he will find that his gainings and his acquisitions bring but
          little comfort to an aching heart, and no peace to a conscience
          exercised with the fear of the wrath to come. |Ah, ah!| he cries, and
          sneers sarcastically, putting us aside as only fit for Bedlam, |Let me
          trade and make a fortune, and that is enough for me; with that I shall
          be well content!| Alas, poor fool, the snow melts not sooner than the
          joy of wealth, and the smoke of the chimney is as solid as the comfort
          of riches.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we must not miss the fifth act. See the rich man, our friend whom
          lately we saw married, whom we then saw in trouble, afterwards
          rejoicing and then prospering in business, has entered upon a green
          old age; he has retired, and has now come to use the world. You will
          notice that in my text this is the last act of the drama. The world
          says he has been a wise man and has done well, for all men will praise
          thee when thou doest well for thyself. Now he keeps a liberal table, a
          fine garden, excellent horses, and many servants, he has all the
          comforts in fact that wealth can command, and as you look around his
          noble park, as you gaze at his avenue of fine old trees, or stay a day
          or two at the family mansion and notice all its luxuries, you hear
          your friend saying, |Ay, there is something very real here; what do
          you think of this?| When we hint that the gray hairs of the owner of
          all these riches betoken that his time is short, and that if this be
          all he has he is a very poor man, for he will soon have to leave it,
          and that his regrets in leaving will make his death more pitiable than
          that of a pauper, our friend replies, |Ah! ah! you are always talking
          in this way. I tell you this is not a play. I believe it is all real
          and substantial, and I am not, by any talking of yours, to be made to
          think that it is unsubstantial and will soon be gone.| O world, thou
          hast fine actors, to cheat men so well, or else mortal man is an easy
          fool, taken in thy net like the fishes of the sea. The whole matter is
          most palpably a mere show, but yet men give their souls to win it.
          Wherefore, O sons of men, are ye thus beside yourselves? |Wherefore do
          ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that
          which satisfieth not?|
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear friends, I have put before your mind's eye a fair picture of that
          which men who live by sight and not by faith regard as being the chief
          end of man, and the real object of his being. It is to be married; to
          pass through the trials and joys of life with decency, to trade and
          grow rich, and at last to use the comforts of this world without
          abuse: a very comfortable and quiet picture, by no means the
          representation we should have to present before you of the profligate,
          He profane, the dissolute, or the debauched. There is nothing here but
          what is proper and right, and yet everything is improper and
          everything becomes wrong at once if these be thought to be the
          substantial things for which an immortal spirit is to spend its fires,
          and for which an undying soul is to exhaust its powers.
        </p>
        <p>II. Let us now take the CHRISTIAN VIEW OF THIS DRAMA.</p>
        <p>
          |Life is real; life is earnest:| it is real thus far to the Christian,
          it is real for work and activity for God; it is real in the solemn
          responsibility which it brings; it is real in the gratitude which we
          owe to God for the comforts which he is pleased to bestow; it is real
          to us so far as we can see God therein, and can turn everything to
          God's glory. The unreality of this world to a Christian, is found in
          the fact that time is short. This is the wand which torches the
          substance and makes it, before the eye of wisdom, dissolve into a
          shade. Time is short!
        </p>
        <p>
          When the apostle declares that they that have wives, should be as
          though they had none, he does not teach us to despise the marriage
          state, but not to seek our heaven in it, nor let it hinder our serving
          the Lord. It is supposed that there are some things which a man
          without a wife and family can do -- those things the man with a wife
          and family should do. It is supposed that a man without a wife can
          give his time to the cause of God: the man with a wife should do the
          same, and he will not find it difficult to do so if God hath blessed
          him with one who will second all his holy endeavors. It is supposed
          that a man without a wife has no care: a man with a wife should have
          none, for he should cast all his cares on God who careth for him. |He
          that careth not for his own house is worse than a heathen man and a
          publican;| and yet the apostle says, in the verse following my text,
          |But I would have you without carefulness;| for we should learn to
          live by faith. The man who has a large family, and many things to
          exercise his mind, should yet, through the teaching of the Holy
          Spirit, lye as quietly and comfortably as though he had none,
          depending and resting by simple faith upon the providence and goodness
          of God. Then, again, it is supposed that an unmarried man will find it
          easier to die, for there will be none of that sorrow at leaving his
          beloved family: the man with a wife and family should, by faith, find
          it just as easy since the promise runs, |Leave thy fatherless
          children, and let thy widows trust in me.| Full of the same faithful
          tenderness and affection which another husband would exhibit, and even
          excelling in love and kindness, yet the Christian should look up to
          the divine Lord who is the husband of the widow, and with confidence
          leave his offspring, and bid them trust in his God. May God the Holy
          Ghost teach us how to walk in our households, loving ever and yet
          remembering that all our kindred shall pass away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, there is the second act -- weeping. Every Christian man must
          weep; but the Apostle says that our sorrows are to be regarded by us,
          because time is short, as though they were no sorrows at all. A man
          who knows that his trials will not last long, can be cheerful under
          them. If he sees a Father's hand in the midst of every adversity, and
          believes that when he is tried he shall come forth like gold from the
          furnace; if he knows with the Psalmist that |weeping may endure for
          the night, but that joy cometh in the morning,| why then grief has
          lost its weight, and sorrow has lost its sting; and while the man
          weeps he yet rejoices, seeing the rainbow of the covenant painted on
          the cloud. Happy man, who, under bereavement, under crosses, and
          losses, can still cast his burden upon God, and can say, |Although the
          fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the
          labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the
          flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in
          the stalls: yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of
          my salvation!| The Christian man is bound to live above his sorrows;
          he weeps, for |Jesus wept;| he may mourn, for the faithful have been
          mourners often, but he must not so mourn and weep as to be eaten up
          with grief; over the tops of the rolling waves he must see the haven
          of peace, and rejoice evermore.
        </p>
        <p>
          So is it in the third part. The Christian has his rejoicings, and he
          is not forbidden to be happy; indeed, he is commanded to rejoice; and
          the things of this life he may freely enjoy with the double zest of
          the mercy itself, and of the God who gave it to him. But still,
          believer, in all thy joys, remember to hold them with a loose hand.
          Never so hold thy joys as if they were all in all to thee. Though it
          be wife, or child, or property, or health, or wealth, or fame, still
          ever stand ready to surrender all into thy Father's hand, feeling that
          these, after all, are not thy joys; that thou hast better springs to
          drink from than those which earth's summers can dry up, and that thou
          hast rivers of pleasure deeper and broader than any which earth's
          winter shall be able to freeze. Do thou still stand steadily to this,
          that, as earth cannot cast thee down to despair, so it cannot lift
          thee up so as to make thee forget thy God. Learn in these things to
          rejoice as though thou hadst them not, and let this be thy solace,
          that thy name is written in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, too, in the matter of buying and possessing. It is not wrong for a
          Christian to trade and to trade well. I cannot see any reason why a
          Christian should be a fool; in fact, those who are fools in business
          are very often a great dishonor to the Christian religion, for a fool
          is very often first-cousin, if not father, to a knave. But, still,
          while we buy and sell it should always be thus -- |This is not my real
          trade; this is not the way in which I really get rich, for my treasure
          is beyond the skies, where moth devours not, and where rust cannot
          consume.| Handle these things, brethren, knowing that they take to
          themselves wings and flee away; look at them as transient objects
          which are to be used and sanctified in the passing, not your own, but
          lent to you for a time; to be repaid at last, with interest, in the
          day when the Master saith, |Give an account of thy stewardship, for
          thou mayest be no longer steward.| A man may be as rich as Croesus,
          and his wealth will never hurt him if he does not hold it with a tight
          hand; and a man may be as happy as happiness can make him here, and
          yet it will not hurt him if he learns to keep it under his feet. But
          oh! when one's rejoicings or possessions get the upper hand of us
          there is as dreadful a drowning in a sea of pleasure as in a sea of
          misery. Keep before your mind the words of our sweet singer --
        </p>
        <p>|To thee we owe our wealth and friends,</p>
        <p>And health, and safe abode;</p>
        <p>Thanks to thy name for meaner things,</p>
        <p>But they are not my God.</p>
        <p>What empty things are all the skies,</p>
        <p>And this inferior clod!</p>
        <p>There's nothing here deserves my joys,</p>
        <p>There's nothing like my God.|</p>
        <p>
          The last scene is the using of the things of this life. The creatures
          of God are given us to be used. John the Baptist may be an ascetic,
          but the Son of Man is come eating and drinking. The Christian man
          knows that the mercies which God has given him are to be used, but
          while he uses them he must use them as though he did not use them.
          That is a high philosophy which I fear me not many of us have learned,
          the philosophy of the apostle when he said, |I have learned in
          whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. I know both how to be
          abased, and I know how to abound.| That man is the fullgrown and true
          Christian whom circumstances cannot alter! He trusts in God when he is
          penniless, and he trusts in his God just the same when he is rich; he
          rests on God when he can enjoy nothing, and he rests on him just the
          same when he can enjoy everything; he learned to build on the Rock of
          Ages when he had no comfort, and he builds on the Rock of Ages now,
          when he has every comfort! This, I take it, is where the apostle would
          have us brought. To the true Christian the things of this world are
          only real so far as they involve responsibility; but, seeing that time
          is short, he looks on life as men look upon a play; he sees a monarch
          strut, and he says, |Ah! he is to pull off his robes behind the
          stage!| He sees a peasant or a beggar, and he smiles and thinks of the
          time when the king and the peasant shall be equal, and the servant and
          his lord shall stand before one tribunal to give an account of the
          things done in the body. Send your souls longing after real and
          unchanging joys, for these splendid, gaudy, shifting scenes, mock the
          beholder and delude his hopes. Gorgeous as the colors of the bubble,
          and quite as frail, farewell ye worthless things, our spirit leaves
          you for eternal mansions in the skies.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, dear friends, I want your attention a few minutes while
          I point you to THE CURTAIN WHICH IS SOON TO DROP UPON ALL THESE
          THINGS, it bears this short device, |TIME IS SHORT.|
        </p>
        <p>
          It is very difficult to keep men in mind of the fact that they are
          mortal. We confess that we are mortal, but we profess by our actions
          that we are immortal. Said a man of eighty-two concerning another of
          seventy, when he wanted to buy his land and could not get it at the
          price he wished -- |Never mind, So-and-so is an old man, he will soon
          be dead, and then I'll buy it.| Though he was ten or twelve years
          older than the other, yet the other must of course, soon die, while
          he, in his own thoughts, must live for many a year. How short time is!
          Do we not, dear friends, get more and more that impression? I am but
          young compared with very many of you, yet the impression constantly
          grows upon my mind. Why, it seems but the day before yesterday when I
          plucked the first early primrose of spring, while the flowers were
          breaking up from under the earth, and the buds were ready to burst
          from the sheath! It was only as yesterday that we were walking in the
          fields and were remarking that the corn was just beginning to be
          tinged with the golden hue of harvest! Only a few Sabbaths ago I was
          talking to you of Ruth in the harvest-fields, and of the heavily-laden
          waggon that was pressed down with sheaves; and now the leaves are
          almost all gone; but few remain upon the trees; these frosty nights
          and strong winds have swept the giants of the forest till their limbs
          are bare, and the hoar frosts plate them with silver. Then, before we
          shall have time to burn the winter's log, we shall see the snow-drops
          and the yellow crocus heralding another spring! At what a rate we
          whirl along! Childhood seems to travel in a waggon, but manhood at
          express-speed. As we grow older I am told that the speed increases
          till the gray-headed old man looks back upon all his life as being but
          a day; and I suppose, if we could live to be a hundred and thirty we
          should feel the same, till, like Jacob, we should say, |Few and evil
          have been the days of thy servant!| and, if we could live as long as
          Methuselah, I doubt not our life would appear shorter still. How time
          flies, not only by the measurement of the seasons, but by ourselves! A
          few days ago I trudged with my satchel on my back to school, or joined
          in boyish sport. How lately was it when the boy became a youth, and
          must be doing something, and was teaching other boys as he had been
          taught in his day. It was but yesterday I came to Park Street to
          address some few of you, and yet how time has fled since then, till
          now some nine years of our ministry have passed. No weaver's shuttle,
          no arrow from a bow, no swift post, no meteor seems to fly at a rate
          so wonderful as does our life! We heard of one the other day who had
          seen Wesley preach, and so we find ourselves side-by-side with the
          last century, and those old people have known some others in their
          youth who told them of the yet older time, and you find that going
          through the history of some ten or twelve persons you are carried back
          to the days of William the Conqueror, and you see our country taken by
          the Normans, and then you fly back to ancient British times as with a
          thought. You no longer say, |How long the nation has existed!| for it
          is as a sleep. You stand by some old cliff and see a deposit of
          shells, and as you remember that it may have taken a million of years
          to have formed that bed, you think -- |What is man? and what is time?
          It is not here, but gone!| We have only to think of what time is to
          conclude at once that time is not! It is but a little interlude in the
          midst of the vast eternity; a narrow neck of land jutting out into the
          great, dread, and unfathomable sea of everlastingness!
        </p>
        <p>
          But while time is thus short, its end is absolutely sure. That curtain
          yonder must fall soon! It must fall; it is inevitable. I cannot
          prevent my death by the most regular habits of life; the most skillful
          physician cannot preserve my life for me; a host of angels, should
          they swear to make me immortal, could not! When the time comes, die I
          must! And, as my death is inevitable, so it may be very near. Let each
          man remember that! How soon it may be we cannot tell! Every Sabbath
          there are some in this house who are dead before the next Sabbath. I
          am not now venturing a guess; it is a matter of fact, a matter of
          fact, too, that comes under my own cognizance very frequently.
          According to our population and the gradual number of deaths, there
          must be some out of this congregation here this morning who will have
          gone the way of all flesh before next Sabbath-day! There was one -- I
          look at her seat now, and a brother sitting near by looks there with
          sorrow! -- who was with us one Sabbath-day, and we soon heard that she
          had gone to enjoy the Eternal Sabbath! At a Church-meeting last week,
          no less than three of our sisters were reported as having fallen
          asleep in Jesus within a week. Ah! how near is death to us! Perhaps he
          now stands looking over thy shoulder, young man; God holds back his
          hand, but the dart of death is close to thy heart, and soon, -- ah,
          how soon! -- may you be taken to the place appointed for all living!
          Go, thou strong man, and remember that thou art a mass of feebleness!
          Go, thou young man, and remember that death reaps green corn! Go, thou
          old man, and expect the sickle! And go, thou rich man, and remember
          that thou shalt soon leave everything that thou hast, and then where
          art thou if thou hast no treasure in heaven, if thou hast not laid up
          in store for immortality?
        </p>
        <p>
          And I must add here that, to those who have no God, death, while
          inevitable and very near, will be most awful and tremendous! There was
          a dreadful story told in the papers of this last week. At the seaport
          town of Garliestown one day last week, certain workmen were busy
          preparing a better berth for a vessel which seems to have taken the
          ground a little too soon. On a sudden some one raised a cry that the
          ship was listing over, and while some four men were able to escape,
          one poor fellow was unable to do so, and the ship fell upon his lower
          extremities and loins. Now this was thought, perhaps, to be no great
          danger, for they could take away the sludge and extricate him. So they
          began to shore the ship, and willing hands brought ropes and blocks,
          and wedges, and earnest strength. But they soon discovered that the
          thing was impossible from the nature of the bottom of the river, and
          from the position of the cargo, which, I suppose, they could not
          speedily remove. The man was jammed under the bulwarks, and must
          remain fixed there without hope. There was just one awful hour before
          the coming tide would reach the spot. Well might a solemn hush succeed
          the frantic labors of the townsmen as death was seen riding on the
          advancing flood. The poor creature had to lie there that hour as the
          tide came gently in. A minister stood his side praying with him; let
          us trust that his soul found peace with God! But O the terror of his
          position; well might he say, |Cover my head, that I may not see the
          water.| Steadily the cold unpitying waters flowed on until a corpse
          was hidden where an hour or so before a strong man labored. This is a
          graphic picture of the position of every ungodly man! He does not know
          it, but the waves of time are coming up about him now, and we cannot
          help him to escape. The load of his sins is on his loins: he cannot
          deliver himself; the great waters of God's wrath must swallow him up
          quick. O, sinner, would that I could save thee! Alas, it is not in my
          power! But there is an arm that can deliver thee; there is one who can
          lift the burden off thee, and say to thee, |Be free!| Believe in him
          and thou shalt never die! Trust thou in his power and rest thyself on
          his love, and thou shalt escape as a bird out of the snare of the
          fowler; and when death cometh it shall be no death to thee, but a
          peaceful migration from the land of shadows to the world of substance.
          God help us to be wise, that we may remember our latter end!
        </p>
        <p>
          I would say a few more words to the sinner. I cannot think, O
          worldling, why thou shouldest love this world so much when it is so
          soon to vanish! In the old Greek cities they had a king every year,
          and, because it was so poor a thing to be a king for only one year and
          then to be a common man again, all the citizens dreaded to be kings.
          How canst thou long to be rich, when thou art only to be rich for so
          short a time? When the sailor is just about to furl his sail because
          he is near the port, he will not fret himself with some little
          inconvenience in the ship; and wherefore art thou so sore vexed with
          all these little trials, when thou art so near the eternal haven? When
          men buy property on a short lease, they will not give much for it, for
          they are only to have it for a brief term; wherefore spendest thou thy
          soul to buy this world? What will it profit thee, if thou gain it, if
          thy soul be lost? When men have a house and they are soon to leave it,
          they will not lay out much in repairing it; wherefore, then, caress
          thou so much for thy body? Why mindest thou so much this life; the
          bell is even now trembling to toll for thee, and the grave is yawning
          that it may swallow thee up? Oh man! Oh man! I would that thou wert
          wise! Thou art to live for ever, for ever, for ever, either
        </p>
        <p>|In flames that no abatement know,</p>
        <p>Though briny tears for ever flow.|</p>
        <p>
          or else in joy beyond degree. Which shall it be with thee, man? If
          thou diest as thou art, O sinner, remember, there remaineth nothing
          for thee but a fearful looking for of judgment and of fiery
          indignation! I pray thee by the love of God, to consider thy ways.
          Thus saith the Lord unto thee this day by my lips, as truly as he
          spake to Hezekiah by the prophet of old, |Set thy house in order, for
          thou shalt die and not live.| How wilt thou stand, sinner, in the day
          when the Lord cometh to make inquisition for sin, and to avenge their
          iniquity upon the heads of the unpardoned? Fly, sinner; God help thee
          by his grace to fly now to yonder open door, where Jesus waits to
          receive thee and to put away thy sin. Whosoever believeth on him is
          not condemned. Like as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,
          even so the Son of man is lifted up that whosoever believeth in him
          should not perish but have everlasting life.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Come, come, ye wise men, rise and leave this theater, we have seen
          enough of it. |The fashion of this world passeth away;| and for you
          and for me happy shall it be when it shall have passed away for ever.
          But is there nothing real? Can I do nothing real here? Is there
          nothing I can do that shall last for ever? Yes, the soul is lasting.
          Then let me see to my own soul. Let me make my calling and election
          sure, for I shall have been of all fools the most mad, if I shall have
          trifled with these things and yet have neglected my soul. The Roman
          emperor, Claudius, once invaded Great Britain, but his performance
          only consisted of gathering pebbles and shells from the sea-coast.
          This shall be my triumph, this my sole reward, if here in this world I
          live only to gather wealth. At the last I shall be as though I
          gathered pebbles, for these things shall be of no value to me if my
          soul shall perish. O Lord, by thy rich grace set me upon a sure
          foundation, and make me right before thy face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, there are some real things besides my own soul. There are other
          men's souls. What am I doing for them? Am I teaching, am I preaching,
          or, if I am not doing this, am I helping others to preach? Am I doing
          my best to add to the kingdom of Christ by the ingathering of
          immortals? Have I a sphere in the ragged school or in tract
          distributing, or am I helping in some way or other to do good? For, if
          not, my life is a play, I am doing nothing real; I am only hurrying
          here and there, and when it comes to the last I shall have been as a
          workmen that has neglected his own work to play with children in the
          streets! Dig up your buried talents, O idlers. Work while it is called
          to-day, O ye who are given to slumber.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, there is something real -- there is Christ's Church. The Church
          that is to shine like the stars in heaven for ever, the Bride of the
          Lamb -- what am I doing for Her? Do I seek the good of Jerusalem? As a
          member of the Church, do I contribute to its strength? Do I give of my
          substance to her efforts, and of my talents to her doings? Do I cast
          myself wholly into the arms of Christ, and work for him! Yes, there is
          something real -- Jesus is so. Am I glorifying him here on earth? When
          I see him in his poor people, do I feed him? When he shivers at my
          door in the garb of poverty, do I clothe him? When I know that he hath
          need, do I visit him? If so, I am doing real things. If I devote my
          life to God, to Christ, to his Church, to the souls of men, and if my
          own soul is saved, then I am living; but if not, I am dead while I
          live. |Let us live while we live!| Alas! how many are dying while they
          live, drivelling while they live! Oh! the scores of pounds we spend on
          ourselves; the hundreds we give to our own comfort! And where is that?
          It is gone like smoke! But that which is given to God lasts and
          endures; it is treasured up in God's bank; that which is given to the
          poor and needy is made -- though unrighteous mammon -- to be treasured
          up in heaven! But I know many practical persons will say, |Yes, this
          is a very pretty speech for a young minister; but these ministers do
          not understand business; they cannot be expected to understand
          temporal matters.| I would to God ye understood them half so well, for
          our understanding in this matter we know is sound; and when you shall
          come to see these things in the light of eternity streaming between
          the curtains of your dying bed, you will understand, then, that there
          was nothing worth living for but God, and Christ, and his Church; and
          you will give your verdict then with mine to this, that truly to live
          must be Christ, or else to die never can be gain!

          God add his blessing, and may some be led to trust in Jesus this
          morning!<br />
