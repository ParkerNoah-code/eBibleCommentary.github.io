          |All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the
          Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son,
          and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. Come unto me, all ye
          that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.| -- Matthew
          11:27-28.
        </p>
        <p>
          I HAVE preached to you, dear friends, several times from the words,
          |Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give
          you rest.| There is such sweetness in the precept, such solace in the
          promise, that I could fain hope to preach from it many times more. But
          I have no intention just now to repeat what I have said in any former
          discourse, or to follow the same vein of thought that we have
          previously explored. This kindly and gracious invitation needs only to
          be held up in different lights to give us different subjects for
          admiration. That it flowed like an anthem from our Saviour's lips we
          perceive, in what connection if was spoken we may properly enquire. He
          had just made some important disclosures as to the covenant relations
          that existed between himself and God the Father. This interesting
          revelation of heavenly truth becomes the basis upon which he offers an
          invitation to the toiling and oppressed children of men, and assigns
          it as a reason why they should immediately avail themselves of his
          succour. Such is the line of discourse I propose now to follow. Kindly
          understand me that I want to deal with the hearts and consciences of
          the unconverted, and, in the power of the Holy Spirit, to plead with
          them that they may at once go to Jesus and find rest unto their souls.
          I shall require no stories or anecdotes, no figures or metaphors, to
          illustrate the urgent necessity of the sinner and the generous bounty
          of the Saviour. We will make it as plain as a pikestaff, and as sharp
          as a sword, with the intention of driving straight at our point. Time
          is precious, your time especially, for you may not have many days in
          which to seek the Lord. The matter is urgent. Oh! that every
          labouring, weary sinner here might at once come to Jesus and find that
          rest which the Saviour expresses himself as so willing to give! With
          all simplicity, then, let me explain to you tile way of salvation,
          |Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The way to be saved is to come to Jesus. To come, to Jesus means to
          pray to him, to trust in him, to rely upon him. Each man who trusts in
          another may be said to come to that other for help. Thus to trust in
          Jesus is to come to him. In order to do this I must give up all
          reliance upon myself, or anything I could do or have done, or anything
          I do feel or can feel. Nor must I feel the slightest dependence upon
          anything that anyone else can do for me. I must cease from creature
          helps and carnal rites, to rest myself upon Jesus. That is what my
          Saviour means when he says, |Come unto me.| The exhortation is very
          personal. |Come unto me,| says he. He saith not, come to my ministers
          to consult them. nor come to my sacraments to observe them, nor come
          to my Bible to study its teaching -- interesting and advantageous as
          under some circumstances any or all of these counsels might be; but he
          invites us in the sweetest tune of friendship, saying, |Come to me.|
          For a poor sinner this is the truest means of succour. Let him resort
          to the blessed Lord himself. To trust in a crucified Saviour is the
          way of salvation. Let him leave everything else and fly away to
          Christ, and look at his dear wounds as he hangs upon the cross. I am
          afraid many people are detained from Christ by becoming entangled in
          the meshes of doctrine. Some with heterodox doctrine, others with
          orthodox doctrine, content themselves. They think that they have
          advanced far enough They flatter their souls that they have
          ascertained the truth! But the fact is, it is not the truth as a
          letter which, saves anybody. It is the truth as a person -- it is
          Jesus Christ who is the way, the truth, and the life, whom we need to
          apprehend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our confidences must rest entirely upon him. |Come unto me,| saith
          Jesus; Come unto me, and I will give you rest.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The exhortation is in the present tense. |Come| now; do not wait; do
          not tarry; do not lie at the pool of ordinances but come unto me; come
          now at once, immediately, just where you are, just as you are.
          Wherever the summons finds you, rise without parley, without an
          instant's delay. |Come.| I know that the human mind is very ingenious,
          and it is especially perverse when its own destruction is threatened.
          By some means or other it will evade this simple call. |Surely,| says
          one, |there must be something to do besides that.| Nay, nothing else
          is to be done. No preliminaries are requisite. The whole way of
          salvation is to trust in Jesus. Trust him now. That done, you are
          saved. Rely upon his finished work. know that he has meditated on your
          behalf. Commit thy sinful self to his saving grace. A change of heart
          shall be yours. All that you need he will supply.
        </p>
        <p>|There is life in a look at the crucified One;</p>
        <p>There is life at this moment for thee.|</p>
        <p>
          So sweet an invitation demands a spontaneous acceptance. Come just as
          you are. |Come unto me,| saith Christ. He does not say, |Come when you
          have washed and cleansed yourself.| Rather should you come to be
          cleansed. He does not say, |Come when you have clothed yourself and
          made yourself beautiful with good works.| Come to be made beautiful in
          a better righteousness than you can wear. Come naked, and let him gird
          thee with fine linen, cover thee with silk, and deck thee with jewels.
          He does not say, |Come when your conscience is tender, come when your
          heart is penitent, when your soul is full of loathing for sin, and
          your mind is enlightened with knowledge and enlivened with joy. But ye
          that labour, ye that are heavy laden, he bids you to come as you are.
          Come oppressed with your burdens, begrimed with your labours,
          dispirited with your toils. If the load that bends you double to the
          earth be upon your shoulders? just come as you are. Take no plea in
          your mouth but this -- he bids you come. That shall suffice as a
          warrant for your coming, and a security for your welcome. If Jesus
          Christ bids you, who shall say you nay?
        </p>
        <p>
          He puts the matter very exclusively. |Come unto me, all ye that labour
          and are heavy laden.| Do nothing else but come to him. Do you want
          rest? Come to him for it. The old proverb hath it that betwixt two
          stools we come to the ground.| Certainly, if we trust partly in Christ
          and partly in ourselves, we shall fall lower than the ground. We shall
          sink into hell. |Come unto me| is the whole gospel. |Come unto me.|
          Mix nothing with it. Acknowledge no other obedience. Obey Christ, and
          him alone. Come unto me. You cannot go in two opposite directions. Let
          your tottering footsteps bend their way to him alone. Mix anything
          with him, and the possibility of your salvation is gone. Yours be the
          happy resolve: --
        </p>
        <p>|Nothing in my hands I bring:</p>
        <p>Simply to thy cross I cling.|</p>
        <p>
          This must be your cry if you are to be accepted at all. Come, then, ye
          that labour, ye horny-handed sons of toil. Come ye to Jesus. He
          invites you. Ye that stew and toil for wealth, ye merchants, with your
          many cares, labourers ye are. He bids you come. Ye students, anxious
          for knowledge, chary of sleep, burning out the midnight oil. Ye labour
          with exhausted brains; therefore, come. Come from struggling after
          fame. Ye pleasure -- seekers, come; perhaps there is no harder toil
          than the toil of the man who courts recreation and thinks he is taking
          his ease. Come, ye that labour in any form or fashion; come to Jesus
          -- to Jesus alone. And ye that are heavy laden; ye whose official
          duties are a burden; ye whose domestic cares are a burden; ye whose
          daily toils are a burden; ye whose shame and degradation are a burden,
          all ye that are heavy laden, come and welcome. If I attach no
          exclusive spiritual signification to these terms, it is because there
          is nothing in the chapter that would warrant such a restriction. Had
          Christ said, |Some of you that labour and are heavy laden may come,| I
          would have said |some| too. Howbeit he has not said |some,| but |all|
          |that labour and are heavy laden.| It is wonderful how people twist
          this text about. They alter the sense by misquoting the words. They
          say, |Come ye that are weary and heavy laden.| After this manner some
          have even intended to define a character rather than to describe
          condition, so they shut out some of those who labour from the kind
          invitation. But let the passage stand in its own simplicity. Let any
          sinner here, who can say, |I labour,| though he cannot say spiritually
          labour, come on the bare warrant of the word as he finds it written
          here; he will not be disappointed of the mercy promised. Christ will
          not reject him. Himself hath said it, |Him that cometh to me I will in
          no wise cast out.| And any man that is heavy laden, even though it may
          not be a spiritual burden that oppresses him, yet if he comes heavy
          laden to Christ, he certainly shall find relief. That were a wonder
          without precedent or parallel, such as was never witnessed on earth
          throughout all the generations of men, that a soul should come to
          Jesus, be rebuffed, and told by him, |I never called you, I never
          meant you; you are not the character; you may not come.| Hear, O
          heaven! witness, O earth! such thing was never heard of. No, nor ever
          shall it be heard of in time or in eternity. That any sinner should
          come to the Saviour by mistake is preposterous. That Jesus should say
          to him, |Go your way; I never called for you,| is incredible. How can
          ye thus libel the sinner's friend? Come, ye needy -- come, ye helpless
          -- come, ye simple -- come, ye penitent -- come, ye impenitent --
          come, ye who are the very vilest of the vile. If you do but come,
          Jesus Christ will receive you, welcome you, rejoice over you, and
          verify to you his thrice blessed promise, |Him that cometh to me, I
          will in no wise cast out.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now to the tug of war. It shall be my main endeavour to press the
          invitation upon you, my good friends, by the arguments which the
          Saviour used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kindly look at the text. Read the words for yourselves. Do you not see
          that the reason why you are solemnly bidden to come to Christ is
          because: --
        </p>
        <p>I. HE IS THE APPOINTED MEDIATOR.</p>
        <p>
          |All things are delivered unto me of my Father.| God, even the Father,
          your Creator, against whom you have transgressed, has appointed our
          Lord Jesus Christ to be the way of access for a sinner to himself. He
          is no amateur Saviour. He has not thrust himself into the place
          officiously. He is officially delegated. In times of distress, every
          man is at liberty to do his best for the public welfare; but the
          officer commissioned by his Sovereign is armed with a supreme right to
          give counsel or to exercise command. Away there in Bengal, if there
          are any dying of famine, and I have rice, I may distribute it of my
          own will at my own charge. But the commissioner of the district has a
          special warranty which I do not posses; he has a function to
          discharge; it is his business, his vocation; he is authorised by the
          Government, and responsible to the Government to do it. So the Lord
          Jesus Christ has not only a deep compassion of heart for the
          necessities of men, but he has God's authority to support him. The
          Father delivered all things into his hands, and appointed him to be a
          Saviour. All that Christ teaches has this superlative sanction. He
          teaches you nothing of his own conjecture. |What I have heard of the
          Father,| he saith, |that reveal I unto you.| The gospel is not a
          scheme of his suggestion. He reveals it fresh from the heart of God.
          Remember that the promises Christ makes are not merely his surmises,
          but they are promises with the stamp of the court of heaven upon them.
          Their truth is guaranteed by God. It is not possible they should fail.
          Sooner might heaven and earth pass away than one word of his fall flat
          to the ground. Your Saviour, O sinner -- your only Saviour -- is one
          whose teachings, whose invitations, and whose promises have the seal
          royal of the King of kings upon them. What more do you want? Moreover,
          the Father has given all things into his hands in the sense of
          government. Christ is king everywhere. God has appointed Christ to be
          a mediatorial prince over all of us -- I say over us all -- not merely
          over those who accept his sovereignty, but even over the ungodly. He
          hath given him power over all flesh, that he may give eternal life to
          as many as he has given him. It is of no use your rebelling against
          Christ, and saying, |We will not have him| -- the old cry, |We will
          not have this man to reign over us.| How read ye in the second Psalm
          |Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The
          kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel
          together against the Lord, and against his anointed. Yet have I set my
          King upon my holy hill of Zion. |Christ is supreme. You will have
          either to submit to his sceptre willingly, or else to be broken by his
          iron rod like a potter's vessel. Which shall it be? Thou must either
          bow or be broken; make your choice. You must bend or break. God help
          you wisely to resolve and gratefully relent. Has the Father appointed
          Christ to stand between him and his sinful creatures? Has he put the
          government upon his shoulders, and given him a name called Wonderful,
          Counsellor, the mighty, the everlasting King? Is he Emmanuel, God with
          us, in God's stead? With what reverence are we bound to receive him!
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, of mercy and
          goodness, are laid up in Christ. You recollect when Pharaoh had corn
          to sell in Egypt, what reply he made to all who applied to him, |Go to
          Joseph.| It would have been no use saying, |Go to Joseph,| if Joseph
          had not the keys of the garner; but he had, and there was no garner
          that could be opened in Egypt unless Joseph lent the key. In like
          manner, all the garners of mercy are under the lock and key of Jesus
          Christ, |who openeth, and no man shutteth; who shutteth, and no man
          openeth.| When you require any bounty or benefit of God, you must
          repair to Jesus for it. The Father has put all power into his hands.
          He has committed the entire work of mercy to his Son, that through him
          as the appointed mediator, all blessings should be dispensed to the
          praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in
          the beloved. |Now, sirs, do you want to be saved? I charge you to say
          whether you do or not; for if you care not for salvation, why should I
          labour among you? If you choose your own ruin, you need no counsel;
          you will make sure of it by your own neglect. But if you want
          salvation, Christ is the only authorized person in heaven and earth
          who can save you. |There is no other name, given among men whereby we
          must be saved.| The Father hath delivered all things into his keeping.
          He is the authorised Saviour. |Come unto me, then, |all ye that labour
          and are heavy laden.| This argument is further developed by another
          consideration: Christ is: --
        </p>
        <p>II. A WELL-FURNISHED MEDIATOR,</p>
        <p>
          |All things are delivered unto me,| he said, |of my Father. |Sum up
          all that the sinner wants, and you will find him able to supply you
          with all. You want pardon; it is delivered unto Christ of the Father.
          You want change of heart; it is delivered unto Christ of the Father.
          You want righteousness in which you may be accepted; Christ has it.
          You want to be purged from the love of sin; Christ can do it. You want
          wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. It is all in
          Christ. You are afraid that if you start on the road to heaven, you
          cannot hold on. Persevering grace is in Christ. You think you will
          never be perfect; but perfection is in Christ, for all believers,
          being saints of God and servants of Christ, are complete in him.
          Between hell-gate and heaven-gate there is nothing a sinner can need
          that is not treasured up in his blessed person. |It pleased the Father
          that in him should all fulness dwell.| He is |full of grace and
          truth.| Oh! sinner, I wish I could constrain you to feel as I do now,
          that had I never come to Christ before, I must come to him now, just
          now. Directly I understand that: --
        </p>
        <p>|Thou, O Christ, art all I want,</p>
        <p>More than all in thee I find.|</p>
        <p>
          Why, then, should I not come? Is it because I want something before I
          come? Make the question your own. Where are you going to seek it? All
          things are delivered unto Christ. To whom should you go for ought you
          crave? Is there another who can aid you when Christ is in possession
          of all? Do you want a tender conscience? Come to Christ for it. Do you
          want to feel the guilt of your sin? Come to Christ to be made
          sensitive to its shame. Are you just what you ought not to be? Come to
          Christ to be made what you ought to be, for everything is in Christ.
          Is there any, thing that can be obtained elsewhere and brought to him?
          The invitation to you is founded upon the explanation that accompanies
          it. |All things are delivered unto me of my Father|; therefore, Come
          unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
          rest.| The argument is so exclusive, that it only wants a willing mind
          to make it welcome. Only let God the Holy Spirit bless the word, and
          sinners will come to Christ, for unto him shall the gathering of the
          people be. Now note the next argument. Come to Christ, ye labouring
          ones, because: --
        </p>
        <p>III. HE IS AN INCONCEIVABLY GREAT MEDIATOR.</p>
        <p>
          Where do I get that? Why, from this -- that no man knows him but the
          Father. So great is he, so good, so full of all manner of precious
          store for needy sinners. No man knows him but the Father. He is too
          excellent for our puny understanding to estimate his worth. None but
          the infinite God can comprehend his value as a Saviour. Has anyone
          here been saying, |Christ cannot save me; I am such a big sinner|? You
          don't know him, my friend you don't know him. You are measuring him
          according to your little insignificant notions. High as the heavens
          are above the earth so high are his ways above your ways, and his
          thoughts than your thoughts. You don't know him, sinner, and no one
          does know him but his Father. Why, some of us who have been saved by
          him, thought when we saw the blessed mystery of his substitutionary
          sacrifice, that we knew all about him; but we have found that he grows
          upon our view the nearer we approach, and the more we contemplate him.
          Some of you have now been Christians for thirty or forty years, and
          you know much more of him than you used to do; but you do not know him
          yet; your eyes are dazzled by his brightness; you do not know him. And
          the happy spirits before the throne who have been there, some of them,
          three or four thousand years, have hardly begun to spell the first
          letter of his name. He is too grand and too good for them to
          comprehend. I believe that it will be, the growing wonder in eternity
          to find out how precious a Christ, how powerful, how immutable -- in a
          word, how divine a Christ he is. in whom we have trusted. Only the
          infinite can understand the infinite. |God only knows the love of
          God,|and only the Father understands the Son. Oh! I wish I had a week
          in which to talk on this, instead of a few minutes! You want a great
          Saviour? Well, here he is. Nobody can depict him, or describe him, or
          even imagine him, except the infinite God himself. Come, then, poor
          sinner, sunken up to your neck in crime, black as hell -- come unto
          him. Come, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and prove him to be
          your Saviour. The fact that no one knows how great a Saviour he is
          except his Father may encourage you. Now for another argument. Come to
          him because: --
        </p>
        <p>IV. HE IS AN INFINITELY WISE MEDIATOR.</p>
        <p>
          He is a mediator who understands both persons on whose behalf he
          mediates. He understands you. He has summed and reckoned you up, and
          he has made you out to be a heap sin and misery, and nothing else. The
          glory of it is that he understands God, whom you have offended, for it
          is written, |Neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son,| and he
          knows the Father. Oh! what a mercy that is to have one to go before
          God for me who knows him intimately. He knows his Father's will; he
          knows his Father's wrath. No man knows it but himself. He has suffered
          it. He knows his Father's love. He alone can feel it -- such love as
          God felt for sinners. He knows how his Father's wrath has been turned
          away by his precious blood; he knows the Father as a Judge whose anger
          no longer burns against those for whom the Atonement has been made. He
          knows the Father's heart. He knows the Father's secret purposes. He
          knows the Father's will is that whosoever seeth the Son and believeth
          on him shall have everlasting life. He knows the decrees of God, and
          yet he says, |Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and
          I will give, you rest.| There is nothing in that contrary to the
          decrees of God; for Jesus knows what the decrees are, and he would not
          speak in contradiction to them. He knows God's requirements. Sinner,
          whatever it is God requires of you, Christ knows what they are, and he
          is ready to meet them. |The law is holy, and just, and good,| and
          Jesus knows it, for the, law is in his heart. Justice is very stern,
          and Jesus knows it, for Jesus has felt the edge of the sword of
          justice, and knows all about it. He is fully equipped for the
          discharge of his mediatorial office, and those that put their trust in
          him shall find that he will bear them through. Often, when a prisoner
          at the bar has a barrister who understands his work, and is perfectly
          competent for the defense, his friends say to him, |Your case is safe,
          for if there is a man in England who can get you through, it is that
          man.| But my Master is an advocate who never lost a case. He has a
          plea at the throne of God that never failed yet. Give him -- oh! give
          him your cause to plead, nor doubt the Father's grace. Poor sinner, he
          is so wise an advocate that you may well come to him, and he will give
          you rest. But I must not weary you, although there is a fulness of
          matter on which I might enlarge. With one other argument I conclude:
          --
        </p>
        <p>V. HE IS AN INDISPENSABLE MEDIATOR.</p>
        <p>
          The only mediator, so the text says. |Neither knoweth any man the
          Father, save the Son.| Christ knows the Father; no one else knows him,
          save the Son. There is none other that can approach unto God. It is
          Christ for your Saviour, or no Saviour at all. Salvation is in no
          other; and if you will not have Christ, neither can you have
          salvation. Observe how that is. It is certain that no man knows God
          except Christ. It is equally certain that no man can come, to God
          except by Christ. He says it peremptorily; |No man cometh to the
          Father but by me.| Not less certain is it that no man can please the
          Father except through Christ, for |without faith it is impossible to
          please him.| No faith is worth having except the grace that is founded
          and based upon the Lord Jesus Christ, and him only. Oh! then, souls,
          since you are shut up to it by a blessed necessity, say at once, |I
          will to the gracious Prince approach, and take Jesus to be my all in
          all. |If I might hope you would do this early, I could go back to my
          home and retire to my bed, praising God for the work that was done,
          and the result that was achieved. Let us reiterate again and again the
          gospel we have to declare, the very essence of the gospel it is which
          we proclaim. Trust your souls with Jesus, and your souls are saved. He
          suffered in the room, and place, and stead of all that trust him. If
          you rely upon him by an act of simple faith, the simplest act in all
          the world, immediately you so rely you are forgiven, your
          transgressions are blotted out for his name's sake. He stands in
          spirit among us at this good hour, and says, |Come unto me, all ye
          that labour and are heavy laden|; and he gives you these arguments,
          which ought to convince you. I pray they may. He is an authorized
          Saviour, and a well-furnished Saviour. He is the friend of God, and
          the friend of man. God grant you may accept him, and find the boon
          which he alone can bestow. Amen.
