          1. But we do now receive a certain portion of His Spirit, tending
          towards perfection, and preparing us for incorruption, being little by
          little accustomed to receive and bear God; which also the apostle
          terms "an earnest," that is, a part of the honour which has been
          promised us by God, where he says in the Epistle to the Ephesians, "In
          which ye also, having heard the word of truth, the Gospel of your
          salvation, believing in which we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit
          of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance." This earnest,
          therefore, thus dwelling in us, renders us spiritual even now, and the
          mortal is swallowed up by immortality. "For ye," he declares, "are not
          in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell
          in you." This, however does not take place by a casting away of the
          flesh, but by the impartation of the Spirit. For those to whom he was
          writing were not without flesh, but they were those who had received
          the Spirit of God, "by which we cry, Abba, Father." If therefore, at
          the present time, having the earnest, we do cry, "Abba, Father," what
          shall it be when, on rising again, we behold Him face to face; when
          all the members shall burst out into a continuous hymn of triumph,
          glorifying Him who raised them from the dead, and gave the gift of
          eternal life? For if the earnest, gathering man into itself, does even
          now cause him to cry, "Abba, Father," what shall the complete grace of
          the Spirit effect, which shall be given to men by God? It will render
          us like unto Him, and accomplish the will of the Father; for it shall
          make man after the image and likeness of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Those persons, then, who possess the earnest of the Spirit, and who
          are not enslaved by the lusts of the flesh, but are subject to the
          Spirit, and who in all things walk according to the light of reason,
          does the apostle properly term "spiritual," because the Spirit of God
          dwells in them. Now, spiritual men shall not be incorporeal spirits;
          but our substance, that is, the union of flesh and spirit, receiving
          the Spirit of God, makes up the spiritual man. But those who do indeed
          reject the Spirit's counsel, and are the slaves of fleshly lusts, and
          lead lives contrary to reason, and who, without restraint, plunge
          headlong into their own desires, having no longing after the Divine
          Spirit, do live after the manner of swine and of dogs; these men, [I
          say], does the apostle very properly term "carnal," because they have
          no thought of anything else except carnal things.

          3. For the same reason, too, do the prophets compare them to
          irrational animals, on account of the irrationality of their conduct,
          saying, "They have become as horses raging for the females; each one
          of them neighing after his neighbour's wife." And again, "Man, when he
          was in honour, was made like unto cattle." This denotes that, for his
          own fault, he is likened to cattle, by rivalling their irrational
          life. And we also, as the custom is, do designate men of this stamp as
          cattle and irrational beasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Now the law has figuratively predicted all these, delineating man
          by the [various] animals: whatsoever of these, says [the Scripture],
          have a double hoof and ruminate, it proclaims as clean; but whatsoever
          of them do not possess one or other of these [properties], it sets
          aside by themselves as unclean. Who then are the clean? Those who make
          their way by faith steadily towards the Father and the Son; for this
          is denoted by the steadiness of those which divide the hoof; and they
          meditate day and night upon the words of God, that they may be adorned
          with good works: for this is the meaning of the ruminants. The
          unclean, however, are those which do neither divide the hoof nor
          ruminate; that is, those persons who have neither faith in God, nor do
          meditate on His words: and such is the abomination of the Gentiles.
          But as to those animals which do indeed chew the cud, but have not the
          double hoof, and are themselves unclean, we have in them a figurative
          description of the Jews, who certainly have the words of God in their
          mouth, but who do not fix their rooted stedfastness in the Father and
          in the Son; wherefore they are an unstable generation. For those
          animals which have the hoof all in one piece easily slip; but those
          which have it divided are more sure-footed, their cleft hoofs
          succeeding each other as they advance, and the one hoof supporting the
          other. In like manner, too, those are unclean which have the double
          hoof but do not ruminate: this is plainly an indication of all
          heretics, and of those who do not meditate on the words of God,
          neither are adorned with works of righteousness; to whom also the Lord
          says, "Why call ye Me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say to
          you?" For men of this stamp do indeed say that they believe in the
          Father and the Son, but they never meditate as they should upon the
          things of God, neither are they adorned with works of righteousness;
          but, as I have already observed, they have adopted the lives of swine
          and of dogs, giving themselves over to filthiness, to gluttony, and
          recklessness of all sorts. Justly, therefore, did the apostle call all
          such "carnal" and "animal," -- [all those, namely], who through their
          own unbelief and luxury do not receive the Divine Spirit, and in their
          various phases cast out from themselves the life-giving Word, and walk
          stupidly after their own lusts: the prophets, too, spake of them as
          beasts of burden and wild beasts; custom likewise has viewed them in
          the light of cattle and irrational creatures; and the law has
          pronounced them unclean.<br />
