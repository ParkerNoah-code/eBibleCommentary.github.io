              GENERAL REMARKS. Here we have one of the loftiest and longest
              sustained flights of the inspired muse. The psalm gives an
              interpretation to the many voices of nature, and sings sweetly
              both of <i> creation </i>and <i>providence</i>. The poem contains
              a complete cosmos sea and land, cloud and sunlight, plant and
              animal, light and darkness, life and death—are all proved to be
              expressive of the presence of the Lord.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              Traces of the six days of creation are very evident, and though
              the creation of man, which was the crowning work of the sixth day,
              is not mentioned, this is accounted for from the fact that man is
              himself the singer.

              Some have ever, discerned marks of the divine rest upon the
              seventh day in 31. It is a poet's version of Genesis. Nor is it
              alone the present condition of the earth which is here the subject
              of song; but a hint is given of those holier times when we shall
              see "a new earth wherein dwells righteousness," out of which the
              sinner shall be consumed, 35.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              The spirit of ardent praise to God runs through the whole, and
              with it a distinct realization of the divine Being as a personal
              existence, loved and trusted as well as adored.

              We have no information as to the author—but the Septuagint assigns
              it to David, and we see no reason for ascribing it to any one
              else. His spirit, style, and manner of writing are very manifest
              therein, and if the psalm must be ascribed to another, it must be
              to a mind remarkably similar, and we could only suggest the wise
              son of David—Solomon, the poet preacher, to whose notes upon
              natural history in the Proverbs some of the verses bear a striking
              likeness. Whoever the human penman may have been, the exceeding
              glory and perfection of the Holy Spirit's own divine authorship
              are plain to every spiritual mind.

              DIVISION. After ascribing blessedness to the Lord the devout
              psalmist sings of the light and the firmament, which were the work
              of the first and second days 1-6.

            <p align="justify">
              By an easy transition he describes the separation of the waters
              from the dry land, the formation of rain, brooks and rivers, and
              the uprising of green herbs, which were the produce of the third
              day 7-18.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              Then the appointment of the sun and moon to be the guardians of
              day and night commands the poet's admiration 19-23, and so he
              sings the work of the fourth day.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              Having already alluded to many varieties of living creatures, the
              psalmist proceeds from 24-30 to sing of the life with which the
              Lord was pleased to fill the air, the sea, and the land; these
              forms of existence were the peculiar produce of the fifth and
              sixth days.

              We may regard the closing verses 31-35 as a Sabbath meditation,
              hymn, and prayer. The whole lies before us as<i>

            <p align="justify">
              This psalm begins and ends like the Hundred and Third, and it
              could not do better—when the model is perfect it deserves to exist
              in duplicate.<i> True praise begins at home.</i> It is idle to
              stir up others to praise if we are ungratefully silent ourselves.
              We should call upon our inmost hearts to awake and bestir
              themselves, for we are apt to be sluggish, and if we are so when
              called upon to bless God, we shall have great cause to be ashamed.

            <p align="justify">
              This ascription has in it a remarkable blending of the boldness of
              faith, and the awe of holy fear: for the psalmist calls the
              infinite Jehovah "my God," and at the same time, prostrate in
              amazement at the divine greatness, he cries out in utter
              astonishment, "You are very great."
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              God was great on Sinai—yet the opening words of his law were, "I
              am the Lord your God;" his greatness is no reason why faith should
              not put in her claim, and call him all her own. The declaration of
              Jehovah's greatness here given would have been very much in place
              at the end of the psalm, for it is a natural inference and
              deduction from a survey of the universe. Its position at the very
              commencement of the poem is an indication that the whole psalm was
              well considered and digested in the mind before it was actually
              put into words; only on this supposition can we account for the
              emotion preceding the contemplation.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              Observe also, that the wonder expressed does not refer to the
              creation and its greatness—but to Jehovah himself. It is not "the
              <i> universe </i>is very great!" but "<i>YOU </i>are very great."
              Many stay at the creature, and so become idolatrous in spirit; to
              pass onward to the Creator himself is true wisdom.

            <p align="justify">
              You yourself are not to be seen—but your works, which may be
              called your garments, are full of beauties and marvels which
              redound to your honor. Garments both <i>conceal </i>and
              <i>reveal </i>a man, and so do the creatures of God. The Lord is
              seen in his works as worthy of honor for his skill, his goodness,
              and his power, and as claiming majesty, for he has fashioned all
              things in sovereignty, doing as he wills, and asking no man's
              permit. He must be blind indeed, who does not see that nature is
              the work of a king. These are solemn strokes of God's severer
              mind, terrible touches of his sterner attributes, broad lines of
              inscrutable mystery, and deep shadings of overwhelming power. And
              these make creation's picture a problem never to be solved, except
              by admitting that he who drew it gives no account of his
              matters—but rules all things according to the good pleasure of his
              will. His majesty is, however, always so displayed as to reflect
              honor upon his whole character; he does as lie wills—but he wills
              only that which is thrice holy, like himself. The very robes of
              the unseen Spirit teach us this, and it is ours to recognize it
              with humble adoration.

              itself is but his garment and veil, what must be the blazing
              splendor of his own essential being! We are lost in astonishment,

              insufferable glory.

              other in this verse. Oriental princes put on their glorious
              apparel and then sit in state within curtains, and the Lord is
              spoken of under that image. But how far above all comprehension
              the figure must be lifted, since the robe is essential light, to
              which suns and moons owe their brightness, and the curtain is the
              azure sky studded with stars for gems. This is a substantial
              argument for the truth with which the psalmist commenced his song,

              element, to be his minister flaming forth upon his errands. That
              the passage refers to angels is clear from Hebrews 1:7; and it was
              most proper to mention them here in connection with light and the

              this reverently will fill us with adoration; to conceive of it
              grossly and carnally would be highly blasphemous.

              This is the poetic interpretation of a roar. To whom do the lions
              roar? Certainly not to their prey, for the terrible sound tends to
              alarm their victims, and drive them away. They after their own
              fashion express their desires for food, and
              <i>the expression of desire is a kind of prayer</i>. Out of this

              But neither with lions nor men will the seeking of

              too, and the lions are well aware of it. What they have in their
              own language asked for they go forth to seek; being in this thing
              far wiser than many men who offer <i>formal prayers </i>not half
              so earnest as those of the young lions, and then
              <i>neglect the means </i>in the use of which the object of their
              petitions might be gained. The lions roar and seek; too many are

              sorrow we have called "the voice of our roaring" Psalm 22:10, will
              be understood by him, and interpreted in our favor. Evidently he
