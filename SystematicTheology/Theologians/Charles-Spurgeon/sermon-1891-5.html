          1. Such, then, is the account they give of what took place within the
          Pleroma; such the calamities that flowed from the passion which seized
          upon the Æon who has been named, and who was within a little of
          perishing by being absorbed in the universal substance, through her
          inquisitive searching after the Father; such the consolidation [of
          that Æon] from her condition of agony by Horos, and Stauros, and
          Lytrotes, and Carpistes, and Horothetes, and Metagoges. Such also is
          the account of the generation of the later Æons, namely of the first
          Christ and of the Holy Spirit, both of whom were produced by the
          Father after the repentance [of Sophia], and of the second Christ
          (whom they also style Saviour), who owed his being to the joint
          contributions [of the Æons]. They tell us, however, that this
          knowledge has not been openly divulged, because all are not capable of
          receiving it, but has been mystically revealed by the Saviour through
          means of parables to those qualified for understanding it. This has
          been done as follows. The thirty Æons are indicated (as we have
          already remarked) by the thirty years during which they say the
          Saviour performed no public act, and by the parable of the labourers
          in the vineyard. Paul also, they affirm, very clearly and frequently
          names these Æons, and even goes so far as to preserve their order,
          when he says, "To all the generations of the Æons of the Æon." Nay, we
          ourselves, when at the giving of thanks we pronounce the words, "To
          Æons of Æons" (for ever and ever), do set forth these Æons. And, in
          fine, wherever the words Æon or Æons occur, they at once refer them to
          these beings.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The production, again, of the Duodecad of the Æons, is indicated by
          the fact that the Lord was twelve years of age when He disputed with
          the teachers of the law, and by the election of the apostles, for of
          these there were twelve. The other eighteen Æons are made manifest in
          this way: that the Lord, [according to them,] conversed with His
          disciples for eighteen months after His resurrection from the dead.
          They also affirm that these eighteen Æons are strikingly indicated by
          the first two letters of His name ['Iesous], namely Iota and Eta. And,
          in like manner, they assert that the ten Æons are pointed out by the
          letter Iota, which begins His name; while, for the same reason, they
          tell us the Saviour said, "One Iota, or one tittle, shall by no means
          pass away until all be fulfilled."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. They further maintain that the passion which took place in the case
          of the twelfth Æon is pointed at by the apostasy of Judas, who was the
          twelfth apostle, and also by the fact that Christ suffered in the
          twelfth month. For their opinion is, that He continued to preach for
          one year only after His baptism. The same thing is also most clearly
          indicated by the case of the woman who suffered from an issue of
          blood. For after she had been thus afflicted during twelve years, she
          was healed by the advent of the Saviour, when she had touched the
          border of His garment; and on this account the Saviour said, "Who
          touched me?" -- teaching his disciples the mystery which had occurred
          among the Æons, and the healing of that Æon who had been involved in
          suffering. For she who had been afflicted twelve years represented
          that power whose essence, as they narrate, was stretching itself
          forth, and flowing into immensity; and unless she had touched the
          garment of the Son, that is, Aletheia of the first Tetrad, who is
          denoted by the hem spoken of, she would have been dissolved into the
          general essence [of which she participated]. She stopped short,
          however, and ceased any longer to suffer. For the power that went
          forth from the Son (and this power they term Horos) healed her, and
          separated the passion from her.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. They moreover affirm that the Saviour is shown to be derived from
          all the Æons, and to be in Himself everything by the following
          passage: "Every male that openeth the womb." For He, being everything,
          opened the womb of the enthymesis of the suffering Æon, when it had
          been expelled from the Pleroma. This they also style the second
          Ogdoad, of which we shall speak presently. And they state that it was
          clearly on this account that Paul said, "And He Himself is all
          things;" and again, "All things are to Him, and of Him are all
          things;" and further, "In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the
          Godhead;" and yet again, "All things are gathered together by God in
          Christ." Thus do they interpret these and any like passages to be
          found in Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. They show, further, that that Horos of theirs, whom they call by a
          variety of names, has two faculties, -- the one of supporting, and the
          other of separating; and in so far as he supports and sustains, he is
          Stauros, while in so far as he divides and separates, he is Horos.
          They then represent the Saviour as having indicated this twofold
          faculty: first, the sustaining power, when He said, "Whosoever doth
          not bear his cross (Stauros), and follow after me, cannot be my
          disciple;" and again, "Taking up the cross, follow me;" but the
          separating power when He said, "I came not to send peace, but a
          sword." They also maintain that John indicated the same thing when he
          said, "The fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge the floor,
          and will gather the wheat into His garner; but the chaff He will burn
          with fire unquenchable." By this declaration He set forth the faculty
          of Horos. For that fan they explain to be the cross (Stauros), which
          consumes, no doubt, all material objects, as fire does chaff, but it
          purifies all them that are saved, as a fan does wheat. Moreover, they
          affirm that the Apostle Paul himself made mention of this cross in the
          following words: "The doctrine of the cross is to them that perish
          foolishness, but to us who are saved it is the power of God." And
          again: "God forbid that I should glory in anything save in the cross
          of Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I unto the
          world."
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Such, then, is the account which they all give of their Pleroma,
          and of the formation of the universe, striving, as they do, to adapt
          the good words of revelation to their own wicked inventions. And it is
          not only from the writings of the evangelists and the apostles that
          they endeavour to derive proofs for their opinions by means of
          perverse interpretations and deceitful expositions: they deal in the
          same way with the law and the prophets, which contain many parables
          and allegories that can frequently be drawn into various senses,
          according to the kind of exegesis to which they are subjected. And
          others of them, with great craftiness, adapted such parts of Scripture
          to their own figments, lead away captive from the truth those who do
          not retain a stedfast faith in one God, the Father Almighty, and in
          one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.<br />
