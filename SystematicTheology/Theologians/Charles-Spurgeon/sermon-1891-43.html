          1. That God is the Creator of the world is accepted even by those very
          persons who in many ways speak against Him, and yet acknowledge Him,
          styling Him the Creator, and an angel, not to mention that all the
          Scriptures call out [to the same effect], and the Lord teaches us of
          this Father who is in heaven, and no other, as I shall show in the
          sequel of this work. For the present, however, that proof which is
          derived from those who allege doctrines opposite to ours, is of itself
          sufficient, -- all men, in fact, consenting to this truth: the
          ancients on their part preserving with special care, from the
          tradition of the first-formed man, this persuasion, while they
          celebrate the praises of one God, the Maker of heaven and earth;
          others, again, after them, being reminded of this fact by the prophets
          of God, while the very heathen learned it from creation itself. For
          even creation reveals Him who formed it, and the very work made
          suggests Him who made it, and the world manifests Him who ordered it.
          The Universal Church, moreover, through the whole world, has received
          this tradition from the apostles.

          2. This God, then, being acknowledged, as I have said, and receiving
          testimony from all to the fact of His existence, that Father whom they
          conjure into existence is beyond doubt untenable, and has no witnesses
          [to his existence]. Simon Magus was the first who said that he himself
          was God over all, and that the world was formed by his angels. Then
          those who succeeded him, as I have shown in the first book, by their
          several opinions, still further depraved [his teaching] through their
          impious and irreligious doctrines against the Creator. These [heretics
          now referred to], being the disciples of those mentioned, render such
          as assent to them worse than the heathen. For the former "serve the
          creature rather than the Creator," and "those which are not gods,"
          notwithstanding that they ascribe the first place in Deity to that God
          who was the Maker of this universe. But the latter maintain that He,
          [i.e., the Creator of this world,] is the fruit of a defect, and
          describe Him as being of an animal nature, and as not knowing that
          Power which is above Him, while He also exclaims, "I am God, and
          besides Me there is no other God." Affirming that He lies, they are
          themselves liars, attributing all sorts of wickedness to Him; and
          conceiving of one who is not above this Being as really having an
          existence, they are thus convicted by their own views of blasphemy
          against that God who really exists, while they conjure into existence
          a god who has no existence, to their own condemnation. And thus those
          who declare themselves "perfect," and as being possessed of the
          knowledge of all things, are found to be worse than the heathen, and
          to entertain more blasphemous opinions even against their own
          Creator.<br />
