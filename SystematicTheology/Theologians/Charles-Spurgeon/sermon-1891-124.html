          1. As I have heard from a certain presbyter, who had heard it from
          those who had seen the apostles, and from those who had been their
          disciples, the punishment [declared] in Scripture was sufficient for
          the ancients in regard to what they did without the Spirit's guidance.
          For as God is no respecter of persons, He inflicted a proper
          punishment on deeds displeasing to Him. As in the case of David, when
          he suffered persecution from Saul for righteousness' sake, and fled
          from King Saul, and would not avenge himself of his enemy, he both
          sung the advent of Christ, and instructed the nations in wisdom, and
          did everything after the Spirit's guidance, and pleased God. But when
          his lust prompted him to take Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, the
          Scripture said concerning him, |Now, the thing (sermo) which David had
          done appeared wicked in the eyes of the Lord;| and Nathan the prophet
          is sent to him, pointing out to him his crime, in order that he,
          passing sentence upon and condemning himself, might obtain mercy and
          forgiveness from Christ: |And [Nathan] said to him, There were two men
          in one city; the one rich, and the other poor. The rich man had
          exceeding many flocks and herds; but the poor man had nothing, save
          one little ewe-lamb, which he possessed, and nourished up; and it had
          been with him and with his children together: it did eat of his own
          bread, and drank of his cup, and was to him as a daughter. And there
          came a guest unto the rich man; and he spared to take of the flock of
          his own ewe-lambs, and from the herds of his own oxen, to entertain
          the guest; but he took the ewe-lamb of the poor man, and set it before
          the man that had come unto him. And David's anger was greatly kindled
          against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the Lord liveth, the man
          that hath done this thing shall surely die (filius mortis est): and he
          shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he hath done this thing, and
          because he had no pity for the poor man. And Nathan said unto him,
          Thou art the man who hast done this.| And then he proceeds with the
          rest [of the narrative], upbraiding him, and recounting God's benefits
          towards him, and [showing him] how much his conduct had displeased the
          Lord. For [he declared] that works of this nature were not pleasing to
          God, but that great wrath was suspended over his house. David,
          however, was struck with remorse on hearing this, and exclaimed, |I
          have sinned against the Lord;| and he sung a penitential psalm,
          waiting for the coming of the Lord, who washes and makes clean the man
          who had been fast bound with [the chain of] sin. In like manner it was
          with regard to Solomon, while he continued to judge uprightly, and to
          declare the wisdom of God, and built the temple as the type of truth,
          and set forth the glories of God, and announced the peace about to
          come upon the nations, and prefigured the kingdom of Christ, and spake
          three thousand parables about the Lord's advent, and five thousand
          songs, singing praise to God, and expounded the wisdom of God in
          creation, [discoursing] as to the nature of every tree, every herb,
          and of all fowls, quadrupeds, and fishes; and he said, |Will God whom
          the heavens cannot contain, really dwell with men upon the earth?| And
          he pleased God, and was the admiration of all; and all kings of the
          earth sought an interview with him (qu√¶rebant faciem ejus) that they
          might hear the wisdom which God had conferred upon him. The queen of
          the south, too, came to him from the ends of the earth, to ascertain
          the wisdom that was in him: she whom the Lord also referred to as one
          who should rise up in the judgment with the nations of those men who
          do hear His words, and do not believe in Him, and should condemn them,
          inasmuch as she submitted herself to the wisdom announced by the
          servant of God, while these men despised that wisdom which proceeded
          directly from the Son of God. For Solomon was a servant, but Christ is
          indeed the Son of God, and the Lord of Solomon. While, therefore, he
          served God without blame, and ministered to His dispensations, then
          was he glorified: but when he took wives from all nations, and
          permitted them to set up idols in Israel, the Scripture spake thus
          concerning him: |And King Solomon was a lover of women, and he took to
          himself foreign women; and it came to pass, when Solomon was old, his
          heart was not perfect with the Lord his God. And the foreign women
          turned away his heart after strange gods. And Solomon did evil in the
          sight of the Lord: he did not walk after the Lord, as did David his
          father. And the Lord was angry with Solomon; for his heart was not
          perfect with the Lord, as was the heart of David his father.| The
          Scripture has thus sufficiently reproved him, as the presbyter
          remarked, in order that no flesh may glory in the sight of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It was for this reason, too, that the Lord descended into the
          regions beneath the earth, preaching His advent there also, and
          [declaring] the remission of sins received by those who believe in
          Him. Now all those believed in Him who had hope towards Him, that is,
          those who proclaimed His advent, and submitted to His dispensations,
          the righteous men, the prophets, and the patriarchs, to whom He
          remitted sins in the same way as He did to us, which sins we should
          not lay to their charge, if we would not despise the grace of God. For
          as these men did not impute unto us (the Gentiles) our transgressions,
          which we wrought before Christ was manifested among us, so also it is
          not right that we should lay blame upon those who sinned before
          Christ's coming. For |all men come short of the glory of God,| and are
          not justified of themselves, but by the advent of the Lord, -- they
          who earnestly direct their eyes towards His light. And it is for our
          instruction that their actions have been committed to writing, that we
          might know, in the first place, that our God and theirs is one, and
          that sins do not please Him although committed by men of renown; and
          in the second place, that we should keep from wickedness. For if these
          men of old time, who preceded us in the gifts [bestowed upon them],
          and for whom the Son of God had not yet suffered, when they committed
          any sin and served fleshly lusts, were rendered objects of such
          disgrace, what shall the men of the present day suffer, who have
          despised the Lord's coming, and become the slaves of their own lusts?
          And truly the death of the Lord became [the means of] healing and
          remission of sins to the former, but Christ shall not die again in
          behalf of those who now commit sin, for death shall no more have
          dominion over Him; but the Son shall come in the glory of the Father,
          requiring from His stewards and dispensers the money which He had
          entrusted to them, with usury; and from those to whom He had given
          most shall He demand most. We ought not, therefore, as that presbyter
          remarks, to be puffed up, nor be severe upon those of old time, but
          ought ourselves to fear, lest perchance, after [we have come to] the
          knowledge of Christ, if we do things displeasing to God, we obtain no
          further forgiveness of sins, but be shut out from His kingdom. And
          therefore it was that Paul said, |For if [God] spared not the natural
          branches, [take heed] lest He also spare not thee, who, when thou wert
          a wild olive tree, wert grafted into the fatness of the olive tree,
          and wert made a partaker of its fatness.|
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Thou wilt notice, too, that the transgressions of the common people
          have been described in like manner, not for the sake of those who did
          then transgress, but as a means of instruction unto us, and that we
          should understand that it is one and the same God against whom these
          men sinned, and against whom certain persons do now transgress from
          among those who profess to have believed in Him. But this also, [as
          the presbyter states,] has Paul declared most plainly in the Epistle
          to the Corinthians, when he says, |Brethren, I would not that ye
          should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and
          were all baptized unto Moses in the sea, and did all eat the same
          spiritual meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they
          drank of that spiritual rock that followed them; and the rock was
          Christ. But with many of them God was not well pleased, for they were
          overthrown in the wilderness. These things were for our example (in
          figuram nostri), to the intent that we should not lust after evil
          things, as they also lusted; neither be ye idolaters, as were some of
          them, as it is written: The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose
          up to play. Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them also
          did, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. Neither let us
          tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of
          serpents. Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and were
          destroyed of the destroyer. But all these things happened to them in a
          figure, and were written for our admonition, upon whom the end of the
          world (s√¶culorum) is come. Wherefore let him that thinketh he
          standeth, take heed lest he fall.|
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Since therefore, beyond all doubt and contradiction, the apostle
          shows that there is one and the same God, who did both enter into
          judgment with these former things, and who does inquire into those of
          the present time, and points out why these things have been committed
          to writing; all these men are found to be unlearned and presumptuous,
          nay, even destitute of common sense, who, because of the
          transgressions of them of old time, and because of the disobedience of
          a vast number of them, do allege that there was indeed one God of
          these men, and that He was the maker of the world, and existed in a
          state of degeneracy; but that there was another Father declared by
          Christ, and that this Being is He who has been conceived by the mind
          of each of them; not understanding that as, in the former case, God
          showed Himself not well pleased in many instances towards those who
          sinned, so also in the latter, |many are called, but few are chosen.|
          As then the unrighteous, the idolaters, and fornicators perished, so
          also is it now: for both the Lord declares, that such persons are sent
          into eternal fire; and the apostle says, |Know ye not that the
          unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived:
          neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, not effeminate,
          nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor
          drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom
          of God.| And as it was not to those who are without that he said these
          things, but to us, lest we should be cast forth from the kingdom of
          God, by doing any such thing, he proceeds to say, |And such indeed
          were ye; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified in the name of the
          Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God.| And just as then,
          those who led vicious lives, and put other people astray, were
          condemned and cast out, so also even now the offending eye is plucked
          out, and the foot and the hand, lest the rest of the body perish in
          like manner. And we have the precept: |If any man that is called a
          brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or
          a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such an one go not to eat.| And
          again does the apostle say, |Let no man deceive you with vain words;
          for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of
          mistrust. Be not ye therefore partakers with them.| And as then the
          condemnation of sinners extended to others who approved of them, and
          joined in their society; so also is it the case at present, that |a
          little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.| And as the wrath of God did
          then descend upon the unrighteous, here also does the apostle likewise
          say: |For the wrath of God shall be revealed from heaven against all
          ungodliness and unrighteousness of those men who hold back the truth
          in unrighteousness.| And as, in those times, vengeance came from God
          upon the Egyptians who were subjecting Israel to unjust punishment, so
          is it now, the Lord truly declaring, |And shall not God avenge His own
          elect, which cry day and night unto Him? I tell you, that He will
          avenge them speedily.| So says the apostle, in like manner, in the
          Epistle to the Thessalonians: |Seeing it is a righteous thing with God
          to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; and to you who are
          troubled rest with us, at the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ from
          heaven with His mighty angels, and in a flame of fire, to take
          vengeance upon those who know not God, and upon those that obey not
          the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall also be punished with
          everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the
          glory of His power; when He shall come to be glorified in His saints,
          and to be admired in all them who have believed in Him.| <br />
