          TITLE. This admirable ode is simply headed, "To the Chief Musician, by
          David." The dedication to the Chief Musician stands at the head of
          fifty-three of the Psalms, and clearly indicates that such psalms were
          intended, not merely for the private use of believers, but to be sung
          in the great assemblies by the appointed choir at whose head was the
          overseer, or superintendent, called in our version, "the Chief
          Musician," and by Ainsworth, "the Master of the Music."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Several of these psalms have little or no praise in them, and were not
          addressed directly to the Most High, and yet were to be sung in public
          worship; which is a clear indication that the theory of Augustine
          lately revived by certain hymn-book makers, that nothing but praise
          should be sung, is far more plausible than scriptural.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Not only did the ancient Church chant hallowed doctrine and offer
          prayer amid her spiritual songs, but even the wailing notes of
          complaint were put into her mouth by the sweet singer of Israel who
          was inspired of God. Some people grasp at any nicety which has a gloss
          of apparent correctness upon it, and are pleased with being more
          fancifully precise than others. Nevertheless it will ever be the way
          of plain men, not only to magnify the Lord in sacred canticles, but
          also, according to Paul's precept, to teach and <i>admonish </i>one
          another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in
          their hearts unto the Lord.

          As no distinguishing title is given to this Psalm, we would suggest as
          an assistance to the memory, the heading—CONCERNING PRACTICAL ATHEISM.
          The many conjectures as to the occasion upon which it was written are
          so completely without foundation, that it would be a waste of time to
          mention them. The apostle Paul, in Romans 3, has shown incidentally
          that the drift of the inspired writer is to show that both Jews and
          Gentiles are all under sin; there was, therefore, no reason for fixing
          upon any particular historical occasion, when<i>
            all of history reeks with terrible evidence of human corruption</i
          >.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          With instructive alterations, David has given us in Psalm 53 a second
          edition of this humiliating psalm, being moved of the Holy Spirit thus
          doubly to declare a truth which is ever distasteful to carnal minds.

        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. "The fool."</p></b> The Atheist is
        <i>the </i>fool pre-eminently, and <i>a</i> fool universally. He would
        not deny God if he were not a fool by nature, and
        <i
          >having denied God it is no marvel that he becomes a fool in
          practice</i
        >. Sin is always folly, and as it is the height of sin to attack the
        very existence of the Most High, so it is also the greatest imaginable
        folly. To say there is no God is to belie the plainest evidence, which
        is <i>obstinacy</i>.
        <p align="justify">
          To oppose the common consent of mankind, which is <i> stupidity</i>.
          <br />
          To stifle consciousness, which is <i>madness</i>.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If the sinner could by his atheism destroy the God whom he hates there
          were some sense, although much wickedness, in his infidelity. But as
          denying the existence of fire does not prevent its burning a man who
          is in it, so doubting the existence of God will not stop the Judge of
          all the earth from destroying the rebel who breaks his laws. Nay, this
          atheism is a crime which much provokes Heaven, and will bring down
          terrible vengeance on the fool who indulges it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The proverb says, "A fool's tongue cuts his own throat!" and in this
          instance it kills both soul and body forever. Would to God the
          mischief stopped even there, but alas!
          <i
            >One fool makes hundreds, and a noisy blasphemer spreads his
            horrible doctrines as lepers spread the plague</i
          >.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Ainsworth, in his "Annotations," tells us that the word here used is
          <i>Nabal</i>, which has the signification of fading, dying, or falling
          away, as a withered leaf or flower. It is a title given to the foolish
          man as having lost the juice and sap of wisdom, reason, honesty, and
          godliness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Trapp hits the mark when he calls him "that sapless fellow, that
          carcass of a man, that walking sepulcher of himself, in whom all
          religion and right reason is withered and wasted, dried up and
          decayed."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Some translate it the apostate, and others the wretch. With what
          earnestness should we shun the appearance of doubt as to the presence,
          activity, power and love of God--for all such mistrust is of the
          nature of folly, and who among us would wish to be ranked with the
          fool in the text? Yet let us never forget that
          <i>all unregenerate men are more or less such fools.</i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The fool <b>"has said in his heart."</b> May a man with his mouth
          profess to believe, and yet in heart say the reverse? Had he hardly
          become audacious enough to utter his folly with his tongue? Did the
          Lord look upon his <i>thoughts </i>as being in the nature of
          <i>words </i>to Him, though not to man? Is this where man first
          becomes an unbeliever?—in his heart, not in his head?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          And when he talks atheistically, is it a foolish heart speaking, and
          endeavoring to clamor down the voice of conscience? We think so. If
          the affections were set upon truth and righteousness, the
          understanding would have no difficulty in settling the question of a
          present personal Deity. But as the heart dislikes the good and the
          right, it is no wonder that it desires to be rid of that Elohim, who
          is the great moral Governor,
          <i>the Patron of rectitude and the Punisher of iniquity</i>.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          While men's hearts remain what they are, we must not be surprised at
          the prevalence of skepticism; a corrupt tree will bring forth corrupt
          fruit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "Every man," says Dickson, "so long as he lies unrenewed and
          unreconciled to God is nothing in effect but a madman." What wonder
          then if he raves?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Such fools as those we are now dealing with are common to all time,
          and all countries. Like weeds, they grow without watering, and are
          found all the world over. The spread of mere intellectual
          enlightenment will not diminish their number, for since it is an
          affair of the heart, this<i> folly and great learning </i>will often
          dwell together.
          <i
            >To answer skeptical cavilings will be labor lost until grace enters
            to make the mind willing to believe</i
          >. Fools can raise more objections in an hour than wise men can answer
          in seven years, indeed it is their mirth to set stools for wise men to
          stumble over.
          <i
            >Let the preacher aim at the heart, and preach the all-conquering
            love of Jesus, and he will by God's grace win more doubters to the
            faith of the gospel than any hundred of the best reasoners who only
            direct their arguments to the head</i

        or "no God." So monstrous is the assertion, that the man hardly dared to
        put it as a positive statement, but went very near to doing so.
        <p align="justify">
          It is not merely the wish of the sinner's corrupt nature, and the hope
          of his rebellious heart, but he manages after a fashion to bring
          himself to assert it, and at certain seasons he thinks that he
          believes it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a solemn reflection that some who worship God with their lips
          may in their hearts be saying, "no God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is worthy of observation that he does not say there is no
          <i>Jehovah</i>, but there is no <i>Elohim</i>. Deity in the abstract
          is not so much the object of attack, as the covenant, personal, ruling
          and governing presence of God in the world. God as ruler, lawgiver,
          worker, Savior, is the butt at which the arrows of human wrath are
          shot. How impotent the malice! How mad the rage which raves and foams
          against Him in whom we live and move and have our being!
          <i
            >How horrible the insanity which leads a man who owes his all to God
            to cry out, "No God"! </i
          >How terrible the depravity which makes the whole race adopt this as
          their hearts desire, "no God!"
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">"They are corrupt."</p></b> This refers to
        <i>all men</i>, and we have the warrant of the Holy Spirit for so
        saying--see the third chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
        <i
          >Where there is enmity to God, there is deep, inward depravity of
          mind. </i
        >The words are in an <i>active </i> sense, "they have done corruptly:"
        this may serve to remind us that sin is not only in our nature passively
        as the source of evil, but we ourselves actively fan the flame and
        corrupt ourselves, making that blacker still which was as black as
        darkness itself already. We <i>rivet our own chains </i>by habit and
        continuance.
        <b> <p align="justify">"They have done abominable works."</p></b> When
        men begin with renouncing the Most High God, who shall tell where they
        will end? When the Master's eyes are put out, what will not the servants
        do? Observe the state of the world before the flood, as portrayed in
        Genesis 6:12, and remember that human nature is unchanged.
        <p align="justify">
          He who would see a terrible photograph of the world without God must
          read that most painful of all inspired Scriptures, the first chapter
          of the epistle to the Romans. Learned Hindus have confessed that the
          description is literally correct in Hindustan at the present moment;
          and were it not for the restraining grace of God, it would be so in
          England. Alas! it is even here but too correct a picture of things
          which are done by men in secret.<i>
            Things loathsome to God and man are sweet to some palates.</i
          >
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">"There is none that does good."</p></b>Sins of
        <i>omission </i>must abound where transgressions are rife.<i>
          Those who do the things which they ought not to have done, are sure to
          leave undone those things which they ought to have done.
        </i>
        <p align="justify">
          What a picture of our race is this! Save only where grace reigns,
          there is none that does good. Humanity, fallen and debased--is a
          desert without an oasis, a night without a star, a dunghill without a
          jewel, a Hell without a bottom.

        As from a watchtower, or other elevated place of observation, the Lord
        is represented as gazing intently upon men. He will not punish blindly,
        nor like a tyrant command an indiscriminate massacre because a rumor of
        rebellion has come up to his ears.
        <p align="justify">
          What condescending interest and impartial justice are here imaged! The
          case of Sodom, visited before it was overthrown, illustrates the
          careful manner in which Divine Justice beholds the sin before it
          avenges it, and searches out the righteous that they perish not with
          the guilty. Behold then the eyes of Omniscience ransacking the globe,
          and prying among every people and nation,
          <b>"to see if there were any that did understand and seek God." </b>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          He who is looking down knows the good, is quick to discern it, would
          be delighted to find it; but as he views all the unregenerate children
          of men, his search is fruitless, for of all the race of Adam, no
          unrenewed soul is other than an enemy to God and goodness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The objects of the Lord's search are not wealthy men, great men, or
          learned men; these, with all they can offer, cannot meet the demands
          of the great Governor. At the same time, he is not looking for
          superlative eminence in virtue, he seeks for any that understand
          themselves, their state, their duty, their destiny, their happiness;
          he looks for any that seek God, who are willing and anxious to find
          him out.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Surely this is not too great a matter to expect; for if men have not
          yet known God, if they have any right understanding, they will seek
          him.

        <p align="justify">
          Alas! even this low degree of good is not to be found even by him who
          sees all things: but men love the hideous negation of "No God," and
          with their backs to their Creator, who is the sun of their life, they
          journey into the dreary region of unbelief and alienation, which is a
          land of darkness as darkness itself, and of the shadow of death
          without any order and where the light is as darkness.

        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 3. "They are all gone aside."</p></b>
        Without exception, all men have apostatized from the Lord their Maker,
        from his laws, and from all the eternal principles of right. Like
        stubborn heifers they have sturdily refused to receive the yoke. Like
        errant sheep they have found a gap and left the right field. The
        original speaks of the race as a whole, as a totality--and
        <i
          >humanity as a whole has become depraved in heart and defiled in life. </i
        ><b> <p align="justify">"They have altogether become filthy;"</p></b>as
        a whole they are spoiled and soured like corrupt leaven, or, as some put
        it, <i>they have become putrid and even stinking</i>. The only reason
        why we do not more clearly see this foulness, is because we are
        accustomed to it--just as those who work daily among offensive odors at
        last cease to smell them. The miller does not observe the noise of his
        own mill. Just so, we are slow to discover our own ruin and depravity.
        But are there no special cases, are all men sinful? "Yes," says the
        Psalmist, in a manner not to be mistaken, "they are." He has put it
        positively, he repeats it negatively,
        <b>"There is none that does good, no, not one." </b>
        <p align="justify">
          The Hebrew phrase is an utter denial concerning any mere man that he
          of himself does good. What can be more sweeping? This is the verdict
          of the all-seeing Jehovah, who cannot exaggerate or mistake. As if no
          hope of finding a solitary specimen of a godly man among the unrenewed
          human family, might be harbored for an instant.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Holy Spirit is not content with saying <i>all </i>and
          <i>altogether</i>, but adds the crushing threefold negative,

        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          What say the opponents to the doctrine of natural depravity to this?

          nature are corrupt, and do we not bless the sovereign grace which has
          renewed us in the spirit of our minds, that sin may no more have

            generation of the righteous.

        Oppressors have it not all their own way, they have their fits of
        trembling and their appointed seasons of overthrow.
        <b> <p align="justify">"There"</p></b>—where they denied God and
        hectored against his people. "There"—where they thought of peace and
        safety, they were made to quail.
        <b> <p align="justify">"There they are"</p></b>—these very loud-mouthed,
        iron-handed, proud-hearted Nimrods and Herods, those heady, high-minded
        sinners, "<b>There they are in great fear</b>." A panic terror seized
        them.
        <p align="justify">
          "They feared a fear," as the Hebrew puts it--an undefinable, horrible,
          mysterious dread crept over them. The most hardened of men have their
          periods when conscience casts them into a cold sweat of alarm. As
          cowards are cruel, so <i>all cruel men are at heart cowards</i>. The
          ghost of past sin is a terrible specter to haunt any man, and though
          unbelievers may boast as loudly as they will, a sound is in their ears
          which makes them ill at ease.

        >This makes the company of godly men so irksome to the wicked because
        they perceive that God is with them. Shut their eyes as they may, they
        cannot but perceive the image of God in the character of his truly
        gracious people, nor can they fail to see that he works for their
        deliverance. Like Haman, they instinctively feel a trembling when they
        see God's <i>Mordecais</i>.
        <p align="justify">
          Even though the saint may be in a base position, mourning at the gate
          where the persecutor rejoices in state, the sinner feels the influence
          of the believer's true nobility and quails before it, for God is
          there.

        <p align="justify">
          Let scoffers beware, for they persecute the Lord Jesus when they
          molest his people. The union is very close between God and his people,
          it amounts to a mysterious indwelling, for God is in the generation of
          the righteous.

            Verse 6. You shame the counsel of the poor, but the LORD is his
            refuge.
          </p></b
        >
        Notwithstanding their real cowardice, the wicked put on the lion's skin
        and lord it over the Lord's poor ones. Though fools themselves, they
        mock at the truly wise as if the folly were on their side; but this is
        what might be expected, for how should brutish minds appreciate
        excellence, and how can those who have owl's eyes admire the sun?
        <p align="justify">
          The special point and butt of their jest seems to be the confidence of
          the godly in their Lord. What can your God do for you now? Who is that
          God who can deliver out of our hand? Where is the reward of all your
          praying and beseeching? Taunting questions of this sort they thrust
          into the faces of weak but gracious souls, and tempt them to feel
          ashamed of their refuge.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us not be laughed out of our confidence by them--let us scorn
          their scorning and defy their jeers. We shall need to wait but a
          little, and then the Lord our refuge will avenge his own elect, and
          ease himself of his adversaries, who once made so light of him and of
          his people.

            Verse 7. Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!
            When the LORD brings back the captivity of His people, let Jacob
            rejoice and Israel be glad.

        >Natural enough is this closing prayer, for what would so effectually
        convince atheists, overthrow persecutors, stay sin, and secure the
        godly, as the manifest appearance of Israel's great salvation?
        <p align="justify">
          The coming of Messiah was the desire of the godly in all ages, and
          though he has already come with a sin-offering to purge away iniquity,
          we look for him to come a second time, to come without a sin-offering
          unto salvation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          O that these weary years would have an end! Why tarries he so long? He
          knows that sin abounds and that his people are down-trodden; why comes
          he not to the rescue?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          His glorious advent will restore his ancient people from literal
          captivity, and his SPIRITUAL seed from spiritual sorrow. Wrestling
          Jacob and prevailing Israel shall alike rejoice before him when he is
          revealed as their salvation. O that he were come! What happy, holy,
          halcyon, heavenly days would we then see! But let us not count him
          slack, for behold he comes, he comes quickly! Blessed are all those
          who wait for him.
