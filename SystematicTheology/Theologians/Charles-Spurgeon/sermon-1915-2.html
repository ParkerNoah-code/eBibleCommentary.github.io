          "I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things
          for me." -- Psalm 57:2.
        </p>
        <p>
          DAVID was in the cave of Adullam. He had fled from Saul, his
          remorseless foe; and had found shelter in the clefts of the rock. In
          the beginning of this psalm he rings the alarm-bell, and very loud is
          the sound of it. "Be merciful unto me," and then the clapper hits the
          other side of the bell. "Be merciful unto me." He utters his misery
          again and again. "My soul trusteth in thee; yea, in the shadow of thy
          wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast." Thus
          he solaces himself by faith in his God. Faith is ever an active grace.
          Its activity, however, is first of all manifested in prayer. This
          precedes any action. "I will cry," says he, "unto God most high." You
          know how graciously he was preserved in the cave, even when Saul was
          close at his heels. Amongst the winding intricacies of those caverns
          he was enabled to conceal himself, though his enemy, with armed men,
          was close at hand. The Targum has a note upon this, which may or may
          not be true. It states that a spider spun its web over the door of
          that part of the cave where David was concealed. The legend is not
          unlike one told of another king at a later time. It may have been true
          of David, and it is quite as likely to be true of the other. If so,
          David would, in such a passage as this, have directed his thoughts to
          the little acts God had performed for him which had become great in
          their results. If God makes a spider spin a web to save his servant's
          life, David traces his deliverance not to the spider, but to the
          wonder-working Jehovah, and he saith, "I will cry unto God most high,
          unto God that performeth all things for me." It is delightful to see
          these exquisite prayers come from holy men in times of extreme
          distress. As the sick oyster makes the pearl, and not the healthy one,
          so doth it seem as if the child of God brought forth gems of prayer in
          affliction more pure, brilliant, and sparkling than any that he
          produces in times of joy and exultation.
        </p>

          Our text is capable of three meanings. To these three meanings we
          shall call your attention briefly. "Unto God who performeth all things
          for me,." First, there is infinite providence. As it stands, the
          words, "all things," you perceive, have been added by the translators;
          not that they were mistaken in so doing, for the unlimited expression,
          "God that performeth for me," allows them to supply the ellipsis
          without any violation of the sense. Secondly, there is inviolable
          faithfulness, as we know that David here referred to God's working out
          the fulfilment of the promises he had made. We sang just now of the
          sweet promise of his grace as the performing God. I think Dr. Watts
          borrowed that expression from this verse. Thirdly, there is a
          certainty of ultimate completeness. The original has for its root the
          word "finishing," and now working it out, it means a God that
          performeth or, as it were, perfects and accomplishes all things
          concerning me. Whatever there is in his promise or covenant that I may
          need, he will perfect for me. To begin with: --
        </p>
        <p>I. THE MARVELLOUS PROVIDENCE.</p>
        <p>
          The text, as it stands, speaks of a service -- "I will cry unto God
          most high; unto God that performeth all things for me." "All things,"
          that is to say, in everything that I have to do, I am but an
          instrument in his hand; it is God that doeth it for me. The Christian
          has no right to have anything to do for which he cannot ask God's
          help. Nay, he should have no business which he could not leave with
          his God. It is his to work and to exercise prudence, but it is his to
          call in the aid of God to his work, and to leave the care of it with
          the God who careth for him. Any work in which he cannot ask divine
          cooperation, the care of which he cannot cast upon God, is unfit for
          him to be engaged in. Depend upon it, if I cannot say of the whole of
          my life, "God performeth all things for me," there is sin somewhere,
          evil lurks in the disposition thereof. If I am living in such a state
          that I cannot ask God to carry out for me the enterprises I have
          embarked in, and entirely rely on his providence for the issues, then
          what I cannot ask him to do for me, neither have I any right to do for
          myself. Let us think, therefore, of the whole of our ordinary life,
          and apply the text to it. Should we not each morning cry unto God to
          give us help through the day? Though we are not going out to preach;
          though we are not going up to the assembly for worship; though it is
          only our ordinary business, that ordinary business ought to be a
          consecrated thing. Opportunities for God's service should be sought in
          our common avocations; we may glorify God very much therein. On the
          other hand, our souls may suffer serious damage, we may do much
          mischief to the cause of Christ in the ordinary walk of any one day.
          It is for us, then, to begin the day with prayer -- to continue all
          through the day in the same spirit, and to close the day by commending
          whatsoever we have done to that same Lord. Any success attending that
          day, if it be real success, is of God who gives it to us. "Except the
          Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it," is a
          statement applicable to the whole of Christian life. It is vain to
          rise early and sit up late, and eat the bread of carefulness, for so
          he giveth his beloved sleep. If there be any true blessing, such
          blessing, as Jabez craved, when he said, "Oh! that thou wouldst bless
          me indeed," it must come from the God of heaven; it can come from
          nowhere else. Cry then, Christian, concerning your common life to God,
          say continually I will cry unto God most high; unto God that
          performeth all things for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peradventure at this hour you are troubled about some petty little
          thing, or you have been through the day exercised about some trivial
          matter. Do you not think we often suffer more from our little troubles
          than from our great ones? A thorn in the foot will irritate our
          temper, while the dislocation of a joint would reveal our fortitude.
          Often the man who would bear the loss of a fortune with the equanimity
          of Job will wince and fume under a paltry annoyance that might rather
          excite a smile than a groan. We are apt to be disquieted in vain. Does
          not this very much arise from our forgetting that God performeth all
          things for us? Do we not ignore the fact that our success in little
          things, our rightness in the minutinae of life, our comfort in these
          inconsiderable trifles depends upon his blessing? Know ye not that God
          can make the gnat and the fly to be a greater trouble to Egypt than
          the murrain, the thunder, or the storm? Little trials, if unblessed --
          if unattended with the divine favour, may scourge you fearfully and
          betray you into much sin. Commend them to God then. And little
          blessings as you think them, if taken away from you, would soon
          involve very serious consequences. Thank God then for the little. Put
          the little into his hand; it is nothing to Jehovah to work in the
          little, for the great is little to him. There is not much difference,
          after all, in our littles and our greats to the infinite mind of our
          glorious God. Cast all on him who numbers the hairs of your head, and
          suffers not a sparrow to fall to the ground without his decree. Unto
          God cry about the little things, for he performeth all things for us.
          Do I speak to some who are contemplating a great change in life? Take
          not that step, my brother, without much careful waiting upon God; but
          if thou be persuaded that the change is one that hath the Master's
          approbation, fear not, for he performeth all things for thee. At this
          moment, thou hast many perplexities; thou mayest chafe thyself with
          anxiety, and make thyself foolish with shilly-shallying if thou dost
          sport with fancy, conjuring up bright dreams, and yielding to dark
          forebodings. There is many a knot we seek to untie, which were better
          cut with the sword of faith. We should end our difficulties by leaving
          them with him who knows the end from the beginning. Up to this moment
          you have been rightly led: you have the same guide. To this hour, he
          who sent the cloudy pillar has led you rightly through the devious
          track-ways of the wilderness; follow still, with a sure confidence
          that all is well. If ye keep close to him, he performeth all things
          for you. Take your guidance from his Word, and, waiting upon him in
          prayer, you need not fear. Just now, mayhap, in addition to some
          exciting dilemma, you are surrounded with real trouble and distress.
          Will it not be well to cry unto God most high, who now, in the time of
          your strait and difficulty, will show himself again to you a God
          all-sufficient to his people in their times of need. He is always
          near. I do not know that he has said, "When thou walkest through the
          green pastures, I will be with thee, and when thy way lies hard by the
          river of the water of life, where lilies bloom, I will strengthen
          thee." I believe he will do so, but I do not remember such a promise;
          but "When thou goest through the rivers, I will be with thee," is a
          well-known word of his. If ever he is present, it shall be in trial:
          if he can be absent, it will certainly not be when his servants most
          want his aid. Rest ye in him then. But you say, "I can do so little in
          this time of difficulty." Do what thou canst, but leave the rest to
          him. If thou seest no way of escape, doth it follow that there is
          none? If thou seest no help, is it, therefore, to be inferred that
          help cannot come? Thy Lord and Saviour found no friend among the whole
          family of man, "Yet," said he, "could I not presently pray to my
          Father, and he would send me twelve legions of angels?" Were it
          needful for thy help, the squadrons of heaven would leave the
          glory-land to come to thy rescue -- the least and poorest of the
          children of God as thou mayest be. He will perform for thee: be thou
          obedient, trustful, patient. 'Tis thine to obey, 'tis his to command,
          'tis thine to perceive, 'tis his to perform. He will perform all
          things for you. Very likely amongst this audience, some are foolish
          enough to perplex themselves as to their future life, and forestall
          the time when they shall grow old and their vigour shall be abated. It
          is always unwise to anticipate our troubles. "Sufficient unto the day
          is the evil thereof." Of all self-torture, that of importing future
          trouble into present account is, perhaps, the most insane. Do you tell
          me you cannot help looking into the future. Well, then, look and peer
          into the distance as far as your weak vision can reach, but do not
          breathe upon the telescope with your anxious breath and fancy you see
          clouds. On the contrary, just wipe your eyes with the soft kerchief of
          some gracious word of promise, and hold your breath while you gaze
          through that transparent medium. Use the eye-salve of faith. Then,
          whatever you discern of the future, you will also descry this. He
          rules and he overrules: he will make all things work together for
          good; he will surely bring you through. Goodness and mercy shall
          follow you all the days of your life, and you shall dwell in the house
          of the Lord for ever. He it is who will perform all things for you.
          Oh! strange infatuation! You see your weakness, you see the
          temptations that will assail you, and the troubles that threaten you,
          and you are afraid. Look away from them all. This is no business of
          yours. Leave it in his hands, who will manage well, who will be sure
          to do the kindest and the best thing for you; be of good confidence
          and rest in peace. So shall it be even at life's close. He performeth
          all things for me. I have the boundary of life in the perspective, the
          almost certainty that I must die. Unless the Lord comes before my term
          expires, I must close these eyes, gather up these feet in the bed,
          breathe a last gasp, and yield my soul to him who gave it. Well, fear
          not; he helped me to live: he will help me to die. He has made me
          perform up to this moment my allotted task; yea, he has performed it
          for me, giving me his grace and working his providence with me. Shall
          I fear that he will desert me at the last? He performeth not some
          things, but all things, and he cannot omit this most important thing,
          which often makes me tremble. No; that must be included, for all
          things are mine -- death as well as life. I leave my dying hour, then,
          with him, and never boding ill of it, I cry unto God most high, unto
          God that performeth all things for me. I want, dear brethren, just to
          leave this impression in your mind, that in the great business of
          life, whatever it is, while we do not sit still and fold our hands for
          lack of work, yet God worketh in us to will and to do of his own good
          pleasure. This we recognize distinctly; if anything be done aright,
          successfully,it is God that performs it, and we give him the glory. I
          want you to feel that, as the task is performed by him in all its
          details, so to the very close of your life, all shall be performed of
          his grace through you by himself, to his own honour and praise, world
          without end. The second run of thought which the text suggests is that
          of: --
        </p>
        <p>II. INVIOLABLE FAITHFULNESS.</p>
        <p>
          "Unto God that performeth all things for me." The God who made the
          promises has not left them as pictures, but has made them to fulfil
          them. It is God who is the actual worker of all that he declared in
          the covenant of grace should be wrought in and for his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us think of this as it pertains to our Redeemer's merits. "Unto
          God that performeth all things for me." Meritoriously our Saviour-God
          has performed all things for us. Our sin has been all put away; he
          bore it all -- every particle of it. The righteousness that wraps us
          is complete; he has woven it all from the top throughout. All that
          God's infinite, unflinching justice can ask of us has been performed
          for us by our Surety and our Covenant Head. I need not say I have to
          fight; my warfare is accomplished. I need not think I have to wash
          away my sins; as a believer, my sin is pardoned. All things are
          performed for me. Don't forget amidst your service for Christ what
          service Christ has rendered to you; do all things for Christ, but let
          the stimulating motive be that Christ has done all things for you.
          There is not even a little thing that is for you to do to complete the
          work of Christ. The temple he has builded wants not that you should
          find a single stone to make it perfect. The ransom he has paid does
          not wait until you add the last mite. It is all done. O soul, if
          Christ has completely redeemed thee and saved thee, rest thou on him,
          and cry to him, and if sin rebels within thee at this present moment,
          fly -- though thy spirit be shut up as in the Cave Adullam- -fly to
          him by faith -- to him who hath done all things for thee as thy
          Representative and Substitute. After the same manner, all things in us
          that have ever been wrought there have been performed by God for us.
          The Holy Spirit has wrought every fraction of good that is within our
          souls. No one flower that God loves grows in the garden of our souls
          in the natural soil, self-sown. The first trembling desire after God
          came from his Spirit. The blade, though very tender would never have
          sprung up if Jesus had not sown the seed. Though the first rays of
          dawn were scarcely light, but only rendered the darkness visible, yet
          from the Sun of Righteousness they came; no light sprang from the
          natural darkness of our spirit. It could not be that life could be
          begotten of death, or that light could be the child of darkness. He
          began the work: he led us when we went tremblingly to the foot of the
          cross; he helped us when we followed him with staggering steps. The
          eyes with which we looked to Jesus and believed were opened by him.
          Christ was revealed to us not by our own discovery, nor by our own
          tuition, but the Spirit of God revealed the Son of God in our spirit.
          We looked and we were lightened. The vision and the enlightening were
          alike from him; he performed all for us. As I look back upon my own
          spiritual career, when I was seeking the Saviour, I am wonderfully
          struck with the way in which God performed everything for me; for if
          he had not, I do remember well when I should have rendered it
          impossible for me to have been here to tell of the wonders of his
          grace. Hard pressed by Satan and by sin, my soul chose strangling
          rather than life. Had I known more of my own guiltiness, my heart
          would utterly have broken, and my life have failed. But wisdom and
          prudence were mingled with the teachings of God's law. He did not
          suffer the schoolmaster to be too severe, but stayed the soul beneath
          the dire remorse which conviction caused. I had never believed on him
          if he had not taught me to believe. To give up hope in self was
          desperate work, and then to find hope in Christ seemed more desperate
          still. It appeared to me easy enough to believe in Jesus while one was
          really believing in one's self, but when "despair" was written upon
          self, then one was too apt to transfer the despair even to the cross
          itself, and it appeared impossible to believe. But the Spirit wrought
          faith in me, and I believed. That is not my testimony only, but the
          testimony of all my brethren and sisters -- in that hour of sore
          trouble it was God that performed all things for us. Since then and up
          to this moment, my brethren, if there has been any virtue; if there
          has been in you anything lovely and of good repute, to whom do you or
          can you attribute it? Must you not say, "Of him all my fruit was
          found"? You could not have done without him. If you have made any
          progress, if you have made any advance, or even if you think you have,
          believe me, your growth, advance, progress, have all been a mistake
          unless they have come entirely from him. There is no wealth for us but
          that which is digged in this mine. There is no strength for us but
          that which comes from the Omnipotent One himself. "Thou who performest
          all things for me," must be our cry up to this hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          What a consolation it is that our God never changes! What he was
          yesterday he is today. What we find him today we shall find him for
          ever. Are you struggling against sin? Don't struggle in your own
          strength: it is God who performeth all things for you. Victories over
          sin are only sham victories unless we overcome through the blood of
          the Lamb, and through the power of divine grace. I am afraid of
          backsliding, but I think I am more afraid still of growing in
          sanctification apparently in my own strength. It is a dreadful thing
          for the grey hairs to appear here and there; but it is worse still for
          the hair to appear to be of raven hue when the man is weak. Only the
          indication is changed, but not the state itself. May we have really
          what we think we have -- no surface work, but deep, inner, spiritual
          life, wrought in us from God -- yea, every good spiritual thing from
          him, who performeth all things for us; and, I say, whatever struggles
          may come, whatever vehement temptations assail, or whatever
          thunder-clouds may burst over your heads, you shall not be deserted,
          much less destroyed. In spiritual things it is God who performeth all
          things for you. Rest in him then. It is no work of yours to save your
          own soul; Christ is the Saviour. If he cannot save you, you certainly
          cannot save yourself. Why rest you your hopes where hopes never ought
          to be rested? Or let me change the question. Why do you fear where you
          never ought to have hoped? Instead of fearing that you cannot hold on,
          despair of holding on yourself, and never look in that direction
          again. But if the preservation be of God, where is the cause for
          perturbation with you? In him let your entire reliance be fixed. Cast
          the burden of your care on him who performeth all things for you.

        <p>III. THE FINISHING STROKE OF A GRAND DESIGN.</p>
        <p>
          It really means, "I will cry unto God most high -- unto God who
          perfecteth all things concerning me." David's career was charged with
          a great work; it was portentous with a high destiny. He had been
          anointed when a lad by Samuel. The Lord had said, "I have provided me
          a king among the sons of Jesse." And Samuel had taken "the horn of oil
          and anointed him in the midst of his brethren." He was thus clearly
          ordained to be king over Israel. His way to the throne was by Adullam.
          Strange route! To be king over Israel and Judah, he must first become
          a rebel, a wandering vagabond, known as a chieftain of banditti,
          hunted about by Saul, the reigning monarch. He must seek refuge in the
          courts of his country's enemies, the Philistines -- being without an
          earthly refuge, or place to lay his head. Strange way to a throne! Yet
          the son of David had to go that way, and all the sons of God. The
          younger brethren of the Crown Prince will have to find their way to
          their crown by much the same route. But is not this a brave thing?
          Though Adullam does not look like the way to Zion, where he shall be
          crowned, David is so confident that what God has said will come to
          pass, so sure that Samuel's anointing was no farce, but that he must
          be king, that he praises and blesses God that while he is making of
          him a houseless wanderer, he is perfecting that which concerns him,
          and leading him by a sure path to the throne. Now, can I believe that
          he who promises that I shall be with him where he is, that I may
          behold his glory -- he who gives the certainty to every believer that
          he shall enter into everlasting happiness -- can I believe tonight
          that he is perfecting that for me -- that the way by which he is
          taking me tonight, so dark, so gloomy, so full of dangers, is,
          nevertheless, the shortest way to heaven? that he is tonight using the
          quickest method to perfect that which concerns my soul? O faith! here
          is something for thee to do; and if thou canst perform it, thou shalt
          bring glory to God. The pith of it is this: that if God hath the
          keeping of us, he will perfect the keeping in the day of Christ. In
          the hand of Jesus all his people are, and in that hand they shall be
          for ever and ever. "None shall pluck them out of my hand," saith he.
          Their preservation shall be perfected. So, too, their sanctification.
          Every child of God is set apart by Christ, and in Christ, and the work
          of the Spirit has commenced which shall subdue sin, and extirpate the
          very roots of corruption; and this work shall be perfected; nay, is
          being perfected at this very moment. The dragon is being trodden down
          under foot. The seed of the woman within us is beginning to bruise the
          serpent's head, and shall clearly bruise it and crush it, even to the
          death within our soul.He is perfecting us in all things for himself.
          He has promised to bring us to glory. We have the earnest of that
          great glory in us now. The new life is there; all the elements of
          heaven are within us. Now he will perfect all these. He will not
          suffer one good thing that he has planted within us to die. It is a
          living and incorruptible seed, which liveth and abideth for ever. He
          will perfect all things for us. There is nothing that makes the saints
          complete but what God will give to us. There shall be lacking us no
          one trait of loveliness that is needful for the courtiers of the
          skies; no one virtue that is necessary in us. What a marvellous thing
          is a Christian! How mean; how noble! How abject; how august! How near
          to hell; how close to heaven! How fallen, yet lifted up! Able to do
          nothing; yet doing all things! Doing nothing; yet accomplishing all
          things; because herein it is that, in the man, and with the man, there
          is God, and he performeth all things for us. God, give us grace to
          look away entirely, evermore, from ourselves, and to depend entirely
          upon him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now is there a soul here that desires salvation? My text gives you the
          clue of comfort. Try -- the thing is simple -- try. Look to him: he
          performeth all things for you. Everything that is wanted to save your
          soul, your heavenly Father will give you. Jesus, the Saviour, has
          wrought out all the sinner's wants. You have but to come and take what
          is already accomplished, and rest in it. "I cannot save myself," say
          you. You need not: there is One who performeth all things for you. "I
          am bruised and mangled by the fall," saith one, "as though every bone
          were broken." "I am incapable of a good thought; there is nothing good
          in me, or that can come from me." Soul! it is not what thou canst do,
          but what God can do -- what Christ has done -- that must be the ground
          of thy hope. Give thyself up unto God, most high -- unto God, who
          performeth all things for thee, and thou shalt be blessed indeed. God
          send you away with his own blessing, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

        <p>Psalm 34:1-20.</p>
        <p>
          Verse 1. I will bless the LORD at all times; his praise shall
          continually be in my mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Others may do what they please, and murmur, and complain, and be
          filled with dread and apprehension of the future; but I will bless the
          Lord at all times. I can always see something for which I ought to
          bless him. I can always see some good which will come out of blessing
          him. Therefore will I bless him at all times. And this," says the
          Psalmist, "I will not only do in my heart, but I will do it with my
          tongue. His praise shall continually be in my mouth," that others may
          hear it, that others may begin to praise him, too, for murmuring is
          contagious, and so, thank God, is praise; and one man may learn from
          another -- take the catchword and the keyword out of another man's
          mouth, and then begin to praise God with him. "His praise shall
          continually be in my mouth." What a blessed mouthful! If some people
          had God's praises in their mouths, they would not so often have
          fault-finding with their fellow-men.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If half the breath thus vainly spent" in finding fault with our
          fellow-Christians were spent in prayer and praise, how much happier,
          how much richer, we should be spiritually! "His praise shall
          continually be in my mouth."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear
          thereof and be glad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Boasting is generally annoying. Even those that boast themselves
          cannot endure that other people should boast. But there is one kind of
          boasting that even the humble can bear to hear -- nay they are glad to
          hear it. "The humble shall hear thereof, and be glad." That must be
          boasting in God -- a holy glorying and extolling the Most High with
          words sought out with care that might magnify his blessed name. You
          will never exaggerate when you speak good things of God. It is not
          possible to do so. Try, dear brethren, and even boast in the Lord.
          There are many poor, trembling, doubting, humble souls that can hardly
          tell whether they are the Lord's people or not, and are half afraid
          whether they shall be delivered in the hour of trouble, that will
          become comforted when they hear you boasting. "The humble shall hear
          thereof, and be glad." "Why," says the humble soul, "God that helped
          that man can help me. He that brought him up through the deep waters,
          and landed him safely, can also take me through the river and through
          the sea, and give me final deliverance. My soul shall make her boast
          in the Lord. The humble shall hear thereof, and be glad."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt His name together.
        </p>
        <p>
          He cannot do enough of it himself. He wants others to come in and help
          him. First, he charges his own heart with the weighty and blessed
          business of praising God, and then he invites all around to unite with
          him in the sacred effort. "Magnify the Lord with me. Let us exalt his
          name together."
        </p>
        <p>
          4. I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my
          fears.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was David's testimony. That is mine. Brother, that is yours. Is
          it not? Sister, is not that yours too? Well, if you have such a
          blessed testimony, be sure to bear it. Often do you whisper it in the
          mourner's ear, "I sought the Lord, and he heard me." Tell it in the
          scoffer's ear. When he says, "There is no God," and that prayer is
          useless, say to him, "I sought the Lord, and he heard me, and
          delivered me from all my fears." It is a pity that such a sweet
          encouraging profitable testimony should be kept back. Be sure at all
          proper times to make it known. But it is not merely ourselves. There
          are others who can speak well of God.

          5. They looked unto him, and were lightened; and their faces were not
          ashamed.
        </p>
        <p>
          And who were they? Why, all the people of God -- the whole company of
          the saints in heaven, and the saints on earth. It can be said of them
          all, "They looked to him, and were lightened." As there is life in a
          look, so is there light in a look. Oh! you that looked to Christ and
          live, at first look to him again, if it is dark with you tonight, and
          speedily it shall be light round about you. "They looked unto him, and
          were lightened."
        </p>
        <p>
          6. This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of
          all his troubles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who was he? He was a poor man -- any poor man -- nothing very
          particular about him, but he was poor -- a poor man. What did he do?
          He cried. That was the style of praying he adopted -- as a child cries
          -- the natural expression of pain. Poor man, he did not know how to
          pray a fine prayer, and he could not have preached you a sermon if you
          had given him a bishop's salary for it; but he cried. He could do
          that. You do not need to go to the Board School to learn how to cry.
          Any living child can cry. This poor man cried. What came of it? "The
          Lord heard him." I do not suppose anybody else did; or, if they did,
          they laughed at it. But it did not signify to him. The Lord heard him.
          And what came of that? He "saved him out of all his troubles." Oh! is
          there a poor man here tonight in trouble. Had he not better copy the
          example of this other poor man? Let him cry to the Lord about it. Let
          him come and bring his burdens before the great One who hears poor
          men's prayers. And, no doubt, that poor man lived to tell the same
          tale as he who wrote this verse. "This poor man cried, and the Lord
          heard and saved him out of all his troubles."
        </p>
        <p>
          7. The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him and
          delivereth them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is no wonder, then, that they are delivered, for the angels are
          always handy. They are waiting round about God's people. Lo, they are
          not at a distance to fly swiftly and come for our rescue, but God has
          set a camp of angels round about all his people. Are we not royally
          attended? What a portion is ours! Many are they that be against us,
          but glorious are they that be for us, both in their number and their
          strength. But the text does not intend so much the angels, as one
          blessed, glorious, covenant angel -- the angel of the Lord, the
          messenger of God. He it is that holds his camp hard by his people, and
          sends his messengers for their rescue in all times of difficulty.

        <p>
          8. O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that
          trusteth in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is the language of experience. Some of us have lived by trusting
          God for many years, and, instead of growing weary of it, we would
          invite others to do the same. Oh! taste and see that the Lord is good.
          You cannot know his goodness without tasting it. But there was never a
          soul yet that did taste of the goodness of the Lord but what could
          bear cheerful testimony that it was even so. "Oh! taste and see."
          Partake of it. Become practically acquainted with it. Trust God
          yourselves, and none of you shall ever have to complain of God. To
          your latest hour you will have to find fault with yourselves, but
          never once will you have to accuse God of changeableness, or of
          unfaithfulness, or even of forgetfulness. "Oh! taste and see that the
          Lord is good, for blessed is the man that trusteth in him."
        </p>
        <p>
          9, 10. O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them
          that fear him. The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they
          that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are very strong, those young lions. They are fierce. They are
          rapacious. They are cunning. And yet they do lack and suffer hunger.
          And there are many men in this world that are very clever, strong in
          body, and active in mind. They say that they can take care of
          themselves, and perhaps they do appear to prosper; but we know that
          often those who are the most prosperous apparently are the most
          miserable of men. They are young lions, but they do lack and suffer
          hunger. But when a man's soul lives upon God, he may have very little
          of this world, but he will be perfectly content. He has learnt the
          secret of true happiness. He does not want any good things, for the
          things that he does not have he does not wish to have. He brings his
          mind down to his estate, if he cannot bring his estate to his mind. He
          is thankful to have a little spending money on the road, for his
          treasure is above. He likes to have the best things last, and so he is
          well content, if he has food and raiment, to urge on his way to the
          rest which remaineth for the people of God. "The young lions do lack
          and suffer hunger, but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good
          thing."
        </p>
        <p>11. Come, ye children.</p>
        <p>
          Ye that are beginning life -- you that want to know where true
          happiness is found.
        </p>
        <p>11. Hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.</p>
        <p>It is that which you want to know, beyond everything else.</p>
        <p>
          12, 13. What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that
          he may see good? Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking
          guile.
        </p>
        <p>
          He that can rule his tongue can rule his whole body. Alas! that unruly
          member destroys peace and happiness in thousands of cases. The tongue
          can no man tame, but the grace of God can tame it; and that man begins
          life with a prospect of happiness whose tongue has been tamed by
          grace.
        </p>
        <p>14. Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.</p>
        <p>
          True happiness is found in true holiness. "Depart from evil." That is,
          do not go after it. But it is much more than that. Go away from it.
          Give it a wide berth. "Depart from evil." But be not satisfied with
          the negatives. It is not enough to say, "I do not do any evil," but do
          good. The only way to keep out the evil is to fill the soul full of
          good. We must be active in the cause of God, or Satan will soon lead
          us into sin. "Depart from evil and do good."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Seek peace." Be of a quiet turn of mind. Be always ready to forgive.
          "Seek peace and pursue it." That is, when it runs away, run after it.
          Make up your mind that you will have it. There are some that seek
          quarrels. There are some that seek revenge. As for you, seek peace and
          pursue it.
        </p>
        <p>
          15. The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open
          unto their cry.
        </p>
        <p>
          God is all eye and all ear, and all his eye and all his ear are for
          his people. Are you distressed in heart? God sees your distress. Are
          you crying in secret in the bitterness of your soul? God hears your
          cry. You are not alone. O lonely spirit, broken spirit, be not
          dismayed; be not given to despair. God is with you. If he sees nothing
          else, he will see you. "The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous."
          And if he hears no one else in the world, he will hear you. "His ears
          are open to their cry."
        </p>
        <p>
          16. The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the
          remembrance of them from the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          You know what we say sometimes. "I set my face against such a thing as
          that." Now God sets his face against them that do evil. You will come
          to an end, my friend. Your happiness, like a bubble painted with
          rainbow colours, may be the object of foolish desires; but in a little
          while it will burst and be gone, as the bubble is, and there will be
          nothing left of you. Even your remembrance will be wiped out from the
          face of the earth. What numbers of books have been written against God
          of which you could not get a copy now, except you went to a museum!
          What numbers of men have lived that have been scoffers; and they have
          had great names amongst the circles of unbelievers, but they are quite
          forgotten now! But the Christian Church treasures up names of poor,
          simple-hearted Christian men and women -- treasures them up like
          jewels, and their fame is fresh after hundreds of years.
        </p>
        <p>
          17. The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out
          of all their troubles.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is how we live, if you want to know. God makes us righteous, and
          then we cry. We often praise him. We desire to have our mouth full of
          it. But we cry as well, and whenever we cry God hears, and our
          troubles are removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          18. The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth
          such as be of a contrite spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Are you here tonight, poor weeping Mary? Are you here, broken-
          hearted, troubled sinner? Are you here? Are you seeking the Lord? Do
          not seek him any longer. You have got him. Read the text, "The Lord is
          nigh unto them that are of a broken heart." He is with you now. Speak
          to him; cry to him; trust him. You shall find deliverance this night.
        </p>
        <p>19. Many are the afflictions of the righteous:&lt;</p>

          You should hear some of them talk, and you would soon know that; for I
          know some of the righteous that seldom talk of anything else. "Oh! for
          badness of trade!" They have been losing money -- oh! ever since I
          knew them. They had not any when they started, but they have gone on
          losing money every year; and I believe they always will. And they
          always have pains of body. The weather is so bad. And they always have
          ungrateful friends. And the church they belong to is not up to the
          mark. Indeed, there is nothing around them that is right. "Many are
          the afflictions of the righteous."

          Well now, dear brethren, as that is recorded in God's Word, and as
          most of us have a pretty good acquaintance with that subject, I do not
          think that it is necessary for all of us to insist upon it every day.
          Could not we go on to the next part of the verse? "Many are the
          afflictions of the righteous," but -- but --
        </p>
        <p>19. But the LORD delivereth him out of the them all.</p>
        <p>
          Not out of some of the, but out of them all, however numerous they may
          be.
        </p>
        <p>20. He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.</p>
        <p>
          He sustains no real injury. He gets flesh-wounds and bruises, but his
          bones are not broken. That is to say, the substantial part of his
          nature is well kept and preserved.<br />
