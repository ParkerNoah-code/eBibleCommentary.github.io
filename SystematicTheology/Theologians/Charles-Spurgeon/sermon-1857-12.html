        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.118)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, February 22, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At The Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens</p>
        <p>"Without shedding of blood is no remission." -- Hebrews 9: 22.</p>
        <p>
          I will show you three fools. One is yonder soldier, who has been
          wounded on the field of battle, grievously wounded, well nigh unto
          death; the surgeon is by his side, and the soldier asks him a
          question. Listen, and judge of his folly. What question does he ask?
          Does he raise his eyes with eager anxiety and inquire if the wound be
          mortal, if the practitioner's skill can suggest the means of healing,
          or if the remedies are within reach and the medicine at hand? No,
          nothing of the sort; strange to tell, he asks, "Can you inform me with
          what sword I was wounded, and by what Russian I have been thus
          grievously mauled? I want," he adds, "to learn every minute particular
          respecting the origin of my wound." The man is delirious or his head
          is affected. Surely such questions at such a time are proof enough
          that he is bereft of his senses.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is another fool. The storm is raging, the ship is flying
          impetuous before the gale, the dark scud moves swiftly over head, the
          masts are creaking, the sails are rent to rags, and still the
          gathering tempest grows more fierce. Where is the captain? Is he
          busily engaged on the deck, is he manfully facing the danger, and
          skilfully suggesting means to avert it? No sir, he has retired to his
          cabin, and there with studious thoughts and crazy fancies he is
          speculating on the place where this storm took its rise. "It is
          mysterious, this wind; no one ever yet" he says, "has been able to
          discover it." And, so reckless of the vessel, the lives of the
          passengers, and his own life, he is careful only to solve his curious
          questions. The man is mad, sir; take the rudder from his hand; he is
          clean gone mad! If he should ever run on shore, shut him up as a
          hopeless lunatic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third fool I shall doubtless find among yourselves. You are sick
          and wounded with sin, you are in the storm and hurricane of Almighty
          vengeance, and yet the question which you would ask of me, this
          morning, would be, "Sir, what is the origin of evil?" You are mad,
          Sir, spiritually mad; that is not the question you would ask if you
          were in a sane and healthy state of mind; your question would be: "How
          can I get rid of the evil?" Not, "How did it come into the world?" but
          "How am I to escape from it?" Not, "How is it that hail descends from
          heaven upon Sodom?" but "How may I, like Lot, escape out of the city
          to a Zoar." Not, "How is it that I am sick?" but "Are there medicines
          that will heal me? Is there a physician to be found that can restore
          my soul to health ?" Ah! you trifle with subtleties while you neglect
          certainties. More questions have been asked concerning the origin of
          evil than upon anything else. Men have puzzled their heads, and
          twisted their brains into knots, in order to understand what men can
          never know -- how evil came into this world, and how its entrance is
          consistent with divine goodness? The broad fact is this, there is
          evil; and your question should be, "How can I escape from the wrath to
          come, which is engendered of this evil?" In answering that question
          this verse stands right in the middle of the way (like the angel with
          the sword, who once stopped Balaam on his road to Barak,) "Without
          shedding of blood is no remission." Your real want is to know how you
          can be saved; if you are aware that your sin must be pardoned or
          punished, your question will be, "How can it he pardoned?" and then
          point blank in the very teeth of your enquiry, there stands out this
          fact: "Without shedding of blood there is no remission." Mark you,
          this is not merely a Jewish maxim; it is a world-wide and eternal
          truth. It pertaineth not to the Hebrews only, but to the Gentiles
          likewise. Never in any time, never in any place, never in any person,
          can there be remission apart from shedding of blood. This great fact,
          I say, is stamped on nature; it is an essential law of God's moral
          government, it is one of the fundamental principles which can neither
          be shaken nor denied. Never can there be any exception to it; it
          stands the same in every place throughout all ages -- "Without
          shedding of blood there is no remission." It was so with the Jews;
          they had no remission without the shedding of blood. Some things under
          the Jewish law might be cleansed by water or by fire, but in no case
          where absolute sin was concerned was there ever purification without
          blood -- teaching this doctrine, that blood, and blood alone, must be
          applied for the remission of sin. Indeed the very heathen seem to have
          an inkling of this fact. Do not I see their knives gory with the blood
          of victims? Have I not heard horrid tales of human immolations, of
          holocausts, of sacrifices; and what mean these, but that there lies
          deep in the human breast, deep as the very existence of man, this
          truth, -- "that without shedding of blood there is no remission." And
          I assert once more, that even in the hearts and consciences of my
          hearers there is something which will never let them believe in
          remission apart from a shedding of blood. This is the grand truth of
          Christianity, and it is a truth which I will endeavour now to fix upon
          your memory; and may God by his grace bless it to your souls. "Without
          shedding of blood is no remission."
        </p>
        <p>
          First, let me show you the blood-shedding, before I begin to dwell
          upon the text. Is there not a special blood-shedding meant? Yes, there
          was a shedding of most precious blood, to which I must forthwith refer
          you. I shall not tell you now of massacres and murders, nor of rivers
          of blood of goats and rams. There was a blood-shedding once, which did
          all other shedding of blood by far outvie; it was a man -- a God --
          that shed his blood at that memorable season. Come and see it. Here is
          a garden dark and gloomy; the ground is crisp with the cold frost of
          midnight; between those gloomy olive trees I see a man, I hear him
          groan out his life in prayer; hearken, angels, hearken men, and
          wonder; it is the Saviour groaning out his soul! Come and see him.
          Behold his brow! O heavens! drops of blood are streaming down his
          face, and from his body; every pore is open, and it sweats! but not
          the sweat of men that toil for bread; it is the sweat of one that
          toils for heaven -- he "sweats great drops of blood!" That is the
          blood-shedding, without which there is no remission. Follow that man
          further; they have dragged him with sacrilegious bands from the place
          of his prayer and his agony, and they have taken him to the hall of
          Pilate; they seat him in a chair and mock him; a robe of purple is put
          on his shoulders in mockery; and mark his brow -- they have put about
          it a crown of thorns, and the crimson drops of gore are rushing down
          his cheeks! Ye angels! the drops of blood are running down his cheeks!
          But turn aside that purple robe for a moment. His back is bleeding.
          Tell me, demons who did this. They lift up the thongs, still dripping
          clots of gore; they scourge and tear his flesh, and make a river of
          blood to run down his shoulders! That is the shedding of blood without
          which there is no remission. Not yet have I done: they hurry him
          through the streets; they fling him on the ground; they nail his hands
          and feet to the transverse wood, they hoist it in the air, they dash
          it into its socket, it is fixed, and there he hangs the Christ of God.
          Blood from his head, blood from his hands, blood from his feet! In
          agony unknown he bleeds away his life; in terrible throes he exhausts
          his soul. "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani." And then see! they pierce his
          side, and forthwith runneth out blood and water. This is the shedding
          of blood, sinners and saints; this is the awful shedding of blood, the
          terrible pouring out of blood, without which for you, and for the
          whole human race, there is no remission.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have then, I hope, brought my text fairly out: without this shedding
          of blood there is no remission. Now I shall come to dwell upon it more
          particularly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is it that this story doth not make men weep? I told it ill, you
          say. Ay, so I did; I will take all the blame. But, sirs, if it were
          told as ill as men could speak, were our hearts what they should be,
          we should bleed away our lives in sorrow. Oh! it was a horrid murder
          that! It was not an act of regicide; it was not the deed of a
          fratricide, or of a parricide; it was -- what shall I say? -- I must
          make a word -- a deicide; the killing of a God; the slaying of him who
          became incarnate for our sins. Oh! if our hearts were but soft as
          iron, we must weep, if they were but tender as the marble of the
          mountains, we should shed great drops of grief; but they are harder
          than the nether millstone; we forget the griefs of him that died this
          ignominious death, we pity not his sorrows, nor do we account the
          interest we have in him as though he suffered and accomplished all for
          us. Nevertheless, here stands the principle -- "Without shedding of
          blood is no remission."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I take it, there are two things here. First, there is a negative
          expressed: "No remission without shedding of blood." And then there is
          a positive implied, forsooth, with shedding of blood there is
          remission.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, I say, here is A NEGATIVE EXPRESSED: there is no remission
          without blood -- without the blood of Jesus Christ. This is of divine
          authority; when I utter this sentence I have divinity to plead. It is
          not a thing which you may doubt, or which you may believe; it must be
          believed and received, otherwise you have denied the Scriptures and
          turned aside from God. Some truths I utter, perhaps, have little
          better basis than my own reasoning and inference, which are of little
          value enough; but this I utter, not with quotations from God's Word to
          back up my assertion, but from the lips of God himself. Here it stands
          in great letters, "There is no remission." So divine its authority.
          Perhaps you will kick at it: but remember, your rebellion is not
          against me, but against God, If any of you reject this truth, I shall
          not controvert; God forbid I should turn aside from proclaiming his
          gospel, to dispute with men. I have God's irrevocable statute to plead
          now, here it stands: "Without shedding of blood there is no
          remission." You may believe or disbelieve many things the preacher
          utters; but this you disbelieve at the peril of your souls. It is
          God's utterance: will you tell God to his face you do not believe it?
          That were impious. The negative is divine in its authority; bow
          yourselves to it, and accept its solemn warning.
        </p>
        <p>
          But some men will say that God's way of saving men, by shedding of
          blood, is a cruel way, an unjust way, an unkind way; and all kinds of
          things they will say of it. Sirs, I have nothing to do with your
          opinion of the matter; it is so. If you have any faults to find with
          your Maker, fight your battles out with him at last. But take heed
          before you throw the gauntlet down; it will go ill with a worm when he
          fighteth with his Maker, and it will go ill with you when you contend
          with him. The doctrine of atonement when rightly understood and
          faithfully received, is delightful, for it exhibits boundless love,
          immeasurable goodness, and infinite truth; but to unbelievers it will
          always be a hated doctrine. So it must be sirs; you hate your own
          mercies; you despise your own salvation. I tarry not to dispute with
          you; I affirm it in God's name: "Without shedding of blood there is no
          remission."
        </p>
        <p>
          And note how decisive this is in its character: "Without shedding of
          blood there is no remission." "But, sir, can't I get my sins forgiven
          by my repentance? if I weep, and plead, and pray, will not God forgive
          me for the sake of my tears?" "No remission," says the text, "without
          shedding of blood." "But, sir, if I never sin again, and if I serve
          God more zealously than other men, will he not forgive me for the sake
          of my obedience?" "No remission," says the text, "without shedding of
          blood." "But, sir, may I not trust that God is merciful, and will
          forgive me without the shedding of blood?" "No," says the text,
          "without shedding of blood there is no remission;" none whatever. It
          cuts off every other hope. Bring your hopes here, and if they are not
          based in blood. and stamped with blood, they are as useless as castles
          in the air, and dreams of the night. "There is no remission," says the
          text, in positive and plain words; and yet men will be trying to get
          remission in fifty other ways, until their special pleading becomes as
          irksome to us as it is useless for them. Sirs, do what you like, say
          what you please, but you are as far off remission when you have done
          your best, as you were when you began, except you put confidence in
          the shedding of our Saviour's blood, and in the blood-shedding alone,
          for without it there is no remission.
        </p>
        <p>
          And note again how universal it is in its character. "What! may not I
          get remission without blood-shedding?" says the king; and he comes
          with the crown on his head; "May not I in all my robes, with this rich
          ransom, get pardon without the blood-shedding?" "None," is the reply;
          "none." Forthwith comes the wise man, with a number of letters after
          his name -- "Can I not get remission by these grand titles of my
          learning?" "None; none." Then comes the benevolent man -- "I have
          dispersed my money to the poor, and given my bounty to feed them;
          shall not I get remission?" "None;" says the text, "Without shedding
          of blood there is no remission." How this puts everyone on a level! My
          lord, you are no bigger than your coachman; Sir, squire, you are no
          better off than John that ploughs the ground; minister, your office
          does not serve you with any exemption -- your poorest hearer stands on
          the very same footing. "Without shedding of blood there is no
          remission." No hope for the best, any more than for the worst, without
          this shedding of blood. Oh! I love the gospel, for this reason among
          others, because it is such a levelling gospel. Some persons do not
          like a levelling gospel; nor would I, in some senses of the word. Let
          men have their rank, and their titles, and their riches, if they will;
          but I do like, and I am sure all good men like, to see rich and poor
          meet together and feel that they are on a level; the gospel makes them
          so. It says "Put up your money-bags, they will not procure you
          remission; roll up your diploma, that will not get you remission;
          forget your farm and your park, they will not get you remission; just
          cover up that escutcheon, that coat of arms will not get you
          remission. Come, you ragged beggars, filthy off-scourings of the
          world, penniless; come hither; here is remission as much for you,
          ill-bred and ill-mannered though ye be, as for the noble, the
          honorable, the titled, and the wealthy. All stand on a level here; the
          text is universal: "Without shedding of blood there is no remission."
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark too, how perpetual my text is. Paul said, "there is no
          remission;" I must repeat this testimony too. When thousands of years
          have rolled away, some minister may stand on this spot and say the
          same. This will never alter at all; it will always be so, in the next
          world as well as this: no remission without shedding of blood. "Oh!
          yes there is," says one, "the priest takes the shilling, and he gets
          the soul out of purgatory." That is a mere pretence; it never was in.
          But without shedding of blood there is no real remission. There may be
          tales and fancies, but there is no true remission without the blood of
          propitiation. Never, though you strained yourselves in prayer; never,
          though you wept yourselves away in tears; never, though you groaned
          and cried till your heart-strings break; never in this world, nor in
          that which is to come, can the forgiveness of sins be procured on any
          other ground than redemption by the blood of Christ, and never can the
          conscience be cleansed but by faith in that sacrifice. The fact is,
          beloved, there is no use for you to satisfy your hearts with anything
          less than what satisfied God the Father. Without the shedding of blood
          nothing would appease his justice; and without the application of that
          same blood nothing can purge your consciences.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But as there is no remission without blood-shedding, IT IS IMPLIED
          THAT THERE IS REMISSION WITHOUT IT. Mark it well, this remission is a
          present fact. The blood having been already shed, the remission is
          already obtained. I took you to the garden of Gethsemane and the mount
          of Calvary to see the bloodshedding. I might now conduct you to
          another garden and another mount to shew you the grand proof of the
          remission. Another garden, did I say? Yes, it is a garden, fraught
          with many pleasing and even triumphant reminiscences. Aside from the
          haunts of this busy world, in it was a new sepulchre, hewn out of a
          rock where Joseph of Arimathea thought his own poor body should
          presently be laid. But there they laid Jesus after his crucifixion.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had stood surety for his people, and the law had demanded his
          blood; death had held him with strong grasp; and that tomb was, as it
          were, the dungeon of his captivity, when, as the good shepherd, he
          laid down his life for the sheep. Why, then, do I see in that garden,
          an open, untenanted grave? I will tell you. The debts are paid, the
          sins are cancelled -- , the remission is obtained. How, think you?
          That great Shepherd of the sheep hath been brought again from the dead
          by the blood of the everlasting covenant, and in him also we have
          obtained redemption through his blood. There, beloved, is proof the
          first.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you ask further evidence? I will take you to Mount Olivet. You
          shall behold Jesus there with his hands raised like the High Priest of
          old to bless his people, and while he is blessing them, he ascends,
          the clouds receiving him out of their sight. But why, you ask, oh why
          hath he thus ascended, and whither is he gone ? Behold he entereth,
          not into the holy place made with hands, but be entereth into heaven
          itself with his own blood, there to appear in the presence of God for
          us. Now, therefore, we have boldness to draw near by the blood of
          Christ. The remission is obtained, here is proof the second. Oh
          believer, what springs of comfort are there here for thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now let me commend this remission by the shedding of blood to
          those who have not yet believed. Mr. Innis, a great Scotch minister,
          once visited an infidel who was dying. When he came to him the first
          time, he said, "Mr. Innis, I am relying on the mercy of God; God is
          merciful, and he will never damn a man for ever." When he got worse
          and was nearer death, Mr. Innis went to him again, and he said, " Oh!
          Mr. Innis, my hope is gone; for I have been thinking if God be
          merciful, God is just too; and what if, instead of being merciful to
          me, he should be just to me? What would then become of me? I must give
          up my hope in the mere mercy of God; tell me how to be saved!" Mr.
          Innis told him that Christ had died in the stead of all believers --
          that God could be just, and yet the justifier through the death of
          Christ. " Ah!" said he, " Mr. Innis, there is something solid in that;
          I can rest on that; I cannot rest on anything else;" and it is a
          remarkable fact that none of us ever met with a man who thought he had
          his sins forgiven unless it was through the blood of Christ. Meet a
          Mussulman; he never had his sins forgiven; he does not say so. Meet an
          Infidel; he never knows that his sins are forgiven. Meet a Legalist;
          he says, "I hope they will be forgiven;" but he does not pretend they
          are. No one ever gets even a fancied hope apart from this, that
          Christ, and Christ alone, must save by the shedding of his blood.

          Let me tell a story to show how Christ saves souls. Mr. Whitfield had
          a brother who had been like him, an earnest Christian, but he had
          backslidden; he went far from the ways of godliness; and one
          afternoon, after he had been recovered from his backsliding, he was
          sitting in a room in a chapel house. He had heard his brother
          preaching the day before, and his poor conscience had been cut to the
          very quick. Said Whitfield's brother, when he was at tea, "I am a lost
          man," and he groaned and cried, and could neither eat nor drink. Said
          Lady Huntingdon, who sat opposite, "What did you say, Mr. Whitfield?"
          "Madam," said he, "I said, I am a lost man." "I'm glad of it," said
          she; "I'm glad of it." "Your ladyship, how can you say so? It is cruel
          to say you are glad that I am a lost man." " I repeat it, sir," said
          she; "I am heartily glad of it." He looked at her, more and more
          astonished at her barbarity. "I am glad of it," said she, "because it
          is written, The Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was
          lost.' " With the tears rolling down his cheeks, he said, "What a
          precious Scripture; and how is it that it comes with such force to me
          ? Oh! madam," said he, "madam, I bless God for that; then he will save
          me; I trust my soul in his hands; he has forgiven me." He went outside
          the house, felt ill, fell upon the ground, and expired. I may have a
          lost man here this morning. As I cannot say much, I will leave you,
          good people; you do not want anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have I got a lost man here? Lost man! Lost woman! Where are you? Do
          you feel yourself to be lost? I am so glad of it; for there is
          remission by the blood-shedding. O sinner, are there tears in your
          eyes? Look through them. Do you see that man in the garden? That man
          sweats drops of blood for you. Do you see that man on the cross? That
          man was nailed there for you. Oh! if I could be nailed on a cross this
          morning for you all, I know what you would do: you would fall down and
          kiss my feet, and weep that I should have to die for you. But sinner,
          lost sinner, Jesus died for you -- for you; and if he died for you.,
          you cannot be lost. Christ died in vain for no one. Are you, then, a
          sinner? Are you convinced of sin because you believe not in Christ? I
          have authority to preach to you. Believe in his name and you cannot be
          lost. Do you say you are no sinner? Then I do not know that Christ
          died for you. Do you say that you have no sins to repent of? Then I
          have no Christ to preach to you. He did not come to save the
          righteous; he came to save the wicked. Are you wicked? Do you feel it?
          Are you lost? Do you know it? Are you sinful? Will you confess it?
          Sinner! if Jesus were here this morning, he would put out his bleeding
          hands, and say, " Sinner, I died for you, will you believe me ?" He is
          not here in person; he has sent his servant to tell you. Won't you
          believe him? "Oh!" but you say, "I am such a sinner;" "Ah!" says he,
          "that is just why I died for you, because you are a sinner." "But,"
          you say, "I do not deserve it." "Ah !" says he, "that is just why I
          did it." Say you, "I have hated him." "But," says he, "I have always
          loved you." "But, Lord, I have spat on thy minister, and scorned thy
          word." "It is all forgiven," says he, "all washed away by the blood
          which did run from my side. Only believe me; that is all I ask. And
          that I will give you. I will help you to believe." "Ah!" says one,
          "but I do not want a Saviour." Sir, I have nothing to say to you
          except this -- "The wrath to come! the wrath to come!" But there is
          one who says, "Sir, you do not mean what you say! Do you mean to
          preach to the most wicked men or women in the place?" I mean what I
          say. There she is! She is a harlot, she has led many into sin, and
          many into hell, There she is; her own friends have turned her out of
          doors; her father called her a good-for-nothing hussey, and said she
          should never come to the house again. Woman I dost thou repent? Dost
          thou feel thyself to be guilty? Christ died to save thee, and thou
          shalt be saved. There he is. I can see him. He was drunk; he has been
          drunk very often. Not many nights ago I heard his voice in the street,
          as he went home at a late hour on Saturday night, disturbing
          everybody; and he beat his wife, too. He has broken the Sabbath; and
          as to swearing, if oaths be like soot, his throat must want sweeping
          bad enough, for he has cursed God often. Do you feel yourself to be
          guilty, my hearer? Do you hate your sins, and are you willing to
          forsake them? Then I bless God for you. Christ died for you. Believe!
          I had a letter a few days ago, from a young man who heard that during
          this week I was going to a certain town. Said he, "Sir, when you come,
          do preach a sermon that will fit me; for do you know, sir, I have
          heard it said that we must all think ourselves to be the wickedest
          people in the world, or else we cannot be saved. I try to think so,
          but I cannot, because I have not been the wickedest. I want to think
          so, but I cannot. I want to be saved, but I do not know how to repent
          enough." Now, if I have the pleasure of seeing him, I shall tell him,
          God does not require a man to think himself the wickedest in the
          world, because that would sometimes be to think a falsehood; there are
          some men who are not so wicked as others are. What God requires is
          this, that a man should say, "I know more of myself than I do of other
          people; I know little about them, and from what I see of myself, not
          of my actions, but of my heart, I do think there can be few worse than
          I am. They may be more guilty openly, but then I have had more light,
          more privileges, more opportunities, more warnings, and therefore I am
          still guiltier." I do not want you to bring your brother with you, and
          say, "I am more wicked than he is;" I want you to come yourself, and
          say, "Father, I have sinned;" you have nothing to do with your brother
          William, whether he has sinned more or less; your cry should be,
          "Father, I have sinned;" you have nothing to do with your cousin Jane,
          whether or not she has rebelled more than you. Your business is to
          cry, "Lord, have mercy upon me, a sinner!" That is all. Do you feel
          yourselves lost? Again, I say, --
        </p>
        <p>"Come, and welcome, sinner, come!"</p>
        <p>
          To conclude. There is not a sinner in this place who knows himself to
          be lost and ruined, who may not have all his sins forgiven, and
          "rejoice in the hope of the glory of God." You may, though black as
          hell, be white as heaven this very instant. I know tis only by a
          desperate struggle that faith takes hold of the promise, but the very
          moment a sinner believes, that conflict is past. It is his first
          victory, and a blessed one. Let this verse be the language of your
          heart; adopt it, and make it your own:
        </p>
        <p>"A guilty weak, and helpless worm.</p>
        <p>In Christ's kind arms I fall;</p>
        <p>He is my strength and righteousness,</p>
        <p>My Jesus and my all."<br /></p>
