          "Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you
          by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God." -- 2
          Corinthians 5:20.
        </p>
        <p>
          THERE has long been war between man and his Maker. Our federal head,
          Adam, threw down the gauntlet in the garden of Eden. The trumpet was
          heard to ring through the glades of Paradise, the trumpet which broke
          the silence of peace and disturbed the song of praise. From that day
          forward until now there has been no truce, no treaty between God and
          man by nature. Man has been at variance with God. His heart has been
          at enmity towards God. He would not be reconciled to God. Never in the
          heart of any natural man, unless divine grace has put it there, has a
          desire to re-establish peace been felt or entertained. If any of you
          long to be at peace with your Maker, it is because his spirit has made
          you long for it. Left to yourselves, you would go from conflict to
          conflict, from struggle to struggle, and perpetuate the encounter,
          until it ended in your eternal destruction. But though man will not
          make terms with God, nor sue for peace at his hands, God shows his
          unwillingness any longer to be at war with man. That he anxiously
          desires man to be reconciled unto him, he proves by taking the first
          step. He, himself, sends his ambassadors. He does not invite them from
          the other party -- that were grace -- but he sends ambassadors, and he
          commands those ambassadors to be very earnest, and to plead with men,
          to pray them, to beseech them that they would be reconciled to God. I
          take this to be a sure pledge that there is love in the heart of God.
          Why, at the very announcement of these tidings, the rebellious
          sinner's ears should be opened! It were enough to make him say, "I
          will hearken diligently; I will hear what God the Lord shall speak,
          for if it be true that he takes the first step towards me, and that he
          is willing to make up this deadly quarrel, God forbid that I should
          turn away; I will even now hear and attend to all that God shall speak
          to my soul. "May he bless the message to you, that you may be
          reconciled to him without a moment's delay. John Bunyan puts it
          plainly enough." If a certain king be besieging a town, and he sends
          out the herald with a trumpet to threaten the inhabitants that, if
          they do not give up the town, he will hang every man of them, then
          straightway they come to the walls and give him back a reviling
          answer; they swear that they will fight it out, and will never
          surrender to such a tyrant. But if he sends an embassage with a white
          flag to tell them that, if they will but surrender and yield to their
          lawful king, he will pardon every one of them, even the very vilest of
          them will relent." Then, saith honest John, "do they not come
          trembling over the walls, and throw their gates wide open to receive
          their gracious monarch." Would that such a result might be
          accomplished to-night! While I speak of the great grace of this Prince
          of Peace, who now sends his ambassadors to the rebellious, may some
          rebel say, "Then I will be at peace with him; I will hold out no
          longer. So irresistible a love as this has dissolved my heart,
          resolved my choice, and constrained my allegiance."
        </p>
        <p>
          Well now, let us speak awhile of the Ambassadors -- the Commission
          with which they are entrusted -- the duty they have to discharge --
          and close with a question -- What then? First, then, we have to speak
          of: --
        </p>
        <p>I. THE AMBASSADORS.</p>
        <p>
          Welcome messengers are they! All nations, with one accord, have agreed
          to honour ambassadors. Strange, then, that all nations and all people
          should have conspired to dishonour the ambassadors of God! Which of
          God's ambassadors in the olden time was not persecuted, rejected, or
          slain? Were they not stoned, beheaded, sawn asunder? How continually
          they were maltreated, and made to wander about in sheep-skins and
          goat-skins, though of them the world was not worthy! But there have
          been some men to whom the ambassadors of God have always been welcome.
          The men whom God had ordained to eternal life. Those on whose behalf,
          from before all worlds, he had made an effectual covenant of peace.
          From them the ambassadors get a hearty welcome. Standing here to
          preach as an ambassador, I shall get but little attention from some of
          my audience. The proclamation of mercy will sound commonplace to many.
          They will turn on their heel and say, "There is nothing in it." But
          mark you, the ambassador of God will be very welcome to some of you,
          who have bitterly felt your estrangement, to some whose hearts are
          prepared by a sense of ruin for the good tidings of redemption; to
          some in whom the secret mystery of predestination begins to work by
          the overt energy of effectual calling. These shall find their souls
          greatly but surely drawn to the proclamation of mercy that shall be
          made, and they will say, "How beautiful upon the mountains are the
          feet of them that bring glad tidings of peace, that publish
          salvation!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Ambassadors are always specially welcome to a people who are engaged
          in a war which is beyond their strength, when their resources are
          exhausted, and the peril of defeat is imminent. If some tiny little
          principality has ventured to rebel against a great empire, when it is
          absolutely certain that its villages will be consumed, its provinces,
          ravaged, and that all its power will be crushed, ambassadors are
          pretty sure to receive a cordial welcome. Ah! man, thou best bid
          defiance to the King of Heaven, whose power is irresistible; by whom
          rocks are thrown down; whose voice breaketh the cedars of Lebanon;
          whose hand controlleth the great deep sea. He it, is who bindeth the
          clouds with a cord, and girdleth the earth with a belt! Angels that
          excel in strength cannot stand against him. From the lofty battlements
          of heaven he hurled down Satan, the great archangel, and the mighty
          host of rebellious morning stars! How canst thou stand against him;
          shall the stubble contend with the fire? Shall the potter's vessel
          resist the rod of iron? What art thou but a moth, easily crushed
          beneath his finger! The breath is in thy nostrils, and that is not
          thine own; how then canst thou, poor mortal, contend with him who only
          hath immortality? With art thou but a moth, easily crushed beneath his
          finger! Thy breath broken more rapidly than a sear leaf by the wind!
          How canst thou venture to be at war with one who has heaven and earth
          at his command, who holds the keys of hell and of death, and who has
          Tophet as his source of ammunition against thee? Listen to his
          thunders, and let thy blood curdle! Let his lightning flash, and how
          art thou amazed! How, then, canst thou stand against the greatness of
          his power, or endure the terror of his wrath? Happy for thee that
          terms of peace are proclaimed in your ears. God is willing to cease
          the warfare; he would not have thee be his adversary. Wilt thou not
          gladly accept what he proposeth to thee? Never, surely, was war more
          charged with disaster than that into which thou hast madly rushed.
        </p>
        <p>
          An ambassador is always welcome when the people have begun to feel the
          victorious force of the king. Yonder province has already yielded.
          Certain cities have been taken by the sword and given up to be sacked.
          Now the poor miserable inhabitants are glad enough to get peace. They
          dread the foot of the conqueror now that they have felt its weight.
          Doubtless there are some here present who have known the power of God
          in their conscience. Perhaps he has soared you with visions, and
          frightened you with dreams. Though it be but the voice of a man that
          you heard, yet the law has been very terrible to you, and now you find
          no pleasure in your pleasure; no joy in your joys. God has begun to
          break your bones with conviction; he has made you feel that sin is a
          bitter thing; he has made you drunken with wormwood, and broken your
          teeth with gravel stones. He has brought you down as the fool in the
          hundred and seventh Psalm, by affliction and by labour, and you are
          crying out in anguish, "God be merciful to me a sinner!" Ay,
          doubtless, you that have once felt the weight of God's hand upon your
          conscience, will rejoice to hear that there is an embassage of peace
          sent to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          An ambassador is likewise always welcome to those who are labouring
          under a few of total and speedy destruction. If none of you are in
          that plight, I remember when I was, when I thought every day it was a
          marvel of mercies that I was kept alive, and wondered as I woke at
          morn that I was not lifting up my eyes with Dives in hell. Everything
          about Christ was precious to me then! I think I would have stood in
          the most crowded chapel, nor would I have been weary had I sat upon
          the hardest seat; no length of service would have wearied me, might I
          but have had an inkling that God would peradventure have mercy upon my
          soul. My eyes were full of tears. My soul was faint with watching, and
          I would have kissed the feet of any man who would have told me the way
          of salvation. But, alas! it seemed as if no man cared for my soul,
          till at last God blessed an humble instrument to give light to his
          poor dark child. Hence I know that the news of mercy will be
          exceedingly welcome to you who stand upon the jaws of hell, fearing
          that the gates will soon be bolted upon you, and that you will be for
          ever lost. You will be ready to cry like our Methodist friends,
          "Hallelujah! Glory! Hallelujah! Bless the Lord!" whilst you hear that
          God still sends an embassage of peace to your soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most acceptable, too, is a messenger of peace if the people know that
          he brings no hard terms. When a certain king sent to the inhabitants
          of a town that he would make peace with them, provided he put out
          their right eyes and cut off their right hands, I am sure the tidings
          must have caused the utmost consternation, and the ambassador could
          not be very popular. But there are no hard terms in the gospel. In
          fact, there are no terms, no conditions at all. It is an unconditional
          peace which God makes with men. It is a gospel which asks nothing of
          men, but gives them everything. The Lord saith, "My oxen and my
          fatlings are killed; all things are ready, come ye to the supper."
          There is nothing for man to get ready; all things are prepared. The
          terms -- if I must use a word I do not like -- are simple and easy.
          "Believe, and live." With what joy should a rebellious sinner hear the
          voice of the ambassador who brings no hard conditions from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And should not the fame of the King increase the zest with which the
          embassage is received? Comes it not from him who cannot lie! No
          temporary peace is proposed that may presently be broken, but a peace
          that shall stand fast for ever and ever. No temporary armistice, no
          brief interlude between the deeds of battle do we herald. Peace;
          eternal, unbroken peace; peace that shall endure in life and outlive
          death; peace which shall endure throughout eternity, we testify and
          make known to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          This peace is proclaimed to all men. It is proclaimed without
          exception." Whosoever believeth in the Lord Jesus Christ shall be
          saved." None are excluded hence but those who do themselves exclude.
          Such an ambassador bringing such a message must surely be a welcome
          messenger from his God. Let us ask now, What is: --
        </p>
        <p>
          II. THE COMMISSION OF PEACE which God has entrusted us to proclaim?
          The words are concise, the sense is transparent." To wit, that God was
          in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their
          trespass unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of
          reconciliation. "Let us open the commission. It lies in a nutshell."
          Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, As I live, saith the Lord, I have no
          pleasure in the death of him that dieth, but had rather that he should
          turn unto me and live." "Come now, let us reason together, saith the
          Lord; though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as wool, though
          they be red like crimson they shall be whiter than snow. Our
          commission begins with the announcement that God is love, that he is
          full of pity and compassion, that he is desirous to receive his
          creature back, that he willeth to forgive, and that he electeth, if it
          be consistent with the high attribute of his justice, to accept even
          the most rebellious, and to put them amongst his children. Our
          commission goes on to disclose the manner, as well as the motive, of
          mercy. Inasmuch as God is love, he, in order to remove all
          difficulties in the way of pardoning rebels, has been pleased to give
          his only begotten Son that he might stand in the room, place, and
          stead of those whom God has chosen; their sins he engaged to take; to
          carry their sorrows, and to make an atonement on their behalf. Thus
          the justice of God should be satisfied, and his love flow over to the
          human race. We declare, therefore, that God has given Christ, and he
          has made it a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that he
          came into the world to save sinners, even the very chief. Christ, the
          Son of God, has become man. Cheerfully and willingly he took upon
          himself our nature; veiled the form of Deity in a humble garb of clay;
          was born of the Virgin Mary, lived a life of holiness, and died a
          death of sacrifice. Through this marvellous death of the Man, the God,
          Christ Jesus, God is at peace with his people. The peace is made
          already, for he is our peace. God is at peace with every man for whom
          Jesus died. Jesus Christ stood in the room, place, and steed of his
          chosen people. Christ was punished for their sins. Justice cannot
          punish twice for one offense. Christ, the substitute, being punished,
          the sinner cannot be amenable for his own offences. Those for whom
          Jesus died go free. The proclamation is that God is willing to be
          reconciled, that he is reconciled. It is an announcement, not that you
          may have peace merely, but that peace is made with God by Jesus Christ
          for you -- full peace, without condition, not half-made, but wholly
          made; the penalty being completely paid to the last doit, and the
          sacrifice completely slaughtered till the last drop of blood had
          expiated the last offence.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the proclamation needs something more to give us any satisfaction.
          Are there any tidings in it for you and me? Well, our message goes on
          to announce that whosoever in the wide world will come to Jesus
          Christ, and commit his cause to him as Redeemer, Saviour, and Friend,
          shall forthwith be at peace with God, receive full pardon for all
          offences, and be welcomed as a favourite of the Most High. He shall
          know that for him Jesus Christ did die in his stead, and as surety did
          stand for him when he appeared before God. From condemnation he is,
          therefore, free; of salvation he is, therefore, sure. This
          proclamation, I say, is to be made universally. Though every man will
          not be blessed by it, the preacher cannot discriminate between those
          who must and those who will not inherit the blessing. Though only some
          will accept it, the preacher is not warranted in showing any
          partiality. It is the Holy Spirit's work to impress the Word on the
          conscience, and to arouse the conscience by the Word. As for us, we
          are willing enough to turn our face to the north or to the south, to
          the east or to the west. Gladly would we proclaim it to the red man
          who hunts the savannahs of America, to the swarthy man who never heard
          the name of Christ before, or to the white man who has often heard,
          but never heeded it. The same message, that God has accepted Christ as
          a substitute for every man that will believe in Christ, and that
          whosoever trusts Christ to save him is in that moment saved, will
          suffice for all. Yea, we would tell them that before the sinner does
          trust Christ he is reconciled unto God by his death, because the
          atonement which he offered had been accepted, and there was peace
          forestalled between God and that sinner. What a message I have to
          present! What a proclamation I have to make! Nothing is necessary on
          your part. God expects nothing of you to merit his esteem, or to
          enhance the value of his gift. If repentance be indispensable, he is
          prepared to give it to you. If a tender heart be needed, he is ready
          to give you a heart of flesh. If you feel that you have a heart of
          stone, be has engaged to take it away. Does your guilt oppress you, he
          says, "I will sprinkle clean water, water of pure fountains, upon
          them, and they shall be cleansed from all their filthiness, and from
          all their uncleanness will I save them." Know, all men, that there is
          no exception made. When Charles II came back to England there was an
          amnesty, except for certain persons, and these were mentioned by name
          -- Hugh Peters and others were proscribed; but there is no exception
          here. I find not any traitors singled out and denounced by name. I
          have to proclaim an indemnity of such universal import that it is
          indiscriminate, "Whosoever believeth on him shall never perish, but
          shall have everlasting life."
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, there is no exception made in my commission to any form of
          sin -- unless it be the sin against the Holy Ghost -- which carries
          its own evidence as well as its consequence. Those to whom I now
          speak, if they feel any drawings of heart towards God have not
          committed that mortal crime. Murder, theft, forgery, felony,
          fornication, adultery, and covetousness, which is idolatry -- black
          and hideous as is the catalogue -- here is pardon for the whole.
          Ransack the kennels, however filthy; rake the slums, however odious;
          drag out the abominations of the age, however degrading; here is
          pardon not only possible, probable, but positive. Bring a man here who
          has stained himself crimson all over with every sort of infamy, though
          it be not the lapse of an hour, but the habit of a life, yet God is
          still able to forgive. Jesus Christ is able to save to the uttermost
          them that come unto God by him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not know whether you find it very good to hear the proclamation,
          but I do know that I feel it most gratifying to utter it. Thrice happy
          am I to have such an announcement to make to rebels. Unwonted hearers,
          listen to my voice. By what strange chance have yon reckless,
          heedless, unconverted souls mingled with this throng of worshippers?
          Not often do you darken the floor of a place of worship. You hardly
          know how you were led to come in hither. To what depths of sin you
          have run, to what extremities of iniquity you have gone! You marvel to
          find yourself in the company of God's people. But since you are here,
          give heed to the message," Thus saith the Lord, I have blotted out
          like a cloud thine iniquities, and like a thick cloud thy sins. Return
          unto me, for I am married unto thee. I have given my blood to redeem
          thee. Return, O wandering child of man; return, return, and I will
          have mercy upon thee, for I am God, and not man." Having thus opened
          my commission, I will endeavour to perform: --
        </p>
        <p>III. A VERY SOLEMN DUTY.</p>
        <p>
          My text supplies me with a warrant. It says, "As though God did
          beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled
          unto God." Then it seems we have not merely to read our commission,
          but we have to beseech you to accept it. Why should we beseech you? Is
          it not because you are rational creatures, not automata, men not
          machines. A machine might be compelled to perform functions without
          persuasion, but the Spirit of God often acts upon the heart of man by
          the sound arguments and affectionate entreaties of his servants whom
          he commissions. We are to beseech you because your hearts are so hard
          that you are prone to defy God's power, and resist his grace.
          Therefore, we pray you to put down your weapons. We are to beseech you
          because you are unbelieving, and will not credit the tidings. You say
          it is too good to be true that God will have mercy on such as you are.
          Therefore, we are to put our hand on you, to go down on our knees to
          you, and to beseech you not to put away this blessed embassy. We are
          to beseech you because you are so proud and self-satisfied that you
          will sooner follow your own righteousness and cling to your own works,
          than accept a peace already and freely proffered to you. We are to
          beseech you because you are careless. You give little heed to what is
          spoken: you will go your way and forget all our proclamations;
          therefore, are we to press you urgently, instantly, importunately, And
          to beseech you as when a mother pleadeth for her child's life, as when
          a condemned criminal beseeches the judge to have pity on him, so are
          we to beseech you. I think I never feel so conscious of my own
          weakness as when I have to ply you thus with exhortations. Oh! there
          have been a few times in my ministry when I could with flowing eyes
          beseech you to be reconciled to God, but these dry eyes of mine are
          not so often fountains of tears as I could wish. We need such an one
          as Richard Baxter to dilate upon this last part of the text. Perhaps
          we could handle the former part better than he, but he could handle
          this last far better than we can. Oh! how he would have summoned you
          by the terrible reality of things to come! With what glaring eyes and
          seething words he would say, "Oh! men, turn ye, turn ye, why will ye
          die? By the need of a Saviour you will feel in the pangs of parting
          life, when the pulsings shall be few and feeble, till with a gasp you
          shall expire; by the resurrection when you will wake up, if not in his
          likeness, to everlasting shame and contempt; by the judgment-seat,
          where your sins shall be published, and you shall be called to account
          for the deeds done in the body; by the dread decree which casteth into
          the pit for ever those that repent, not; by the heaven you will lose:,
          and by the hell into which you will fall; by eternity, that dread
          eternity whose years never waste; by the wrath to come, the burning
          indignation of which shall never cool; by the immortality of your own
          souls, by the perils you now run, by the promises you despise, by the
          provocations you multiply, by the penalties you accumulate, we do
          beseech you to be reconciled to God." Fly to Jesus. Call upon his
          name. Trust him; his word; his work, his goodness and his grace. This
          is the way of reconciliation. Bow the knee and kiss the Son. We do
          conjure you to do so. Acquaint yourselves now with God, and be at
          peace with him. My text bangs like a crushing weight upon my soul at
          this moment. It is awful in its grandeur, and it is majestically full
          of divine love. I must read the words again in your hearing. Oh! that
          the sense might break in on your understanding!
        </p>
        <p>
          We are to beseech you as though God did beseech you, and we to do it
          in Christ's stead. You see God speaks when his ambassadors speak. I
          wonder, oh! I wonder, whether I have brain enough to compass the
          thought of how God would beseech you to be reconciled! 'Tis the
          Father's own self-pleading with his prodigal son. Can you imagine the
          father in the parable going after his son, and finding him in rags
          feeding swine? Can you conceive him saying, "My son, my dear son, come
          back! come back and I will forgive you all!" You think you hear that
          son saying to his father "Get you gone, I will not hear of it", till
          his father says "My dear son, why will you prefer the company of swine
          to your father's house? Why will you wear rags when you might be
          clothed in the best robe? Why will you starve in a far-off country
          when my house shall be full of feasting on your return?" What if that
          son should utter some indignant word, and tell his father to his face
          he never would go back! Oh! I think I see the venerable, loving man
          falling on his son's neck and kissing him, in his filth just as he is
          (for "the great love wherewith he loved us when we were dead in
          trespasses and sins!") -- and he says to the rebel that insults him
          and resents his tenderness, "My dear son, you must come back; I must
          have you; I cannot be without you. I must have you; come back!" In
          such a style we ought to plead with men. Ah! then, I cannot plead with
          you as I would. As though God himself, your offended Maker, came to
          you now as he did to Adam in the cool of the day, and said to you,
          "Oh! return to me, for I have loved thee with an everlasting love,"
          even so, as though God spoke, would I woo you, ye chiefest sinners, to
          return to him. You know, dear friends, that the great God did send
          another ambassador, and that great ambassador was Christ. Now the
          Apostle says that we, the ministers, are ambassadors for Christ in
          Christ's stead. Christ is no more an ambassador; he has gone to
          heaven; we stand in his stead to the sons of men, not to make peace,
          but to proclaim it. What! am I then to speak in Christ's stead! But
          how can I picture my Lord Jesus standing here? Alas, my imagination is
          not equal to the task. Would that I had sympathy enough with him to
          put myself in his case so as to use his words. Methinks I see him
          looking at this great throng as once he looked at the inhabitants of
          Jerusalem. He turns his head round to these galleries, and about on
          yonder aisles, and at last he bursts into a flood of tears, saying,
          "How often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen
          gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not." He is
          choked with tears, and when he has paused a moment, he cries, "Come
          unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
          rest; take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly
          of heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls; a bruised reed I
          will not break, nor quench the smoking flax."
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, I think I see him, as he looks at you again, and when he
          observes some hearts so obdurate and hard that they will not melt, he
          unwraps his mantle, and exclaims, "See here." Do you mark the gash in
          his side? As he lifts his hands and shows the nail-prints, and points
          downward to his pierced feet, he says, "By these, my wounds, which I
          endured when suffering for you, O my people, return unto me; come, bow
          at my feet, and take the peace which I have wrought out for you. Oh!
          be not faithless, but believing! Doubt no longer! God is reconciled!
          Tremble no more! Peace is established. Toil no more at the works of
          the law, cling not to your own doings. Cease to consult your feelings.
          It is finished. When I bowed my head upon the tree, I finished all for
          you. Take salvation: take it now! Come to me; come now to me just as
          you are." Alas! this is but a poor representation of my Lord and
          Master. I could wish myself laid among the clods of the valley,
          sleeping in my grave, rather than that I should be so poor an
          ambassador. But, Lord, wherefore didst thou choose thy servant, and
          why givest thou this people still to hear his voice, if thou wilt not
          more mightily enable him to plead with men. I have no more words, oh!
          let these, tears plead with you. I feel that I could freely give my
          life if it would avail for the saving of your souls. Fain would I meet
          a martyr's death, if you would be persuaded thereby to come to Christ,
          for life. But oh! sinners, no pleading of mine will ever prevail if
          the pleading of Christ prove ineffectual with you. To each one of you,
          a distinct proclamation of salvation is addressed. Whosoever among you
          will believe that Christ died, and that he is able to save you, and
          will trust your soul upon what he did, shall be saved. Oh! why reject
          him? He will not hurt nor harm you. Do lay hold of this good hope, for
          your time is short! Death is hastening on; eternity is near! Do lay
          hold of it, for hell is hot, the, flames thereof are terrible! Lay
          hold of it, for heaven is bright, and the harps of angels are sweet
          beyond compare! Lay hold of it. It shall make your heart glad on
          earth, it shall charm away your fears and remove your griefs! Lay hold
          of it! It shall bear you through Jordan's billows, and land you safe
          on Canaan's side. Oh! by the love of the Father, by the, blood of
          Jesus, by the love of the Spirit, I beseech you, sinner, believe and
          live! By the cross and the five wounds, by the agony and bloody sweat,
          by the resurrection, and by the ascension, sinner, believe and live!
          By every argument that would touch your nature, by every motive that
          can sway your reason or stir your passions, in the name of God that
          sent me, by the Almighty that made you, by the Eternal Son that
          redeemed you, by the gift of the Holy Spirit, sinner, I command you,
          with divine authority to sanction my vehemence, that ye be reconciled
          to God through the death of his Son! And: --
        </p>
        <p>IV. WHAT THEN?</p>
        <p>
          When we have answered this question we shall have done. What then? Are
          there not some of you with whom this peace is made at this good hour?
          I will go back and tell my Master so. Then there shall be fresh
          ratifications between you and him. The angels will hear of it, and
          they will strike their harps anew to sweeter lays than they have known
          before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others there are of you that will not be reconciled. I must have an
          answer from you. Do you hesitate? Do you delay? Do you refuse? You
          shall never have another warning, some of you! No tears of pity shall
          be wept for you again; no loving heart shall ever bid you come to
          Christ again must have your answer now. Yes or no. Wilt thou be damned
          or not? Wilt thou be saved or not? I will not have thee say, "When I
          have a more convenient season I will send for thee." Sinner, it cannot
          be a more convenient one than this. This is a convenient place; it is
          God's house. It is a convenient time; it is the Lord's day. Now,
          sinner, wilt thou be reconciled, restored, forgiven? "Wilt thou be
          made whole?" said Jesus, and I say the same to thee, "Wilt thou be
          made whole?" Do you say, "No"? Must I take that for an answer? Mark
          you, sinner, I have to tell my Master must tell him when I seek the
          closet of the King to-night; I must tell him your reply that you would
          not. What then remains for an ambassador to do when he has spoken to
          you in the name of the Sovereign? If you will not turn, we must shake
          off the dust of our feet against you. I am clear, I am clear, of the
          blood of you all, I am clear. If you perish, being warned, you perish
          wantonly. The wrath cometh upon you, not on him who, to the best of
          his power, has told his Master's message. Yet again, I beg you to
          accept it. Do you still say no? The white flag will be pulled down. It
          has been up long enough. Shall I pull it down, and run up the red flag
          now? Shall I hurl threatenings at you because you heed not entreaties?
        </p>
        <p>"If your ears refuse</p>
        <p>The language of his grace,</p>
        <p>And hearts grow hard like stubborn Jews,</p>
        <p>That unbelieving race,</p>
        <p>The Lord in anger drest,</p>
        <p>Shall lift his trend and swear</p>
        <p>Ye that despised my promised rest</p>
        <p>Shall have no portion there."</p>
        <p>
          But no, I cannot pull it down, that white flag! My heart will not let
          me do so; it shall fly there still, it shall fly there as a sign and a
          symbol of the day of grace. Mercy is still held out to you. But there
          is one coming -- I can hear his footsteps -- who will pull down that
          white flag. The vision haunts my eyes. That grim, heartless skeleton
          whom men call Death will rend the white flag from its place, and up
          will go the blood-red flag, with the black escutcheon of the
          thunderbolts. Where are you then, sinners? Where will you be then? You
          shudder at the thought. He lays his hand on you. There is no escape.
          Oh! turn ye, turn ye, turn ye! Come and welcome, sinner, come now
          while you are welcome. 'Tis love invites you. Jesus stretches out his
          hand to you all the day long. He has stretched out his hands to a
          rebellious, and a gainsaying generation. Do not say, "I will think of
          it," but yield to his love who around you now the bands of a man doth
          cast. Do not make a resolution, but commit yourself to the good
          confession. Now, even now, may sovereign grace constrain, and
          irresistible love draw you. May you believe with your heart, may you
          record your profession at once. Before you close your eyes in sleep,
          just as you would wish before your eyes are closed in death, may you
          be at peace with God. I pray God, as I entreat you, that this may come
          to pass, for his Son, Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.<br />
