        <p>"For I know that my Redeemer liveth," -- Job 19:25.</p>
        <p>
          I DARESAY you know that there are a great many difficulties about the
          translation of this passage. It is a very complicated piece of Hebrew,
          partly, I suppose, owing to its great antiquity, being found in what
          is, probably, one of the oldest Books of the Bible. Besides that,
          different persons have tried to translate it according to their own
          varying views. The Jews stiffly fight against the notion of the
          Messiah and his resurrection being found in this verve, while many
          Christian commentators see here everything that we can find in the New
          Testament, and translate the passage as though Job were as well
          instructed in this matter as we are now that Christ "hath brought life
          and immortality to light through the gospel." Others say that, while
          there is, no doubt, a reference to the person and the resurrection of
          Christ, yet it is not so vivid as some seem to think.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personally, I am quite satisfied with the translation given in our
          Authorized Version; yet it has occurred to me that, possibly, Job
          himself may not have known the full meaning of all that he said.
          Imagine the patriarch driven into a corner, badgered by his so-called
          friends, charged by them with all manner of evils until he is quite
          boiling over with indignation, and, at the same time, smarting under
          terrible bodily diseases and the dreadful losses which he has
          sustained; and, at last, he bursts out with this exclamation, "I shall
          be vindicated one day; I am sure I shall. I know that my Vindicator
          liveth. I am sure that, there is One who will vindicate me; and if he
          never clears my name and reputation as long as I live, it will be done
          afterwards. There must be a just God, in heaven, who will see me
          righted; and even though worms devour my body until the last relic of
          it has passed away, I do verily believe that, somehow, in the far-off
          ages, I shall be vindicated." He, throws his faith forward to some
          tremendous era which he anticipates, and he declares that there will
          be found then, as he believes there is alive even now, a Goel, a
          Kinsman, an Avenger, who will stand up for him, and set right all this
          wrong. He cannot conceive that God will permit such gross injustice to
          be done as for a man, who has walked as he has walked, to be brought
          so low, and then to be stung with such unfounded accusations; he is
          positive that there must be a Vindicator for him somewhere, and he
          appeals to that last dread tribunal, which he dimly sees in the
          far-off future, and he believes that someone will be found to stand up
          successfully for him there.
        </p>
        <p>
          If that be the case, you will see that Job was driven, perhaps beyond
          his former knowledge, by his very pains and trials. He may but dimly
          have perceived a future state, but his condition revealed to him the
          necessity for such a state. He felt that, if the righteous suffer so
          much in this life, often apparently without any just cause, and if the
          wicked prosper, then there must be another state in which God will set
          right the wrongs of this, and rectify the apparent inequalities of his
          providence here. Job realized that; and, possibly, his deep griefs may
          have been the channel of another revelation to him, namely, that there
          was a mysterious Divine Being, concerning whom that dark prophecy had
          been handed down from the garden of Eden itself, "The Seed of the
          woman shall bruise the serpent's head." He felt sure that, for those
          who were wronged as he had been, there must be an Advocate provided.
          He had before complained that there was no Umpire -- no "Daysman" --
          to stand between them both; but now he asks for an Advocate, and he
          feels that there must be one, yea, he knows that there is, and he
          declares that, somewhere or other, there is an Advocate who will, some
          day or other, set right all that concerns him, let things go now as
          they may. So, possibly, Job was seeing more than he had ever seen
          before of that mysterious One who pleads the cause of those who are
          oppressed, and shows himself strong, on their behalf, at the right
          hand of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am not going to enter into any discussion of the matter, but shall
          use the passage in the full Evangelical sense. Job may have known all
          that we now know concerning Christ, for he may have had special
          revelations and manifestations. We do not find all that we know in his
          Book, yet he may have meant all that I shall say in this discourse. If
          he did not mean it, I trust that we shall, under the gracious guidance
          of the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I shall speak first upon this point, -- JOB HAD A TRUE FRIEND AND
          HIS MISTAKEN FRIENDS.
        </p>
        <p>
          These men were miserable comforters, but Job had a real Comforter,
          they were estranged from him, but he had a true Friend left; so he
          said, "I know that my Goel liveth." That is the Hebrew word; I suppose
          you all know that it means the person nearest akin to him, who,
          because he was nearest akin, was bound to take up his cause. If a man
          was slain by misadventure, the goel pursued the one who had slain him,
          and endeavored to avenge his death. If a person fell into debt, and
          was sold into slavery because of the debt, his goel, if he was able,
          had to redeem him; and hence we get the word "redeemer." Or if estates
          became mortgaged through poverty, it was the duty of the next of kin
          to redeem them, if possible; so again we get the idea of redeemer. But
          the word "goel" is more comprehensive than the word redeemer, so we
          will begin with its first meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Job, in the midst of his false friends, had One whom he called his
          kinsman. "I know," he said, "that my Kinsman liveth." We interpret
          that word "Kinsman" as meaning our Lord Jesus Christ, and we sing, --
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus, our Kinsman and our God,</p>
        <p>Arrayed in majesty and blood,</p>
        <p>Thou art our life, our souls in thee</p>
        <p>Possess a full felicity."</p>
        <p>
          I want you, just now, to think of Jesus Christ as your Kinsman if you
          are really in him, for he is indeed the nearest akin to you of any, --
          bone of your bone, and flesh of your flesh. "Forasmuch then as the
          children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise
          took part of the same." Now, your own flesh and blood, as you call
          them, are not so near to you in real kinship as Jesus is; for, often,
          you will find flesh and blood near akin by birth but not by sympathy.
          Two brothers may be, spiritually, very different from one another, and
          may not be able to enter into each other's trials at all; but this
          Kinsman participates in every pang that rends your heart; he knows
          your constitution, your weakness, your sensitiveness, the particular
          trial that cuts you to the quick, for in all your afflictions he was
          afflicted. Thus he is nearer to you than the nearest of earthly kin
          can possibly be, for he enters more fully into the whole of your life;
          he seems to have gone through it all, and he still goes through it all
          in his constant sympathy with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ's kinship with his people is to be thought of with great
          comfort because it is voluntary. We have some, perhaps, who are akin
          to us, yet, who wish they were not. Many a time, when a rich man has
          poor relations, he is half ashamed of the kinship between them, and
          wishes that it did not exist. Shame upon him for thinking so! But our
          Lord Jesus Christ's relationship to us is no accident of birth; it was
          voluntarily assumed by him. He would be one with us because he loved
          us; nothing could satisfy him till he had come to this earth, and been
          made one flesh with his Church. "For this cause," it is said
          concerning marriage, "shall a man leave his father and mother, and
          shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. This
          is a great mystery," said Paul; "but I speak concerning Christ and the
          Church." And, verily, so was it with Christ, as the poet sings, --
        </p>
        <p>"'Yea,' saith the Lord, 'with her I'll go</p>
        <p>Through all the depths of care and woe;</p>
        <p>And on the cross will even dare</p>
        <p>The bitter pangs of death to bear.'"</p>
        <p>
          This he did because he would be one flesh with his people, and that is
          a very near kinship which comes as close as that, and which willingly
          does so, -- not by force; but by voluntary choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, further, this is a kinship of which Jesus is never ashamed. We
          have known or heard of the prosperous man who has been ashamed of his
          poor old mother, and of the educated young man who has looked down
          with scorn upon the very father who has toiled and slaved in order to
          give him the advantages of such an education. It is disgraceful that
          there should ever be such ingrates; but it is written concerning our
          great Kinsman, "He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are
          all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren."
          He declares to the whole universe, concerning those persecuted ones,
          those who are ridiculed as being fools, "They are my brethren." The
          Prince of glory, whose fingers are adorned with stars of light like
          rings of priceless value, calls the poor bedridden woman, who, is a
          child of God, his sister, and calls the humble, toiling, laboring man,
          who walks with him, his brother; and he is not ashamed to do so.
          Think, beloved, with intensest gratitude, of this great Kinsman of
          yours, who is so near of kin to you, -- voluntarily near of kin, and
          not ashamed to own the kinship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, too, that your Kinsman liveth in this respect, -- that he
          will always be your Kinsman. The closest ties of earthly relationship
          must, to a great extent, end in death, for there are no husbands and
          wives, as such, in heaven. There cannot be, "for in the resurrection
          they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels
          of God in heaven." There are other ties, of a spiritual kind, that,
          will far outshine the best of bonds that linked us together here; but,
          when all other ties are broken, Jesus will always be our Kinsman, our
          Brother. We shall find the fraternal relationship better understood,
          more fully enjoyed, and more clearly manifested up there than it ever
          can be here. When all other relationships are growing dim, this
          blessed eternal kinship will shine out the more brightly. So I want
          all of you, who truly love, the Lord Jesus Christ, to interpret my
          text in this way: "I know that my Kinsman liveth," and to feel how
          honored you are to have such a Kinsman as Christ is. Ruth was highly
          privileged in having such a kinsman as Boaz, who was not content, for
          her to glean in his fields, but who took her as his wife; and your
          great Kinsman intends that you should be betrothed unto him for ever,
          and he will bring you to his heavenly home at the marriage supper of
          the Lamb.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a second meaning to the word goel, arising out of the first,
          -- Job's kinsman would become his Vindicator. It was the kinsman's
          duty to defend the rights of his needy relative, so Job intended here
          to say, "I know that my Vindicator liveth;" and the Lord Jesus Christ
          is the Vindicator of his people from all false charges. It is not easy
          for Christians to live in this world without being slandered and
          misrepresented; certainly, those of us who live in the full blaze of
          public life can hardly utter a word without having it twisted, and
          tortured, and misconstrued. We are often represented as saying what we
          loathe even to think; yet we must not be surprised at that. The world
          loves lying, -- it always has done so, and it always will. Even in
          private life you may meet with similar cruel treatment; there are some
          of God's best children who lie under reproach by the year together.
          The very things which they would not tolerate for a moment are laid to
          their charge, and they are thought to be guilty of them, and even good
          people hold up their hands in pious horror at them, though they are
          perfectly innocent all the while. Well, beloved, ever remember that
          your Vindicator liveth. Do not, be too much concerned to clear your
          own character; above all, do not attempt to vindicate yours in a court
          of law, but say to yourself, "I know that my Vindicator liveth." When
          he cometh, "then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the
          kingdom of their Father." His people may be under a cloud now; but,
          when he appeareth, the cloud shall break, and their true glory shall
          be seen. The greater the obloquy under which any of us have unjustly
          lived on earth, the greater will be the joy and the honor which will
          be vouchsafed to us in the day when Christ shall clear our character
          from all the shameful aspersions that have been brought against us.
          All will be cleared up in that day, so leave the accusations alone,
          knowing that your Vindicator liveth.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is another most comforting thought, -- that our Vindicator will
          clear us from true charges as well as false ones. As for the false
          charges, what do they matter? It is the true ones that really concern
          us: can Christ clear us from them? Yes, that he can. Remember how the
          apostle John writes, "If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the
          Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." You see, it is not merely, if we
          have been said to sin when we did not, but if we really sin, "we have
          an Advocate with the Father." O blessed Advocate, how dost thou clear
          thy people of the sin which they have actually committed? Why, in this
          way; he took it up himself, -- the awful load of their guilt, -- and
          suffered the full penalty far it. So there he stands before the
          eternal throne, to plead their cause; and, as he does so, he says,
          "Those sins, committed by my people, -- I have taken them upon myself,
          and suffered in the room, and place, and stead of all who will believe
          in me." O thou blessed Kinsman, how glorious art thou in thy grace, in
          that thou hast so completely undertaken our cause that thou hast been
          made sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in
          thee! Yes, beloved, Jesus will plead the merit of his precious broad
          and his spotless righteousness; and, before that powerful pleading,
          our sins and our transgressions shall sine beneath the flood, and
          shall not be remembered against us any more for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          In that day, too, our Vindicator will defend us against all the
          accusations of Satan. Our great adversary often assails and attacks us
          here, and the Lord says to him, as he did concerning Joshua the high
          priest, "The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen
          Jerusalem rebuke thee! "We may tell the devil, when we stand foot to
          foot with him, and are sore beset, that our Vindicator liveth, and we
          may quote to him that grand promise, "The God of peace shall bruise
          Satan under your feet shortly," because our Vindicator, who is to
          bruise the serpent's head, still liveth. The old serpent may nibble at
          your heel for a while, as he did at your Master's, but you, in the
          strength of your Lord, shall bruise his head; and whatsoever other
          adversary of your soul there may be, at any time, rest you in quiet
          confidence. Even if that adversary is permitted to prevail over you
          for a while, say unto him, "Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when
          I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a
          light unto me." So you have two meanings of the word goel, -- my
          Kinsman, my Vindicator, liveth. I hope you who are greatly tempted and
          tried, and you who are persecuted and oppressed, will catch that
          second meaning, and commit your cause unto God. "Dearly beloved,
          avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath; for it is
          written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." Be slow to
          anger; fret not yourselves because of the wicked man that prospereth
          in his evil way, and think not of being revenged upon your oppressors.
          In patience and quietness possess your souls, knowing that your time
          of vindication will surely come, for your Vindicator liveth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the third meaning of the word goel certainly is redeemer, so Job
          could say, "I know that my Redeemer liveth." As I have already said,
          the next of kin, in the process of vindicating his poor Kinsman, was
          accustomed to redeem him from bondage, or to redeem any part of his
          estate that might be under mortgage. So, let us next think of how the
          Lord Jesus Christ hath redeemed us from bondage. Having broken the law
          of God, we were in bondage to that law; we had received the spirit of
          bondage again to fear. But we, who have believed in Jesus, our
          Kinsman, can say that he hath redeemed us from the curse of the law,
          being made a curse for us, and that we are no longer in bondage. We
          were also in bondage under sin, as Paul wrote, "I am carnal, sold
          under sin;" but Christ has come, and broken the power of sin in us, so
          that its reigning power is subdued; and though it still striveth to
          get the mastery, and often maketh us to groan within ourselves, even
          as Paul did, yet do we, with him, thank God, who giveth us the
          victory, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two redemptions, -- redemption by price and redemption by
          power, and both of these Christ hath wrought for us; -- by price, by
          his sacrifice upon the cross of Calvary; and by power, by his Divine
          Spirit coming into our heart, and renewing our soul. Ought we not
          unceasingly to bless the Lord who hath redeemed us from under the law,
          having paid the penalty for the commands which we had broken, and who
          hath also redeemed us from the power of sin? "I know that my Redeemer
          liveth," then I know that I am a free man; for if the Son makes us
          free, then are we free indeed. I know that he paid the price for my
          soul's eternal redemption, then may my soul continually exult in him,
          and rejoice in the liberty wherewith he hath made me free.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, as I have already reminded you, the redeemer was also accustomed
          to redeem the estate as well as the person of his kinsman. We had lost
          everything. Father Adam had put everything under a heavy mortgage, and
          we could not even meet the interest on it; but the whole estate is
          unmortgaged now, even to paradise itself. Does someone ask, "Is there
          not any mortgage even upon paradise?" I answer, -- No; for Christ said
          to the dying thief, "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise;" so it
          is clear that he has entered paradise, and claimed it on his people's
          behalf. Jesus Christ hath said, in the words of the psalmist, "I
          restored that which I took not away." Bankrupt debtors, through the
          Lord's sovereign grace, you are no longer under any liabilities
          because of your sin if Christ be accepted by you as your Goel and
          Redeemer. He hath restored to you the estates which your first father,
          Adam, had lost; and he hath made you heirs of God, and joint heirs
          with Jesus Christ, through the wondrous redemption which he wrought
          for you upon the cross of Calvary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suck the honey, if you can, out of these three glorious truths, and
          you will be able to do so in proportion as you can personally use the
          words of the text, "'I know that my Redeemer liveth.' I know that he
          lives who will vindicate my character, and rectify my wrongs. I know,
          too, that he lives who hath redeemed me from sin and hell; and even
          though I die, I know that he will redeem me from the power of the
          grave, and that he will enable me to say, 'O death, where is thy
          sting? O grave, where is thy victory?'"
        </p>
        <p>
          Dwell on the remembrance that you have such a Divine Helper, and then
          let us pass on to another thought, at which I will only briefly hint
          as I proceed to another part of my theme.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second point, is this,-JOB HAD REAL PROPERTY AMID ABSOLUTE
          POVERTY.
        </p>
        <p>
          Job had lost everything, -- every stick and stone that he possessed,
          he had lost his children, and he had lost his wife, too, for all
          practical purposes, for she had not acted like a wife to him in his
          time of trial. Poor Job, he had lost everything else, but he had not
          lost his Redeemer. Notice, he does not say, "I know that my wife and
          my children live;" but he says, "I know that my Redeemer liveth." Ah!
          "my Redeemer," -- he has not lost him, so he has the best of all
          possessions still left. Looking up to him, by faith, with the tears of
          joy standing in his eyes, he says, "Yes, he is my Redeemer, and he
          still lives; I accept him as mine, and I will cling to him for ever."
          Can you, beloved friends, not merely rejoice in Christ as the
          Redeemer, but also as your Redeemer? Have you personally accepted him
          as your Redeemer? Have you personally trusted him with your soul,
          wholly and really; and do you already feel in your own heart, a
          kinship to this great Kinsman, a trust in this great Vindicator, a
          reliance upon his great redemption? Another man's redemption is of no
          value to my soul; the sweetness lies in the little word "my" -- "my
          Redeemer." Luther used to say that the marrow of the gospel is found
          in the pronouns, and I believe it is: "my Redeemer." Say, with me,
          each one of you for himself or herself, --
        </p>
        <p>"My faith would lay her hand</p>
        <p>On that dear head of thine,</p>
        <p>While like a penitent I stand,</p>
        <p>And there confess my sin.</p>
        <p>"My soul looks back to see</p>
        <p>The burdens thou didst bear,</p>
        <p>When hanging on the cursed tree</p>
        <p>And hopes her guilt was there."</p>
        <p>
          If you really do rely upon Christ's atoning sacrifice, and so take him
          as your Redeemer, you may not only hope your guilt was there, but you
          may know that it was. There, poor man, you may not have a penny in
          your pocket, but if you can truly say, "my Redeemer," you are
          infinitely better off than a millionaire who cannot say that. Thou,
          who knowest not where thou wilt have a lodging to-night, if thou canst
          truly say, "my Redeemer," thou needest not envy the very angels of
          God, for, in this respect, thou art ahead even of them, for they can
          call him "Lord", but not "Redeemer." He is not so near akin to them as
          he is to thee, "for verily he took not on him the nature of angels;
          but he took on him the seed of Abraham." He took your nature and mine,
          beloved, for Christ became a man.
        </p>
        <p>
          So Job had something real and valuable left even when he had lost all
          his property.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Thirdly, Job seems to lay stress upon the word "liveth": "I know
          that my Redeemer liveth." This teaches us that JOB HAD A LIVING
          KINSMAN AMID A DYING FAMILY.
        </p>
        <p>
          All his children were dead. We cannot easily estimate the full force
          of that blow upon the patriarch's heart. The loss of one child is a
          very painful event, even when the child is a very little one, and the
          parents have many others left; but it is a far worse bereavement when
          the children, who are taken away, are grown up, as Job's were. They
          were evidently a very united family, who used to meet in each other's
          houses for mutual fellowship. They seem to have been a very happy
          family, and they were certainly a family under very gracious
          influences, for Job was accustomed, after their days of festival, to
          offer sacrifices for them, lest they should have sinned against the
          Lord. Altogether, it was a fine family, -- seven sons and three
          daughters; -- and now they were all gone at once! To lose all one's
          family at once, like that, is a heavy stroke that nose can measure but
          those who have felt it. All were! gone, -- the whole ten at once! That
          was sad for poor Job, but it was most blessed that he was able to say,
          "Though my children are all dead, 'I know that my Redeemer liveth.'
          He, is not dead, and in him I find more than all that I have lost."
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at your Lord, dear friend, if you are mourning, just now, the
          sons of loved ones, and see whether he is not better to you than ten
          sons and daughters. See whether there is not, in his heart, room
          enough for that affection, which has been so rudely snapped, to grow
          again. The tendrils of your soul want something to cling to, and to
          twist around; then let them swine around him. Rejoice that he lives in
          a dying world. If you walk through the cemetery, or stand by the open
          grave, how blessedly these words seem to fall upon your spirit, like
          the music of angels, "These are dead, but 'I know that my Redeemer
          liveth,' -- liveth on, liveth in power, liveth in happiness, liveth
          with a life which he communicates to all who trust him. He lives, and
          therefore I shall live with him. He lives, and therefore the dead, who
          are in him, shall live for ever." O blessed truth!
        </p>
        <p>
          You will yourself die soon, dear friend; no, I must correct myself,
          you will not die, for it is not death for one who knows the Saviour to
          die. You will fall asleep in him, one of these days, at the very hour
          that God has appointed; and when you open your eyes, it will not be in
          the narrow death-chamber, you will not be on the bed of sickness.
          Methinks you will be startled to find yourself amid such new
          surroundings. "What is this I hear?" you will say. "Such music as this
          has never charmed me before, and what is that I see?". "But you will
          not need to enquire, for you will know that face at once. You knew,
          while on earth, that Jesus still lived; but you will know it better
          then, when you lay aside these heavy optics that do but dim our sight,
          and get into the pure spirit state, and then see HIM. Oh, the bliss of
          that first sight of Christ! It seems to me as if that would gather up
          an eternity of delight into a single moment; that first glimpse of him
          will be enough to make us swoon away with excessive rapture. I do
          verily think that some, saints, whom I have known, have done just
          that, -- swooned away with the excess of joy that they have felt in
          their departing moments. I have, sounding in my ears just now, the
          voice of a dear brother, by whose bedside I sate for a little while
          before I came to this service. He said to me, "I shall be home
          to-night, pastor. I wanted to see your face once more before I went;
          but I shall be home to-night, and see the face of Jesus." I hope you
          will all be prepared to die after that fashion. The godly old negro
          said, "Our minister is dying full of life." That is the way to die, --
          full of life. Because Jesus lives, we shall live also, and we may well
          die full of life because of our union to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The last thought I want to leave with you is this, JOB HAD
          ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY AMID UNCERTAIN AFFAIRS.
        </p>
        <p>
          He said, "I know that my Redeemer liveth." Why, Job, I should have
          thought you would not have known anything for certain now. I should
          not have liked to insure Job's sheep, and oxen, and asses, and camels,
          or the houses in which his children met together to feast. Nothing
          seemed to be certain with Job but uncertainty; yet there was one
          thing, concerning which he felt that he could put his foot down
          firmly, and say, "'I know.' The winds may rage, and the tempests roar,
          but they cannot shake this rock. 'I know.' 'I know.' 'I know.'"
          Beloved, is everything uncertain with you in this world? Of course it
          is, for it is so with everybody. But does it appear to be more
          uncertain with you than it does with anybody else? Does your business
          seem to be slipping away, and every earthly comfort be threatening to
          disappear? Even if it is so, there is, nevertheless, something that is
          certain, something, that is stable, -- Jesus your Redeemer lives. Rest
          on him, and you will never fail. Let your faith in him be firm, and
          confident; you cannot be too fully established in the belief that
          Jesus, who once died, has left the grave, to die no more, and that
          you, in him, must also live eternally. Something may be wrong with
          you, for the next few days or weeks, but all is right with you for
          ever, and "all's well that ends well." There may be some rough water
          to be crossed between here and the fair havens of eternal felicity,
          but all is right there for ever and ever. There may be losses and
          crosses, there may be tossings and shipwrecks, but all is right for
          ever with all who are in Christ Jesus. "Some on boards, and some on
          broken pieces of the ship," -- but all who are in Christ Jesus shall
          escape "safe to land." There are uncertainties innumerable, but there
          is this one certainty: "Israel shall be saved in the Lord with an
          everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world
          without end." Spring on this rock, man! If you are struggling in the
          sea, just now, and waves of sin and doubt beat over you, leap on to
          this rock, Jesus lives. Trust the living Christ; and, because he
          lives, you shall live also. I could cheerfully take my place with Job,
          if I might be able to say as confidently as he did, "I know that my
          Redeemer liveth;" and if you, as a poor sinner, are trusting wholly
          and only in Christ, then he is your Redeemer, and you are saved for
          ever. If he is the only hope that you have, and you cling to him as
          the limpet clings to the rock, then all is right with you for ever,
          and you may know that he is your Redeemer as surely as Job knew that
          he was his. The Lord bless you, for Jesus Christ's sake! Amen.
        </p>
        <p>JOB 19.</p>
        <p>
          Verses 1, 2. Then, Job answered and said, how long will ye vex my
          soul, and break me in pieces with words?
        </p>
        <p>
          They struck at him with their hard words, as if they were breaking
          stones on the roadside. We ought to be very careful what we say to
          those who are suffering affliction and trial, for a word, though it
          seems to be a very little thing, will often cut far more deeply and
          wound far more terribly than a razor would. So Job says, "How long
          will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?"
        </p>
        <p>
          3. These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye
          make yourselves strange to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          He means that they had reproached him several times over, and hints
          that they ought to have been ashamed to act so strangely, so coldly,
          so untenderly, towards him.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with
          myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have done you no harm. The error, if error there be, is within my
          own bosom, for you cannot find anything in my life to lay to my
          charge." Happy is the man who can say as much as that.
        </p>
        <p>
          5, 6. If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead
          against me my reproach: know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath
          compassed me with his net.
        </p>
        <p>
          Job seems to say, "I did not bring this trouble upon myself; it is God
          who has laid it upon me. Take heed lest, in reproaching me because of
          my trouble, you should reproach God also. "I suppose that we cannot,
          all of us, see into the inner meaning of these words, but if we are in
          very sore trouble, and those who ought to comfort us are bringing
          gruel accusations against us, we shall read the language of Job with
          no small sympathy and satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but
          there is no judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Poor Job I When our prayer is not heard, or we think it is not, then
          the clouds above us are dark indeed. You who are passing through a
          season of unanswered prayer, do not imagine that you are the first to
          traverse that dreary way! You can see the footprints of others on that
          desolate sandy shore. Job knew what that experience meant, so did
          David, and so did our blessed Lord. Read the 2nd verse of the 22nd
          Psalm, and hear Jesus say, "O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou
          hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent."
        </p>
        <p>
          8. He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set
          darkness in my paths.
        </p>
        <p>
          God had done this, and done it to Job, whom he called "a perfect and
          an upright man." Then, how can you and I expect to escape trial and
          difficulty when such a man as the patriarch of Uz found his road
          blocked up, and darkness all around him?
        </p>
        <p>
          9, 10. He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my
          head. He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope
          hath he removed like a tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is, torn up by the roots, and carried down the stream, to be
          forgotten by the people who once knew it, and rejoiced in its welcome
          shade.
        </p>
        <p>
          11. He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto
          him as one of his enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Does God ever act like that towards his own children? Yes; there are
          times when, without any anger in his heart, but with designs of love
          toward them, he treats his children, outwardly, as if he were an enemy
          to them. See the gardener going up to that beautiful tree. He takes
          out a sharp knife, feels its edge to be sure that it is keen, and then
          he begins pruning it here, gashing it there, and making it to bleed in
          another place, as if he were going to cut it all to pieces. Yet all
          that is not because he has any anger against the tree, but, on the
          contrary, because he greatly values it, and wishes it to bring forth
          more fruit than it has ever done. Do not think that God's sharpest
          knife means death to his loved ones; it means more life, and richer,
          fuller life.
        </p>
        <p>
          12. His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and
          encamp round about my tabernacle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Troops of trouble, troops of Chaldeans and Sabeans, troops in which
          Job counted the stormy winds as terrible allies of the Most High, --
          all these had come up against Job, and he seemed to be like a country
          that is beaten down and devoured by powerful invaders.
        </p>
        <p>
          13. He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are
          verily estranged from me.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looks on those so-called "friends" of his, and, remembering the
          bitter things they had said, he tells them that they are estranged
          from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          14, 15. My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have
          forgotten me. They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me
          for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          What a long way a child of God may be permitted to go in trouble! Ah,
          brethren! we do not know how those, who are most dear to God's heart,
          may suffer all the more for that very reason: "for whom the Lord
          loveth he chasteneth."
        </p>
        <p>
          16, 17. I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him
          with my mouth. My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for
          the children's sake of mine own body.
        </p>
        <p>
          He mentioned to his wife those whom death had taken away, and asked
          her to speak kindly to him; but even she had hard words to throw in
          his teeth.
        </p>
        <p>
          18-20. Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake
          against me. All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved
          are turned against me. My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh,
          and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no skin upon the teeth, or scarcely any, and, therefore, Job
          means that there was next to nothing of him left, like the skin of his
          teeth.
        </p>
        <p>
          21. Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the
          hand of God hath touched me.
        </p>
        <p>
          How pitiful it is that he has thus to beg for sympathy! This strong
          man -- this most patient man -- this perfect and upright man before
          God has to ask for sympathy. Do you wonder that it was so? HE, who was
          far greater than Job, ran back thrice to his sleeping disciples as if
          he needed some help from them, yet he found it not, for he had to say
          to them, "What, could ye not watch with me one hour? "Let this be a
          lesson to us to try and possess bowels of compassion towards those who
          are in sorrow and distress.
        </p>
        <p>
          22. Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied uith my
          flesh?
        </p>
        <p>
          "If God smites me, why do you, who are round about me, do the same? Is
          it not enough that God seems to be turned against me? Why should you
          also be my enemies?"
        </p>
        <p>
          23, 24. Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed
          in a book! that they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock
          for ever!
        </p>
        <p>
          Inscriptions have been found, graven in the rocks, that may have been
          done in the time of Job, and it was common, in ancient days, to write
          on tablets of lead or brass; so Job desired that what he was saying
          might be recorded for future reference, for he was persuaded that he
          was being hardly dealt with, and unjustly judged.

          25. For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the
          latter day upon the earth:
        </p>
        <p>
          "For I know," What a splendid burst of confidence this is, right out
          of the depth of his sorrow, like some wondrous star that suddenly
          blazes upon the brow of the blackest night, or like the sudden rising
          of the morning sun!

          26-28. And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my
          flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes
          shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.
          But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter
          is found in me?
        </p>
        <p>
          Job seems to say, speaking about himself, though in the third person,
          "He is a devout man, can you not see that? He has faith in God, my
          friends, can you not perceive that? Wherefore, then, do you persecute
          him so?"
        </p>
        <p>
          29. Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of
          the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now Job carries the war into the enemy's camp; and he says, "You
          charge me with all sorts of sin, and yet you cannot deny that the root
          of the matter is in me. Would it not be much wiser for you to be
          yourselves afraid lest God should cut you off for falsely accusing me,
          and slandering me, in the time of my sorrow? "There we may confidently
          leave Job for the man who can truly say what he has said about his
          Redeemer, will come out all right at the last.
