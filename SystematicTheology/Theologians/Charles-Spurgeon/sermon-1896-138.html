          d 25. My soul cleaveth to the dust: quicken me according to thy word.
          d 26. I have declared my ways, and thou didst answer me: teach me thy
          statutes. d 27. Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: and I
          will meditate on thy wonderful works. d 28. My soul, droppeth away for
          grief: raise me up according to thy word. d 29. Take away from me the
          way of falsehood: and grant to me the favor of thy law. d 30. I have
          chosen the way of truth: and I have set thy judgments before me. d 31.
          I have cleaved to thy testimonies: O Jehovah! let me, not be ashamed.
          d 32. I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt have
          enlarged my heart.

          25. My soul cleaveth to the dust He means that he had no more hope of
          life than if he had been shut up in the tomb; and this must be
          carefully attended to, that we my not become impatient and grieved,
          whenever it may please God to make us endure various kinds of death.
          And, by his own example, he instructs us, when death stares us in the
          face, and all hope of escape fails, to present our petitions to God,
          in whose hand, as we have elsewhere seen, are the issues of death, and
          whose peculiar prerogative it is to restore life to those that are
          dead, (Psalm 68:21) As the combat is hard, he betakes himself to the
          promises of God, and invites others to do the same. The expression,
          according to thy word, is an acknowledgment, that should he depart
          from God's word, no hope would be left for him; but as God has
          affirmed that the life of the faithful is in his hand, and under his
          protection, shut up as he was in the grave, he yet comforted himself
          with the expectation of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          26. I have declared my ways. In the first part of this verse he
          affirms he had prayed sincerely, and had not imitated the proud, who,
          trusting to their own wisdom, fortitude, and opulence, make not God
          their refuge. That man is said to declare his ways to God, who
          presumes neither to attempt nor undertake any thing unless with His
          assistance, and, depending wholly on His providence, commits all his
          plans to His sovereign pleasure, and centers all his affections in
          Him; doing all this honestly, and not as the hypocrites, who profess
          one thing with their lips, and conceal another within their hearts. He
          adds, that he was heard, which was of great importance in making him
          cherish good hope for the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the second part of the verse he solemnly declares, that he holds
          nothing more dear than the acquiring of a true understanding of the
          law. There are not a few who make known their desires unto God, but
          then they would that he would yield to their extravagant passions.
          And, therefore, the prophet affirms that he desires nothing more than
          to be well instructed in God's statutes. This statement is
          strengthened by the next verse, in which he once more asks the
          knowledge of these to be communicated to him. In both passages it must
          be carefully observed, that with the law of God set before us, we will
          reap little benefit from merely perusing it, if we have not his Spirit
          as our internal teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some expositors will have the word which I have translated, I will
          meditate, to be, I will entreat or argue, and thus the Hebrew term
          svch, shuach, is referred both to the words and thoughts. The latter
          meaning is most in accordance with the scope of the passage. I take
          the import of the prophet's words to be this: -- That I may meditate
          upon thy wondrous works, make me to understand thy commandments. We
          will have no relish for the law of God until he sanctify our minds,
          and render them susceptible of tasting heavenly wisdom. And from this
          disrelish springs indifference, so that it is a grievous thing for the
          world to give a respectful attention to the law of God, having no
          savor for the admirable wisdom contained in it. With great propriety,
          therefore, does the prophet pray that this way may be opened to him by
          the gift of knowledge. From these words we are instructed, that in
          proportion to the spirit of knowledge given to us, our regard for the
          law of God, and our delight in meditating on it, ought to increase.

          28. My soul droppeth away for grief As a little before he said that
          his soul cleaved to the dust, so now, almost in the same manner, he
          complains that it melted away with grief. Some are of opinion that he
          alludes to tears, as if he had said that his soul was dissolved in
          tears. But the simpler meaning is, that his strength was poured out
          like water. The verb is in the future tense, yet it denotes a
          continued action. The prophet assures himself of a remedy for this his
          extreme sorrow, provided God stretch out his hand towards him.
          Formerly, when almost lifeless, he entertained the expectation of a
          revival through the grace of God; now also, by the same means, he
          cherishes the hope of being restored to renovated and complete vigor,
          notwithstanding he was nearly consumed. He repeats the expression,
          according to thy word, because, apart from his word, God's power would
          afford us little comfort. But when he comes to our aid, even should
          our courage and strength fail, his promise is abundantly efficacious
          to fortify us.

        <p>
          29. Take away from me the way of falsehood. Knowing how prone the
          nature of man is to vanity and falsehood, he first asks the
          sanctification of his thoughts, lest, being entangled by the snares of
          Satan, he fall into error. Next, that he may be kept from falsehood,
          he prays to be fortified with the doctrine of the law. The second
          clause of the verse is interpreted variously. Some render it, make thy
          law pleasant to me. And as the law is disagreeable to the flesh, which
          it subdues and keeps under, there is good cause why God should be
          asked to render it acceptable and pleasant to us. Some expound it,
          have mercy upon me according to thy law as if the prophet should draw
          pity from the fountain-head itself, because God in his law promised it
          to the faithful. Both of these meanings appear to me forced; and,
          therefore, I am more disposed to adopt another, freely grant to me thy
          law. The original term, chnny channeni, cannot be translated otherwise
          in Latin than, gratify thou me; an uncouth and barbarous expression I
          admit, yet that will give me: little concern, provided my readers
          comprehend the prophet's meaning. The amount is, that being full of
          blindness, nothing is more easy than for us to be greatly deceived by
          error. And, therefor unless God teach us by the Spirit of wisdom, we
          will presently be hurried away into various errors. The means of our
          being preserved from error are stated to consist in his instructing us
          in his law. He makes use of the term to gratify. "It is indeed an
          incomparable kindness that men are directed by thy law, but in
          consequence of thy kindness being unmerited, I have no hesitation in
          asking of thee to admit me as a participator of this thy kindness." If
          the prophet, who for some time previous served God, in now aspiring
          after farther attainments, does not ask for a larger measure of grace
          to be communicated to him meritoriously, but confesses it to be the
          free gift of God, then that impious tenet, which obtains in the
          papacy, that an increase of grace is awarded to merit as deserving of
          it, must fall to the ground.

          30. I have chosen the way of truth. In this and the following verse he
          affirms that he was so disposed as to desire nothing more than to
          follow righteousness and truth. It is, therefore, with great propriety
          he employs the term to choose. The old adage, that man's life is as it
          were at the point where two ways meet, refers not simply to the
          general tenor of human life, but to every particular action of it. For
          no sooner do we undertake any thing, no matter how small, than we are
          grievously perplexed, and as if hurried off by a tempest, are
          confounded by conflicting counsels. Hence the prophet declares, that
          in order constantly to pursue the right path, he had resolved and
          fully determined not to relinquish the truth. And thus he intimates
          that he was not entirely exempted from temptations, yet that he had
          surmounted them by giving himself up to the conscientious observance
          of the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last clause of the verse, I have set thy judgments before me,
          relates to the same subject. There would be no fixed choice on the
          part of the faithful, unless they steadily contemplate the law, and
          did not suffer their eyes to wander to and fro. In the subsequent
          verse he not only asserts his entertaining this holy affection for the
          law, but also combines it with prayer, that he might not become
          ashamed and enfeebled under the derision of the ungodly, while he gave
          himself wholly to the law of God. Here he employs the same term as
          formerly, when he said his soul cleaved to the dust, and, in doing so,
          affirms he had so firmly taken hold of God's law, that he cannot be
          separated from it. From his expressing a fear lest he might be put to
          shame or overwhelmed with reproach, we learn that the more sincerely a
          man surrenders himself to God, the more will he be assailed by the
          tongues of the vile and the venomous.
        </p>
        <p>
          32 I will run the way of thy commandments. The meaning of the prophet
          is, that when God shall inspire him with love for his la he will be
          vigorous and ready, nay, even steady, so as not to faint in the middle
          of his course. His words contain an implied admission of the
          supineness inability of men to make any advancement in well-doing
          until God enlarge their hearts. No sooner does God expand their
          hearts, than they are fitted not only for walking, but also for
          running in the way of his commandments. He reminds us that the proper
          observance of the law consists not merely in external works, -- that
          it demands willing obedience, so that the heart must, to some extent,
          and in some way, enlarge itself. Not that it has the self-determining
          power of doing this, but when once its hardness and obstinacy are
          subdued, it moves freely without being any longer contracted by its
          own narrowness. Finally, this passage tells us, when God has once
          enlarged our hearts, there will be no lack of power, because, along
          with proper affection, he will furnish ability, so that our feet will
          be ready to run.
