        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.293)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, January 8th, 1860, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand</p>
        <p>
          "And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be
          saved, and thy house." -- Acts.16:31.
        </p>
        <p>
          YOU WILL REMEMBER that when the children of Israel were settled in
          Canaan, God ordained that they should set apart certain cities to be
          called the Cities of Refuge, that to these the man-slayer might flee
          for security. If he killed another unawares, and had no malice
          aforethought, he might flee at once to the City of Refuge; and if he
          could enter its gates before the avenger of blood should overtake him,
          he would be secure. We are told by the rabbis that once in the year,
          or oftener, the magistrates of the district were accustomed to survey
          the high roads which led to these cities. they carefully gathered up
          all the stones, and took the greatest possible precautions that there
          should be no stumbling-blocks in the way which might cause the poor
          fugitive to fall, or might by any means impede him in his hasty
          course. We hear, moreover, and we believe the tradition to be grounded
          in fact, that all along the road there were hand-posts with the word
          "Refuge" written very legibly upon them, so that when the fugitive
          came to a crossroad, he might not need to question for a single moment
          which was the way of escape; but seeing the well-known word "Refuge,"
          he kept on his breathless and headlong course until he had entered the
          suburb of the City of Refuge, and he was then at once completely safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my brothers and sisters, God has prepared for the sons of men a
          City of Refuge, and the way to it is by FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS. It is
          needful, however, that very often the ministers of Christ should
          survey this road, lest there should be any stumbling-blocks in the
          path of the poor sinner. I propose this morning to go along it, and,
          by God's grace, to remove any impediment which Satan may have laid
          upon the path, and may God so help me, that this survey may be of
          spiritual benefit to all your souls, that any of you who have been
          made to stumble in the path of faith may now pluck up courage, and run
          joyfully forward; hoping yet to escape from the fierce avenger of your
          sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well may the minister be careful to keep the road of faith clear for
          the seeking sinner, for surely the sinner hath a heavy heart to carry,
          and we ought to make the road as clear and as smooth as we can. We
          should make straight paths for the feet of these poor benighted souls.
          It should be our endeavor to cast loads of promises into every slough
          that runs across the path, that so it may be a king's highway, and may
          be safe and easy for travelling for those weary feet that have to
          carry such a heavy heart. Besides, we must remember that the sinner
          will make stumbling-blocks enough for himself, even with our greatest
          and most scrupulous care to remove any others that may naturally lie
          in his way. For this is one of the sad follies of the poor desponding
          soul -- that it spoils its own road. You have sometimes seen, perhaps,
          the newly-invented engine in the streets, the locomotive that lays
          down its own pathway and then picks it up again. Now, the sinner is
          the very reverse of that; he spoils his own road before himself, and
          then carries behind him all the mire and dirt of his own mishaps. Poor
          soul! he flings stones before himself, cuts out valleys, and casts up
          mountains in his own pathway. Well may the ministers, then, be careful
          to keep this road clear. And, let me add there is another weighty
          reason. Behind him comes the furious avenger of blood. Oh, how swift
          is he! There is Moses armed with all the wrath of God, and Death
          following hard after him -- a mounted rider upon his pale horse; and
          after Death there cometh Hell with all the powers and legions of
          Satan, all athirst for blood and swift to slay. Make straight the
          road, oh ministers of Christ, level the mountains, fill up the
          valleys; for this is a desperate flight, this flight of the sinner
          from his ferocious enemies towards the one City of Refuge -- the
          atonement of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have thus given the reasons why I am compelled in spirit to make
          this survey this morning. Come, O Spirit, the Comforter, and help us
          now, that every stone may be cast out of the high road to heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          The road to heaven, my brethren, is BY FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS. It is
          not by well-doing that you can be saved, though it is by ill-doing
          that you will be damned if you put not trust in Christ. Nothing that
          you can do can save you. Albeit that after you are saved it will be
          your delightful privilege to walk in the ways of God and to keep his
          commandments, yet all your own attempts to keep the commandments
          previous to faith, will but sink you deeper into the mire, and will by
          no means contribute to your salvation. The one road to heaven is BY
          FAITH IN CHRIST. Or to make it plainer still as the countryman said,
          there are but two steps to heaven -- out of self into Christ, and,
          then, out of Christ into heaven. Faith is simply explained as trusting
          in Christ. I find that Christ commands me to believe in him, or to
          trust him. I feel that there is no reason in myself why I should be
          allowed to trust him. But he commands me to do so. Therefore
          altogether apart from my character or from any preparation that I feel
          in myself, I obey the command, and sink or swim, I trust Christ. Now,
          that is faith, -- when with the eye shut as to all evidence of hope in
          ourselves, we take a leap in the dark right into the arms of an
          Omnipotent Redeemer. Faith is sometimes spoken of in Scripture as
          being a leaning upon Christ; a casting of one's self upon him, or, as
          the old Puritans used to put it, (using a somewhat hard word) it is
          recumbency on Christ -- the leaning of the whole weight upon his
          cross; ceasing to stand by the strength of one's own power and resting
          wholly upon the rock of ages. The leaving of the soul in the hands of
          Jesus is the very essence of faith. Faith is receiving Christ into our
          emptiness. There is Christ like the conduit in the market-place. As
          the water flows from the pipes, so does grace continually flow from
          him. By faith I bring my empty pitcher and hold it where the water
          flows, and receive of its fullness, grace for grace. It is not the
          beauty of my pitcher, it is not even its cleanness that quenches my
          thirst: it is simply holding that pitcher to the place where water
          flows. Even so I am but the vessel, and my faith is the hand which
          presents the empty vessel to the flowing stream. It is the grace, and
          not the qualification of the receiver which saves the soul. And though
          I hold that pitcher with a trembling hand, and much of that which I
          seek may be lost through my weakness, yet if the soul be but held to
          the fountain, and so much as a single drop trickle into it, my soul is
          saved. Faith is receiving Christ with the understanding, and with the
          will, submitting everything to him, taking him to be my all in all,
          and agreeing to be henceforth nothing at all. Faith is ceasing from
          the creature and coming to the Creator. It is looking out of self to
          Christ, turning the eye entirely from any good thing that is here
          within me, and looking for every blessing to those open veins, to that
          poor bleeding heart, to that thorn-crowned head of him whom God hath
          set forth "to be the propitiation for our sins, and not for our sins
          only, but for the sins of the whole world."
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, having thus described the way, I now come to my real business of
          removing these stones.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. A very common impediment in the pathway of the soul that is
          desiring to be saved, is the recollection of its past life. "Oh,"
          saith the sinner, "I dare not trust Christ, because my past sins have
          been of an unusually black dye. I have been no common sinner, but I
          have been one singled out from the herd, a very monster in sin. I have
          taken the highest degree in the devil's college, and have become a
          master of Belial. I have learned to sit in the seat of the scornful,
          and have taught others to rebel against God." Ah, soul, I know very
          well what this impediment is, for once it laid in my way, and very
          sorely did it trouble me. Before I thought upon my soul's salvation, I
          dreamed that my sins were very few. All my sins were dead as I
          imagined, and buried in the graveyard of forgetfulness. But that
          trumpet of conviction which aroused my soul to think of eternal
          things, sounded to all my sins, and oh, how they rose up in multitudes
          more countless than the sands of the sea! Now, I saw that my very
          thoughts were enough to damn me, that my words would sink me lower
          than the lowest hell; and as for my acts of sin they now began to be a
          stench in my nostrils, so that I could not bear them. I recollect the
          time when I thought I had rather have been a frog or a toad than have
          been made a man; when I reckoned that the most defiled creature, the
          most loathsome and contemptible was a better thing than myself; for I
          had so grossly and grievously sinned against Almighty God. Ah, my
          brethren, it may be that this morning your old oaths are echoing back
          from the walls of your memory. You recollect how you have cursed God,
          and you say, "Can I, dare I trust him whom I have cursed?" And your
          old lusts are now rising before you; midnight sins stare you in the
          face, and snatches of the lascivious song are being yelled in the ear
          of your poor convinced conscience. And all your sins as they rise up,
          cry, "Depart, thou accursed one! Depart! thou hast sinned thyself out
          of grace! Thou art a condemned one! Depart! There is no hope, there is
          no mercy for thee!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, permit me in the strength and name of God to remove this
          stumbling block out of your way. Sinner, I tell thee that all thy
          sins, be they never so many cannot destroy thee if thou dost believe
          on the Lord Jesus Christ. If now thou castest thyself simply on the
          merits of Jesus, "Though thy sins be as scarlet, they shall be as
          wool." Only believe. Dare to believe that Christ is able to save them
          to the uttermost that come unto God by him. Take him at his word and
          trust him. And thou hast a warrant for doing it; for remember it is
          written "The blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all
          sin." Thou art commanded to believe, therefore, be thou never so black
          a sinner, the command is, thy warrant -- oh, may God help thee to obey
          the command. Now, just as thou art, cast thyself on Christ. It is not
          the greatness of the sinner that is the difficulty; it is the hardness
          of the sinner's heart. If now thou art conscious of the most awful
          guilt, thy guilt becomes as nothing in the eye of God when once he
          sees the blood of Christ sprinkled upon thee. I tell thee more, if thy
          sins were ten thousand times as many as they be, yet the blood of
          Christ is able to atone for them all. Only dare to believe that. Now,
          by a venturesome faith trust thyself in Christ. If thou art the most
          sick of all the wretches that ever this divine physician essayed to
          cure, so much the more glory to him. When a physician cures a man of
          some little finger-ache or some little disease, what credit doth he
          get? But when he heals a man who is all over diseased, who has become
          but a putrid mass, then there is glory to the physician. And so will
          there be to Christ when he saveth thee. But to put this block out of
          the way once for all. Remember, sinner, that all the while thou dost
          not believe in Christ, thou art adding to thy sin this great sin of
          not believing, which is the greatest sin in the world. But if thou
          obey God in this matter of putting thy trust in Christ, God's own Word
          is guaranteed that thy faith shall be rewarded, and thou shalt find
          that thy sins which are many are all forgiven thee. By the side of
          Saul of Tarsus and of her, out of whom was cast seven devils, shalt
          thou one day stand. With the thief shalt thou sing of love divine, and
          with Manasseh shalt thou rejoice in him who can wash away the foulest
          crimes. Oh, I pray God there may be some one in this great crowd
          today, who may be saying in his heart, "Sir, you have described me. I
          do feel that I am the blackest sinner anywhere, but I will risk it, I
          will put my trust in Christ and Christ alone." Ah, soul, God bless
          thee; thou art an accepted one. If thou canst do this, this morning, I
          will be God's hostage that he will be true to thee and true to his
          Son, for never sinner perished yet that dared to trust the precious
          blood of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Now let me endeavor to upheave and eject another stumbling block.
          Many an awakened sinner is troubled because of the hardness of his
          heart and the lack of what he thinks to be true penitence. "Oh," saith
          he, "I can believe that however great my sins are they can be
          forgiven, but I do not feel the evil of my sins as I ought:" --
        </p>
        <p>"My heart how dreadful hard it is;</p>
        <p>How heavy here it lies!</p>
        <p>Heavy and cold within my breast,</p>
        <p>Just like a rock of ice."</p>
        <p>
          "I cannot feel," says one, "I cannot weep, I have heard of the
          repentance of others, but I seem to be just like a stone. My heart is
          petrified, it will not quake at all the thunders of the law, it will
          not melt before all the wooings of Christ's love." Ah, poor heart,
          this is a common stumbling-block in the way of those who are really
          seeking Christ. Bat let me ask thee one question. Dost thou read
          anywhere in the Word of God that those who have hard hearts are not
          commanded to believe? Because if thou canst find such a passage as
          that, I will be sorry enough to see it, but then I may excuse thee for
          saying, "I cannot trust Christ because my heart is hard." Do you not
          know that the Scripture runs thus? "Whosoever believeth in him shall
          not perish, but have everlasting life." Now, if thou believest, though
          thy heart be never so hard, thy believing saves thee; and what is
          more, thy believing shall yet soften thy heart. If thou canst not feel
          thy need of a Savior as thou wouldst, remember that when thou hast a
          Savior thou wilt begin then to find out more and more how great was
          thy need of him. Why, I believe that many persons find out their needs
          by receiving the supply. Have you never walked along the street, and
          looking in at a shop window have seen an article, and have said, "Why,
          that is just what I want." How do you know that? Why, you saw the
          thing and then you wanted it. And I believe there is many a sinner who
          when he is hearing about Christ Jesus is led to say, "That is just
          what I want." Did not he know it before? No, poor soul, not till he
          saw Christ. I find my sense of need of Christ is ten times more acute
          now than it was before I found Christ. I thought I wanted him for a
          good many things then, but now I know I want him for everything. I
          thought there were some things which I could not do without him; but
          now I find that without him I can do nothing. But you say, "Sir, I
          must repent before I come to Christ." Find such a passage in the Word
          if you can. Doth not the Word say? "Him hath God exalted with his
          right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to
          Israel and forgiveness of sins." Doth not one of our hymns translate
          that verse into rhyme and put it thus?
        </p>
        <p>"True belief and true repentance.</p>
        <p>Every grace that brings us nigh --</p>
        <p>Without money</p>
        <p>Come to Jesus Christ, and buy."</p>
        <p>
          Oh, these graces are not of nature's spinning. We cannot make these in
          the loom of the creature. If you would know your need of Christ, take
          him now by faith and sense and feeling shall follow in the rear. Trust
          him now for everything. Dare to trust him. Hard as your heart is, say,
          "Just as I am, without a plea, but that thou commandest me, and bid'st
          me come, I come to thee!" Thy heart shall be softened by the sight of
          Christ, and love divine shall so sweetly commend itself to thee, that
          the heart which terrors could not move shall be dissolved by love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do understand me, my dear hearers. I wept to preach in the broadest
          manner I possibly can this morning the doctrine that we are justified
          by faith alone; that man is commanded to believe, and that altogether
          apart from anything in man, man has a right to believe. Not from any
          preparation that he feels, not from anything good he discerns in
          himself, but he has a right to believe simply because he is commanded
          to believe; and it; relying upon the fact that he is commanded, God
          the Holy Spirit enables him to believe, that faith will surely save
          the soul, and deliver him from the wrath to come. Let me take up,
          then, that stumbling stone about hardness of heart. Oh, soul, trust
          Christ and thy heart shall be softened. And may God the Holy Spirit
          enable thee to trust him hard heart and all, and then thy hard heart
          shall soon be turned into a heart of flesh, and thou shalt love him
          who hath loved thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Now, for a third stumbling block. "Oh," saith some poor soul, "I do
          not know whether I believe or not, sir. Sometimes I do believe; but
          oh, it is such little faith I have that I cannot think Christ can save
          me." Ah, there you are again you see, looking to yourself. This has
          made many trip and fall. I pray God I may put this out of your way.
          Poor sinner, remember it is not the strength of thy faith that saves
          thee, but the reality of thy faith. What is more, it is not even the
          reality of thy faith that saves thee, it is the object of thy faith.
          If thy faith be fixed on Christ, though it seems to be in itself a
          line no thicker than a spider's cobweb, it will hold thy soul
          throughout time and eternity. For remember it is not the thickness of
          this cable of faith, it is the strength of the anchor which imparts
          strength to the cable, and so shall hold thy ship in the midst of the
          most fearful storm. The faith that saves man is sometimes so small
          that the man himself cannot see it. A grain of mustard seed is the
          smallest of all seeds, and yet if thou hast but that quantity of
          faith, thou art a saved man. Remember what the poor women did. She did
          not come and take hold of Christ's person with her hand, she did not
          throw her arms about his knees; but she stretched out her finger, and
          then -- she did not touch Christ's feet or even his dress -- she
          touched but the ravelling, the fringe of his garment and she was made
          whole. If thy faith be but as little as that, seek to get more of it,
          but still remember that it will save thee. Jesus Christ himself
          compares Little-faith to a smoking flax. Does it burn? is there any
          fire at all! No; there is nothing but a little smoke and that is most
          offensive. "Yes," saith Jesus, "but I will not quench it." Again, he
          compares it to a bruised reed. Of what service is it? It is broken,
          you cannot bring music from it; it is but a, reed when it is whole,
          and now it is a bruised reed. Break it, snap it, throw, it away? "No,"
          says he. "I will not break the bruised reed." Now, if that is the
          faith thou hast, the faith of the smoking flax, the faith of the
          bruised reed, thou art saved. Thou wilt have many a trial and many a
          trouble in going to heaven, with so little faith as that, for when
          there is little wind to a boat there must be much tugging at the oar;
          but still there will be wind enough to land thee in glory, if thou
          dost simply trust Christ, be that trust never so feeble. Remember a
          little child belongs to the human race as much as the greatest giant;
          and so a babe in grace is as truly a child of God as is Mr.
          Great-heart, who can fight all the giants on the road. And thou mays't
          be as much an heir of heaven in thy minority, in the infancy of thy
          grace, as thou wilt be when thou shalt have expanded into the full
          grown Christian, and shalt become a perfect man in Christ Jesus. It is
          not, I tell thee, the strength of thy faith, but the object of thy
          faith. It is the blood, not the hyssop; not the hand that smites the
          lintel, but the blood that secures the Israelite in the day when God's
          vengeance passes by. Let that stumbling block be taken out of the way.
        </p>

          4. "But," saith another, "I do think sometimes I have a little faith,
          but I have so many doubts and fears. I am tempted every day to believe
          that Jesus Christ did not die for me, or that my belief is not
          genuine, or that I never experienced the regenerating influence of the
          Holy Spirit. Tell me Sir, can I be a true believer in Christ if I have
          doubts and fears?" My answer is simply this, there is no Scripture
          which saith, that "He that believeth, shall be damned, if that faith
          be mixed: with doubts." "He that believeth shall be saved," be that
          faith never so little, and even though it be intermingled with
          multitudes of doubts and fears. You remember that memorable story of
          our Savior, when he was on board a ship with his disciples. The winds
          roared, the ship rocked to and fro, the mast was strained, the sails
          were rent, and the poor disciples were full of fear: -- "Lord save us
          or we perish." Here were doubts. What did Jesus say when he rebuked
          them? "Why are ye fearful" -- O ye of no faith? No, "O ye of little
          faith." So there maybe little faith where there are great doubts.
          There is light at eventide in the air; even though there is a great
          deal of darkness, yet there is light. And if thy faith should never
          come to noon-day, if it do but come to twilight, thou art a saved man.
          Nay, more, if it doth not come to twilight, if thy faith is but
          starlight, nay, candlelight, nay, a spark -- if it be but a glow-worm
          spark, thou art saved; and all thy doubts, and all thy fears, and thy
          distresses, terrible though they may be, can never trample thee in the
          dust, can never destroy thy soul. Do you not know that the best of
          God's children are exercised with doubts and fears even to the last?
          Look at such a man as John Knox. There was a man who could face the
          frowns of a world, who could speak like a king to kings, and fear no
          man; yet on his dying bed he was troubled about his interest in
          Christ, because he was tempted to self-righteousness. If such a man
          have doubts, dost thou expect to live without them? If God's brightest
          saints are exercised, if Paul himself keeps under his body lest he
          should be a castaway, why how canst thou expect to live without
          clouds? Oh, my dear man, drop the idea that the prevalence of thy
          doubts disproves the truth of the promise. Again believe; away with
          all thy doubts; sink or swim; cast thyself on Jesus; and thou canst
          not be lost, for his honor is engaged to save every soul that puts its
          trust in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. "Ah," says another, "but you have not yet hit upon my fear." I used
          when I first knew the Savior, to try myself in a certain manner, and
          often did I throw stumbling blocks in my path through it, and
          therefore I can speak very affectionately to any of you who are doing
          the same. Sometimes I would go up into my chamber, and by way of
          self-examination, I used to ask myself this question -- Am I afraid to
          die? If I should drop down dead in my chamber, can I say that I should
          joyfully close my eyes? Well, it often happened that I could not
          honestly say so. I used to feel death would be a very solemn thing.
          Ah, then I said "I have never believed in Christ, for if I had put my
          trust in the Lord Jesus, I should not be afraid to die, but I should
          be quite confident. I do not doubt that there are many here who are
          saying, "Sir, I cannot follow Christ, because I am afraid to die; I
          cannot believe that Jesus Christ will save me, because the sight of
          death makes me tremble." Ah, poor soul, there are many of God's
          blessed ones, who through fear of death, have been much of their
          lifetime subject to bondage. I know precious children of God now: I
          believe that when they die, they will die triumphantly; but I know
          this, that the thought of death is never pleasing to them. And this is
          accounted for, because God has stamped on nature that law, the love of
          life and self-preservation. And again, the man that hath kindred and
          friends, it is natural enough that he should scarce like to leave
          behind those that are so dear. I know that when he gets more grace he
          will rejoice in the thought of death; but I do know that there are
          many quite safe, who could die triumphantly, who, now, in the prospect
          of death feel afraid of it. I remember my aged grandfather once preach
          a sermon which I have not forgotten. He was preaching from the text
          "The God of all grace," and he somewhat interested the assembly, after
          describing the different kinds of grace that God gave, by saying at
          the end of each period "But there is one kind of grace that you do not
          want." After each sentence there came the like, "But there is one kind
          of grace you do not want." And, then, he wound up by saying, "You
          don't want dying grace in living moments, but you shall have dying
          grace when you want it." Now, you are testing yourself by a condition
          in which you are not placed. If you are placed in the condition, you
          shall have grace enough if you put your trust in Christ. In a party of
          friends we were discussing the question, whether if the days of
          martyrdom should come we were prepared to be burned. Well, now, I must
          frankly say, that speaking as I feel to-day, I am not prepared to be
          burned. But I do believe if there were a stake in Smithfield, and I
          knew that I were to be burned there at one o'clock, that I should have
          grace enough to be burned at one o'clock; but I have not yet got to a
          quarter past twelve, and the time is not come yet. Do not expect dying
          grace, until you want it, and when the time comes, you may be sure you
          will have sufficient grace to bear it. Cast out that stumbling-block
          then. Rest thyself on Christ, and trust a living Christ to help thee
          in thy dying hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Another most grievous perplexity to many a seeking soul is this:
          "Oh, I would trust Christ, but I feel no joy. I hear the children of
          God singing sweetly about their privileges. I hear them saying that
          they have been to the top of Pisgah and have viewed the promised land,
          have taken a pleasant prospect of the world to come; but oh, my faith
          yields me no joy. I hope I do believe, but at the same time I have
          none of those raptures. My worldly troubles press heavily upon me, and
          sometimes even my spiritual woes are greater than I can bear." Ah,
          poor soul, let me cast out that stone from thy road. Remember, it is
          not written "he that is joyful shall be saved," but "he that believeth
          shall be saved." Thy faith will make thee joyful by-and-bye, but it is
          as powerful to save thee even when it does not make thee rejoice. Why,
          look at many of God's people, how sad and sorrowful they have been. I
          know they ought not to be. This is their sin; but still it is such a
          sin that it does not destroy the efficacy of faith. Notwithstanding
          all the sorrows of the saint, faith still keeps alive, and God is
          still true to his promise. Remember, it is not what you feel that
          saves you, it is what you believe. It is not feeling but believing.
          "We walk by faith, not by sight." When I feel my soul as cold as an
          iceberg, as hard as a rock, and as sinful as Satan, yet even then
          faith ceases not to justify. Faith prevails as truly in the midst of
          sad feelings as of happy feelings, for then, standing alone, it proves
          the majesty of its might. Believe, O son of God, believe in him, and
          look not for aught in thyself.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Then, again, there are many that are distressed because they have
          blasphemous thoughts. Here, too, I can heartily sympathise with many.
          I remember a certain narrow and crooked lane in a certain country
          town, along which I was walking one day while I was seeking the
          Savior. On a sudden the most fearful oaths that any of you can
          conceive rushed through my heart. I put my hand to my mouth to prevent
          the utterance. I had not, that I know of, ever heard those words; and
          I am certain that I had never used in my life from my youth up so much
          as one of them, for I had never been profane. But these things sorely
          beset me: for half an hour together the most fearful imprecations
          would dash through my brain. Oh, how I groaned and cried before God.
          That temptation passed away; but ere many days it was renewed again;
          and when I was in prayer, or when I was reading the Bible, these
          blasphemous thought would pour in upon me more than at any other time.
          I consulted with an aged godly man about it. He said to me, "Oh, all
          this many of the people of God have proved before you. But," said he,
          "do you hate these thoughts?" "I do," I truly said. "Then," said he,
          "they are not yours; serve them as the old parishes used to do with
          vagrants -- whip them and send them on to their own parish. So" said
          he, "do with them. Groan over them, repent of them, and send them on
          to the devil, the father of them, to whom they belong -- for they are
          not yours." Do you not recollect how John Bunyan hits off the picture?
          He says, when Christian was going through the valley of the shadow of
          death, "There stepped up one to him, and whispered blasphemous
          thoughts into his ear, so that poor Christian thought they were his
          own thoughts; but they were not his thoughts at all, but the
          injections of a blasphemous spirit." So when you are about to lay hold
          on Christ, Satan will ply all his engines and try to destroy you. He
          cannot bear to lose one of his slaves: he will invent a fresh
          temptation for each believer so that he may not put his trust in
          Christ." Now, come, poor soul, notwithstanding all these blasphemous
          thoughts in thy soul, dare to put thy trust in Christ. Even should
          those thoughts have been more blasphemous than any thou hast ever
          heard, come trust in Christ, come cast thyself on him. I have heard
          that when an elephant is going over a bridge he will sound the timber
          with his foot to see if it will bear him over. Come thou, who thinkest
          thyself an elephantine sinner, here is bridge that is strong enough
          for thee, even with all these thoughts of thine: -- "All manner of sin
          and blasphemy shall be forgiven thee." Throw that in Satan's face, and
          trust thyself in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. One other stumbling-block, and I will have done. Some there be that
          say; Oh, sir, I would trust in Christ to save me if I could see that
          my faith brought forth fruits. Oh, sir, when I would do good, evil is
          present with me." Excuse my always bringing in my own feelings as an
          illustration, but I feel when I am preaching to tried sinners that the
          testimony of one's own experience is generally more powerful than any
          other illustration that can be found. It is not, believe me, any
          display of egotism, but the simple desire to come home to you, that
          makes me state what I have felt myself. The first Sunday after I came
          to Christ I went to a Methodist chapel. The sermon was upon this text:
          "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this
          death?" I had just got as far as that in the week. I knew that I had
          put my trust in Christ, and I knew that, when I sat in that house of
          prayer, my faith was simply and solely fixed on the atonement of the
          Redeemer. But I had a weight on my mind, because I could not be as
          holy as I wanted to be. I could not live without sin. When I rose in
          the morning I thought I would abstain from every hard word, from every
          evil thought and look; and I came up to that chapel groaning, because
          "when I would do good evil was present with me." The minister said
          that when Paul wrote the verse I have quoted, he was not a Christian;
          that this was his experience before he knew the Lord. Ah, what error,
          for I know that Paul was a Christian, and I know the more Christians
          look to themselves the more they will have to groan, because they
          cannot be what they want to be. What, you will not believe in Christ
          until you are perfect? Then you will never believe in him. You will
          not trust the precious Jesus till you have no sins to trust him with!
          Then you will never trust him at all. For rest assured you will never
          be perfect till you see the face of God in heaven. I knew one man who
          thought himself a perfect man and that man was hump-backed. This was
          my rebuke to his pride, "Surely if the Lord gave you a perfect soul he
          would give you a perfect body to carry it in." Perfection will not be
          found this side of the grave. Your business is to trust in Christ. You
          must depend on nothing but the blood of Christ. Trust in Christ and
          you stand secure. "He that believeth on the Son of God hath
          everlasting life." It is our duty to fight against corruption; it is
          our privilege to conquer it; it is our honor to feel that we are
          fighting against sin, it shall be our glory one day to tread it
          beneath our feet. But to-day expect not complete victory. Your very
          consciousness of sin proves that you are alive. The very fact that you
          are not what you want to be, proves that there is some high and noble
          thoughts in you that could not come by nature. You were content with
          yourself some six weeks ago, were you not? And the fact that you are
          discontent now, proves that God has put a new life into you, which
          makes you seek after a higher and better element in which to breathe.
          When you become what you want to be on earth, then despair. When the
          law justifies you, then you have fallen from grace; for Paul has said,
          "When we are justified by the law we are fallen from grace." But while
          I feel that the law condemns me it is my joy to know that believing in
          Christ, "There is no condemnation to him that is in Christ Jesus, who
          walks not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now though I have been trying to clear the way I feel conscious
          that very likely I have been putting a stone or two in the road
          myself. May God forgive me -- it is a sin of inadvertance. I would lay
          this road as straight and clear as ever was turnpike road between one
          city and another. Sinner, there is nothing which can rob thee of thy
          right to believe in Christ. Thou art freely invited to come to the
          marriage banquet. The table is spread, and the invitation freely
          given. There are no porters at the door to keep thee out; there are
          none to ask a ticket of admission of thee:
        </p>
        <p>"Let not conscience make you linger;</p>
        <p>Nor of fitness fondly dream;</p>
        <p>All the fitness he requireth</p>
        <p>Is to feel your need of him;</p>
        <p>This he gives you;</p>
        <p>'Tis his Spirit's rising beam."</p>
        <p>
          Come to him just as thou art. But, ah, I know that when we sit in our
          studies it seems a light think to preach the gospel and make people
          believe in Christ, but when we come to practice, it is the hardest
          thing in the world. If I were to tell you to do some great thing you
          would do it; but simply, when it is, "Believe, wash and be clean!" you
          will not do it. If I said, "Give me ten thousand pounds," you would
          give it. You would crawl a thousand miles on your hands and knees, or
          drink the bitterest draught that was ever concocted; but this trusting
          in Christ is too hard for your proud spirit. Ah, sinner, art thou too
          proud to be saved? Come, man, I beseech thee by the love of Christ, by
          the love of thine own soul, come with me, and let us go together to
          the foot of the cross. Believe on him who hangs groaning there, oh,
          put thy trust in him, who is risen from the dead, and has led
          Captivity captive. And if thou trustest him, poor sinner, thou shalt
          not be disappointed; it shall not be trust misplaced. Again I say it,
          I am content to be lost if thou art lost trusting in Christ; I will
          make my bed in hell with thee should God reject thee, if thou puttest
          thy simple trust in Christ. I dare to say that, and to look that
          boldly in the face; for thou wouldst be the first sinner that was ever
          cast away trusting in Jesus. "But, oh," saith one, "I cannot think
          that such a wretch as I am can have a right to believe." Soul, I tell
          thee it is not whether thou art a wretch, or not a wretch; it is the
          command that is thy warrant. Thou art commanded to believe. And when a
          command comes home with power the power comes with the command; and he
          who is commanded, being made willing, casts himself on Christ, and he
          believes, and is saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have labored this morning to try and make myself as clear as I can
          about this doctrine. I know if any man is saved it is the work of God
          the Holy Ghost from first to last. "If any man is regenerate, it is
          not of the will of the flesh, nor of blood, but of God." But I do not
          see how that great truth interferes with this other, "Whosoever
          believeth in Christ shall be saved." And I would again, even to the
          falling down on my knees, as though God did beseech you by me, pray
          you "In Christ's stead be ye reconciled to God." And this is the
          reconciliation, "That ye believe on the Lord Jesus Christ whom he hath
          sent," that ye trust Christ. Do you understand me? That ye cast
          yourself on him; that ye depend on nothing but what he has done. Saved
          you must be, lost you cannot be, if you fling yourself wholly upon
          Christ, and cast the whole burden of your sins, your doubts, your
          fears, and your anxieties wholly there. Now, this is preaching free
          grace doctrine. And if any wonder how a Calvinist can preach thus, let
          me say that this is the preaching that Calvin preached, and better
          still it is the preaching of our Lord Jesus Christ and his apostles.
          We have divine warrant when we tell you, "He that believeth and is
          baptized, shall be saved; he that believeth not shall be damned."<br />
