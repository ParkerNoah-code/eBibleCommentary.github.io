        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1622)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, October 2nd, 1881, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "So these nations feared the Lord and served their graven images, both
          their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers,
          so do they unto this day." -- 2 Kings 17:41.
        </p>
        <p>
          SO DO THEY unto this day," said the writer of the Book of Kings, who
          has long since passed away unto his fathers. Were he alive now he
          might say concerning the spiritual descendants of these Samaritans,
          "So do they unto this day." This base union of fearing God and serving
          other gods is by no means obsolete. Alas, it is too common everywhere,
          and to be met with where you might least expect it. From generation to
          generation there have been Mongrel Religionists, who have tried to
          please both God and the devil, and have been on both sides, or on
          either side, as their interest led them. Some of these wretched
          blenders are always hovering around every congregation, and my hope is
          that I may convince the consciences of some here present that they
          themselves are guilty, and that of them it might be said, as of these
          Assyrian immigrants, "They feared the Lord, and served their own
          gods." My sermon will by no means be an essay upon an extinct race,
          but it may be placed among "the present-day papers," for "so do they
          unto this day." He that hath ears to hear, let him hear, and to
          whomsoever the word shall apply let its rebuke be taken home, and
          through the teaching of the Holy Spirit may it produce decisive
          results.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I shall first call your attention to THE NATURE OF THIS Mongrel
          Religion. It had its good and bad points, for it wore a double face.
          These people were not infidels. Far from it: "they feared the Lord."
          They did not deny the existence, or the power, or the rights of the
          great God of Israel, whose name is Jehovah. They had not the pride of
          Pharaoh who said, "Who is Jehovah that I should obey his voice?" They
          were not like those whom David calls "fools," who said in their
          hearts, "There is no God." They had faith, though only enough to
          produce fear. They knew that there was a God; they feared his wrath,
          and they tried to appease it. So far they were hopeful persons, and
          under the influence of a feeling which has often led up to better
          things. It was better to dread God than to despise him; better
          slavishly to fear than stupidly to forget. We would not have men so
          foolish as to doubt the existence of God, nor so profane as to defy
          him. There was something commendable about men of whom it could be
          said that they feared Jehovah, even though that fear was a selfish and
          servile one, and was by no means so efficacious upon them as it ought
          to have been, for it did not cause them to put away their idols.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another good point about these mixed religionists was that they were
          willing to be taught. As soon as they found that they were not acting
          rightly towards the God of the land, they sent a petition to their
          supreme ruler, the king of Assyria, setting forth their spiritual
          destitution. Church and State were fused in those days, and therefore
          they applied to their king that he would help them in their religious
          distress, and he acted to the best of his light; for he sent them one
          or the priests of the old religion of the land. This man was a
          Bethelite, one who worshipped God under the symbol of an ox, which the
          Scripture calls a calf. He was a very slight improvement upon a
          heathen; but we must be glad even of small progress. They were quite
          willing to be taught the manner of the God of the land, and so they
          installed this priest at Bethel, and gathered about him to know what
          they should do. We have people around us unto this day who are glad to
          hear the gospel, and sit with pleasure under our ministry, and if the
          word be faith fully preached they commend the preacher and give a
          gratified attention to the things that proceed out of his mouth; and
          yet they are living in known sin. Albeit they do not practically turn
          from sin and renounce the service of Satan, yet are they willing to
          bow with the righteous, to sing their psalms and assent to their
          prayers, and to accept their confession of faith. They are a teachable
          sort of people, so far as mere hearing goes but there they stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though these strangers feared Jehovah, and were willing to learn the
          way of his worship, yet they stuck to their old gods. "Ah," said the
          Babylonian, "I listen respectfully to what you have to say of this
          God, of the land; but Succoth-benoth for me; when I go home I shall
          offer sacrifice to him." The men of Cuthah said, "Verily this is good
          doctrine concerning the God of Israel; but the god of our fathers was
          Nergal, and to him will we cleave"; and the Sepharvites, though they
          wished to hear of the pure and holy Jehovah, and therefore learned
          from his law the command, "Thou shalt not kill," yet still they passed
          their children through the fire to Moloch, and did not cease from that
          most cruel of all religious rites. Thus you see that this
          mingle-mangle religion left the people practically where they were:
          whatever their fear might be, their customs and practices remained the
          same. Have you never met with persons of the same mongrel kind? If you
          have never done so, your class of acquaintances must be superior to
          mine At this moment I shall not speak at random, but aim at individual
          cases; for I know of persons who come to this place of worship with
          great regularity, and yet they serve their sins, and obey their own
          vicious passions. They take delight in the services of this house, and
          yet they are much at home with the god of this world. Some worship a
          deity quite as horrible as Moloch, whose name in the olden time was
          Bacchus -- the god or the wine-cup and the beer-barrel. They pay their
          eager devotions at his shrine, and yet they would be numbered with the
          people of God. They were drunk last night, and yet they are here this
          morning: possibly they will keep sober to-day; but they will not let
          many days pass before they will once more stagger before their
          abominable idol. In all places of worship there are people of this
          kind. Do not look round to see if there is a person present dressed
          like a working man, for I have not the poor in my eye at this time.
          Alas, this vice is to be met with in one rank as well as another, and
          the person I mean looks quite respectable, and wears broadcloth. Many
          worshippers of Bacchus do not drink so as to be found drunk and
          incapable in the street. O no; they go upstairs to their beds in their
          own houses, so that their condition is not observed; but still they
          must know that they are verging upon intoxication, if not actually
          gone. Woe unto such, who, while they pretend to be worshippers of
          Jehovah, are also worshippers of the beastly god of drunkenness. Is
          that too harsh a word? I beg the beasts' pardon for thus slandering
          them. Alas, there are others who adore the goddess Venus, the queen of
          lust and uncleanness. I say no more. It is a shame even to speak of
          things which are done of them in secret. Too often the god is Mammon,
          who is as degraded a deity as any of them. Such turn religion into a
          means of gain, and would sell Jesus himself for silver. The sin of
          Judas is one of which we may say, "So do they unto this day." Judas is
          an apostle, he listens to the Master's words, he preaches at the
          Master's command, and be works miracles in the Master's Dame; he also
          keeps the bag and manages the finance for Christ's little company, and
          he does it so carefully and economically that what he filches for
          himself is not missed, and he remains in good repute. Judas professes
          to serve Jesus, but all the while be is really serving himself, for
          secretly he abstracts from the treasury somewhat for his own pocket.
          "He had the bag and kept that which was put therein." There are such
          still in the churches of God: they do not actually steal, but they
          follow Jesus for what they can make or get out of him and his
          disciples. The symbols of their worship are the loaf and the fish.
          Now, this is as degrading a form of worship as the adoration of graven
          images. Gain is the god of many in all congregations: they seek Jesus,
          not because they care for his words, but because they eat of the
          loaves. They fear the Lord, but they serve other gods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Are there not to be found in the world men whose very calling is
          contrary to the spirit of true godliness? I did know, and may I never
          know again such an one, a man apparently most devout and gracious, who
          was a deacon of a church, and passed round the communion cup; and yet
          over the worst drinking dens in the town where he lived, where the
          lowest harlots congregated, you would see the man's name, for he was
          the brewer to whom the houses belonged -- houses which had been
          purposely adapted at his expense for purposes of vice and drunkenness.
          He took the profits of a filthy traffic, and then served at the Lord's
          table. I would judge no man, but some cases speak for themselves. God
          save the man that can pander to the devil, and then bow down, before
          the Most High. Persons are to be found, without a lantern and candle,
          who earn their money by ministering at the altars of Belial, and then
          offer a part of it to the Lord of hosts. Can they come from the place
          of revelling to the chamber of communion? Will they bring the wages of
          sin to the altar of God? He who makes money over the devil's back is a
          hypocrite if he lays his cankered coin at the apostles' feet. "Thy
          money perish with thee." How some men can rest in their impious
          pretensions it is not for me to guess; but methinks if their
          consciences were quickened, it would strike them as being a horrible
          thing in the land that they should be fearing the Lord, and serving
          other gods. I knew one who was always at the place of worship,
          prayer-meetings, and all, and yet he had forsaken the wife of his
          youth, and was the companion of gamblers, and drunkards, and the
          unclean. I know another of a much milder type: be is a regular hearer,
          but he has no sense of true religion. He is a steady, hard-working
          man, but he lives to hoard money, and neither the poor nor the church
          of God ever get a penny from him: bowels of compassion he has none. He
          is a stranger to private prayer, and his Bible is never read; but he
          never misses a sermon. He never lifts his thoughts above the bench at
          which he works, or the shop in which he serves, his whole conversation
          is of the world, and the gain thereof, and yet he has occupied a seat
          in the meeting-house from his youth up, and has never thought of
          leaving it except at quarter-days, when he is half a mind to give it
          up and save the few shillings which it costs him. Oh, sad, sad, sad! I
          can understand the man who honestly says, "I am living for the world
          and have no time for religion." I can understand the man who cries, "I
          love the world and mean to have my fill of it." I can understand the
          man who says, "I shall not pretend to pray or sing psalms, for I do
          not care about God or his ways"; but how can I comprehend those who
          are faithful to the outward part of religion, and profess to receive
          the truth, and yet have no heart for the love of Jesus, no care for
          the service of God? Oh, unhappy men, to come so near salvation in
          appearance, and to be so far off in reality! How can I explain their
          conduct? Truly, I must leave them among the mysteries of the moral
          world; for "they fear the Lord and serve their graven images unto this
          day." So far have we spoken upon the nature of this patched-up
          religion, this linsey-woolsey piety. May we have none of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Let us now consider THE MANNER OF ITS GROWTH. However came such a
          monstrous compound into this world?
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is the history of it. These people came to live where the people
          of God had lived. The Israelites were most unworthy worshippers of
          Jehovah; but, still, they were known to others as his people, and
          their land was Jehovah's land. If the Sepharvites had stopped at
          Sepharvaim they would never have thought of fearing Jehovah; if the
          men of Babylon had continued to live in Babylon they would have been
          perfectly satisfied with Bel, or Succoth-benoth, or whatever the name
          of their precious god might be: but when they were fetched out from
          their old haunts, and brought into Canaan, they came under a different
          influence, and a new order of things. God would not allow them to go
          the whole length of idolatry in his land: though he had cast out his
          people, yet still it was his land, and he would make these heathens
          know it, and show some little decency in their new abode. Now, it
          sometimes happens to utter worldlings that they are dropped into the
          midst of Christian people, and they naturally feel that they must not
          be different from everybody about them. A kind of fashion is set by
          the professors among whom they dwell, and they fall into it. If they
          do not become gracious people themselves they try to look a little
          like them. Everybody in the village attends a place of worship, and
          the new comers do the same, though they have no heart to it. They have
          not the courage of their want of conviction, so they just drift with
          the current, and as it happens to run in a religious direction they
          are as religious as the rest. Or it may be they have a godly mother,
          and their father is a believer, and so they adopt the traditions of
          the family. They would like to be free to forsake the ways of piety,
          but they cannot be quite so unkind to those whom they love, and so
          they yield to the influences which surround them, and become in a
          measure fearers of God, out of respect to their neighbors or their
          families. This is a poor reason for being religious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something else happened to these Assyrian immigrants which had a
          stronger influence still. At first they did not fear God, but the Lord
          sent lions among them. Matthew Henry says, "God can serve his own
          purposes by which he pleaseth, little or big, lice or lions." By the
          smaller means he plagued the Egyptians, and by the greater these
          invaders of his land. There is no creature so small or so great but
          God can employ it in his service and defeat his enemies thereby. When
          these lions had torn one and another, then the people trembled at the
          name of the God of the land, and desired to know the manner in which
          he would be worshipped. Affliction is a wild beast by which God
          teaches men who act like beasts. This is the growth of mongrelists.
          First, they are among godly people, and they must, therefore, go a
          little that way; and next, they are afflicted, and they must now go
          further still. The man has been ill, he has seen the brink of the
          grave; he has promised and vowed to attend to good things, in the hope
          that God would relent and permit him to live. Besides that, the man's
          extravagance has brought him into difficulties and straits; he cannot
          go so far or so fast as he formerly did, and hence he inclines to more
          staid and sober ways. He dares not follow his bent, for he finds vice
          too expensive, too disreputable, too dangerous. Many a man is driven
          by fear where he could not be drawn by love. He does not love the
          Lamb, but he does fear the lions. The rough voices of pain, poverty,
          shame, and death work a kind of law -- work upon certain consciences
          which are insensible to spiritual arguments. They are forced, like the
          devils, to believe and tremble. Apprehension does not in their case
          lead to conversion, but it compels an outward respect for divine
          things. They argue that if the ills they feel do not reform them they
          may expect worse. If God begins with lions, what will come next?
          Therefore, they outwardly humble themselves, and yield homage to the
          God they dread.
        </p>
        <p>
          But notice, that the root of this religion is fear. There is no love
          on the right side; that affection is in the opposite scale. Their
          hearts go after their idols, but to Jehovah they yield nothing but
          dread. How many there are whose religion consists in a fear of hell, a
          dread of the consequences of their sin. If there were no hell they
          would drink up sin as the ox, standing knee-deep in the stream, sucks
          in the water. If sin were not followed with inconvenient consequences,
          they would live in it as their element, as fishes swim in the sea.
          They are only kept under by the hangman's whip or the jailer's keys.
          They dread God, and this is but a gentler form of hating him. Ah, this
          is a poor religion, a religion of bondage and terror. Thank God, dear
          friends, if you have been delivered from it; but it is sure to be the
          characteristic of a fusion of fearing God and serving other gods.
        </p>
        <p>
          One reason why they dropped into this self-contradictory religion was
          that they had a trimming teacher. The king of Assyria sent them a
          priest: he could not have sent them a prophet, but that was what they
          really wanted. He sent them a Bethelite, not a genuine servant of
          Jehovah, but one who worshipped God by means of symbols; and this the
          Lord had expressly forbidden. If this priest did not break the first
          commandment by setting up other gods, yet he broke the second by
          making an image to represent the true God. What saith the Lord? "Thou
          shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything
          that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is
          in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them,
          nor serve them." This priest taught them the calf worship, but he
          winked at their false deities. When he saw them each one bowing before
          his own idol, he called it a natural mistake, and by no means spake
          indignantly to them. If one of them worshipped Succoth-benoth, so long
          as he also brought an offering to Jehovah, he was not so uncharitable
          as to condemn him. He cried, "Peace, peace," for he was a
          large-hearted man, and belonged to the Broad Church who believe in the
          good intentions of all men, and manufacture excuses for all the
          religions of the age. I know of no surer way of a people's perishing
          than by being led by one who does not speak out straight, and honestly
          denounce evil. If the minister halts between two opinions, do you
          wonder that the congregation is undecided? If the preacher trims and
          twists to please all parties, can you expect his people to be honest?
          If I wink at your inconsistencies will you not soon be hardened in
          them? Like priest, like people. A cowardly preacher suits hardened
          sinners. Those who are afraid to rebuke sin, or to probe the
          conscience, will have much to answer for. May God save you from being
          led into the ditch by a blind guide.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet is not a mingle-mangle of Christ and Belial the common
          religion of the day? Is not worldly piety, or pious worldliness, the
          current religion of England? They live among godly people, and God
          chastens them, and they therefore fear him, but not enough to give
          their hearts to him. They seek out a trimming teacher who is not too
          precise and plain-spoken, and they settle down comfortably to a
          mongrel faith, half truth, half error, and a mongrel worship half dead
          form, and half orthodoxy. God have mercy upon men, and bring them out
          from the world; for he will not have a compound of world and grace.
          "Come ye out from among them," saith he, "be ye separate: touch not
          the unclean thing." "If God be God, serve him: if Baal be God, serve
          him." There can be no alliance between the two. Jehovah and Baal can
          never be friends. "Ye cannot serve God and Mammon." "No man can serve
          two masters." All attempts at compromise or comprehensiveness in
          matters of truth and purity are founded on falsehood, and falsehood is
          all that can come of them. May God save us from such hateful
          doublemindedness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus have I described the nature and the growth of this cross-bred
          religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Thirdly, let us estimate THE VALUE OF THIS RELIGION. What is it
          worth? First, it must evidently be feeble on both sides, because the
          man who serves Succoth-benoth cannot do it thoroughly if all the while
          be fears Jehovah; and he who fears Jehovah cannot be sincere it be is
          worshipping Moloch. The one sucks out the life of the other. Either
          one or the other alone might breed an intense worshipper; but when
          there are two deities, it is written, "Their heart is divided, now
          shall they be found wanting." A man of the world who is out and out in
          his conduct can make the best of his worldliness: what joy there is in
          it he gets, what profit there is to be made out of it be obtains; but
          if he tries to mix godliness with it he is pouring water on the fire,
          and hindering himself. On the other hand, if a man goes in for
          godliness, he will assuredly make something of it, by the blessing of
          God: if there be any joy, if there be any holiness, if there be any
          power, the man who is thorough-going wins it; but suppose he is pulled
          back by his love of sin, then he may possess enough religion to make
          him miserable, and enough of sin to prevent his salvation; but the two
          are opposed, and between them he finds no rest. The man is lame on
          both feet, impotent in both directions. He is like the salt which has
          lost its savor, neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill,
          but to be trodden under foot of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first I should think that the mixture of the true with the false at
          Samaria looked like an improvement. I should not wonder but what the
          priests of Judah were rather glad to bear that the lions had come
          among the strangers, and that the people wanted to know something
          about Jehovah. It had a look in the right direction, and consequently
          the Scripture says that they feared God; but yet this fear of God was
          so hollow that, if you turn to the thirty-fourth verse, you will read,
          "They fear not the Lord." Sometimes a verbal contradiction most
          accurately states the truth. They feared the Lord only in a certain
          sense; but, inasmuch as they also served other gods, it came to this
          when summed up, that they did not fear God at all. The man who is
          religious and also immoral, to put it in short, is irreligious. He who
          makes a great fuss about godliness and yet acts in an ungodly way,
          when all comes to all, is an ungodly man. The value of this mixture is
          less than nothing. It is sin with a little varnish upon it. It is
          enmity to God with a brilliant colouring of formality: it is standing
          out against the Most High, and yet with a Judas kiss pretending to pay
          him homage.
        </p>
        <p>
          These Samaritans in after years became the bitterest foes of God's
          people. Read the Book of Nehemiah, and you will see that the most
          bitter opponents of that godly man were those mongrels. Their fear of
          God was such that they wanted to join with the Jews in building the
          Temple, and when they found that the Jews would not have them, they
          became their fiercest foes. No people do so much hurt as those who are
          like Jack-o'-both-sides. The mixed multitude that came out of Egypt
          with the Israelites, fell a-lusting. The mischief does not begin with
          the people of God, but with those who are with them, but not of them.
          The tares which you cannot root out grow with the wheat, and draw away
          from it that which should have nourished it. As the clinging ivy will
          eat out the life of a tree around which it climbs, so will these
          impostors devour the church if they be left to their own devices. This
          patchwork religion is of more value to the devil than to anyone else;
          it is his favourite livery, and I pray you hate it, for it is a
          garment spotted by the flesh. I believe, dear friends, that those
          people who have a dread of God, which makes them appear religious, and
          who yet all the while live in their sins, are most in danger of any
          people in the world; for there is no getting at them to save them. You
          preach to sinners, and they say, "He does not mean us, for we are
          saints." You bring the thunders of the law to bear on the
          congregation, and they, being inside the church, are not afraid of the
          tempest. They hide behind their false profession. There is more
          likelihood of the salvation of a downright outsider than of these
          pretenders. They hold with the bare and run with the hounds, they fear
          the Lord and serve other gods, and they will perish in their folly.
          Their ruin will be all the more terrible because they sin in the
          light. They have so much conscience that they know what is right and
          what is wrong, and they deliberately choose to abide with the evil,
          even though at the same time they do despite to their better selves.
          Surely they will be banished to the deepest hell who seemed inclined
          to go towards heaven, but who, nevertheless, presumptuously wrenched
          off bolts and bars to force their way to destruction. O you religious
          worldlings, for you there is reserved the blackness of darkness for
          ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          How provoking this adulterated religion must be to God! It is even
          provoking to God's minister to be pestered with men whose hypocrisies
          weaken the force of his testimony. Here is a man who is known to be
          one of my hearers, and yet at the same time he drinks, and speaks
          lewdly, and acts wickedly. What have I to do with him? His tongue is
          never still, and he tells everybody that he is a friend of mine, and
          my great admirer, and then men lay his conduct at my door, and wonder
          what my doctrine must be. I could almost say, "Sir, be my enemy, for
          this will harm me less than your friendship." If this grieves his
          ministers, how provoking must it be to God himself: these people are
          seen to worship him, and when strangers come into the assembly they
          spy out these hypocrites, and straightway charge the holy Jesus with
          all their faults. "See," say they, "there is old So-and-so. He is a
          great man among them, and yet I saw him come out of the gin-palace
          more than three sheets in the wind." Thus the holy God is dishonored
          by these unholy hypocrites. True religion suffers for their falsehood.
          One may fancy the Lord Jesus saying, "Come now, if you must needs
          serve the devil, do it; but do not loiter around my gates and boast of
          being my servants." The holy God must often feel his indignation burn
          against unholy men and women who intrude into his courts and dare to
          pass themselves off under his name. I put this very plainly. Some of
          you do not know how necessary it is to speak plainly in these days. If
          any of you perish through hypocrisy it shall not be because I did not
          speak boldly about it. May God the Holy Spirit of his great mercy
          apply the words where they need to be applied, that those who are
          fearing God and serving other gods may grieve over their
          inconsistency, and repent and turn in very deed and truth to the Most
          High.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. I pass briefly to another important point, which is this, -- THE
          CONTINUANCE OF THIS EVIL: for the text says, "As did their fathers, so
          do they, unto this day." I believe in the final perseverance of the
          saints: I am almost obliged to believe in the final perseverance of
          hypocrites; for, really, when a man once screws himself up to play the
          double, and both to fear God and serve other gods, he is very apt to
          stick there. It takes a great deal of effort to bring yourself to that
          degree of wickedness; you must use a great deal of damping of
          conscience and quenching of the Spirit before you can reach that
          shameless point, and having once gained that position you are apt to
          keep it all your life long. "So do they unto this day."
        </p>
        <p>
          Look, friends. It seems unlikely that a man would willingly continue
          in such a ridiculous position even for an hour. I call it ridiculous,
          for it is unreasonable and outrageous to be serving God and Satan at
          the same time. It is inconsistent and self-contradictory, and yet,
          though it be so, it is a sad fact that it is a deep pit and the
          abhorred of the Lord fall therein, seldom to be lifted out of it.
          Often by the grace of God we see the confirmed sinner plucked like a
          brand from the burning; but, oh, how seldom do we see the
          hollow-hearted Pharisee brought out of his delusions. On the anvil of
          a false profession Satan hammers out the most hardened of hard hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          One reason why it can be said of most men -- "so do they unto this
          day," is because it yields them a sort of comfort; at any rate it
          keeps off the lions. "Why," say they, "it must be the right thing to
          do, for now we are quiet." While they lived in sin without a pretense
          of religion, when the minister preached the word powerfully, they went
          home trembling; now they do not care what he preaches about: the lions
          roar no longer, not so much as a cub shows itself. Though they do
          drink a little, though they do use strong language now and then,
          though they are really unconverted, yet since they have taken a pew at
          the church, or the chapel, they feel wonderfully easy in their minds.
          This peace they think to be worth a Jew's eye. It is so soothing and
          pacifying to the conscience to feel that you mix up with the best of
          the saints, and are highly esteemed by them. So they wrap it up, and
          go down to hell with a lie in their right hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The worst of it is that not only men themselves do this, but their
          children and their children's children do the same: "As their fathers
          did, so do they unto this day." In an out-and-out godly family it is a
          great joy to see the children springing up to fear God; but these
          double people, these borderers, see no such desirable succession.
          Frequently there is an open decline from apparent religion: the sons
          do not care to go where the old man went at all; nor need we wonder,
          since it did him so little good. He made all unhappy at home, and none
          are eager to imitate him. In other cases, where there was kindness at
          home, the children are apt to try the same plan as their fathers, and
          mingle a little religion with a great deal of worldliness. They are
          just as keen and sharp as their worldly sire, and they see on which
          side their bread is buttered, and therefore they keep up the
          reputation of religion. A little gilt and paint go a long way, and so
          they lay it on. They fly the flag of Christ, at any rate, even though
          the vessel does not belong to his dominion, and is not bound for the
          port of glory. As vessels sometimes run a blockade under a false flag,
          so do they reap many advantages from sailing under Christian colors.
          This detestable iniquity will not die out: it multiplies itself,
          scattering its own seed on all sides, and so from generation to
          generation it lives on; whole nations fear the Lord and serve other
          gods.
        </p>
        <p>
          The greatest curse, perhaps, that ever visited the world came upon it
          in this way. Certain vain-glorious preachers desired to convert the
          world at a stroke, and to make converts without the work of the
          Spirit. They saw the people worshipping their gods, and they thought
          that if they could call these by the names of saints and martyrs the
          people would not mind the change, and so they would be converted. The
          idea was to Christianize heathenism. They virtually said to idolaters,
          "Now, good people, you may keep on with your worship, and yet you can
          be Christians at the same time. This image of the Queen of heaven at
          your door need not be moved. Light the lamp still; only call the image
          our Lady,' and the Blessed Virgin.' Here is another image; don't pull
          it down, but change its name from Jupiter to Peter." Thus with a mere
          change of names they perpetuated idolatry: they set up their altars in
          the groves, and upon every high hill, and the people were converted
          without knowing it -- converted to a baser heathenism than their own.
          They wanted priests, and, lo, there they were, robed like those who
          served at the altars of Jove. The people saw the same altars and
          sniffed the same incense, kept the same holy days and observed the
          same carnivals as aforetime, and called everything by Christian names.
          Hence came what is now called the Roman Catholic religion, which is
          simply fearing God and serving other gods. Every village has its own
          peculiar saint, and often its own particular black or white image of
          the Virgin, with miracles and wonders to sanctify the shrine. This
          evil wrought so universally that Christianity seemed in danger of
          extinction from the prevalence of idolatry, and it would have utterly
          expired had it not been of God, and had he not therefore once more put
          forth his hand and raised up reformers, who cried out, "There is but
          one God, and one Mediator between God and man." Brave voices called
          the church back to her allegiance and to the parity of her faith. As
          for any of you who are trying to link good and evil, truth and
          falsehood together, beware of the monstrous birth which will come of
          such an alliance: it will bring on you a curse from the Most High.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. I shall now close by saying a few words byway of CURE OF THIS
          DREADFUL EVIL OF MONGRELISM; this fearing the Lord, and serving other
          gods. Suppose men were thus fall of duplicity in politics, what would
          be thought of them? If a war should rage between two nations, what
          would be thought of the man who professed to serve the Queen, and all
          the while was playing his cards to win favor with the Queen's enemies.
          What would he be? A liberal-minded person? A gentleman of broad
          sympathies? Perhaps so. But also he would be a traitor, and when he
          was found out he would be shot. He who in any way tries to serve God
          and his enemies, is a traitor to God: that is what it comes to. In
          ordinary politics, if there be two parties, and a man comes forward
          and says, "I am on your side," and all the while he is doing his best
          to help the opposition, everybody says that he is a mean fellow. And
          what meanness it is to say, "I am for Christ," and yet practically to
          be for his enemies; to cry up holiness, and yet to live in sin; to
          preach up faith in Christ, and yet to trust in your own merits. This
          wretched shuffling indicates a meanness of soul from which may God in
          infinite mercy deliver us. Suppose a man in business said, "Oh, yes, I
          will be an honest man, but I will at the same time practice a trick or
          two; I will be as straight as a line, but yet I will be crooked too."
          Why, he would very soon be known by only one name, and that name a
          dishonorable one. A merchant cannot be honest and dishonest, a woman
          cannot be both chaste and unchaste, pure and impure, at the same time;
          and a man cannot be truly with God and yet with the world; the
          amalgamation is impossible. Everybody sees through such sham
          godliness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah, my dear friends, suppose that God were to treat us after the like
          double fashion; suppose he smiled to-day and cursed to-morrow suppose
          be said, "You fear me, and so I will give you comfort to-day but
          inasmuch as you worship other gods, when it comes to the last I will
          send you to your own gods; you shall go down to hell." You want one
          course of conduct from God, mercy, tenderness, gentleness,
          forgiveness; but if you play fast and loose with him, what is this but
          mocking him? Shall a man mock God? O thou great Father of our spirits,
          if we poor prodigals return to thee, shall we come driving all the
          swine in front of us, and bringing all the harlots and citizens of the
          far country at our heels, and introduce ourselves to thee by saying,
          "Father, we have sinned, and have come home to be forgiven and to go
          on sinning"? It were infernal, -- I can say no less. Yet some attempt
          it. Shall any of us come to the blessed Christ upon the cross, and
          look up to his dear wounds, and say to him, "Redeemer, we come to
          thee; thou shalt be our Savior, thou shalt deliver us from the wrath
          to come; but, behold, when we have washed our robes we will defile
          them again in the filth of the world. Wash us, and we will go back,
          like the sow, to wallow in the mire. Forgive us, and we will use the
          immunity which thy mercy grants us, as a further incentive to
          rebellion"? I can imagine such language as that being used by Satan;
          but methinks few of you have descended so low as to talk thus. Yet is
          not that exactly what the man says who professes to be a Christian,
          and yet wilfully lives in sin?
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, what shall I say of the Holy Spirit? If he does not dwell in
          our hearts we are lost; there is no hope for us unless he rules within
          us. And shall we dare to say
        </p>
        <p>"Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,</p>
        <p>With all thy quickening powers,"</p>
        <p>
          meanwhile I will live in filthiness and selfishness. Come, Holy
          Spirit, come and dwell with me, and I will hate my brother, I will
          boil with angry temper, and will be black with malice, so as to make
          my home miserable. Come, Holy Spirit, Heavenly Dove, come dwell within
          my soul, and I will carry thee to the theater, and the ball-room, and
          the house of evil name.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hate to utter such language even for the sake of exposing it; but
          what must God think of men who do not say so, but who act so; who,
          like Balaam, live in sin and yet cry, "Let me die the death of the
          righteous, and let my last end be like his." I dare not preach from
          that very popular text, for it is the mean, selfish wish of a man who
          even at the last would save his own skin. The old sneak! He wanted to
          live and serve the devil, and then cry off at the last. Surely he
          might have said, "I have been a prophet of Satan, and have sold my
          soul to him; let me die as I have lived." I would wish to live in such
          a way as I would wish to die. If I would not like to die as I am, then
          I ought not to live as I am. If I am in a condition in which I dare
          not meet my God, may God in mercy fetch me out of the condition at
          once. Let me be right, and let there be no mistake about it; but do
          not let me try to be both right and wrong, washed and filthy, white
          and black, a child of God and a child of Satan. God has separated
          heaven and hell by a gulf that never can be passed, and he has divided
          the two characters which shall people those two places by an equally
          wide gulf. This division can be passed by his grace, but none can
          inhabit the intermediate space. None can hang between spiritual death
          and spiritual life, so as to be partly in one and partly in the other.
          Decide, then, decide. Be one thing or the other. "How long halt ye
          between two opinions?" Again I say with Elias, upon Carmel, "If the
          Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him." But do not mix
          the worship of the two, for thus you will provoke God, and cause his
          anger to burn like fire against you. May God bless this word, for his
          name's sake. Amen.
