          TITLE. To the Chief Musician, a Psalm for the sons of Korah. This is
          precisely the same as on former occasions, and no remark is needed.

        <p align="justify">
          DIVISION. The poet musician sings, to the accompaniment of his harp,
          the despicable character of those who trust in their wealth, and so he
          consoles the oppressed believer.

        <p align="justify">The first four verses are a preface;</p>
        <p align="justify">
          from verses 5-12 all fear of great oppressors is removed by the

          from verses 16-20 the lesson from the whole is given in an admonitory
          form.

          Note the chorus in Verses 2, 20, and also the two Selahs.<br />

        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verses 1-4.</p></b> In these four verses the poet
        prophet calls universal humanity to listen to his didactic hymn.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. Hear this, all you people.</p></b>All
        men are concerned in the subject, and therefore <i>to </i>them that the
        psalmist would speak. It is not a topic which men delight to consider,
        and therefore he who would instruct them must press them to give ear.
        Where, as in this case, the theme claims to be wisdom and understanding,
        attention is very properly demanded; and when the style combines the
        sententiousness of the proverb with the sweetness of poetry, interest is
        readily excited.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Give ear, all you inhabitants of the world.</p></b
        >"He who has ears to hear let him hear." Men dwelling in all climates
        are equally concerned in the subject, for the laws of providence are the
        same in all lands. It is wise for each one to feel I am a man, and
        therefore everything which concerns mortals has a personal interest to
        me. We must all appear before the judgment seat, and therefore we all
        should give earnest heed to holy admonition which may help us to prepare
        for that dread event. He who refuses to receive instruction by the ear,
        will not be able to escape receiving destruction by it when the Judge
        shall say, "Depart, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire!"
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 2. Both low and high, rich and poor, together.
          </p></b
        >
        Sons of great men, and children of base men; men of large estate, and
        you who pine in poverty—you are all bidden to hear the inspired minstrel
        as he touches his harp to a mournful but instructive lay. The
        <i>low </i>will be encouraged, the <i>high </i>will be warned, the
        <i>rich </i>will be sobered, the <i>poor </i>consoled—there will be a
        useful lesson for each if they are willing to learn it.
        <p align="justify">
          Our preaching ought to have a voice for all classes, and all should
          have an ear for it. To suit our word to the <i>rich </i>alone is
          wicked sycophancy, and to aim only at pleasing the <i>poor </i>is to
          act the part of a demagogue. Truth may be so spoken as to command the
          ear of all, and wise men seek to learn that acceptable style.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Rich and poor must soon meet together in the grave, they may well be
          content to meet together now. In the congregation of the dead, all
          differences of rank will be obliterated, they ought not now to be
          obstructions to united instructions.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 3. My mouth shall speak of wisdom.</p></b>
        Inspired and therefore lifted beyond himself, the prophet is not
        praising his own attainments, but extolling the divine Spirit which
        spoke in him. He knew that the Spirit of truth and wisdom spoke through
        him. He who is not sure that his matter is good, has no right to ask a
        hearing.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            And the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.
          </p></b
        >
        The same Spirit who made the ancient seers eloquent, also made them
        thoughtful.
        <i
          >The help of the Holy Spirit was never meant to supersede the use of
          our own mental powers. </i
        >The Holy Spirit does not make us speak as Balaam's donkey, which merely
        uttered sounds, but never meditated; but he first leads us to consider
        and reflect, and then he gives us the tongue of fire to speak with
        power.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Verse 4. I will incline my ear to a parable.</p></b
        >He who would have others hear, begins by hearing himself. As the
        minstrel leans his ear to his harp, so must the preacher give his whole
        soul to his ministry.

        <p align="justify">
          The truth came to the psalmist as a parable, and he endeavored to
          unriddle it for popular use. He would not leave the truth in
          obscurity, but he listened to its voice until he so well understood it
          as to be able to interpret and translate it into the common language
          of the multitude. Still of necessity it would remain a problem, and a
          dark saying to the unenlightened many, but this would not be the
          songster's fault, for, says he,
          <b>I will open my dark saying upon the harp</b>.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The writer was no mystic, delighting in deep and cloudy things—yet he
          was not afraid of the most profound topics; he tried to open the
          treasures of darkness, and to uplift pearls from the deep. To win
          attention he cast his proverbial philosophy into the form of song, and
          tuned his harp to the solemn tone of his subject.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us gather round the minstrel of the King of kings, and hear the
          Psalm which first was led by the chief musician, as the chorus of the
          sons of Korah lifted up their voices in the temple.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 5. Why should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of
            my heels shall compass me about?
          </p></b
        >
        The man of God looks calmly forward to dark times when those evils which
        have dogged his heels shall gain a temporary advantage over him.
        Iniquitous men, here called in the abstract <i>iniquity</i>, lie in wait
        for the righteous, as serpents that aim at the heels of travelers.
        <b> <p align="justify">The iniquity of our heels</p></b> is that evil
        which aims to trip us up or impede us. It was an old prophecy that the
        serpent should wound the heel of the woman's seed, and the enemy of our
        souls is diligent to fulfill that premonition.
        <p align="justify">
          In some dreary part of our road it may be that evil will wax stronger
          and bolder, and gaining upon us will openly assail us; those who
          followed at our heels like a pack of wolves, may perhaps overtake us,
          and compass us about. What then? Shall we yield to cowardice? Shall we
          be a prey to their teeth? God forbid. Nay, we will not even fear, for
          what are these foes? What indeed, but mortal men who shall perish and
          pass away?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There can be no real ground of alarm to the faithful. Their enemies
          are too insignificant to be worthy of one thrill of fear. Does not the
          Lord say to us, "I, even I, am he who comforts you. Who are you, that
          you should be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man
          which shall be made as grass?"
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 6.</p></b> What if the godly man's foes be
        among the great ones of the earth! Yet he need not fear them.
        <b> <p align="justify">Those who trust in their wealth.</p></b> Poor
        fools, to be content with such a rotten confidence. When we set our rock
        in contrast with theirs, it would be folly to be afraid of them. Even
        though they are loud in their brags, we can afford to smile. What if
        they boast themselves in the multitude of their riches? Yet while we
        glory in our God we are not dismayed by their proud threatenings. Great
        strength, position, and estate, make wicked men very lofty in their own
        esteem, and tyrannical towards others; but the heir of Heaven is not
        overawed by their dignity, nor cowed by their haughtiness. He sees the
        small value of riches, and the helplessness of their owners in the hour
        of death, and therefore he is not so base as to be afraid of an
        ephemera, a moth, a bubble.

            Verse 7. None of them can by any means redeem his brother.
          </p></b
        >
        With all their riches, the whole of them put together could not rescue a
        comrade from the chill grasp of death. They boast of what they will do
        with <i>us</i>, let them see to themselves<i
          >. Let them weigh their gold in the scales of death, and see how much
          they can buy therewith from the worm and the grave</i

        ever so dearly, they cannot give to God a ransom for him. A king's
        ransom would be of no avail, a mountain of rubies, a continent of
        silver, a world of gold, a sun of diamonds—would all be utterly
        despised.

        Too great is the price—hence the purchase is hopeless. Forever must the

          </p></b
        >
        Mad are men now after gold, what would they be if it could buy the
        elixir of immortality? Gold is lavished out of the bag to cheat the worm
        of the poor body by embalming it, or enshrining it in a coffin of
        lead—but it is a miserable business, a very burlesque and comedy. As for
        the soul, it is too subtle a thing to be detained when it hears the
        divine command to soar through tracks unknown. Never, therefore, will we
        fear those base nibblers at our heels, whose boasted treasure proves to
        be so powerless to save.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 10. For he sees that wise men die.</p></b>
        Every one sees this. The proud persecuting rich man cannot help seeing
        it. He cannot shut his eyes to the fact that wiser men than he are
        dying, and that he also, with all his craft, must die.
        <p align="justify">
          Likewise the fool and the brutish person perish. Folly has no immunity
          from death. Off goes the jester's cap, as well as the student's gown.
          Jollity cannot laugh off the dying hour. Death who visits the
          university, does not spare the tavern. Thoughtlessness and brutishness
          meet their end, as surely as <i>much care </i>and
          <i>wasting study</i>.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In fact, while the truly wise, so far as this world is concerned, die,
          the fool has a worse lot, for he perishes, is blotted out of
          remembrance, bewailed by none, remembered no more.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">And leave their wealth to others.</p></b> Not a
        farthing can they carry with them. Whether heirs of their own body,
        lawfully begotten, inherit their estates, or they remain unclaimed, it
        matters not—their hoardings are no longer theirs. Friends may quarrel
        over their property, or strangers divide it as spoil, they cannot
        interfere. You boasters, hold you your own, before you dream of
        despoiling the sons of the living God. Keep shoes to your own feet in

        The sweetest reflection to the upright is that "the morning" here
        intended begins an endless, changeless, day.

          What a vexation of spirit to the proud worldling, when the Judge of

          despised, exalted high in Heaven, while he himself is cast away!

        Whatever of glory the ungodly had shall disappear in the tomb. Form and

          The beauty of the righteous is not yet revealed, it waits its

        Forth from that temporary resting place we shall come in due time,

        death.
        <p align="justify">
          No redemption could man find in riches, but God has found it in the
          blood of his dear Son. Our Elder Brother has given to God a ransom,
          and we are the redeemed of the Lord. Because of this redemption by
          price, we shall assuredly be redeemed by power out of the hand of the
          last enemy.

        <i>body </i>shall sleep in Jesus until, being raised in his image, it

        Temporal prosperity is too small a matter to be worth fretting about.
        Let the <i>dogs </i>have their bones, and the <i>swine </i>their chaff.
        <b> <p align="justify">When the glory of his house is increased.</p></b>
        Though the sinner and his family are in great esteem, and stand
        exceedingly high, never mind; all things will be righted in due time.
        Only those whose judgment is worthless, will esteem men the more because
        their lands are broader; those who are highly estimated for such
        unreasonable reasons, will find their level before long, when truth and

        Through the river of death man must pass naked. Not a rag of all his
        clothing, not a coin of all his treasure, not a jot of all his honor,
        can the dying worldling carry with him. Why then fret ourselves about so

        The generality of men worship success, however it may be gained. The
        color of the winning horse is no matter; it is the winner, and that is
        enough. "Take care of Number One," is the world's proverbial philosophy,
        and he who gives good heed to it is "a clever fellow," "a fine man of
        business," "a shrewd common sense tradesman," "a man with his head put
        on the right way."

        <p align="justify">
          Get money, and you will be "respectable," "a substantial man," and

          To do good wins fame in Heaven, but to do good to yourself is the
          prudent thing among men of the world. Yet not a whisper of worldly
          congratulation can follow the departing millionaire; they say he died
          worth a mint of money, but what charm has that fact to the dull cold
          ear of death? <i>The banker rots as fast as the shoeblack</i>, and the
          noble becomes as putrid as the pauper.

            perish</b
          >. <i>Understanding </i>makes men different from animals, but if they
          will not follow the highest wisdom, and like beasts find their
          <i>all </i>in this life—then their end shall be as base and
          dishonorable as that of beasts slain in the chase, or slaughtered in
          the shambles. From the loftiest elevation of worldly honor, to the
          uttermost depths of death and damnation, is but a step.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Saddest of all is the reflection, that though men are like beasts in
          all the degradation of perishing—yet not in the rest which animal
          perishing secures, for, alas! it is written, "These shall go away into
          everlasting punishment."
