          And in exhorting you, we also admonish all who have embraced the faith
          of Christ, and who have taken from Christ the name of Christian, that
          ye make your Christianity vain in no respect, but keep stedfastly the
          engagement which ye took upon yourselves in baptism, so that ye may be
          found not reprobate, but worthy in His presence. And if any one of you
          has entered the life which has all things common, and has taken the
          vow to hold no private property, let him see to it that he make not
          his promise vain, but let him keep with all faithfulness this
          engagement which he has made to the Lord, so that he may acquire for
          himself not damnation, but a reward; for it is better for a man not to
          take a vow at all than not to discharge to the best of his ability the
          vow that he has made. For they who have made a vow, or taken on them
          the faith, and have not kept their vow, or have carried out their life
          in things evil, are punished more severely than those who have carried
          out their life without a vow, or have died without faith, but not
          without doing good works. For to this end have we received a
          reasonable mind by the gift of nature, and the renewal also of the
          second birth, that, according to the apostle, we may discern
          (sapiamus) rather things above, and not things on the earth; for the
          wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For to what, most dearly
          beloved, does the wisdom of this world urge us, but to seek things
          that are hurtful, and to love things that are to perish, and to
          neglect things that are healthful, and to esteem as of no value things
          that are lasting? It commends the love of money, of which it is said,
          The love of money is the root of all evil; and which has this evil in
          especial, that while it obtrudes the transitory, it hides from view
          the eternal; and while it looks on things that are outside, it does
          not look in upon things that lurk within; and while it seeks after
          strange things, it is an evil that makes itself strange to him who
          does it. Behold, to what does the wisdom of this world urge a man? To
          live in pleasures. Whence it is said: A widow that liveth in pleasure,
          is dead while she liveth. It urges a man to feed the flesh with the
          softest delights, with sins, and vices, and flames, to press the soul
          with intemperance in food and wine, and to check the life of the
          spirit, and to put into his enemy's hand the sword to be used against
          himself. Behold, what is the counsel which the wisdom of this world
          gives? That those who are good should choose rather to be evil, and
          that in error of mind they should be zealous to be sinners, and should
          not bethink themselves of that terrible voice of God, when the wicked
          shall be burned up like grass. <br />
