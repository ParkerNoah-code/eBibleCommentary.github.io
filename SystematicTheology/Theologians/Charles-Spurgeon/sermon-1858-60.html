        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.223)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, November 14th, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great." --
          Ezekiel 9:9.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin." -- 1
          John 1:7.
        </p>
        <p>
          ISHALL HAVE two texts this morning -- the evil and its remedy. "The
          iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great;" and
          "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin."
        </p>
        <p>
          We can learn nothing of the gospel, except by feeling its truths -- no
          one truth of the gospel is ever truly known and really learned, until
          we have tested and tried and proved it, and its power has been
          exercised upon us. I have heard of a naturalist, who thought himself
          exceedingly wise with regard to the natural history of birds, and yet
          he had learned all he knew in his study, and had never so much as seen
          a bird either flying through the air or sitting upon its perch. He was
          but a fool although he thought himself exceeding wise. And there are
          some men who like him think themselves great theologians; they might
          even pretend to take a doctor's degree in divinity; and yet, if we
          came to the root of the matter, and asked them whether they ever saw
          or felt any of these things of which they talked, they would have to
          say, "No; I know these things in the letter, but not in the spirit; I
          understand them as a matter of theory, but not as things of my own
          consciousness and experience." Be assured, that as the naturalist who
          was merely the student of other men's observations knew nothing, so
          the man who pretends to religion, but has never entered into the
          depths and power of its doctrines, or felt the influence of them upon
          his heart, knows nothing whatever, and all the knowledge he pretendeth
          to is but varnished ignorance. There are some sciences that may be
          learned by the head, but the science of Christ crucified can only be
          learned by the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have made use of this remark as the preface to my sermon, because I
          think it will be forced from each of our hearts before we have done,
          if the two truths which I shall consider this morning, shall come at
          all home to us with power. The first truth is the greatness of our
          sin. No man can know the greatness of sin till he has felt it, for
          there is no measuring-rod for sin, except its condemnation in our own
          conscience, when the law of God speaks to us with a terror that may be
          felt. And as for the richness of the blood of Christ and its ability
          to wash us, of that also we can know nothing till we have ourselves
          been washed, and have ourselves proved that the blood of Jesus Christ
          the Son of God hath cleansed us from all sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I shall begin, then, with the first doctrine as it is contained in
          the ninth chapter of Ezekiel, the ninth verse, -- "The iniquity of the
          house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great." There are two great
          lessons which every man must learn, and learn by experience, before he
          can be a Christian. First, he must learn that sin is an exceeding
          great and evil thing; and he must learn also that the blood of Christ
          is an exceedingly precious thing, and is able to save unto the
          uttermost them that come unto it. The former lesson we have before us.
          O may God, by his infinite spirit, by his great wisdom, teach it to
          some of us who never knew it before!
        </p>
        <p>
          Some men imagine that the gospel was devised, in some way or other, to
          soften down the harshness of God towards sin. Ah! how mistaken the
          idea! There is no more harsh condemnation of sin anywhere than in the
          gospel. Ye shall go to Sinai, and ye shall there hear its thunders
          rolling; ye shall behold the flashing of its terrible lightnings,
          till, like Moses, ye shall exceedingly fear and quake, and come away
          declaring that sin must be a terrible thing, otherwise, the Holy One
          had never come upon Mount Paran with all these terrors round about
          him. But after that ye shall go to Calvary; there ye shall see no
          lightnings, and ye shall hear no thunders, but instead thereof, ye
          shall hear the groans of an expiring God, and ye shall behold the
          contortions and agonies of one who bore
        </p>
        <p>"All that Incarnate God could bear,</p>
        <p>With strength enough, and none to spare."</p>
        <p>
          And then ye shall say, "Now, though I never fear nor quake, yet I know
          how exceedingly great a thing sin must be, since such a sacrifice was
          required to make an atonement for it. Oh! sinners; if ye come to the
          gospel, imagining that there ye shall find an apology for your sin, ye
          have indeed mistaken your way. Moses charges you with sin, and tells
          you that you are without excuse; but as for the gospel, it rends away
          from you every shadow of a covering; it leaves you without a cloak for
          your sin; it tells you that you have sinned wilfully against the Most
          High God -- that ye have not an apology that ye can possibly make for
          all the iniquities that ye have committed against him; and so far in
          any way from smoothing over your sin, and telling you that you are a
          weak creature and, therefore could not help your sin, it charges upon
          you the very weakness of your nature, and makes that itself the most
          damning sin of all. If ye seek apologies, better look even into the
          face of Moses, when it is clothed with all the majesty of the terrors
          of the law, than into the face of the gospel, for that is more
          terrible by far to him who seeks to cloak his sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor does the gospel in any way whatever give man a hope that the
          claims of the law will be in any way loosened. Some imagine that under
          the old dispensation God demanded great things of man -- that he did
          bind upon man heavy burdens that were grievous to he borne -- and they
          suppose that Christ came into the world to put upon the shoulders of
          men a lighter law, something which it would be more easy for them to
          obey -- a law which they can more readily keep, or which if they
          break, would not come upon them with such terrible threatenings. Ah,
          not so. The gospel came not into the world to soften down the law.
          Till heaven and earth shall pass away, not one jot or tittle of the
          law shall fail. What God hath said to the sinner in the law, he saith
          to the sinner in the gospel. If he declareth that "the soul that
          sinneth it shall die," the testimony of the gospel is not contrary to
          she testimony of the law. If he declares that whosoever breaketh the
          sacred law shall most assuredly be punished, the gospel also demands
          blood for blood, and eye for eye, and tooth for tooth, and doth not
          relax a solitary jot or tittle of its demands, but is as severe and as
          terribly just as even the law itself. Do you reply to this, that
          Christ has certainly softened down the law? I reply, that ye know not,
          then, the mission of Christ. What said he himself? The Lord hath said
          in the law "Thou shalt not commit adultery;" hath Christ softened the
          law? No. Saith he, "I say unto you, that whosoever looketh upon a
          woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in
          his heart." That is no softening of the law. It is, as it were, the
          grinding of the edge of the terrible sword of Divine justice, to make
          it sharper far than it seemed before. Christ hath not put out the
          furnace; he rather seemeth to heat it seven times hotter. Before
          Christ came sin seemed unto me to be but little; but when he came sin
          became exceeding sinful, and all its dread heinousness started out
          before the light.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, says one, surely the gospel does in some degree remove the
          greatness of our sin. Does it not soften the punishment of sin? Ah!
          no. Ye shall appeal to Moses; let him ascend the pulpit and preach to
          you. He says, "The soul that sinneth, it shall die;" and his sermon is
          dread and terrible. He sits down. And now comes Jesus Christ, the man
          of a loving countenance. What says he with regard to the punishment of
          sin? Ah! sirs, there was never such a preacher of the fires of hell as
          Christ was. Our Lord Jesus Christ was all love, but he was all honesty
          too. "Never man spake like that man," when he came to speak of the
          punishment of the lost. What other prophet was the author of such
          dread expressions as these? -- "He shall burn up the chaff with
          unquenchable fire" -- "These shall go away into everlasting
          punishment;" or these -- "Where their worm dieth not, and their fire
          is not quenched." Stand at the feet of Jesus when he tells you of the
          punishment of sin, and the effect of iniquity, and you may tremble
          there far more than you would have done if Moses had been the
          preacher, and if Sinai had been in the background to conclude the
          sermon. No, brethren, the gospel of Christ in no sense whatever helps
          to make sin less. The proclamation of Christ to-day by his minister is
          the same as the utterence of Ezekiel of old -- "The iniquity of the
          house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now let us endeavour to deal with hearts and consciences a moment.
          My brethren, there are some here who have never felt this truth. There
          are many of you who start back affrighted from it. You will go home
          and represent me as one who delights to dwell on certain dark and
          terrible things that I suppose to be true -- you say within
          yourselves, "I cannot, I will not, receive that doctrine of sin; I
          know I am a frail weak creature; I have made a great many mistakes in
          my life -- that I will admit; but still such is my nature, and I
          therefore could not help it; I am not going to be arraigned before a
          pulpit and condemned as the chief of criminals; I may be a sinner -- I
          confess I am with all the rest of mankind -- but as to my sin being
          anything so great as that man attempts to describe, I do not believe
          it; I reject the doctrine." And thinkest thou, my friend, that I am
          surprised at thy doing so? I know thee who thou art; it is because as
          yet the grace of God has never touched thy soul that therefore thou
          sayest this. And here comes the proof of the doctrine with which I
          started. Thou dost not know this truth, because thou hast never felt
          it; but if thou hadst felt it, as every true-born child of God has
          felt it, thou wouldst say, "The man cannot describe its terrors as
          they are; they must be felt before they can be known, and when felt
          they are not to be expressed in all their fulness of terror."
        </p>
        <p>
          But come, let me reason with you for a moment. Your sin is great,
          although you think it small. Remember, brother, I am not about to make
          out that thy sin is greater than mine. I speak to thee, and I speak to
          myself also, thy sin is great. Follow me in these few thoughts and
          perhaps thou wilt better understand it. How great a thing is one sin,
          when according to the Word of God one sin could suffice to damn the
          soul. One sin, remember, destroyed the whole human race. Adam did but
          take of the forbidden fruit, and that one sin blasted Eden, and made
          all of us inheritors of the curse, and caused the earth to bring forth
          thorns and thistles, even unto this day. But it may be said could one
          sin destroy the soul? Is it possible that one solitary sin could open
          the gates of hell, and then close them upon the guilty soul for ever,
          and that God should refuse his mercy, and shut out that soul for ever
          from the presence of his face? Yes, if I believe my Bible, I must
          believe that. Oh, how great must my sins be if this is the terrible
          effect of one transgression. Sin cannot be the little thing that my
          pride has helped me to imagine it to be. It must be an awful thing if
          but one sin could ruin my soul for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think again my friend, for a moment what an imprudent and impertinent
          thing sin is. Behold! there is one God who filleth all in all, and he
          is the Infinite Creator. He makes me, and I am nothing more in his
          sight than an animated grain of dust; and I that animated grain of
          dust, with a mere ephemeral existence, have the impertinence and
          imprudence to set up my will against his will! I dare to proclaim war
          against the Infinite Majesty of heaven. It is a thing so audacious, so
          infernally full of pride, that one need not marvel that even a sin in
          the little eye of man, should, when it is looked upon by the
          conscience in the light of heaven, appear to be great indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But think again, how great does your sin, and mine seem, if we will
          but think of the ingratitude which has marked it. The Lord our God has
          fed us from our youth up to this day: he has put the breath into our
          nostrils, and has held our souls in life; he has clothed the earth
          with mercies and he has permitted us to walk across these fair fields;
          and he has given us bread to eat and raiment to put on, and mercies so
          precious that their full value can never be known until they are taken
          from us; and yet you and I have persevered in breaking all his laws
          wilfully and wantonly: we have gone contrary to his will; it has been
          sufficient for us to know that a thing has been God's will, and we
          have at once run contrary thereunto. Oh, if we set our secret sins in
          the light of his mercy, if our transgressions are set side by side
          with his favours, we must each of us say, our sins indeed are
          exceeding great!
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark, I am not now addressing myself solely and wholly to those whom
          the word itself condemns of great sin. We of course do not hesitate
          for a moment to speak of the drunkard, the whoremonger, the adulterer,
          and the thief, as being great sinners; we should not spare to say that
          their iniquity is exceeding great, for it exceeds even the bounds of
          man's morality, and the laws of our civil government. But I am
          speaking this day to you who have been the most moral, to you whose
          outward carriage is everything that could be desired, to you who have
          kept the Sabbath, to you who have frequented God's house, and
          outwardly worshipped. Your sins and mine are exceeding great. They
          seem but little to the outward eye -- but if we came to dig into the
          bowels thereof and see their iniquity, their hideous blackness, we
          most say of them they are exceeding great.
        </p>
        <p>
          And again, I repeat it, this is a doctrine that no man can rightly
          know and receive until he has felt it. My hearer, hast thou ever felt
          this doctrine to be true -- "my sin is exceeding great?" Sickness is a
          terrible thing, more especially when it is accompanied with pain, when
          the poor body is racked to an extreme, so that the spirit fails within
          us, and we are dried up like a potsherd; but I bear witness in this
          place this morning, that sickness however agonizing, is nothing like
          the discovery of the evil of sin. I had rather pass through seven
          years of the most wearisome pain, and the most languishing sickness,
          than I would ever again pass through the terrible discovery of the
          terrors of sin. There be some of you who will understand what I mean;
          for brother, you have felt the same. Once on a time, you were playing
          with your lusts, and dallying with your sin, and it pleased God to
          open your eyes to see that sin is exceeding sinful. You remember the
          horror of that state, it seemed as if all hideous things were gathered
          into one dread and awful spectacle. You had before loved your
          iniquities, but now you loathed them -- and you loathed yourselves;
          before, you had thought that your transgressions might easily be got
          rid of, they were matters that might be speedily washed out by
          repentance, or purged away by amendment of your life; but now sin
          seemed an alarming thing, and that you should have committed all this
          iniquity; life seemed to you a curse, and death, if it had not been
          for that dreary something after death, would have been to you the
          highest blessing, if you could have escaped the lashings of your
          conscience, which seemed to be perpetually whipping you with whips of
          burning wire. Some of you, perhaps, passed through but a little of
          this. God was graciously pleased to give you deliverance in a few
          hours; but you must confess that those hours were hours into which it
          seemed as if years of misery had been compressed. It was my sad lot
          for three or four years, to feel the greatness of my sin without a
          discovery of the greatness of God's mercy. I had to walk through this
          world with more than a world upon my shoulders, and sustain a grief
          that so far exceeds all other griefs, as a mountain exceeds a mole
          hill; and I often wonder to this day how it was, that my hand was kept
          from rending my own body into pieces through the terrible agony which
          I felt, when I discovered the greatness of my transgression. Yet, I
          had not been a greater sinner than any one of you here present, openly
          and publicly, but heart sins were laid bare, sins of lip and tongue
          were discovered, and then I knew -- oh, that I may never have to learn
          over again in such a dreadful school this terrible lesson -- "The
          iniquity of Judah and of Israel is exceeding great." This is the first
          part of the discourse.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. "Well," cries one, turning on his heel, "there is very little
          comfort in that. It is enough to drive one to despair, if not to
          madness itself." Ah friend! such is the very design of this text. If I
          may have the pleasure of driving you to despair, if it be a despair of
          your self-righteousness and a despair of saving your own soul, I shall
          be thrice happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We turn therefore from that terrible text to the second one, -- the
          first of John, the first chapter, and the seventh verse; -- "The blood
          of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin." There lies the
          blackness; here stands the Lord Jesus Christ. What will he do with it?
          Will he go and speak to it, and say, "This is no great evil; this
          blackness is but a little spot?" Oh! no; he looks at it, and he says,
          "This is terrible blackness, darkness that may be felt; this is an
          exceeding great evil." Will he cover it up then? Will he weave a
          mantle of excuse and then wrap it round about the iniquity? Ah! no;
          whatever covering there may have been he lifts it off; and he declares
          that when the Spirit of truth is come he will convince the world of
          sin, and lay the sinner's conscience bare and probe the wound to the
          bottom. What then will he do? He will do a far better thing than make
          an excuse or than to pretend in any way to speak lightly of it. He
          will cleanse it all away, remove it entirely by the power and
          meritorious virtue of his own blood, which is able to save unto the
          uttermost. The gospel does not consist in making a man's sin appear
          little. The way Christians get their peace is not by seeing their sins
          shrivelled and shrinking until they seem small to them. But on the
          contrary; they, first of all, see their sins expanding, and then,
          after that, they obtain their peace by seeing those sins entirely
          swept away, -- far as the east is from the west.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, carrying in mind the remarks I made upon the first text, I call
          your attention for a few moments to the greatness and beauty of the
          second one. Note here, "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us
          from ALL sin." Dwell on the word "all" for a moment. Our sins are
          great; every sin is great; but there are some that in our apprehension
          seem to be greater than others. There are crimes that the lip of
          modesty could not mention. I might go far in this pulpit this morning
          in describing the degradation of human nature in the sins which it has
          invented. It is amazing how the ingenuity of man seems to have
          exhausted itself in inventing fresh crimes. Surely there is not the
          possibility of the invention of a new sin. But if there be, ere long
          man will invent it, for man seemeth exceedingly cunning, and full of
          wisdom in the discovery of means of destroying himself and the
          endeavour to injure his Maker. But there are some sins that show a
          diabolical extent of degraded ingenuity -- some sins of which it were
          a shame to speak, of which it were disgraceful to think. But note
          here: "The blood of Jesus Christ eleanseth from all sin." There may be
          some sins of which a man cannot speak, but there is no sin which the
          blood of Christ cannot wash away. Blasphemy, however profane, lust,
          however bestial; covetousness, however far it may have gone into theft
          and rapine; breach of the commandments of God, however much of riot it
          may have run, all this may be pardoned and washed away through the
          blood of Jesus Christ. In all the long list of human sins, though that
          be long as time, there standeth but one sin that is unpardonable, and
          that one no sinner has committed if he feels within himself a longing
          for mercy, for that sin once committed, the soul becomes hardened,
          dead, and seared, and never desireth afterwards to find peace with
          God. I therefore declare to thee, O trembling sinner, that however
          great thine iniquity may be, whatever sin thou mayest have committed
          in all the list of guilt, however far thou mayest have exceeded all
          thy fellow-creatures, though thou mayest have distanced the Pauls and
          Magdalens and every one of the most heinous culprits in the black race
          of sin, yet the blood of Christ is able now to wash thy sin away.
          Mark! I speak not lightly of thy sin, it is exceeding great; but I
          speak still more loftily of the blood of Christ. Great as are thy
          sins, the blood of Christ is greater still. Thy sins are like great
          mountains, but the blood of Christ is like Noah's flood; twenty cubits
          upwards shall this blood prevail, and the top of the mountains of thy
          sin shall be covered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just take the word "all" in another sense, not only as taking in all
          sorts of sin, but as comprehending the great aggregate mass of sin.
          Come here sinner, thou with the grey head. What are we to understand
          in thy case by this word all? Bring hither the tremendous load of the
          sins of thy youth. Those sins are still in thy bones, and thy
          tottering knees sometimes testify against the iniquities of thy early
          youth; but all these sins Christ can remove. Now bring hither the sins
          of thy riper manhood, thy transgressions in the family, thy failures
          in business, all the mistakes and all the errors thou hast committed
          in the thoughts of thy heart. Bring them all here; and then add the
          iniquities of thy frail and trembling age. What a mass is there here!
          what a mass of sin! Stir up that putrid mass, but put thy finger to
          thy nostrils first, for thou canst not bear the stench thereof if thou
          art a man with a living and quickened conscience. Couldst thou bear to
          read thine own diary if thou hadst written there all thy acts? No; for
          though thou be the purest of mankind, thy thoughts if they could have
          been recorded, would now if thou couldst read them, make thee startle
          and wonder that thou art demon enough to have had such imaginations
          within thy soul. But put them all there, and all these sins the blood
          of Christ can wash away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nay, more than that. Come hither ye thousands who are gathered
          together this morning to listen to the Word of God; what is the
          aggregate of your guilt? Hither ye have come, men of every grade and
          class, and women of every age and order; what is the mass of all your
          united guilt? Could ye put it so that mortal observation could
          comprehend the whole within its ken, it were as a mountain with a
          base, broad as eternity, and a summit lofty almost as the throne of
          the great archangel. But, remember, the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
          cleanseth from all sin. Let but the blood be applied to our
          consciences and all our guilt is removed, and cast away for ever --
          all -- none left, not one solitary stain remaining -- all gone, like
          Israel's enemies -- all drowned in the Red Sea, so that there was not
          one of them left, all swept away, not so much as the remembrance of
          them remaining. "The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin."
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, once more, in the praise of this blood we must notice one further
          feature. There be some of you here who are saying, "Ah! that shall be
          my hope when I come to die, that in the last hour of my extremity the
          blood of Christ will take my sins away; it is now my comfort to think
          that the blood of Christ shall wash, and purge, and purify the
          transgressions of life." But, mark! my text saith not so; it does not
          say the blood of Christ shall cleanse -- that were a truth -- but it
          says something greater than that -- it says, "The blood of Jesus
          Christ his Son cleanseth" -- cleanseth now. And is it possible that
          now a man may be forgiven? Can a harlot now have all her sins blotted
          out of the book of God? And can she know it? Can the thief this day
          have all his transgressions cast into the sea; and can he know it? Can
          I, the chief of sinners, this day be cleansed from all my sins, and
          know it? Can I know that I stand accepted before the throne of God, a
          holy creature because washed from every sin? Yes, tell it the wide
          world over, that the blood of Christ can not only wash you in the last
          dying article, but can wash you now. And let it be known, moreover,
          that to this there are a thousand witnesses, who, rising in this very
          place from their seats, could sing --
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, how sweet to view the flowing</p>
        <p>Of my Saviour's precious blood,</p>
        <p>With divine assurance knowing,</p>
        <p>He has made my peace with God"</p>
        <p>
          What would you not give to have all your sins blotted out now? Would
          you not give yourself away to become the servant of God for ever, if
          now your sins should be washed away? Ah, then, say not in your hearts,
          "What shall I do to obtain this mercy?" Imagine not there is any
          difficulty in your way. Suppose not there is some hard thing to be
          done before you can come to Christ to be washed, O beloved! to the man
          that knows himself to be guilty, there is not one barrier between
          himself and Christ. Come, soul, this moment come to him that hung upon
          the cross of Calvary! come now and be washed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what meanest thou by coming? I mean this: come thou and put thy
          trust in Christ, and thou shalt be saved. What is meant by believing
          in Christ? Some say, that "to believe in Christ is to believe that
          Christ died for me." That is not a satisfactory definition of faith.
          An Arminian believes that Christ died for everybody. He must,
          therefore, necessarily believe that Christ died for him. His believing
          that will not save him, for he will still remain an unconverted man
          and yet believe that. To believe in Christ is to trust him. The way I
          believe in Christ, and I know not how to speak of it, except as I feel
          it myself, is simply this: I know it is written that "Jesus Christ
          came into the world to save sinners." I do firmly believe that those
          he came to save he will save. The only question I ask myself is, "Can
          I put myself among that number whom he has declared he came to save?"
          Am I a sinner? Not one that utters the word in a complimentary sense,
          but do I feel the deep compunction in my inmost soul? do I stand and
          feel convicted, guilty, and condemned? I do; I know I do. Whatever I
          may not be, one thing I know I am -- a sinner, guilty, consciously
          guilty, and often miserable on account of that guilt. Well, then, the
          Scripture says, "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all
          acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners."
        </p>
        <p>"And when thine eye of faith is dim,</p>
        <p>Still trust in Jesus, sink or swim;</p>
        <p>Thus, at his footstool, bow the knee,</p>
        <p>And Israel's God thy peace shall be,"</p>
        <p>
          Let me put my entire trust in the bloody sacrifice which he offered
          upon my behalf. No dependence will I have in my playings, my doings,
          my feelings, my weepings, my preachings, my thinkings, my Bible
          readings, nor all that. I would desire to have good works, and yet in
          my good works I will not put a shadow of trust.
        </p>
        <p>"Nothing in my hands I bring,</p>
        <p>Simply to thy cross I cling."</p>
        <p>
          And if there be any power in Christ to save I am saved; if there be an
          everlasting arm extended by Christ, and if that Saviour who hung there
          was "God over all, blessed for ever," and if his blood is still
          exhibited before the throne of God as the sacrifice for sin, then
          perish I cannot, till the throne of God shall break, and till the
          pillars of God's justice shall crumble.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, sinner what then hast thou to do this morning? If thou feelest
          thy guilt to be great, cast thyself entirely upon this sacrifice by
          blood. "But no," says one, "I have not felt enough." Thy feelings are
          not Christ. "No, but I have not prayed enough." Thy prayers are not
          Christ, and thy prayers cannot save thee. "No, but I have not repented
          enough." Thy repentance may destroy thee, if thou puttest that in the
          place of Christ. All that thou hast, I repeat this morning, is this --
          dost thou feel thyself to be a lost, ruined, guilty sinner? Then
          simply cast thyself on the fact that Christ is able to save sinners
          and rest there. What! do you say you cannot do it? Oh may God enable
          you, may he give you faith, sink or swim, to cast yourself on that.
          "Well! but," you say, "I may not; being such a sinner?" You may; and
          God never yet rejected a sinner that sought salvation by Jesus. Such a
          thing never happened, though the sinner sometimes thought it had.
          Come, the crumb is under the table; though thou be but a dog come and
          pick it up; it is a privilege even for the dog to take it; and mercy
          that is great to thee, is but a crumb to him that gives it freely --
          come and take it. Christ will not reject thee. And if thou be the
          chief of sinners that ever lived, only simply trust thyself upon him,
          and perish thou canst not, if God be God, and if this Bible be the
          book of his truth. The Lord now help each one of us to come afresh to
          Christ, and to his name be glory.<br />
