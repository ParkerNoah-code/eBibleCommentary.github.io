          1. Praise ye Jehovah; because he is good: because his mercy endureth
          for ever.2. Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.3.
          Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.4.
          Let those who fear Jehovah now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.

          1 Praise ye Jehovah In this passage we see that David does not merely
          in a private capacity render thanks to God, but that he loudly summons
          the people to engage in the common exercises of piety. This he does,
          not simply from his having been divinely appointed to be the captain
          and teacher of others; but, God having invested him with royal power,
          had manifested his sympathy with his distressed Church. Hence he
          exhorts the Israelites to magnify the grace of God, under whose kind
          protection he appears to re-establish them in safety. In the beginning
          of the psalm he alludes generally to the goodness and mercy of God,
          but he shortly instances himself as an evidence of his goodness, as
          will be seen in its proper place. It becomes us at present to recall
          to mind what I mentioned in the preceding psalm, that a reason for
          praising God is given to us on account of his mercy, in preference to
          his power or justice; because, though his glory shine forth in them
          also, yet will we never promptly and heartily sound forth his praises,
          until he win us by the sweetness of his goodness. Accordingly, in
          Psalm 51:17, we found that the lips of the faithful were opened to
          praise God, when they perceived that he was truly their deliverer. In
          restricting his address to Israel, and to the children of Aaron, he is
          guided by a regard to his own times, because, up to that period, the
          adoption did not extend beyond that one nation. He again resumes the
          order which he observed in Psalm 116:1; for, after exhorting the
          children of Abraham, who had been separated from the Gentiles by the
          election of God, and also the sons of Aaron, who, by virtue of the
          priesthood, ought to take the precedence in conducting the psalmody,
          he directs his discourse to the other worshippers of God; because
          there were many hypocrites among the Israelites, who, occupying a
          place in the Church, were yet strangers to it. This is not
          inconsistent with David's here speaking by the spirit of prophecy,
          respecting the future kingdom of Christ. That kingdom, no doubt,
          extended to the Gentiles, but its commencement and first-fruits were
          among God's chosen people.<br />
