        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.3492)</p>
        <p>Published on Thursday, December 30th, 1915.</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>On Lord's-day Evening, 27th November , 1870.</p>
        <p>
          "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who
          refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we
          turn away from him that speaketh from heaven." -- Hebrews 12:25.
        </p>
        <p>
          WE ARE NOT a cowering multitude gathered in trembling fear around the
          smoking mount of Horeb; we have come where the great central figure is
          the mercy of God in Christ Jesus. We have gathered virtually in the
          outer circle of which the saints above and holy angels make the inner
          ring. And now tonight Jesus speaks to us in the gospel. So far as his
          gospel shall be preached by us here, it shall not be the word of man,
          but the word of God; and although it comes to you through a feeble
          tongue, yet the truth itself is not feeble, nor is it any less divine
          than if Christ himself should speak it with his own lips. "See that ye
          refuse not him that speaketh." The text contains: --
        </p>
        <p>I. AN EXHORTATION OF A VERY SOLEMN, EARNEST KIND.</p>
        <p>
          It does not say, "Refuse not him that speaketh," but "See that ye
          refuse not him that speaketh" -- that is, "be very circumspect that by
          no means, accidental or otherwise, you do refuse the Christ of God,
          who now in the gospel speaks to you. Be watchful, be earnest, lest
          even through inadvertence ye should refuse the prophet of the gospel
          dispensation -- Jesus Christ, the Son of God, 0who speaks in the
          gospel from heaven to the sons of men." It means, "Give earnest heed
          and careful attention, that by no means, and in no way you refuse him
          that speaketh." My object tonight will be to help you, beloved
          friends, especially you that have not laid hold on Christ, who are not
          the children of Zion, who are joyful in their king -- to help you
          tonight, that you may see to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And to go to our point at once, we shall have many things to say, and
          we shall speak them in brief sentences, hoping that the thoughts as
          they arise may be accepted by your mind, and may, by God's Spirit,
          work upon your hearts and conscience. There is great need of this
          exhortation from many considerations not mentioned in the text. A few
          of these we will hint at first.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, from the excellency of the Word of God itself. "See that ye
          refuse not him that speaketh." That which Jesus speaks concerns your
          soul, concerns your everlasting destiny; it is God's wisdom; God's way
          of mercy; God's plan by which you may be saved. If this were a
          secondary matter, ye need not be so earnest about receiving it, but of
          all things under heaven, nothing so concerns you as the gospel. See,
          then, that ye refuse not this precious Word, more precious than gold
          or rubies -- which alone can save your souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          See to this, again, because there is an enemy of yours who will do all
          he can that you may refuse him that speaketh. Satan is always busiest
          where the gospel is most earnestly preached. Let the sower scatter
          handfuls of seeds, and birds will find out the seeds and soon devour
          them. Let the gospel be preached, and these birds of the air, fiends
          of hell, will soon by some means try to remove these truths from your
          hearts, lest they should take root in your hearts and bring forth
          fruit unto repentance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Give earnest heed, again, "that ye refuse not him that speaketh,"
          because the tendency of your own mind will be to refuse Christ. Oh!
          sirs, ye are fallen through your first father, Adam, and the
          tendencies now of your souls are towards evil, and not towards the
          right, and when the Lord comes from heaven to you, you will reject him
          if left to yourselves. Watch, then, I say; see that ye refuse not,
          stir up your souls, awaken your minds, lest this delirious tendency of
          sin should make you angry with your best friend, and constrain you to
          thrust from you that which is your only hope for the hereafter. When a
          man knows that he has a bad tendency which may injure him , if he be
          wise he watches against it. So, knowing this, which God's Word tells
          you, watch, I pray you, lest ye refuse him that speaketh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bethink you well, too, that you have need to see to this, because some
          of you have rejected Christ long enough already. He has spoken to you
          from this pulpit, from other pulpits, from the Bible, from the
          sick-bed. He spoke to you lately in the funeral knell of your buried
          friend -- many voices, but all with this one note, "Come to me,
          repent, be saved"; but until now ye have refused "him that speaketh."
          Will not the time past suffice to have played this mischievous game?
          Will not the years that have rolled into eternity bear enough witness
          against you? Must ye add to all this weight by again refusing? Oh! I
          implore you to see to it that ye do not again "refuse him that
          speaketh from heaven," for there is not a word of that which he
          speaks, but what is love to your souls. Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
          came not armed with terrors to work wrath among the sons of men; all
          was mercy, all was grace, and to those who listen to him he has
          nothing to speak but tenderness and loving-kindness; your sins shall
          be forgiven you; the time of your ignorances God will wink at; your
          transgressions shall be cast into the depths of the sea; for you there
          shall be happiness on earth, and glory hereafter. Who would not listen
          when it is good news to be heard? Who would not listen when the best
          tidings that God himself ever sent forth from the excellent glory is
          proclaimed by the noblest Ambassador that ever spake to men, namely,
          God's own Son, Jesus, the once crucified, but now exalted Saviour? For
          these reasons, then, at the very outset I press upon you this
          exhortation, "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh such precious
          truth", which the enemy would fain take out of your minds: truth which
          you yourselves have refused long enough already, and truth which is
          sweet, and will be exceedingly precious to your souls if you receive
          it. But now the text gives us:
        </p>
        <p>
          II. SOME FURTHER REASONS for seeing to it that we do not "refuse him
          that speaketh." One reason I see in the text is this: see to this
          because there are many ways of refusing him that speaketh, and you may
          have fallen into one or other of these. See to it; pass over in
          examination your own state and conduct, lest you may have been
          refusing Christ. Some refuse the Saviour by not hearing of him. In his
          day there were some that would not listen, and there are such now. The
          Sabbath days of some of you are not days of listening to the gospel.
          Where were you this morning? Where are you usually all the Lord's Day
          long? Remember, you cannot live in London, where the gospel is
          preached, and be without responsibility. Though you will not come to
          the house of God to hear of it, yet be sure of this, the kingdom of
          God hath come nigh unto you. You may close your ears to the invitation
          of the gospel, but at last you will not be able to close your ear to
          the denunciation of wrath. If you will not come and hear of Christ on
          the cross, you must one day see for yourselves Christ on his throne.
          "See that ye refuse not him that speaks to you from heaven" by
          refusing to be found where his gospel is proclaimed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many come to hear it, and yet refuse him that speaketh, for they hear
          listlessly. In many congregations -- I will not judge this -- a very
          large proportion of hearers are listless hearers. It little matters to
          them what is the subject in hand: they hear the sentences and phrases
          that come from the speaker's tongue, but these penetrate the ear only,
          and never reach their heart. Oh! how sad it is that this should be the
          case with almost all who have heard the gospel long, and who are not
          converted! They get used to it; no form of alarm could reach them, and
          perhaps no form of invitation could move them to penitence. The
          preacher may exhaust his art. They are like the adder that is deaf. He
          may know how to charm others, but these he cannot charm, charm he
          never so wisely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! see ye gospel hearers up yonder, and ye below here, that have been
          hearing Christ these many years, see that ye refuse not him that day
          by day during so long a time has spoken to you in the preaching of the
          gospel out of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there are some who do hear, and have a very intelligent idea of
          what they hear, but who actually refuse to believe it. For divers
          reasons best known to themselves they reject the testimony of the
          incarnate God. They hear that God the Word was made flesh and dwelt
          among us, and he hath borne testimony that whosoever believeth in him
          is not condemned. They know but they will not believe in him. They
          will give you first one excuse, and then another, but all the excuses
          put together will never mitigate the fact that they do not believe the
          testimony of God concerning his Son, Jesus Christ, and so they "refuse
          him that speaketh." How many, how many here are by their unbelief
          refusing the Christ that speaks out of heaven?
        </p>
        <p>
          Some are even offended at the gospel, as in Christ's day. When he came
          to a tender point in his preaching they went back and walked no more
          with him. Such there are to be found in our assemblies. The gospel
          galls them; there is some point that touches their prejudices,
          something that touches their favourite sin, and they are vexed and
          irritable. They ought to be angry -- angry with their sin -- but they
          are angry with Christ instead. They ought to denounce themselves, and
          patiently seek mercy, but this is not palatable to them; they would
          rather denounce the preacher, or denounce the preacher's Master.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some will even hear the gospel, the very gospel of Christ to catch at
          words and pervert sentences to make play of the preacher's words which
          he uses, when they are honestly the best he can find, and, worse
          still, make play with the sense, too, with the very gospel -- and find
          themes for loose jokes and profane and ribald words, even in the
          cross. Dicing, like the soldier at the cross-foot, with the blood
          falling on them, so some make merriment when the blood of Jesus is
          falling upon them to their condemnation. May it not be so with any
          here present, but there have been such who have even reviled the
          Saviour, and had hard words for God in human flesh -- could not
          believe that he bore the guilt of sin, could not admire the love
          astounding that made him suffer for the guilt of his enemies -- could
          not see anything admirable in the heroic sacrifice of the great
          Redeemer, but rather turned their heel against their benefactor, and
          poured forth venomous words on him that loved the sons of men and died
          saying, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."
        </p>
        <p>
          And some have practically shown they have refused him that speaketh,
          for they have begun to persecute his people; they have maltreated
          those that sought the glory of God, and anything that had a savour of
          Christ about it has been despicable and detestable to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! dear hearers, I shall ask you, since there are all these ways of
          refusing Christ, to see to it that ye do not fall into any of them.
          The grosser forms, perhaps, you would be too shocked at, but don't
          fall into the others. Do not especially fall into that indifference
          which has as much of insult to the Saviour almost as blasphemy. Is it
          nothing to you, is it nothing to you that God should come from heaven
          that he might be just in the salvation of men, and that, coming from
          heaven to be thus just, he should himself suffer that we might not
          suffer -- the Christ of God bleed and die instead of the undeserving,
          hell-deserving sinners? Shall this be told you -- pressed upon you --
          and will you refuse it? Will you refuse him who speaks himself, in his
          own sacrifice, and in the blood which he hath carried within the veil
          continues now to speak -- will you, will you refuse him? Pray God you
          may see to it that in no form you do.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now passing on, but keeping to the same point, striking the hammer
          on the head of the same nail, there are many reasons why men refuse
          Christ; therefore, see that for none of these reasons ye do it. Some
          refuse him out of perfect indifference; the great mass of men have not
          a thought above their meat and their drink. Like the cock that found
          the diamond on the dunghill, they turn it over and wish it were a
          grain of barley. What care they for heaven, or the pardon of sin?
          Their mind does not reach to that. See that ye -- that ye, none of
          you, are so sensuous as to "refuse him that speaketh from heaven" for
          such a reason as this. Some reject him because of their
          self-righteousness: they are good enough. Jesus Christ speaks against
          them, they say; he does not applaud their righteousness, he ridicules
          them rather; he tells them that their prayers are long prayers, and
          their many good works are, after all, a poor ground for reliance." So
          as the Saviour will not patronize their righteousness, neither will
          they have to do with him. Oh! say not ye are rich and increased in
          goods; ye are naked, and poor, and miserable. Say not ye can win
          heaven by your merits; ye have none; your merits drag you down to
          hell. Yet many will refuse the Saviour because of the insanity of
          their self-righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some, too, reject him because of their self-reliant wisdom. "Why,"
          they say, "this is a very thoughtful age." And everywhere I hear it
          dinned into my ears, "thoughtful preaching," "thinkings,"
          "intellectual preaching." And what a mass of rottenness before high
          heaven the whole lot is that is produced by these thinking preachers
          and these intellectual men! For my part I would rather say to them,
          "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh," for one word of God is
          better than all the thoughts of all the philosophers, and one sentence
          from the lip of Christ I do esteem to be more precious than the whole
          Alexandrian library, and the Bodleian also if you will, so much as it
          comes from man. Nay, it is the thinking of Christ we have to think
          about; otherwise our thinking may prove our curse. A man, if he is
          drowning, if he have a rope thrown to him, had better lay hold of it
          than merely be there thinking about the possibilities of salvation by
          some other means. While your souls are being lost, sirs, there is
          better employment for you than merely indulging in rhapsodies and
          inventions of your own supposed judgment. Take hold of this, the
          gospel of Jesus revealed of God, lest ye perish, and perish with a
          vengeance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some reject the Saviour from another cause: they do not like the
          holiness of Christ's teaching. They refuse him that speaketh because
          they think Christ's religion too strict, too precise, cuts off their
          pleasures, condemns their lusts. Yes, yes, it is so, but to reject
          Christ for such a reason is certainly to be most unreasonable, for it
          should be in every man a desire to be delivered from these passions
          and lusts, and because Christ can deliver us, shall we, therefore,
          reject him? God forbid that we should be led astray by such a reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some reject him because they have a fear of the world. If they were
          Christians, they would probably be laughed at as Methodistic,
          Presbyterian, Puritanic, or some other name. And shall we lose our
          souls to escape the sneers of fools? He is not a man -- call him by
          some other name -- he is no man that flings away his soul because he
          is such a coward that he cannot bear to do and believe the right, and
          bear the frown of fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are others who refuse the Saviour simply out of procrastination.
          They have no reason for it, but they hope they shall have a more
          convenient season. They are young people as yet, or they are not so
          very old, or if they are old, yet still life will linger a little
          while, and so still they refuse him that speaketh.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have not mentioned a worthy reason for refusing him that speaketh,
          nor do I believe there is a worthy reason. It seems to me that if it
          be so, that God himself has taken upon himself human form, and has
          come here to effect our redemption from our sin and misery, there
          cannot be any reason that will stand a moment's looking at for
          refusing him that speaketh. It must be my duty and my privilege to
          hear what it is that God has got to say to me: it must be my duty to
          lend him all my heart to try and understand what it is that he says,
          and then to give him all my will to do, or to be whatever he would
          have me to do or to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But did God thus come?" says one. I always feel that the very
          declaration is its own proof. No heart could ever have contrived or
          invented this as a piece of imagination, the love, the story of the
          redeeming love of God in Christ Jesus. If I had no evidence but the
          mere statement, I think I must accept it, for it wears truth upon its
          very forefront. Who should conceive it? The offended God comes here to
          redeem his creatures from their own offence. Since he must in justice
          punish, he comes to bear the punishment himself, that he may be just
          and yet be inconceivably gracious! My soul flies into the arms of this
          revelation; it seems to be the best news my troubled conscience ever
          had -- God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not
          imputing their trespasses unto them. Oh! there cannot be a reasonable
          motive for rejecting the Saviour, and I, therefore, impress it upon
          you, since so many unreasonable motives carry men away, see that ye
          refuse not him that speaketh, and may the Spirit of God grant that you
          may not be able to refuse. But now coming to the text again, we have:
          --
        </p>
        <p>
          III. A VERY HIGH MOTIVE GIVEN for seeing that we refuse not him that
          speaketh. It is this -- because in refusing him, we shall be despising
          the highest possible authority. When Moses spake in God's name, it was
          no light thing to refuse such an ambassador. Still, Moses was but a
          man. Though clothed with divine authority, yet he was but a man and a
          servant of God. But Jesus Christ is God by nature. See that ye refuse
          not him who is of heavenly origin, who came from heaven, who is
          clothed with such divine powers, that every word he speaks is
          virtually spoken from heaven, and who, being now in heaven, speaks
          through his ever living gospel directly out of the excellent glory.
          Regard ye this, I pray you, and remember well the parable which Jesus
          gave. A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen,
          and when the time came that he should receive the fruit he sent a
          servant, and they stoned him. He sent another, and they beat him. He
          sent another, and they maltreated him. After he had thus sent many of
          his servants, and the dressers of the vineyard had incurred his high
          displeasure by the shameful way in which they had treated the
          servants, he sent his own son, and he said, "They will reverence my
          son." It was the highest degree of guilt when they said, "This is the
          heir; let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours." Then they
          took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard. You know
          how the Saviour was treated by the sons of men; but here is the point
          I aim at; it is this: to reject Jesus Christ, to refuse him, to refuse
          merely his gospel, if he did not speak in it, might not be so high a
          misdemeanour, but to refuse him! -- I don't know how it is, but my
          heart feels very heavy, even to sinking, at the thought that any man
          here should be able to refuse Christ, the Son of God, the Everlasting
          and the ever Blessed. But I cannot speak out what I feel. It fills my
          soul with horror to think that any creature should refuse his God,
          when his God speaks, but much more when God comes down on earth in
          infinite, wondrous, immeasurable love, takes upon himself the form of
          man, and suffers, and then turns round to his rebellious creature and
          says, "Listen, I am ready to forgive you; I am willing to pardon you;
          do but listen to me." Oh! it seems monstrous that men should refuse
          Christ! I don't know how you feel about it, but if you have ever
          measured that in your thoughts, it will have seemed to be the most
          monstrous of all crimes. If, in order to be saved, the terms were hard
          and the conditions difficult, I could understand a man saying, "It
          mocks me," but when the gospel is nothing but this, "Turn ye, turn ye;
          why will ye die?"; when it is nothing but, "Believe in the Lord Jesus
          Christ, and thou shalt be saved," what shall I say? I cannot fashion
          an excuse for any of you, and if you, after having heard the gospel,
          be cast into hell, I dare not think that its utmost pains will be too
          severe for so high an insult to such wondrous love. Ye will not be
          saved, sirs; ye put from you your own life; ye will not be saved when
          the way of salvation is plain, easy, simple, close to your hand.
        </p>
        <p>"What chains of vengeance they deserve,</p>
        <p>That slight the bonds of love."</p>
        <p>
          I cannot -- I could not -- conceive a punishment too severe for men
          who, knowing that their rejection of Christ will bring upon them
          everlasting punishment, yet wilfully reject him. Ye choose your own
          delusion. If ye drank poison and did not know it, I could pity you; if
          you made all your veins to swell with agony, and caused your death --
          but when we stand up and say, "Sirs, it is poison; see others drop and
          die; touch it not!" -- when we give you something a thousand times
          better, and bid you take that, but you will not take that, but will
          have the poison -- then if you will, you must. If, then, you would
          destroy your soul, it must be so; but we would plead with you yet
          again, "See, see that ye refuse not him that speaketh." I wish I could
          raise him before you tonight -- even the Christ of God, and bid him
          stand here, and you should see his hands and his feet, and you should
          ask, "What are these marks we see there?" He would reply, "These are
          the wounds that I received when I suffered for the sons of men," and
          he bares his side and says, "See here, here went the spear when I died
          that sinners might live." In glory now, yet once, saith he, this face
          was defiled with spittle, and this body mangled with Pilate's scourge
          and Herod's rod, and I, whom angels worshipped, was treated as a
          menial, ay, worse, God himself forsook me, Jehovah hid his face from
          me, that I, bearing the punishment of sin, might really bear it, not
          in fiction, but in fact, and might suffer the equivalent for all the
          miseries that souls redeemed by me ought to have suffered had they
          been cast into hell. Will ye look at his wounds, and yet refuse him?
          Will you hear the story of his love, and yet reject him? Must he go
          away and say in his heart, "They have refused me; they have refused
          me; I told them of salvation; I showed them how I bought salvation;
          they have refused me; I will go my way, and they shall never see my
          face again till that day when they shall say, 'Mountains fall upon us;
          hide us from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne'"? If you
          will not have him in mercy, you must have him in judgment, and if the
          silver sceptre of God will not touch you, the Christ of God, the man
          of Nazareth, will come a second time on the clouds of heaven, and woe
          unto you in that tremendous day. Then shall the nations of the earth
          weep and wail because of him. They would not have him as their
          Saviour; they must have him as their Judge, and out of his mouth shall
          the sentence come, "Depart! Depart!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I have to close with the last reason that is given in the text why
          we should see that we "refuse not him that speaketh." It is this: that
          if we do: --
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. THERE IS A DOOM TO BE FEARED, for if they escaped not who refused
          him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape if we turn away
          from him that speaketh from heaven. You hear the din that goes up from
          the Red Sea when the angry billows leap over Pharaoh and his horsemen.
          Why is the king asleep in the midst of the waters? Why are the
          chivalry of Egypt cut off? They rejected Moses when he said, "Thus
          saith the Lord, Let my people go." If Pharaoh escaped not when he
          refused him that spake on earth, oh! dreadful shall be that day when
          the Christ who this day speaks to you, and whom you reject, shall lift
          up the rods of his anger, and the lake of fire, more direful than the
          Red Sea, shall swallow up his adversaries. See you that next sight? A
          number of men are standing there holding censers of incense in their
          hands, and there stands Moses, the servant of God, and he says, "If
          these die the death of common men, God hath not spoken by me," for
          they have rebelled against Moses. Do you see the sight? Can you
          picture it? If they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth,
          how shall we escape if we refuse him that speaketh from heaven? Go
          through the peninsular of the Arabian desert. See how the tribes drop,
          one by one, and leave graves behind them as the track of their march.
          Of all that came out of Egypt, not one entered into Canaan. Who slew
          all these? They were all slain there because they resisted the Word of
          God by his servant Moses, and he swore in his wrath that they should
          not enter into his rest. If they escaped not who refused him that
          spake on earth, how shall we escape if we refuse him that speaketh to
          us from heaven?
        </p>
        <p>
          I might multiply instances and give you proof of how God avenged the
          refusal to listen to his servant Moses, but how much more will he
          avenge it if we listen not to Jesus Christ the Lord! "Oh!" says one,
          "you preach the terrors of the Lord." The terrors of the Lord! -- I
          scarce think of them; they are too dreadful for human language; but if
          I speak severely, even for a moment, it is in love. I dare not play
          with you, sinner; I dare not tell you sin is a trifle; I dare not tell
          you that the world to come is a matter of no great account; I dare not
          come and tell you that you need not be in earnest. I shall have to
          answer for it to my Master. I have these words ringing in my ears, "If
          the watchman warns them not, they shall perish, but their blood will I
          require at the watchman's hands." I cannot bear that I should have the
          blood of souls upon my skirts, and, therefore, do I again say to you
          -- refuse what I say as much as you will; cast anything that is mine
          to the dogs; have nothing to do with it; but wherein I have spoken to
          you Christ's Word, and I have told you his gospel, "Believe and live,"
          "He that believeth on him is not condemned," "He that believeth, and
          is baptized, shall be saved." Wherein it is Christ's gospel, it is
          Christ that speaks, and I again say to you, for your soul's sake,
          "Refuse not him that speaks from heaven to you." May his Spirit
          sweetly incline you to listen to Christ's Word, and may you be saved
          tonight.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't have Christ tonight, some of you never will have him. If
          you are not saved tonight, some of you never will be. 'Tis now or
          never with you. God's Spirit strives with you, conscience is a little
          awakened. Catch every breeze, catch every breeze; do not let this pass
          by. Oh! that tonight you might seek, and that tonight you might find
          he Saviour. Else remember if you refuse him that speaks from heaven,
          he lifts his hands and swears that you shall not enter into his rest.
          Then are you lost, lost, lost, beyond all recall! God bless every one
          of you, and may we meet in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not know, I sometimes am afraid that there are not so many
          conversions as there used to be. If I thought there were no more souls
          to be saved by me in this place, under God, I would break away from
          every comfort, and go and find out a place where I could find some
          that God would bless. Are they all saved that will be? You
          seatholders, have I fished in this pond till there is no more to come?
          Is it to be so, that in all the ground where wheat ever will grow,
          wheat has grown, and there can be no more? My brethren and sisters in
          Christ, pray God to send his Spirit that there may be more brought to
          Jesus. If not, it is hard, hard work to preach in vain. Perhaps I grow
          stale and dull to you; I would not if I could help it. If I could
          learn how to preach, I would go to school. If I could find the best
          way to reach you I am sure I would spare no pains. I do not know what
          more to say, but if Christ himself shall be refused, how shall I speak
          for him? If his dear wounds, if his precious blood, if his dying
          groans, if his love to the souls of men all go for nothing, then my
          words cannot be anything; they may well go to the wind. But do, do
          turn ye to him. Cast not away your souls. Come to him; he will receive
          you; he waiteth to be gracious. Whosoever is heavy laden, let him come
          tonight. One tear, one sigh, one cry -- send it up to him; he will
          hear you. Come and trust him; he will save you. God bless you for
          Christ's love's sake. Amen.
