        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.3228)</p>
        <p>Published on Thursday, December 15th, 1910,</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington,</p>
        <p>On Lord's-day Evening, July 7th, 1872.</p>
        <p>"Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!" -- John 11:36.</p>
        <p>
          IT WAS AT THE GRAVE OF LAZARUS that Jesus wept, and his grief was so
          manifest to the onlookers that they said, "Behold how he loved him!"
          Most of us here, I trust, are not mere onlookers, but we have a share
          in the special love of Jesus. We see evidences of that love, not in
          his tears, but in the precious blood that he so freely shed for us; so
          we ought to marvel even more than those Jews did at the love of Jesus,
          and to see further into his heart than they did, and to know more of
          him than they could in the brief interval in which they had become
          acquainted with him. When we think of his love to us, we may well cry,
          "Behold how he has loved us!"
        </p>
        <p>
          These Jews expressed their wonder at the love that Jesus had for his
          friend Lazarus; they did not keep that wonder to themselves, but they
          said, "Behold how he loved him!" In these days, we are too apt to
          repress our emotions. I cannot say that I greatly admire the way in
          which some enthusiastic folk shout "Glory!" "Hallelujah!" "Amen," and
          so on, in the midst of sermons and prayers; yet I would sooner have a
          measure of that enthusiastic noise than have you constantly stifling
          your natural emotions, and checking yourself from giving utterances to
          your heart's true feelings. If we were in a right state of mind and
          heart, we should often say to one another, "How wondrous has the love
          of Jesus been to us!" Our conversation with one another, as brethren
          and sisters in Christ, would often be upon this blessed subject. We
          waste far too much of our time upon trifles, it would be well if the
          love of Jesus so engrossed our thoughts that it engrossed our
          conversation too. I fear that many, who profess to be Christians, go
          for a whole year, or even longer, without telling out to others what
          they are supposed to have experienced of the love of Jesus; yet this
          ought not to be the case. If we were as we should be, one would
          frequently say to another, "How great is Christ's love to me, my
          brother! Dost thou also say that it is great to thee?" Such talk as
          that between the saints on earth would help us to anticipate the time
          when we shall want no other theme for conversation in the land beyond
          the river.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am going just to remind you of some very simple truths in order to
          excite the hearts of those of you who are coming to the communion to
          increased love to the dear Lord and Saviour who has loved you so
          intensely as to die for you. And first, beloved, let us think of what
          the love of Christ has done for us; secondly, of what his love has
          done to us; and then thirdly, I want to say that I am afraid our love
          to Christ will never cause any wonder except on account of the
          littleness of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. So, first, let us quietly think over WHAT THE LOVE OF CHRIST HAS
          DONE FOR US.
        </p>
        <p>
          When did Christ's love begin to work for us? It was long before we
          were born, long before the world was created; far, far back, in
          eternity, our Saviour gave the first proof of his love to us by
          espousing our cause. By his divine foresight, he looked upon human
          nature as a palace that had been plundered, and broken down, and in
          its ruins he perceived the owl, the bittern, the dragon, and all
          manner of unclean things. Who was there to undertake the great work of
          restoring that ruined palace? No one but the Word, who was with God,
          and who was God. "He saw that there was no man, and wondered that
          there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation unto
          him; and his righteousness, it sustained him." Ere the angels began to
          sing, or the sun, and moon, and stars threw their first beams athwart
          primeval darkness, Christ espoused the cause of his people, and
          resolved not only to restore to them all the blessings that he foresaw
          that they would lose, but also add to them richer favours that could
          ever have been theirs except through him. Even for eternity his
          delights were with the sons of men; and when I think of him, in that
          far-distant past of which we can form so slight a conception, becoming
          "the head over all things to the church" which then existed only in
          the mind of God, my very soul cries out in a rapture of delight,
          "Behold how he loved us!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, too, that in that eternal secret council, the Lord Jesus
          Christ became the Representative and Surety of his chosen people.
          There was to be, in what was then the far remote future, a covenant
          between God and man; but who was there who was both able and willing
          to sign that covenant on man's behalf, and to give a guarantee that
          man's part of that covenant should be fulfilled? Then it was that the
          Son of God, well knowing all that such suretyship would involve,
          undertook to be the Surety for his people, to fulfil the covenant on
          their behalf, and to meet all its demands which he foresaw that they
          would be unable to meet. Then the eternal Father gave into Christ's
          charge the souls that he had chosen unto eternal life through ages, of
          which we can have so faint an idea, were to elapse before those souls
          were to be created; and the eternal Son covenanted to redeem all those
          souls after they had fallen through sin, to keep them by his grace,
          and to present them "faultless" before the presence of his Father with
          exceeding joy. Thus, as Jacob became accountable to Laban for the
          whole flock committed to his charge, Jesus Christ, "that great
          Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,"
          undertook to redeem and guard the whole flock entrusted to his care,
          so that when, at the last great muster, they should pass under the
          hand of him that telleth them, not one of them should be missing, and
          the blessed Shepherd-Son should be able to say to his Father, "Those
          that thou gavest me I have kept, and not one of them is lost." It was
          in the everlasting covenant that our Lord Jesus Christ became our
          Representative and Surety, and engaged on our behalf to fulfill all
          his Father's will; and as we think of this great mystery of mercy,
          surely all of us who are truly his must exclaim with grateful
          adoration, "Behold how he loved us!"
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been speaking of very ancient things, but let us now come to
          matters that we can more clearly comprehend. In the fulness of time,
          our Lord Jesus Christ left the glories of heaven, and took upon him
          our nature. We know so little of what the word "heaven" means that we
          cannot adequately appreciate the tremendous sacrifice that the Son of
          God must have made in order to become the Son of Mary. The holy angels
          could understand far better than we can what their Lord and ours gave
          up when he renounced the royalties of heaven, and all the honour and
          glory which rightly belonged to him as the Son of the Highest, and
          left his throne and crown above to be born as the Babe of an earthly
          mother, yet even to them there were mysteries about his incarnation
          which they could not fathom; and as they followed the footprints of
          the Son of man on his wondrous way from the manger to the cross and to
          the tomb, they must often have been in that most suggestive attitude
          of which Peter wrote, "which things the angels desire to look into."
          To us, the incarnation of Christ is one of the greatest marvels in the
          history of the universe, and we say, with Paul, "Without controversy
          great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh." The
          omnipotent Creator took the nature of a creature into indissoluble
          union with his divine nature; and, marvel of marvels, that creature
          was man. "He took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him
          the seed of Abraham." For an angel to become an emmet, if that were
          possible, would be nothing at all in comparison with the condescension
          of Christ in becoming the Babe of Bethlehem; for, after all, angels
          and emmets are only creatures formed by Christ, working as one of the
          persons of the ever-blessed Trinity, for John, writing under the
          inspiration of the Holy Spirit, expressly says, "All things were made
          by him; and without him was not anything made that was made." O
          glorious Bridegroom of our hearts, there never was any other love like
          thine! That the eternal Son of God should leave his Father's side, and
          stoop so low as to become one with his chosen people, so that Paul
          could truly write, "We are members of his body, of his flesh, and of
          his bones, is such a wonder of condescending grace and mercy that we
          can only exclaim again and again, "Behold how he loved us!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, "being found in fashion as a man," he took upon himself human
          sickness and suffering. All our infirmities that were not sinful Jesus
          Christ endured, -- the weary feet, the aching head, and the
          palpitating heart, "that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by
          Isaiah the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our
          sickness." This was a wondrous proof of love, that the ever-blessed
          Son of God, who needed not to suffer, should have been willing to be
          compassed with infirmity just like any other man is. "We have not a
          high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities;
          but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin."
        </p>
        <p>
          But if you want to see the love of Jesus at the highest point it ever
          reached, you must, by faith, gaze upon him when he took upon himself
          the sins of all his people, as Peter writes, "who his own self bare
          our sins in his own body on the tree." Oh, how could one who was so
          pure, so absolutely perfect, ever bear so foul a load? Yet he did bear
          it, and the transfer of his people's sin from them to him was so
          complete that the inspired prophet wrote, "The Lord hath laid on him
          the iniquity of us all," and the inspired apostle wrote, "He hath made
          him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
          righteousness of God in him." When a man marries a woman who is deeply
          in debt, well knowing the burdens that he is taking upon himself even
          though it is enough to crush him all his life, we may well say,
          "Behold how he loves her!" That was what Christ did for his Church
          when he took her into an eternal marriage union with himself, although
          she had incurred such liabilities as could not have been discharged if
          she had spent all eternity in hell; he took all her debts upon
          himself, and then paid them unto the uttermost farthing; for we must
          never forget that, when Christ bore his people's sins, he also bore
          the full punishment of them. In fulfillment of the great eternal
          covenant, and in prospect of all the glory and blessing that would
          follow from Christ's atoning sacrifice, "it pleased the Lord to bruise
          him; he hath put him to grief." We cannot have the slightest
          conception of what that bruising and that grief must have been. We do
          not know what our Lord's physical and mental agonies must have been,
          yet they were only the shell of his sufferings; his soul-agony was the
          kernel, and it was that which made him cry, "My God, my God, why hast
          thou forsaken me?" Then it was that the precious "corn of wheat" fell
          into the ground and died; and dying, brought forth "much fruit" of
          which heaven and eternity alone can tell the full tale. I cannot speak
          of this wondrous mystery as I fain would do, but you who know even in
          part what it means must join me in saying, "Behold how he loved us!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, than that, Christ has so completely given himself to us that
          all that he has is ours. He is the glorious Husband, and his Church is
          his bride, the Lamb's wife; and there is nothing that he has which is
          not also hers even now, and which he will not share with her for ever.
          By a marriage bond which cannot be broken, for he hateth putting away,
          he hath espoused her unto himself in righteousness and truth, and she
          shall be one with him throughout eternity. He has gone up to his
          Father's house to take possession of the many mansions there, not for
          himself, but for his people; and his contrary prayer is, "Father, I
          will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am;
          that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou
          lovedst me before the foundation of the world." Jesus has an
          ever-flowing fountain of joy in his heart, but he desires that his joy
          may be in you if you belong to him, and that your joy may be full; and
          everything else that he has is yours as much as it is his, so surely
          you will again join with me in saying, "Behold how he loved us!"
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, secondly, let us consider WHAT CHRIST HAS DONE TO US, for
          each of his acts of love should cause us to exclaim, "Behold how he
          loved us!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Think, dear brethren and sister ins Christ, how the Lord dealt with us
          in the days of our unregeneracy. He called us again and again, but we
          would not go to him; and the more lovingly he called us, the more
          resolutely we hardened our hearts, and refused to accept his gracious
          invitation. With some of us, this refusal lasted for years; and we
          wonder now that the Lord waited for us so long. If a rich man invites
          a pauper to a feast, and the poor man is indifferent to the
          invitation, or positively refuses to accept it, he gets no second
          invitation, for man does not press his charity upon the needy; but
          when we even scoffed at our Lord's call, and made all manner of
          excuses for not coming to the gospel banquet, he would not take our
          "No" for an answer, but called, and called, again and again, until
          last we could hold out no longer, and had to yield to the sweet
          compulsion of his grace. Do you not remember, beloved, how you
          received pardon, and justification, and adoption, and the indwelling
          of the Spirit, and how many "exceeding great and precious promises"
          were brought to you, like various courses at a royal festival served
          upon golden dishes adorned with priceless gems? Oh, that blessed,
          blessed day in which you first came and sat among the guests at the
          great King's table! As you look back upon it, your heart glows in
          grateful remembrance of Christ's mercy to you, and you cannot help
          saying, "Behold how he loved us!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Many days have passed since then, and I asked you now to recollect
          what Christ has done to us since we first trusted in him. Has his love
          for you cooled in the slightest degree? We have all of us tried that
          love by our wondering and waywardness, but we have not quenched it,
          and its fire still burns just as vehemently as at the first. We have,
          sometimes, fallen so low that our hearts have been like adamant,
          incapable of emotion; yet Jesus has loved us all the while, and
          softened our hard hearts as the glorious sun melts the icebergs of the
          sea. We were like the insensible grass which calls not for the dew,
          yet the dew of his love gently fell upon us; and though we had not
          sought it, our heart was refreshed by it. Our Lord has indeed proved
          how he loved us by the gracious way in which he has borne with our
          many provocations; and think too, beloved, with what gifts he has
          enriched us, with what comforts he has sustained us, with what divine
          energy he has renewed our failing strength, and with what blessed
          guidance he has led and is still leading us! Take thy pencil and
          paper, and try to set down in figures or in words thy total
          indebtedness to his love; where wilt thou begin, and when thou hast
          begun, where wilt thou finish? If thou wert to record only one out of
          a million of his love-gifts to thee, would the whole world be able to
          contain the books that might be written concerning them? No; all thou
          canst say is, "Behold how he has loved us!"
        </p>
        <p>
          There have been times -- of which I will not say much just now, for
          some here would not understand what I mean, -- when we have seemed to
          stand in the very suburbs of heaven, where we could hear the bells
          pealing forth celestial music from the invisible belfries, and our
          hearts were ravished with the sound of the heavenly harpers harping
          with their harps, and the ten thousand times ten thousand white-robed
          choristers singing the song of Moses and of the Lamb. Nay, more than
          that, the King himself hath brought us into his banqueting house, and
          his banner over us has been love. He has not only permitted us to sit
          at his feet, as Mary did, but he has allowed us to pillow our head on
          his bosom, as John did, and even condescended to let us put our finger
          into the print of the nails in our rapturous familiar fellowship with
          him who is not ashamed to call us his brethren. I must not continue in
          this strain, -- not for the lack of matter, but lack of time in which
          to speak concerning him, so must again say, "Behold how he loved us!"
        </p>
        <p>
          I must, however, mention one more proof of Christ's love, and that is
          this, he has made us long for heaven, and given us at least a measure
          of preparation for it. We are expecting that, one of these days, if
          the chariot and horses of fire do not stop at our door, our dear Lord
          and Saviour will fulfil to us his promise, "if I go and prepare a
          place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that
          where I am, there ye may be also," To a true believer in Jesus, the
          thought of departing from this world, and going to be "for ever with
          the Lord," has nothing of gloom associated with it. This earth is the
          place our banishment and exile; heaven is our home. We are like the
          loving wife who is sundered by thousands of miles of sea and land from
          her dear husband, and we are longing for the great re-union with our
          beloved Lord, from whom we shall then never again be separated. I
          cannot hope to depict the scene when he shall introduce us to the
          principalities and powers in heavenly places, and bid us sit with him
          in his throne, even as he sits with his Father in his throne. Surely
          then the holy angels, who have never sinned, will unite in exclaiming,
          "Behold, how he loved them!" It is a most blessed thought, to my mind,
          that we may be up there before the hands of that clock complete
          another round; and if not so soon as that, it will not be long before
          all of us who love the Lord will be with him where he is, and then the
          last among us shall know more of his love than the greatest of us can
          ever know while here below. Meanwhile, we have much of the joy of
          heaven even while we are upon this earth; for, as Paul wrote to the
          Ephesians, "God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he
          loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together
          with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised us up together,
          and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The closing portion of my sermon is to be very practical. Did
          anybody ever say of any one of us here, "Behold how he loves Christ"?
          If someone did say that of you, my brother or sister, was it true? I
          think I hear your answer, " Oh, I do love him! He knows all things,
          and he knows that I love him." But do you love him so fervently that
          strangers or even your more intimate acquaintances would say of your
          love to Jesus what the Jews said of his love to Lazarus, "Behold how
          he loved him"? "I wish," says one, "I could do so." Then listen for a
          minute or two while I tell you of WHAT SOME SAINTS HAVE DONE TO SHOW
          HOW THEY LOVED THEIR LORD.

          There have been those who have suffered for Christ's sake. They have
          lain in damp dungeons, and have refused to accept liberty at the price
          of treachery to their Lord and his truth. They have been stretched
          upon the rack, yet no torture could make them yield up their fidelity
          to God. If you have read Foxe's Book of Martyrs, you know how hundreds
          of brave men and women, and children too, stood at the stake,
          gloriously calm, and often triumphantly happy, and were burnt to death
          for Christ's sake, while many of those who looked on learnt to imitate
          their noble example, and others who heard their dying testimonies, and
          their expiring songs, (not groans,) could not help exclaiming, "Behold
          how these martyrs love their Master!"
        </p>
        <p>
          There have been others, who have shown their love to their Lord by
          untiring and self-sacrificing service. They have laboured for him, at
          times, under great privations and amid many perils, some as
          missionaries in foreign lands, and others with equal zeal in this
          country. Their hearts were all aglow with love for their dear Lord and
          Saviour, and they spent their whole time and strength in seeking to
          win souls for him, so that those who knew them could not help saying,
          "Behold how they love their Lord!" Some of us can never hope to wear
          the ruby crown of martyrdom, yet we may be honoured by receiving the
          richly-jewelled crown from the hand of Christ as he says to each of
          his true labourers, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant: . . .
          enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we have known some saints who showed their love to their Lord by
          weeping over sinners and praying for their conversion. There have been
          gracious men and women, who could not sleep at night because of their
          anxiety about the eternal welfare of their relatives and friends, or
          even of lost ones who were personally unknown to them; and they have
          risen from their beds to agonize in prayer for sinners who were either
          calmly sleeping, and not even dreaming of their doom, or else at that
          very hour were adding to their previous transgressions. There have
          been others, who could not hear a blasphemous word, as they passed
          along the street, without feeling a holy indignation at the injury
          that was being done to their best Friend, and at the same time their
          eyes filled with tears of pity for the poor blasphemers, and their
          hearts poured out a stream of supplication for those who were thus
          ignorantly or wantonly sinning against the Most High. They have been
          like Jeremiah weeping over the lost, and like Moses and Paul ready to
          sacrifice their own souls for the sake of others, until men have been
          compelled to say, "Behold how these weeping and pleading saints love
          their Lord, and love lost sinners for his sake!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Others have proved their love to their Lord by the way in which they
          have been given of their substance to his cause. They have not only
          given a tithe of all they had to the great Melchizdeck, but they have
          counted it a high privilege to lay all that they had upon his altar,
          counting that their gold was never so golden as when it was all
          Christ's and that their lands were never so valuable to them as when
          they were gladly surrendered to him. Alas, that there should be so
          few, even in the Church of Christ, who thus imitate their Lord who
          freely gave himself and all he had that he might save his people!
          Blessed will the Church be when she gets back to the Pentecostal
          consecration which was the fitting culmination of the Pentecostal
          blessing: "all that believed were together, and had all things in
          common; and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all
          men, as every man had need."
        </p>
        <p>
          Another most admirable way of proving our love to Christ is by being
          scrupulously carefully to please him in little things as well as in
          the important matters. One of the worst signs of this present evil age
          is that so little is thought of even the great things of Christ, --
          his atoning sacrifice, his high priestly character and work, his
          kingly rule, and so on; while the little things of Christ, those that
          are less by comparison with these, are often utterly despised. There
          was a time, in Scotland, when men of God signed the Solemn League and
          Covenant with their blood; how many would do that to-day? One jewel in
          Christ's crown, that priceless Koh-i-noor of the crown rights of the
          King of kings, was sufficient to call into battlefield the noblest of
          Scotland's sons; but, to-day, the very crown of Christ itself is
          kicked about, like a football, by some of his professed servants, for
          they set up their own fallible judgments against his infallible
          revelation, and so practically say, "We will not have this Man to
          reign over us!" In this land, in the most glorious days that England
          has ever seen, our Puritan forefathers were so scrupulous that men
          called them strait-laced, sour-faced, bigoted, and I know not what;
          but, nowadays, the truth for which they contended, and for which many
          of them resisted even unto blood, are said to be unimportant or of no
          account whatever. The special truth which distinguishes us as a
          denomination is regarded by many with supreme contempt. Not long ago,
          a professedly Christian minister said that he did not care a penny
          about baptism! If he belongs to Christ, he will have to answer to his
          Master for that saying; but I could not utter such a sentence as that
          without putting my very soul in peril. He who really loves his Lord
          will not trifle with the least jot or tittle of his Lord's will. Love
          is one of the most jealous things in the universe. "God is a jealous
          God" because "God is love." The wife who truly loves her husband will
          not harbour even a wanton imagination; her fidelity to him must not be
          stained even by an unchaste thought; so must it be with every true
          lover of the Lord Jesus Christ. God grant that we, beloved brethren
          and sisters in Christ, may do our Lord's will so scrupulously, in
          great things and little things, and in all things alike, that those
          who see us in our daily life may be compelled to say, "Behold how
          these Christians love Jesus Christ their Lord and Saviour!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, beloved, remember that, when our love has reached its climax, it
          can only be like a solitary dewdrop trembling on a leaf compared with
          the copious showers of love that pour continually from the heart of
          our dear Lord and Master. Put all our loves together, and they will
          not fill a tiny cup, and there before us flows the fathomless,
          limitless, shoreless ocean of the love of Jesus; yet let us have all
          the love for him that we can. May the Holy Spirit fill our souls to
          the brim with love to Jesus, for his dear name's sake! Amen.<br />
