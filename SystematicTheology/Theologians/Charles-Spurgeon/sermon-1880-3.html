        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1513)</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "And Josiah set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to
          the service of the house of the Lord" -- 2 Chronicles 35:2.
        </p>
        <p>
          JOSIAH, as you remember, in the early part of his reign set his face
          against the idolatries that prevailed, to root them out of the land.
          He then bent his thoughts upon repairing and beautifying the temple.
          After that it was his heart's aim to restore the sacred services, to
          observe the solemn feasts, and to revive the worship of God after the
          due order, according to the words of the book of the covenant that was
          found in the house of the Lord. Our text tells us something of the
          method with which he went to work; and it may well serve us as a
          model.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing is to get every man into his proper place; the next
          thing is for every man to have a good spirit in his present place, so
          as to occupy it worthily. I will suppose, dear friends, that in the
          providence of God you are in your place, and that by the direction of
          God's Spirit you have also sought and found the precise form of
          usefulness in which you ought to exercise yourself. To-night it shall
          not be my business to arrange you; but assuming that it is well for
          you to keep where you are, my object shall be to encourage you to do
          your work for your Lord without being cast down. I am hardly going to
          preach so much as to talk to different persons who are discouraged in
          the work of the Lord, that we may rouse them up, rally them round us,
          and encourage them to keep rank.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. And, first, I would speak a little to THOSE WHO THINK THAT THEY CAN
          DO NOTHING. They will tell me that in such a sermon not a sentence can
          concern them: if I am to encourage men to the service of the house of
          the Lord, it will be in vain for them, as they can do nothing at all.
          Well, dear friends, you must not take that for granted; you must make
          quite sure that you cannot do anything before I may venture to speak
          to you as if it were a matter of fact; for sometimes there is a want
          of way because there is a want of will. Though I do not go so far as
          to allege that this is your case, we know too well that "cannot" often
          does mean "will not," and not to have triumphed may mean that you have
          not tried. You have been so discouraged that you have excused yourself
          for inaction, and your inaction has grown into indolence. If a man,
          under the notion that he could not lift his right hand, constantly
          kept it still, I should not wonder if, after weeks and months, it
          would become a matter of fact that he had not the power to use it. It
          might actually stiffen for no reason but because he had not moved it.
          Do you not think that, before your muscles get rigid, it would be well
          to exercise them by attempting some kind of service? Especially you
          younger folk, if you do not work for the Lord almost as soon as you
          are converted it will be very difficult afterwards to make you take to
          it. Aptitude, I have often noticed, comes with employment, and through
          negligence and sloth people become enervated and helpless. You say
          that you cannot move your arm, and so you do not move it; take heed,
          for by-and-by your pretence will become the parent of real
          powerlessness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I will take what you have said as being true. You are ill; the
          vigour you felt in the bright days of health fails you now; you have
          to suffer pain, weariness, and exhaustion; you are often detained at
          home; and home seems now to you a gloomy hospital all the day long,
          rather than a genial hostelry when evening shadows fall. Little
          indeed, therefore, can you do; so little that you are apt to reckon it
          as nothing at all. The thought is a burden to you. You wish you could
          serve the Lord. How constantly you have dreamed of the pleasure since
          you have been denied the privilege! How willing your feet would be to
          run; how ready your hands would be to labour; how glad would your
          tongue be to testify! You envy those who are able, and you would fain
          emulate and excel them; not indeed that you harbour ill-will against
          them, but you devoutly wish that you could do some personal service in
          the cause of your Master.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I want to encourage you first by reminding you that the law of
          the Son of David is the same as the law of David himself; and you know
          the law of David about those that went to the battle. There were some
          that were lame, and some that were otherwise incapable of action, and
          he left them with the baggage. "There," he said, "you are very weary
          and ill: stop in the camp: take care of the tents, and the ammunition,
          while we go and fight." Now, it happened once on a time that the men
          that went to fight claimed all the spoil. They said, "These people
          have done nothing: they have been lying in the trenches: they shall
          not carry off a share of the booty." But King David there and then
          made a law that they should share and share equally -- those that were
          in the trenches and those that engaged in the fray. "As his part is
          that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by
          the stuff: they shall part alike. And it was so from that day forward,
          that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel." Nor is the law
          of the Son of David less gracious. If by sickness you are detained at
          home, -- if for any other reason, such as age or infirmity, you are
          not able to enter into actual service, yet if you are a true soldier
          and would fight if you could, and your heart is in it, you shall share
          even with the best and bravest of those who, clad in the panoply of
          God, encounter and grapple with the adversary.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, brethren, you have no reason to envy, though you may admire to
          your heart's content, all who are diligent and successful in the
          service of Christ. Let me remind you of a law of the kingdom of heaven
          with which you are all familiar -- "He that receiveth a prophet in the
          name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward." In truth, it is a
          splendid appointment to be a servant of the Lord. David thought so,
          for you often read at the commencement of his psalms -- "A prayer of
          David, the servant of God," though you never read, "A prayer of David,
          the king of Israel," for he thought more of being enrolled a servant
          of God than of being entitled a king of Israel. Health and strength,
          ability and opportunity to fulfil a mission for the Master are much to
          be desired, but these are not always to be taken as reliable evidence
          of personal salvation. A man may preach admirably, and he may work
          marvels in the church, and yet himself not be a partaker of saving
          grace. Hence, when the disciples came back from preaching, and said,
          "Lord, even the devils are subject to us through thy name," the Lord
          said, "Never the less, in this rejoice not, but rather rejoice because
          your names are written in heaven." Judas was amongst them; Judas cast
          out devils; Judas preached the gospel; and yet Judas was a son of
          perdition, and is lost for ever. Because you cannot do much you must
          not infer that therefore you are not saved; for if you were to be
          among the chief of Christian workers it would not prove that you were
          certainly a child of God. Do not fret, then, because you are shut out
          from the cheerful activities in which others share; for, as long as
          your name is written in heaven, and your heart truly follows after the
          Lord, you shall have an abundant recompense at the last great day,
          even though here you are doomed to be a sufferer rather than a worker.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to me it seems more than possible that some of you, dear friends,
          whose minds are tinged with melancholy, have painted your own lot in
          deeper shades than the justice of the case deserves. Is your life
          indeed a dull routine, which, for lack of busy change and lively
          enterprise, leaves no record behind? Not so, methinks. "The rich
          relics of a well-spent hour" do sometimes pour around your path a
          stream of light that cheers our eyes, though it may escape your
          notice. Are you patient under your sufferings? Do you try to keep the
          flesh in subjection, to govern your spirit, to refrain from murmuring,
          and to foster cheerfulness? That, my friend, is doing a great deal. I
          am sure that the holy serenity of a suffering child of God is one of
          the best sermons that can ever be preached in a family. A sick saint
          has often been more serviceable in a house than the most eloquent
          divine could have been. They see how sweetly you submit to the divine
          will, how patiently you can bear painful operations, how the Lord
          gives you songs in the night. Why, you are greatly useful. I have
          sometimes been called to visit bedridden persons who have been unable
          to rise for many, many years, and it has been within my knowledge that
          their influence has extended over whole parishes. They have been known
          as poor pious women or as experienced Christian men, and many have
          gone to visit them. Christian ministers have said that they derived
          more benefit from sitting half-an-hour talking to poor old Betsy than
          they did from all the books in their library, and yet Betsy said that
          she was doing nothing. Look at your case in that light, and you will
          see that you can praise God upon your bed, and make your chamber to be
          as vocal for God as this pulpit ever can be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, dear friends, do you not think we frequently limit our
          estimate of serving God to the public exercises of the sanctuary, and
          forget the strong claims that our Lord has upon our private fidelity
          and obedience? You say, "I cannot serve God," when you cannot teach in
          the school or preach in the pulpit, when you are unable to sit on a
          committee or speak on a platform: as if these were the only forms of
          service to be taken into account. Do you not think that a mother
          nursing her baby is serving God? Do you not think that men and women
          going about their daily toil with patient industry discharging the
          duties of domestic life are serving God? If you think rightly you will
          understand that they are. The servant sweeping the room, the mistress
          preparing the meal, the workman driving a nail, the merchant casting
          up his ledger, ought to do all in the service of God. Though, of
          course, it is very desirable that we should each and all have some
          definitely religious work before us, yet it is much better that we
          should hallow our common handicraft, and make our ordinary work chime
          with the melodies of a soul attuned for heaven. Let true religion be
          our life, and then our life will be true religion. That is how it
          ought to be. "Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all in
          the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks unto God and the Father by
          him." So, then, let the stream of your common life as it flows on,
          obscure, unobserved, be holy and courageous; you will find that while
          "they also serve who only stand and wait," you shall not be neglected
          or overlooked who simply sit at Jesus' feet and listen to his words
          when you can do no more. This is service done for him which he can
          appreciate; complain who may.
        </p>
        <p>
          Know, too, my dear sister, that by thy sorrows the Lord has drawn out
          thy sympathies. Thou, my dear brother, know that by the discipline
          which has chastened thee, thou hast learned to be a comforter. Say
          you, then, that you cannot do anything? I know a few secrets about you
          that you forget. You do not reckon yourself up as we reckon you. Did
          you not try to cheer a poor neighbour the other day by telling of the
          Lord's goodness to you when you were very sick yourself? How started
          from your eye that tear most sacred shed for a fellow-creature's pain?
          Is it not your habit, poor sufferer as you are, to let drop just a few
          words for your Master to others in a like condition whenever you can?
          You tell me that you cannot do anything. Why, dear hearts, the
          refreshing of God's saints is one of the highest works in which anyone
          can be occupied. God will send prophets to his servants at times when
          they need to be rebuked; if he wants to comfort them he generally
          sends an angel to them, for that is angel's work. Jesus Christ
          himself, we read, had angels sent to minister to him. When? Was it not
          in the garden of Gethsemane, when he was bowed down with sorrow?
          Comforting is not ordinary work: it is a kind of angelic work. "There
          appeared unto him an angel strengthening him." A prophet was sent to
          warn the Israelites of their sin; but when a Gideon was to be
          encouraged to go and fight for his country, it was the angel of the
          Lord that came to him. So I gather that comforting work is angel's
          work. You, dear kind Christian men and women, who think that you are
          not able to do anything but to condole or to console with cheery words
          some souls cast down and sore dismayed, you are fulfilling a most
          blessed office, and doing work which many ministers find it difficult
          to perform. I have known some who have never known suffering or
          ill-health, and when they try to comfort God's weary people they are
          dreadfully awkward over it. They are like elephants picking up pins:
          they can do it, but it is with a wonderful effort. God's tried people
          comfort each other con amore; they take to the work as a fish to
          water. They understand the art of speaking a word in season to him
          that is weary, and when this is the case they may not complain that
          they are doing nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet, beloved, you who thought that you did nothing, and now
          perceive that you are really useful, will, I hope, perceive that there
          is still a wider region into which you may advance. Breathe to-night
          the prayer of Jabez, who was more honourable than his brethren,
          because he was the child of his mother's sorrow; and this was the
          prayer -- "Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my
          coast"! Ask God to open up to you a larger region of usefulness, and
          he will do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now let me address a few words to another class of workers WHO
          THINK THAT THEY ARE LAID ASIDE.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Dear sir," says one, "I wish you would encourage me. I used to be
          useful once; at least, I was recognized as one of a band of men who
          worked together right heartily, but since I have changed my residence
          I am unknown in the neighborhood where I am living, and I seem to have
          dropped out of the ranks. I have done little or nothing lately, and I
          feel uneasy about it. I wish that I could get to work." My dear
          brother, I hope you will; but do not waste five minutes in thinking it
          over. These times need so much Christian effort that when a man asks
          me, "How shall I do work for Christ"? I am accustomed to say, "Go and
          do it." "But what is the way to do it"? Start at once. Get at it, my
          brother. Do not be out of harness a minute. But suppose that you are
          obliged to desist awhile, do not let your interest in the cause of our
          Lord and Master decline. Some of the best of God's workers have been
          laid aside for long periods. Moses was forty years in the desert,
          doing nothing. A greater than he, our blessed Saviour himself, was
          thirty years, -- I will not say doing nothing, but certainly doing no
          public work. When you are in a retired and inactive position, be
          preparing for the time when God brings you out again. If you are put
          away on the shelf, do not rust there, but pray the Master to brighten
          you up so that when he comes to use you again you may be fully fitted
          for the work which he has in hand for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          While you must be laid aside, I want you to do this, -- pray for
          others that are at work. Help them; encourage them. Do not get into
          that peevish, miserable frame of mind which grudges and undervalues
          other men's works. Be not like the dog in the manger. Some people,
          when they cannot do anything themselves, do not like anybody else to
          be diligent and laborious. Say, "If I cannot help, I will never
          hinder, but I will cheer my brethren."
        </p>
        <p>
          Spend your time in prayer that you may be fit for the Master's use,
          and, meanwhile, be prompt in helping others. You remember that, at the
          siege of Gibraltar, when the fleet surrounded it and determined to
          storm the old rock, the governor fired red-hot shot down upon the men
          of war. The enemy did not at all admire the governor's warm reception.
          Think how it was done. Here were gunners on the ramparts firing away,
          and every man in the garrison would have liked to do the same. What
          did those do who could not serve a gun? Why, they heated the shot; and
          that is what you must do. I am master gunner here generally: heat my
          shot for me, if you will. Keep the furnace going, so that when we do
          fire off a sermon it may be red-hot, through your earnest prayers.
          When you see your friends sitting in the Sunday-school, or standing
          out in the street working for God, if you cannot join them yet say,
          "Never mind: I will heat the shot for them. My prayers shall not be
          wanting, if I can contribute nothing else." That is counsel for you
          who are for awhile laid on the shelf.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Others there are who are much discouraged because THEY HAVE BUT
          SMALL TALENT. "Oh," they say, "I wish I could serve Jesus Christ like
          Paul, or like Whitefield -- that I could range the country through
          proclaiming his dear name and winning thousands of converts. But I am
          slow of speech and dull of thought, and what I attempt produces little
          or no effect." Well, brother, mind that you do what you can. Do you
          not recollect the parable of the men who had talents entrusted to
          them? I do not want to lay undue stress upon the fact that it was the
          man who had one talent who buried it. Yet why is he represented as
          doing so? I think it was not because the men of two and five talents
          do not sometimes bury theirs, but because the temptation lies most
          with the one talent people. They say, "What can I do? What is the use
          of me? I may be excused." That is the temptation. Brother, do not be
          entangled in that snare. If your Lord has only given you one talent he
          does not expect you to make the same interest upon it as the man does
          with five; but still he does expect his interest, and therefore do not
          wrap your talent in a napkin. It is but with strength imparted that
          any of us can serve him. We have nothing to consecrate to him but the
          gift we have first received from him. You are weak. You feel it; but
          what says your God to you? "Not by might nor by power, but by my
          Spirit, saith the Lord." He can make you useful though you have no
          extraordinary endowments. Grape-shot may do great execution, though it
          cannot compare with grenade or bomb-shell. A sinner may be brought to
          Christ by the simple earnestness of a peasant or an artisan, without
          calling in the aid of a professor's learning or a preacher's
          eloquence. God can bless you far above what you think to be your
          capacity, for it is not a question of your ability but of his aid. You
          have no self-reliance, you tell me. Then take refuge in God, I entreat
          you, for you evidently want more of the divine succor. Go and get it;
          it is to be had. He girds the weak with strength. "The young men shall
          faint and be weary, but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their
          strength." Why, I think you are more likely to do good than if you had
          five talents, for now you will pray more and you will depend more upon
          God than you would have done if you had possessed strength of your
          own.
        </p>
        <p>
          One other word. As you are not enriched with many talents, mind you
          economize those you have. Do you know how merchants and tradesmen who
          have only a small capital in business manage to compete with those who
          have larger means? They try to turn their money over every day. The
          costermonger cannot afford to deal out his goods to gentlemen who will
          pay him in three months. Not he. He must get his ready money at the
          door, and then go and buy another stock to-morrow morning, and turn it
          over, or else he could not pick up his living with so small a capital.
          If you have only ninepence, make it "nimble," and you will get as much
          profit out of a nimble ninepence as another out of a lazy crown.
          Activity often makes up for lack of ability. If you cannot get force
          by the weight of the ball, get it by the velocity with which it
          travels. A little man with one talent all ablaze may become a perfect
          nuisance to the devil, and a champion for Christ. As for that great
          divine with his five talents, who marches on so sleepily, Satan can
          always overmatch him and win the day. If you can but turn over your
          one talent again and again, in the name of God, you may achieve great
          wonders. So I would encourage you in the work of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. With workers WHO ARE UNDER GREAT DIFFICULTIES I would now have a
          word. I have known the day when perplexities pleased me, dilemmas
          afforded me delight, and instead of declining a difficult task I
          rather like it. Even now I enjoy puzzling over a problem, and
          attempting what others decline. Nothing good in this world can be
          effected without difficulty. The biggest diamonds lie under heavy
          stones which sluggards cannot turn over. That which is easy to do is
          hardly worth doing. In the face of difficulty the man of ardent,
          persevering spirit braces up his nerves, sharpens his wits, and brings
          all his powers into play to achieve an object that will reward his
          efforts. Have you great difficulties dear friend? You are not the
          first worker for God who has had difficulties to encounter. Let us go
          back to Moses again. He was to bring Israel out of Egypt; but his path
          did not appear very plain. He must go before Pharaoh and issue God's
          command. Pharaoh looked him through when he said, "Let my people go."
          The haughty monarch was greatly surprised to hear anybody, especially
          a Hebrew, talk like that; and so he bade him begone. But Moses returns
          with, "Thus saith the Lord, Let my people go"; and his courage was not
          even then crowned with immediate success. There must be plague upon
          plague, plague upon plague, till at last proud Pharaoh's heart was
          broken, the Israelites were saved from the hand of him that hated
          them; and Egypt was glad when they departed. This, however, was but
          the beginning of the mission of Moses. His was a life of difficulty --
          the meekest man, but the most provoked; and until he got to the top of
          Pisgah, and his gracious Master kissed away his soul, the prophet of
          Horeb had never done with difficulties. Any good thing, I say,
          especially any good thing done for God, must be surrounded with
          difficulties, and resisted by adversaries. Look at Nehemiah, and Ezra,
          and Zerubbabel, and those that built Jerusalem, the second time. These
          good men wrought zealously, but Sanballat and Tobiah were jeering and
          jesting, and trying to throw down the wall. If you build a city
          without difficulty, it is not Jerusalem. Be sure of that. As soon as
          ever you begin working for God you will find a great power working
          against you. If you encounter opposition, take it as a good sign. When
          our young men go to a provincial town to preach, and I want to know
          how they are getting on, after listening to their story, I ask, "Has
          somebody slandered you yet? Do the newspapers denounce you as a fool"?
          If they say "No," I conclude that they are not getting on much. If
          Christ's cause is prospering the world will reproach the soul-winner;
          if you do damage to the devil's kingdom he will roar at you. Should
          your course be smooth, it is because he says, "There is nothing to
          disturb me in that man's monotonous talk. I need not let fly the fiery
          dart of calumny at him: he is a chip in the porridge, I will let him
          alone." Such a man generally goes through life very comfortably.
          People say, "He is a quiet, inoffensive sort of man." We do not want
          such soldiers in the service of Christ. "What a disagreeable person"!
          said a king once of an officer whose sword rattled on the floor. "That
          sword of his is most offensive." "Sire," said the officer, "that is
          exactly what your majesty's enemies think." When ungodly persons say
          that we are troublesome, we are not broken-hearted at being out of
          their good looks. If the king's enemies think us troublesome, we
          reckon it to be high praise. When you, my dear brother, meet with
          opposition, encounter it with prayer. Exercise more faith. Antagonists
          ought never to hinder your going forward in the cause of Christ.
          Diamond must cut diamond. There is nothing so hard in this world but
          you can cut it with something harder. If you ask God to steel your
          soul up to the conquering point, and to make your resolution like an
          adamant stone, you can cut your way through an alp of diamond in the
          service of your Lord and Master.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me inspirit you in the face of assailants. The forces ranged
          against you might be stumbling-blocks to fools, but they shall only
          prove a stimulus to men. One day your honour shall be the greater and
          your reward shall be the higher because of these adverse elements.
          Therefore, be brave and fear not, but advance in the strength of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Fain would I now speak a passing word of comfort to another class
          of workers -- THOSE THAT ARE NOT APPRECIATED. I am not going to say
          much, because I have not much sympathy with them. Yet I know that the
          smallest slight chafes those who are over sensitive. They murmur, "I
          do my best, and nobody thanks me." You think yourself a martyr, and
          complain that you are mis-represented. Be it so, dear friend; that was
          your Master's lot, and it is the lot of all his servants. This is a
          cross we must all carry, or we shall never wear the crown. Do you
          fancy that this is a new experience? Look at Joseph. His brethren
          could not bear him, and yet it was he that saved the family and fed
          them in time of famine. Look at David. His brothers asked why he had
          left the charge of the sheep to come down to the battle, suspecting
          that the pride of his heart had brought him among the soldiers and the
          standards. Yet nobody could bring back Goliath's head but that young
          David. Take a lesson from the ruddy hero; take no notice of what your
          brethren say about you. Go and bring back the giant's head. A good
          adventure is the best answer to evil accusations. If you are serving
          the Master let their scandal stir you up to more self-consecration. If
          they cry out against you as too forward, serve the Lord with more
          vigour, and you will antidote the venom of their tongues. Did you
          enter into Christ's work in order to be honoured among men? Then
          retire from it, for you came with a bad motive. But if you enlisted
          purely to bring honour to Him, and to win his smile, what more do you
          want? What more do you want? Be not therefore disheartened because you
          are not applauded. Be certain of this, that to be kept in the rear
          rank is often necessary to future eminence. If you take a man and put
          him in front, and pat him on the back and say, "What a great man he
          is"! he will make a false step before long, and there will be an end
          of your hero; but when a man is brought forward by God, he is often
          one whom everybody criticizes, finds fault with, and declaims as an
          impostor, but the banter he is exposed to serves as ballast for his
          mind. When he comes off with success he will not be spoiled with
          conceit, for the grace of God will make him bow with gratitude. The
          sword that is meant for a princely hand, to split through skull and
          backbone in the day of battle, must be annealed in the furnace again
          and again; it cannot be fit for such desperate work until it has
          passed through the fire full many a time. Do not ask to be
          appreciated. Never be so mean as that. Appreciate yourself in the
          serenity of conscience, and leave your honour with your God.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. I must speak now, in the last place, a little more at length to
          THOSE WHO ARE DISCOURAGED BECAUSE THEY HAVE HAD SO LITTLE SUCCESS.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was my great delight a few evenings ago to meet a splendid band of
          men and women who are the Sunday-school teachers of this church. You
          will think it strange that I did not till then thoroughly estimate the
          extent of their work, as I had never added up the total of the various
          schools; but when I did so, and found that they mounted up to six
          thousand children, I felt full of joy. I shall run over with delight
          if they increase to twelve thousand in another twelve months. For so
          large a district this would not be too many, but still our present
          number is most encouraging. Now, I know that some of our teachers are
          working away in back streets, in rooms not connected with any place
          but this, and we hardly knew of them, because they were pursuing their
          simple, unobtrusive labours so quietly. Are there any of you who fear
          that you have toiled in vain and spent your strength for nought? I
          would entreat you, dear friends, not to be satisfied with casting in
          the seed unless you reap some good results; yet do not be so
          faint-hearted as to give up because of a little disappointment. Though
          you cannot be satisfied without fruit, yet do not cease to sow because
          one season proves a failure. I would not have our friends the farmers
          abandon agriculture because this year they have a bad crop: if they
          were to measure their future prospects by the present failure, it
          would be a great pity. If you have preached or taught, or done work
          for Christ with little success until now, do not infer that you will
          always be unsuccessful. Regret the lack of prosperity but do not
          relinquish the labour of seeking it. You may reasonably be sorrowful,
          but you have no right to despair. Non-success is a trial of faith
          which has been endured by many a trusty servant who has been
          triumphant in the issue. Did not the disciples toil all night, and
          catch nothing? Did we not read just now of some who cast the net, and
          yet took no fish? Did not our Lord say that some seed would fall on
          stony ground, and some among the thorns, and that from these there
          would be no harvest? What good did Jeremiah do? I have no doubt he
          laboured, and God blessed him, but the result of his preaching was
          that he said, "The bellows are burned in the fire." He had blown up
          the fire till he had burnt the bellows, but no man's heart was melted.
          "Woe is me"! said he. "Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a
          fountain of tears"! I do not know what was the result of Noah's
          ministry, but I do know that he was a preacher of righteousness for a
          hundred and twenty years, and yet he never brought a soul into the ark
          except his own family. Poor preaching we may count it judging by the
          influence it exerted: and yet we know that it was grand preaching,
          such as God commended. Do not, then, grudge the time, or the strength,
          you lay out in the service of our great Lord because you do not see
          your efforts thrive, for better men than you have wept over failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, too, that if you really do serve the Lord thoroughly and
          heartily, he will accept you and acknowledge your service, even though
          no good should come of it. It is your business to cast the bread on
          the waters: if you do not find it after many days, that is not your
          business. It is your business to scatter the seed; but no farmer says
          to his servant, "John, you have not served me well, for there is no
          harvest." The man would say, "Could I make a harvest, sir? I have
          ploughed, and I have sowed. What more could I do"? Even so our good
          Lord is not austere, nor does he demand of us more than we can do. If
          you have ploughed and if you have sowed, although there should be no
          harvest, you are clear and accepted. Did it never strike you that you
          may be now employed in breaking up ground and preparing the soil from
          which other labourers who come after you will reap very plentifully.
          Perhaps your Master knows what a capital ploughman you are. He has a
          large farm, and he never means to let you become a reaper because you
          do the ploughing so well. Your Master does not intend you to take part
          in the harvest because you are such a good hand at sowing; and as he
          has crops that need sowing all the year round he keeps you at that
          work. He knows you better than you know yourself. Perchance if he were
          once to let you get on the top of a loaded wagon of your own sheaves,
          you would turn dizzy and make a fall of it; so he says, "You keep to
          your ploughing and your sowing, and somebody else shall do the
          reaping." Peradventure when your course is run you will see from
          heaven, where it will be safe for you to see it, that you did not
          labour in vain nor spend your strength for nought. "One soweth and
          another reapeth." This is the divine economy. I think that every man
          that loves his Master will say, "So long as there does but come a
          harvest, I will not stipulate about who reaps it. Give me faith enough
          to be assured that the reaping will come, and I will be content." Look
          at William Carey going to India, his prayer being "India for Christ."
          What did Carey live to see? Well, he saw good-speed enough to rejoice
          his heart: but certainly he did not see the fulfillment of all his
          prayer. Successive missionaries have since gone and spent their life
          on that vast field of enterprise. With what result? A result amply
          sufficient to justify all their toil, but, as compared with the
          millions that sit in heathendom, utterly inadequate to the craving of
          the church, much less to the crown of Christ. It does not much matter
          how any one man fares. The mighty empire will revert to the world's
          Redeemer, and I can almost trace in the records of the future the
          writing of "These be the names of the mighty men whom David had," as
          the valiant deeds of his heroes are chronicled by our Lord. When old
          St. Paul's cathedral had to be taken down in order to make room for
          the present noble edifice, some of the walls were immensely strong and
          stood like rocks. Sir Christopher Wren determined to throw them down
          by the old Roman battering-ram. The battering-ram began to work, and
          the men worked at it for hours and hours, day after day, without
          apparent effect. Blow after blow came on the wall; tremendous thuds
          that made the bystanders tremble. The wall continued to stand till
          they thought it was a useless operation. But the architect knew. He
          continued working his battering-ram till every particle of the wall
          felt the motion, and at last over it went in one tremendous ruin. Did
          anybody commend those workmen who caused the final crash, or ascribe
          all the success to them? Not a bit of it. It was the whole of them
          together. Those who had gone away to their meals, those who had begun
          days before, had as much honour in the matter as those who struck the
          last blow. And it is so in the work of Christ. We must keep on
          battering, battering, battering, and at last -- though it may not be
          for another thousand years -- the Lord will triumph. Though Christ
          cometh quickly he may not come for another ten thousand years, but in
          any case idolatry must die, and truth must reign. The accumulated
          prayers and energies of ages shall do the deed, and God shall be
          glorified. Only let us persevere in holy effort, and the end is sure.
          When a certain American general was fighting they said, "What are you
          doing"? He said, "I am not doing much, but I keep pegging away." That
          is what we must do. We cannot do much at any one time, but we must
          keep on. We must keep on pegging away at the enemy, and something will
          come of it by-and-by.
        </p>
        <p>
          Possibly, dear friends, some of you who think you have had slender
          success may have had a great deal more than you know of. Others there
          may be whose want of success should suggest to them to try somewhere
          else, or else to try some other method. If we cannot do good in one
          way we must do it in another. Bring the matter before God in prayer.
          Cry mightily to him, for he will help you yet to do it, and his shall
          be the glory. When he has laid you low, when he has taught you how
          inefficient you are, when he has driven you in despair to rely
          implicitly upon himself, then it may be that he will give you more
          trophies and triumphs than you ever dreamed of. Anyhow, whether I
          prosper in life or not is not my question. To bring souls to Christ is
          my main endeavour, but it is not the ultimate proof of my ministry. My
          business is to live for God, to lay aside self, and give myself up
          wholly to him, and if I do that I shall be accepted whatever else may
          happen. I wish we had the spirit of that brave old man who was
          condemned to the stake. They were going to burn him. He knew that the
          sentence was to be carried out the next morning, but with a soul full
          of courage, and with a merry heart, he sat the last thing at night
          talking with his friends -- faggots and fire to face in the morning,
          recollect -- and he said to one of them, "I am an old tree in my
          Master's orchard. When I was young I bore a little fruit by his grace.
          It was unripe and sour, but he bore with it: and I have grown mellow
          in my older days and brought forth some fruit for him by his grace.
          Now the tree has grown so old that my Master is going to cut it down
          and burn the old log. Well, it will warm the hearts of some of his
          family while I am burning"; and he even smiled for joy to think that
          he might be put to so good a purpose. I want you to have that spirit,
          and to say, "I will live for Christ while I am young: I will die for
          him, and warm the hearts of my brethren. You know that the
          persecutions of those martyr days begat such heroism and gallantry
          among disciples as prudent people in peaceful times can scarcely
          credit. It is said of the old Baptist church over in the City that the
          members went to Smithfield early one morning to see their pastor
          burnt, and when some one asked the young people what they went there
          for, they said that they went to learn the way. That is splendid! They
          went to learn the way. Oh, go to the Master's cross to learn the way
          to live and die! See how he spent himself for you, and then sally
          forth and spend yourselves for him. "Though Israel be not gathered,
          yet shall ye be glorious in the sight of the Lord." Though you may
          think that you do not succeed, your whole-hearted consecration shall
          be your honour in the day of the Lord. By your hallowed life, and your
          humble service, you shall bring glory to his name. O Lord, set us in
          our charges, and encourage us in the service of thy house! "Let the
          beauty of the Lord our God be upon us; establish thou the work of our
          hands: yea, the work of our hands establish thou it." May the blessing
          of our covenant God rest upon you, my brethren, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

        <p>
          BELOVED FRIENDS, -- On this first day of a New Year I salute you with
          hearty good wishes, and pray that every blessing may attend your
          future steps. I beg also on my own behalf your prayers that through
          another year my ministry may be more edifying to the saints, more
          persuasive with sinners, and more acceptable to the Lord. I thank the
          great Healer that this day smiles upon me, and sees me free from pain,

          at work again. Oh for an anointing with fresh oil.
