        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, January 7th, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not
          consumed." -- Malachi 3:6
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been said by some one that "the proper study of mankind is
          man." I will not oppose the idea, but I believe it is equally true
          that the proper study of God's elect is God; the proper study of a
          Christian is the Godhead. The highest science, the loftiest
          speculation, the mightiest philosophy, which can ever engage the
          attention of a child of God, is the name, the nature, the person, the
          work, the doings, and the existence of the great God whom he calls his
          Father. There is something exceedingly improving to the mind in a
          contemplation of the Divinity. It is a subject so vast, that all our
          thoughts are lost in its immensity; so deep, that our pride is drowned
          in its infinity. Other subjects we can compass and grapple with; in
          them we feel a kind of self-content, and go our way with the thought,
          "Behold I am wise." But when we come to this master-science, finding
          that our plumb-line cannot sound its depth, and that our eagle eye
          cannot see its height, we turn away with the thought, that vain man
          would be wise, but he is like a wild ass's colt; and with the solemn
          exclamation, "I am but of yesterday, and know nothing." No subject of
          contemplation will tend more to humble the mind, than thoughts of God.
          We shall be obliged to feel --
        </p>
        <p>"Great God, how infinite art thou,</p>
        <p>What worthless worms are we!"</p>
        <p>
          But while the subject humbles the mind it also expands it. He who
          often thinks of God, will have a larger mind than the man who simply
          plods around this narrow globe. He may be a naturalist, boasting of
          his ability to dissect a beetle, anatomize a fly, or arrange insects
          and animals in classes with well nigh unutterable names; he may be a
          geologist, able to discourse of the megatherium and the plesiosaurus,
          and all kinds of extinct animals; he may imagine that his science,
          whatever it is, ennobles and enlarges his mind. I dare say it does,
          but after all, the most excellent study for expanding the soul, is the
          science of Christ, and him crucified, and the knowledge of the Godhead
          in the glorious Trinity. Nothing will so enlarge the intellect,
          nothing so magnify the whole soul of man, as a devout, earnest,
          continued investigation of the great subject of the Deity. And, whilst
          humbling and expanding, this subject is eminently consolatary. Oh,
          there is, in contemplating Christ, a balm for every wound; in musing
          on the Father, there is a quietus for every grief; and in the
          influence of the Holy Ghost, there is a balsam for every sore. Would
          you lose your sorrows? Would you drown your cares? Then go, plunge
          yourself in the Godhead's deepest sea; be lost in his immensity; and
          you shall come forth as from a couch of rest, refreshed and
          invigorated. I know nothing which can so comfort the soul; so calm the
          swelling billows of grief and sorrow; so speak peace to the winds of
          trial, as a devout musing upon the subject of the Godhead. It is to
          that subject that I invite you this morning. We shall present you with
          one view of it, -- that is the immutability of the glorious Jehovah.
          "I am," says my text, "Jehovah," (for so it should be translated) "I
          am Jehovah, I change not: therefore ye sons of Jacob are not
          consumed."
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three things this morning. First of all, an unchanging God;
          secondly, the persons who derive benefit from this glorious attribute,
          "the sons of Jacob;" and thirdly, the benefit they so derive, they
          "are not consumed.' We address ourselves to these points.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First of all, we have set before us the doctrine of THE
          IMMUTABILITY OF GOD. "I am God, I change not." Here I shall attempt to
          expound, or rather to enlarge the thought, and then afterwards to
          bring a few arguments to prove its truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. I shall offer some exposition of my text, by first saying, that God
          is Jehovah, and he changes not in his essence. We cannot tell you what
          Godhead is. We do not know what substance that is which we call God.
          It is an existence, it is a being; but what that is, we know not.
          However, whatever it is, we call it his essence, and that essence
          never changes. The substance of mortal things is ever changing. The
          mountains with their snow-white crowns, doff their old diadems in
          summer, in rivers trickling down their sides, while the storm cloud
          gives them another coronation; the ocean, with its mighty floods,
          loses its water when the sunbeams kiss the waves, and snatch them in
          mists to heaven; even the sun himself requires fresh fuel from the
          hand of the Infinite Almighty, to replenish his ever burning furnace.
          All creatures change. Man, especially as to his body, is always
          undergoing revolution. Very probably there is not a single particle in
          my body which was in it a few years ago. This frame has been worn away
          by activity, its atoms have been removed by friction, fresh particles
          of matter have in the mean time constantly accrued to my body, and so
          it has been replenished; but its substance is altered. The fabric of
          which this world is made is ever passing away; like a stream of water,
          drops are running away and others are following after, keeping the
          river still full, but always changing in its elements. But God is
          perpetually the same. He is not composed of any substance or material,
          but is spirit -- pure, essential, and ethereal spirit -- and therefore
          he is immutable. He remains everlastingly the same. There are no
          furrows on his eternal brow. No age hath palsied him; no years have
          marked him with the mementoes of their flight; he sees ages pass, but
          with him it is ever now. He is the great I AM -- the Great
          Unchangeable. Mark you, his essence did not undergo a change when it
          became united with the manhood. When Christ in past years did gird
          himself with mortal clay, the essence of his divinity was not changed;
          flesh did not become God, nor did God become flesh by a real actual
          change of nature; the two were united in hypostatical union, but the
          Godhead was still the same. It was the same when he was a babe in the
          manager, as it was when he stretched the curtains of heaven; it was
          the same God that hung upon the cross, and whose blood flowed down in
          a purple river, the self-same God that holds the world upon his
          everlasting shoulders, and bears in his hands the keys of death and
          hell. He never has been changed in his essence, not even by his
          incarnation; he remains everlastingly, eternally, the one unchanging
          God, the Father of lights, with whom there is no variableness, neither
          the shadow of a change.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. He changes not in his attributes. Whatever the attributes of God
          were of old, that they are now; and of each of them we may sing "As it
          was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end,
          Amen." Was he powerful? Was he the mighty God when he spake the world
          out of the womb of nonexistence? Was he the Omnipotent when he piled
          the mountains and scooped out the hollow places for the rolling deep?
          Yes, he was powerful then, and his arm is unpalsied now, he is the
          same giant in his might; the sap of his nourishment is undried, and
          the strength of his soul stands the same for ever. Was he wise when he
          constituted this mighty globe, when he laid the foundations of the
          universe? Had he wisdom when he planned the way of our salvation, and
          when from all eternity he marked out his awful plans? Yes, and he is
          wise now; he is not less skillful, he has not less knowledge; his eye
          which seeth all things is undimmed; his ear which heareth all the
          cries, sighs, sobs, and groans of his people, is not rendered heavy by
          the years which he hath heard their prayers. He is unchanged in his
          wisdom, he knows as much now as ever, neither more nor less; he has
          the same consummate skill, and the same infinite forecastings. He is
          unchanged, blessed be his name, in his justice. just and holy was he
          in the past; just and holy is he now. He is unchanged in his truth; he
          has promised, and he brings it to pass; he hath saith it, and it shall
          be done. He varies not in the goodness, and generosity, and
          benevolence of his nature. He is not become an Almighty tyrant,
          whereas he was once an Almighty Father; but his strong love stands
          like a granite rock, unmoved by the hurricanes of our iniquity. And
          blessed be his dear name, he is unchanged in his love. When he first
          wrote the covenant, how full his heart was with affection to his
          people. He knew that his Son must die to ratify the articles of that
          agreement. He knew right well that he must rend his best beloved from
          his bowels, and send him down to earth to bleed and die. He did not
          hesitate to sign that mighty covenant; nor did he shun its
          fulfillment. He loves as much now as he did then, and when suns shall
          cease to shine, and moons to show their feeble light, he still shall
          love on for ever and for ever. Take any one attribute of God, and I
          will write semper idem on it (always the same). Take any one thing you
          can say of God now, and it may be said not only in the dark past, but
          in the bright future it shall always remain the same: "I am Jehovah, I
          change not."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Then again, God changes not in his plans. That man began to build,
          but was not able to finish, and therefore he changed his plan, as
          every wise man would do in such a case; he built upon a smaller
          foundation and commenced again. But has it ever been said that God
          began to build but was not able to finish? Nay. When he hath boundless
          stores at his command, and when his own right hand would create worlds
          as numerous as drops of morning dew, shall he ever stay because he has
          not power? and reverse, or alter, or disarrange his plan, because he
          cannot carry it out? "But," say some, "perhaps God never had a plan."
          Do you think God is more foolish than yourself then, sir? Do you go to
          work without a plan? "No," say you, "I have always a scheme." So has
          God. Every man has his plan, and God has a plan too. God is a
          master-mind; he arranged everything in his gigantic intellect long
          before he did it; and once having settled it, mark you, he never
          alters it. "This shall be done," saith he, and the iron hand of
          destiny marks it down, and it is brought to pass. "This is my
          purpose," and it stands, nor can earth or hell alter it. "This is my
          decree," saith he, promulgate it angels; rend it down from the gate of
          heaven ye devils; but ye cannot alter the decree; it shall be done.
          God altereth not his plans; why should he? He is Almighty, and
          therefore can perform his pleasure. Why should he? He is the All-wise,
          and therefore cannot have planned wrongly. Why should he? He is the
          everlasting God, and therefore cannot die before his plan is
          accomplished. Why should he change? Ye worthless atoms of existence,
          ephemera of the day! Ye creeping insects upon this bayleaf of
          existence! ye may change your plans, but he shall never, never change
          his. Then has he told me that his plan is to save me? If so, I am
          safe.
        </p>
        <p>"My name from the palms of his hands</p>
        <p>Eternity will not erase;</p>
        <p>Impress'd on his heart it remains,</p>
        <p>In marks of indelible grace."</p>
        <p>
          4. Yet again, God is unchanging in his promises. Ah! we love to speak
          about the sweet promises of God; but if we could ever suppose that one
          of them could be changed, we would not talk anything more about them.
          If I thought that the notes of the bank of England could not be cashed
          next week, I should decline to take them; and if I thought that God's
          promises would never be fulfilled -- if I thought that God would see
          it right to alter some word in his promises -- farewell Scriptures! I
          want immutable things: and I find that I have immutable promises when
          I turn to the Bible: for, "by two immutable things in which it is
          impossible for God to lie," he hath signed, confirmed, and sealed
          every promise of his. The gospel is not "yea and nay," it is not
          promising today, and denying tomorrow; but the gospel is "yea, yea,"
          to the glory of God. Believer! there was a delightful promise which
          you had yesterday; and this morning when you turned to the Bible the
          promise was not sweet. Do you know why? Do you think the promise had
          changed? Ah, no! You changed; that is where the matter lies. You had
          been eating some of the grapes of Sodom, and your mouth was thereby
          put out of taste, and you could not detect the sweetness. But there
          was the same honey there, depend upon it, the same preciousness. "Oh!"
          says one child of God, "I had built my house firmly once upon some
          stable promises; there came a wind, and I said, O Lord, I am cast down
          and I shall be lost." Oh! the promises were not cast down; the
          foundations were not removed; it was your little "wood, hay, stubble"
          hut, that you had been building. It was that which fell down. You have
          been shaken on the rock, not the rock under you. But let me tell you
          what is the best way of living in the world. I have heard that a
          gentleman said to a Negro, "I can't think how it is you are always so
          happy in the Lord and I am often downcast." "Why Massa," said he, "I
          throw myself flat down on the promise -- there I lie; you stand on the
          promise -- you have a little to do with it, and down you go when the
          wind comes, and then you cry, Oh! I am down;' whereas I go flat on the
          promise at once, and that is why I fear no fall." Then let us always
          say, "Lord there is the promise; it is thy business to fulfill it."
          Down I go on the promise flat! no standing up for me. That is where
          you should go -- prostrate on the promise; and remember, every promise
          is a rock, an unchanging thing. Therefore, at his feet cast yourself,
          and rest there forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. But now comes one jarring note to spoil the theme. To some of you
          God is unchanging in his threatenings. If every promise stands fast,
          and every oath of the covenant is fulfilled, hark thee, sinner! --
          mark the word -- hear the death-knell of thy carnal hopes; see the
          funeral of thy fleshly trustings. Every threatening of God, as well as
          every promise shall be fulfilled. Talk of decrees! I will tell you of
          a decree: "He that believeth not shall be damned." That is a decree,
          and a statute that can never change. Be as good as you please, be as
          moral as you can, be as honest as you will, walk as uprightly as you
          may, -- there stands the unchangeable threatening: "He that believeth
          not shall be damned." What sayest thou to that, moralist? Oh, thou
          wishest thou couldst alter it, and say, "He that does not live a holy
          life shall be damned." That will be true; but it does not say so. It
          says, "He that believeth not." Here is the stone of stumbling, and the
          rock of offence; but you cannot alter it. You must believe or be
          damned, saith the Bible; and mark, that threat of God is an
          unchangeable as God himself. And when a thousand years of hell's
          torments shall have passed away, you shall look on high, and see
          written in burning letters of fire, "He that believeth not shall be
          damned." "But, Lord, I am damned." Nevertheless it says "shall be"
          still. And when a million ages have rolled away, and you are exhausted
          by your pains and agonies, you shall turn up your eye and still read
          "SHALL BE DAMNED," unchanged, unaltered. And when you shall have
          thought that eternity must have spun out its last thread -- that every
          particle of that which we call eternity, must have run out, you shall
          still see it written up there, "SHALL BE DAMNED." O terrific thought!
          How dare I utter it? But I must. Ye must be warned, sirs, "lest ye
          also come into this place of torment." Ye must be told rough things;
          for if God's gospel is not a rough thing &amp; the law is a rough
          thing; Mount Sinai is a rough thing. Woe unto the watchman that warns
          not the ungodly! God is unchanging in his threatenings. Beware, O
          sinner, for "it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the
          living God."
        </p>
        <p>
          6. We must just hint at one thought before we pass away and that is --
          God is unchanging in the objects of his love -- not only in his love,
          but in the objects of it.
        </p>
        <p>"If ever it should come to pass,</p>
        <p>That sheep of Christ might fall away.</p>
        <p>My fickle, feeble soul, alas,</p>
        <p>Would fall a thousand times a day."</p>
        <p>
          If one dear saint of God had perished, so might all; if one of the
          covenant ones be lost, so may all be, and then there is no gospel
          promise true; but the Bible is a lie, and there is nothing in it worth
          my acceptance. I will be an infidel at once, when I can believe that a
          saint of God can ever fall finally. If God hath loved me once, then he
          will love me for ever.
        </p>
        <p>"Did Jesus once upon me shine,</p>
        <p>Then Jesus is for ever mine."</p>
        <p>
          The objects of everlasting love never change. Those whom God hath
          called, he will justify; whom he has justified, he will sanctify; and
          whom he sanctifies, he will glorify.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Thus having taken a great deal too much time, perhaps, in simply
          expanding the thought of an unchanging God, I will now try to prove
          that He is unchangeable. I am not much of an argumentative preacher,
          but one argument that I will mention is this: the very existence, and
          being of a God, seem to me to imply immutability. Let me think a
          moment. There is a God; this God rules and governs all things; this
          God fashioned the world: he upholds and maintains it. What kind of
          being must he be? It does strike me that you cannot think of a
          changeable God. I conceive that the thought is so repugnant to common
          sense, that if you for one moment think of a changing God, the words
          seem to clash, and you are obliged to say, "Then he must be a kind of
          man," and get a Mormonite idea of God. I imagine it is impossible to
          conceive of a changing God; it is so to me. Others may be capable of
          such an idea, but I could not entertain it. I could no more think of a
          changing God, than I could of a round square, or any other absurdity.
          The thing seems so contrary, that I am obliged, when once I say God,
          to include the idea of an unchanging being.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Well, I think that one argument will be enough, but another good
          argument may be found in the fact of God's perfection. I believe God
          to be a perfect being. Now, if he is a perfect being, he cannot
          change. Do you not see this? Suppose I am perfect today, if it were
          possible for me to change, should I be perfect tomorrow after the
          alteration? If I changed, I must either change from a good state to a
          better -- and then if I could get better, I could not be perfect now
          -- or else from a better state to a worse -- and if I were worse, I
          should not be perfect then. If I am perfect, I cannot be altered
          without being imperfect. If I am perfect today, I must keep the same
          tomorrow if I am to be perfect then. So, if God is perfect, he must be
          the same; for change would imply imperfection now, or imperfection
          then.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Again, there is the fact of God's infinity, which puts change out
          of the question. God is an infinite being. What do you mean by that?
          There is no man who can tell you what he means by an infinite being.
          But there cannot be two infinities. If one thing is infinite, there is
          no room for anything else; for infinite means all. It means not
          bounded, not finite, having no end. Well, there cannot be two
          infinities. If God is infinite today, and then should change and be
          infinite tomorrow, there would be two infinities. But that cannot be.
          Suppose he is infinite and then changes, he must become finite, and
          could not be God; either he is finite today and finite tomorrow, or
          infinite today and finite tomorrow, or finite today and infinite
          tomorrow -- all of which suppositions are equally absurd. The fact of
          his being an infinite being at once quashes the thought of his being a
          changeable being. Infinity has written on its very brow the word
          "immutability."
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But then, dear friends, let us look at the past: and there we shall
          gather some proofs of God's immutable nature. "Hath he spoken, and
          hath he not done it? Hath he sworn, and hath it not come to pass?" Can
          it not be said of Jehovah, "He hath done all his will, and he hath
          accomplished all his purpose?" Turn ye to Philistia; ask where she is.
          God said, "Howl Ashdod, and ye gates of Gaza, for ye shall fall;" and
          where are they? Where is Edom? Ask Petra and its ruined walls. Will
          they not echo back the truth that God hath said, "Edom shall be a
          prey, and shall be destroyed?" Where is Babel, and where Nineveh?
          Where Moab and where Ammon? Where are the nations God hath said he
          would destroy? Hath he not uprooted them and cast out the remembrance
          of them from the earth? And hath God cast off his people? Hath he once
          been unmindful of his promise? Hath he once broken his oath and
          covenant, or once departed from his plan? Ah! no. Point to one
          instance in history where God has changed! Ye cannot, sirs; for
          throughout all history there stands the fact that God has been
          immutable in his purposes. Methinks I hear some one say, "I can
          remember one passage in Scripture where God changed!" And so did I
          think once. The case I mean, is that of the death of Hezekiah. Isaiah
          came in and said, Hezekiah, you must die, your disease is incurable,
          set your house in order.' He turned his face to the wall and began to
          pray; and before Isaiah was in the outer court, he was told to go back
          and say, "Thou shalt live fifteen years more." You may think that
          proves that God changes; but really I cannot see in it the slightest
          proof in the world. How do you know that God did not know that? Oh!
          but God did know it; he knew that Hezekiah would live. Then he did not
          change, for if he knew that, how could he change? That is what I want
          to know. But do you know one little thing? -- that Hezekiah's son
          Manasseh, was not born at that time, and that had Hezekiah died, there
          would have been no Manasseh, and no Josiah and no Christ, because
          Christ came from that very line. You will find that Manasseh was
          twelve years old when his father died; so that he must have been born
          three years after this. And do you not believe that God decreed the
          birth of Manasseh, and foreknew it? Certainly. Then he decreed that
          Isaiah should go and tell Hezekiah that his disease was incurable, and
          then say also in the same breath, "But I will cure it, and thou shalt
          live." He said that to stir up Hezekiah to prayer. He spoke, in the
          first place as a man. "According to all human probability your disease
          is incurable, and you must die." Then he waited till Hezekiah prayed;
          then came a little "but" at the end of the sentence. Isaiah had not
          finished the sentence. He said, "You must put your house in order for
          there is no human cure; but" (and then he walked out. Hezekiah prayed
          a little, and then he came in again, and said) "But I will heal thee."
          Where is there any contradiction there, except in the brain of those
          who fight against the Lord, and wish to make him a changeable being.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now secondly, let me say a word on THE PERSONS TO WHOM THIS
          UNCHANGEABLE GOD IS A BENEFIT. "I am God, I change not; therefore ye
          sons of Jacob are not consumed." Now, who are "the sons of Jacob," who
          can rejoice in an immutable God?
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, they are the sons of God's election; for it is written,
          "Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated, the children being not yet
          born neither having done good nor evil." It was written, "The elder
          shall serve the younger." "The sons of Jacob" --
        </p>
        <p>"Are the sons of God's election,</p>
        <p>Who through sovereign grace believe;</p>
        <p>Be eternal destination</p>
        <p>Grace and glory they receive."</p>
        <p>
          God's elect are here meant by "the sons of Jacob," -- those whom he
          foreknew and fore-ordained to everlasting salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. By "the sons of Jacob" are meant, in the second place, persons who
          enjoy peculiar rights and titles. Jacob, you know, had no rights by
          birth; but he soon acquired them. He changed a mess of pottage with
          his brother Esau, and thus gained the birthright. I do not justify the
          means; but he did also obtain the blessing, and so acquired peculiar
          rights. By "the sons of Jacob" here, are meant persons who have
          peculiar rights and titles. Unto them that believe, he hath given the
          right and power to become sons of God. They have an interest in the
          blood of Christ; they have a right to "enter in through the gates into
          the city;" they have a title to eternal honors; they have a promise to
          everlasting glory; they have a right to call themselves sons of God.
          Oh! there are peculiar rights and privileges belonging to the "sons of
          Jacob."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But, then next, these "sons of Jacob" were men of peculiar
          manifestations. Jacob had peculiar manifestations from his God, and
          thus he was highly honored. Once at night-time he lay down and slept;
          he had the hedges for his curtains, the sky for his canopy, a stone
          for his pillow, and the earth for his bed. Oh! then he had a peculiar
          manifestation. There was a ladder, and he saw the angels of God
          ascending and descending. He thus had a manifestation of Christ Jesus,
          as the ladder which reaches from earth to heaven, up and down which
          angels came to bring us mercies. Then what a manifestation there was
          at Mahanaim, when the angels of God met him; and again at Peniel, when
          he wrestled with God, and saw him face to face. Those were peculiar
          manifestations; and this passage refers to those who, like Jacob, have
          had peculiar manifestations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now then, how many of you have had personal manifestations? "Oh!" you
          say "that is enthusiasm; that is fanaticism." Well, it is a blessed
          enthusiasm, too, for the sons of Jacob have had peculiar
          manifestations. They have talked with God as a man talketh with his
          friend; they have whispered in the ear of Jehovah; Christ hath been
          with them to sup with them, and they with Christ; and the Holy Spirit
          hath shone into their souls with such a mighty radiance, that they
          could not doubt about special manifestations. The "sons of Jacob" are
          the men, who enjoy these manifestations.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Then again, they are men of peculiar trials. Ah! poor Jacob! I
          should not choose Jacob's lot if I had not the prospect of Jacob's
          blessing; for a hard lot his was. He had to run away from his father's
          house to Laban's; and then that surly old Laban cheated him all the
          years he was there -- cheated him of his wife, cheated him in his
          wages, cheated him in his flocks, and cheated him all through the
          story. By-and-bye he had to run away from Laban, who pursued him and
          overtook him. Next came Esau with four hundred men to cut him up root
          and branch. Then there was a season of prayer, and afterwards he
          wrestled, and had to go all his life with his thigh out of joint. But
          a little further on, Rachael, his dear beloved, died. Then his
          daughter Dinah is led astray, and the sons murder the Shechemites.
          Anon there is dear Joseph sold into Egypt, and a famine comes. Then
          Reuben goes up to his couch and pollutes it; Judah commits incest with
          his own daughter-in-law; and all his sons become a plague to him. At
          last Benjamin is taken away; and the old man, almost broken-hearted,
          cries, "Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin
          away." Never was man more tried than Jacob, all through the one sin of
          cheating his brother. All through his life God chastised him. But I
          believe there are many who can sympathize with dear old Jacob. They
          have had to pass through trials very much like his. Well,
          cross-bearers! God says, "I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are
          not consumed." Poor tried souls! ye are not consumed because of the
          unchanging nature of your God. Now do not get fretting, and say, with
          the self-conceit of misery, "I am the man who hath seen affliction."
          Why "the Man of Sorrows" was afflicted more than you; Jesus was indeed
          a mourner. You only see the skirts of the garments of affliction. You
          never have trials like his. You do not understand what troubles means;
          you have hardly sipped the cup of trouble; you have only had a drop or
          two, but Jesus drunk the dregs. Fear not saith God, "I am the Lord, I
          change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob," men of peculiar trials, "are
          not consumed."
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Then one more thought about who are the "sons of Jacob," for I
          should like you to find out whether you are "sons of Jacob,"
          yourselves. They are men of peculiar character; for though there were
          some things about Jacob's character which we cannot commend, there are
          one or two things which God commends. There was Jacob's faith, by
          which Jacob had his name written amongst the mighty worthies who
          obtained not the promises on earth, but shall obtain them in heaven.
          Are you men of faith, beloved? Do you know what it is to walk by
          faith, to live by faith, to get your temporary food by faith, to live
          on spiritual manna -- all by faith? Is faith the rule of your life? if
          so, you are the "sons of Jacob."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then Jacob was a man of prayer -- a man who wrestled, and groaned, and
          prayed. There is a man up yonder who never prayed this morning, before
          coming up to the house of God. Ah! you poor heathen, don't you pray?
          No! he says, "I never thought of such a thing; for years I have not
          prayed." Well, I hope you may before you die. Live and die without
          prayer, and you will pray long enough when you get to hell. There is a
          woman: she did not pray this morning; she was so busy sending her
          children to the Sunday School, she had no time to pray. No time to
          pray? Had you time to dress? There is a time for every purpose under
          heaven, and if you had purposed to pray, you would have prayed. Sons
          of God cannot live without prayer. They are wrestling Jacobs. They are
          men in whom the Holy Ghost so works, they they can no more live
          without prayer than I can live without breathing. They must pray.
          Sirs, mark you, if you are living without prayer, you are living
          without Christ; and dying like that, your portion will be in the lake
          which burneth with fire. God redeem you, God rescue you from such a
          lot! But you who are "the sons of Jacob," take comfort, for God is
          immutable.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Thirdly, I can say only a word about the other point -- THE
          BENEFIT WHICH THESE "SONS OF JACOB" RECEIVE FROM AN UNCHANGING GOD.
          "Therefore ye sons Jacob are not consumed." "Consumed?" How? how can
          man be consumed? Why, there are two ways. We might have been consumed
          in hell. If God had been a changing God, the "sons of Jacob" here this
          morning, might have been consumed in hell; but for God's unchanging
          love I should have been a faggot in the fire. But there is a way of
          being consumed in this world; there is such a things as being
          condemned before you die -- "condemned already;" there is such a thing
          as being alive, and yet being absolutely dead. We might have been left
          to our own devices, and then where should we have been now? Revelling
          with the drunkard, blaspheming Almighty God. Oh? had he left you,
          dearly beloved, had he been a changing God, ye had been amongst the
          filthiest of the filthy, and the vilest of the vile. Cannot you
          remember in your life, seasons similar to those I have felt? I have
          gone right to the edge of sin; some strong temptation has taken hold
          of both my arms, so that I could not wrestle with it. I have been
          pushed alone, dragged as by an awful satanic power to the very edge of
          some horrid precipice. I have looked down, down, down, and seen my
          portion; I quivered on the brink of ruin. I have been horrified, as,
          with my hair upright, I have thought of the sin I was about to commit,
          the horrible pit into which I was about to fall. A strong arm hath
          saved me. I have started back and cried, O God! could I have gone so
          near sin, and yet come back again? Could I have walked right up to the
          furnace and not fallen down, like Nebuchadnezzar's strong men,
          devoured by the very heat? Oh! is it possible I should be here this
          morning, when I think of the sins I have committed, and the crimes
          which have crossed my wicked imagination? Yes, I am here, unconsumed,
          because the Lord changes not. Oh! if he had changed, we should have
          been consumed in a dozen ways; if the Lord had changed, you and I
          should have been consumed by ourselves; for after all, Mr. Self is the
          worst enemy a Christian has. We should have proved suicides to our own
          souls; we should have mixed the cup of poison for our own spirits, if
          the Lord had not been an unchanging God, and dashed the cup out of our
          hands when we were about to drink it. Then we should have been
          consumed by God himself if he had not been a changeless God. We call
          God a Father; but there is not a father in this world who would not
          have killed all his children long ago, so provoked would he have been
          with them, if he had been half as much troubled as God has been with
          his family. He has the most troublesome family in the whole world --
          unbelieving, ungrateful, disobedient, forgetful, rebellious,
          wandering, murmuring, and stiffnecked. Well it is that he is
          longsuffering, or else he would have taken not only the rod, but the
          sword to some of us long ago. But there was nothing in us to love at
          first, so, there cannot be less now. John Newton used to tell a
          whimsical story, and laugh at it too, of a good woman who said, in
          order to prove the doctrine of Election, "Ah! sir, the Lord must have
          loved me before I was born, or else he would not have seen anything in
          me to love afterwards." I am sure it is true in my case, and true in
          respect most of God's people; for there is little to love in them
          after they are born, that if he had not loved them before then, he
          would have seen no reason to choose them after; but since he loved
          them without works, he loves them without works still; since their
          good works did not win his affection, bad works cannot sever that
          affection; since their righteousness did not bind his love to them, so
          their wickedness cannot snap the golden links. He loved them out of
          pure sovereign grace, and he will love them still. But we should have
          been consumed by the devil, and by our enemies -- consumed by the
          world, consumed by our sins, by our trials, and in a hundred other
          ways, if God had ever changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, now, time fails us, and I can say but little. I have only just
          cursorily touched on the text. I now hand it to you. May the Lord help
          you "sons of Jacob" to take home this portion of meat; digest it well,
          and feed upon it. May the Holy Ghost sweetly apply the glorious things
          that are written! And may you have "a feast of fat things, of wines on
          the lees well refined!" Remember God is the same, whatever is removed.
          Your friends may be disaffected, your ministers may be taken away,
          every thing may change, but God does not. Your brethren may change and
          cast out your name as vile: but God will love you still. Let your
          station in life change, and your property be gone; let your whole life
          be shaken, and you become weak and sickly; let everything flee away --
          there is one place where change cannot put his finger; there is one
          name on which mutability can never be written; there is one heart
          which never can alter; that heart is God's -- that name Love.
        </p>
        <p>"Trust him, he will ne'er deceive you.</p>
        <p>Though you hardly of him deem;</p>
        <p>He will never, never leave you,</p>
        <p>Nor will let you quite leave him."<br /></p>
